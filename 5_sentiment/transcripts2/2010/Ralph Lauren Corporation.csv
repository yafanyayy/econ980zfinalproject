We reported strong third quarter and year-to-date results this morning. Year-to-date, our profits are at a record level, despite operating in the worst economic environment since the Great Depression. And we've exceeded our own expectations on all operating metrics. We've been able to achieve this level of performance even as we've intensified our investments on our long-term strategic initiatives, which for the first nine months of the year include building an entirely new organization in Hong Kong to support our growth aspirations through Asia, investing in important new flagships in New York, Paris and Greenwich, Connecticut and developing a host of exciting new products. We ended the third quarter with more than $1.3 billion in cash and investments, with net cash more than double last year's level, and we continue to reinvest in our business, buy back stock and reduce debt.Of course, we benefit from having exceptionally strong product and strategic merchandising initiatives. As Ralph said in today's release, customers appreciate our unwaving commitment to quality and innovation, which are defining characteristics of our company. This brand and product excellence, coupled with superb worldwide execution by the team, has allowed us to succeed. As much as our third quarter and year-to-date performances reflect the day-to-day operational excellence of our teams, they are also a result of many years of careful planning, investment, strategic decision-making that sometimes have a negative short-term impact but they have ultimately made us stronger and more profitable organization.We would not be in the position we are today without these years of preparation and execution. Two years ago, when the first signs of global financial crisis were emerging, we made a decision that our foremost priority was to protect our brand and our profits. We executed this by developing focused merchandise strategies and calibrating our global shipment volumes with the expected customer demand trends. We supported our efforts further by exploring supply chain initiatives that would allow us to capitalize on certain efficiencies without sacrificing quality or service levels. The net result of our actions have been strong retail sellthroughs of our products across channels, the benefit of which you see reflected in the 470 basis point improvement in our gross profit margins during the third quarter, and the 270 basis point improvements for the full year, both of which are on top of a margin expansion last year.Across the board, our core products have exceeded their sales plans on significantly reduced stock and tightly managed receipt flows. We achieved this level of profitability while remaining absolutely true to our luxury brand positioning. There aren't many brands or company or industry that could make a similar claim. Our retail performance during the third quarter is particularly noteworthy. We experienced a dramatic change in our worldwide same-store sales trends, with comps rising 6% after falling 7% in the first half of the year. And ralphlauren.com maintained its double-digit growth rate. Our tiered multichannel approach to our direct-to-consumer operations is a strategy that continues to serve us well. And by any measure, we had a strong holiday season. The decisions we made to adjust our merchandising assortments to accommodate the new customer mindset, in addition to taking significant cost out of the business, helped drive the operating profitability of our retail segment to 17%, up 75% in dollar terms compared to last year and just 60 basis points shy of our historic third quarter peak retail margins.The recovery in retail sales and margin was broad-based across concept and region and particularly good for our factory stores, which have been especially strong in the current environment. There is no question that customers are increasingly shopping online, where traffic to ralphlauren.com continues to grow at a double-digit rate even as visitors to brick-and-mortar stores remain down. We were pioneer in selling luxury apparel online 10 years ago and we continue to benefit from the multi-year investment we've made to develop a state-of-the-art online business with cutting-edge technology, distribution and customer service capabilities.The cumulative effect of our consistent investment in world class advertising, marketing and public relations initiatives have also proven to be valuable, particularly in the current environment. Consumers clearly recognize that our brand stands for quality and exceptional value. Our long-standing associations with premier sporting events such as the Olympics, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open not only convey the power of the Ralph Lauren brand but they also accentuate our global visibility and allure. We will also have very strong coverage at the Winter Olympics in two weeks. We are proud to be associated with these events and the world's finest athletes and we constantly explore for new ways of reaching customers to increase the visibility of our brands. For example, rugby.com staged a successful virtual fashion show during the third quarter that significantly increased the amount of attention and was highly effective in driving awareness of the site. Given the strength of our brand and a consistent sellthrough performance, we believe we are well-positioned to continue taking market share through sustained productivity gains of our core products. In addition, we continue to pursue incremental growth opportunities, most importantly in accessories. As you are aware, we've been working on developing handbag assortment for our Lauren brand and we are currently in market with our first collection of Lauren handbags. We expect to deliver this merchandise in leading department store doors this fall. The product looks fantastic and we're excited about the long-term growth prospects of this category. The recent activity to our footwear product is expanding rapidly and the profitability of this category is following suit. On January 1, we successfully assumed control of our business in several Asian markets including China, that were formerly licensed territories. I'm pleased to report that the transition was executed smoothly with no disruption to the business. We are now directly operating a multichannel business. Our ability to execute that transition, which includes the creation of an entirely new locally-based organization, speaks not only to the operational sophistication of our company but also to the tremendous opportunity we see in this part of the world. Our efforts obviously require significant investment, some of which you see reflected in our operating expenses this quarter.To give you some perspective on what we've accomplished over the last year in this region, we've hired and trained nearly 700 employees. We've obtained lease assignments for all of our locations. We've built a new world-class world supply chain and logistics network to support the region and we've built a constellation of management systems and corporate processes. The net result is that on day one of the transition, our stores were open for business with our own new POS system. They were set with spring merchandise and they were receiving goods from our distribution center daily. The store associates are now being trained in our selling and service cultures. We did not have any of this infrastructure when we first spoke to you about our plans for this region last year at this time, so we've clearly come a long way. And to make this kind of progress in difficult market conditions really highlights the operational and financial strength of our organization. With the first part of this transition now behind us, we will begin to develop this region in a measured way, as we focused on managing our existing points of distribution and learning about taste and preferences of our customers in this part of the world. Our spring buys, which were made 12 months ago, already reflect our desire to elevate the brand and educate the customer about the breadth of our offering, by presenting a more balanced mix of men's, women's, fashion and icon product, as well as accessories. For the first time ever, we are now in control of our destiny in the world's fastest-growing regions. We believe this is a powerful position for us for a number of reasons. It allows us to leverage global best practices in terms of inventory management, assortment planning, retail operations and logistics. In addition, our global advertising and marketing messages can be more appropriately aligned with our selling strategies. And perhaps, most importantly, it allows us to leverage the incarretable [ph]  Scope of products that we offer on a global platform. We are uniquely positioned to capitalize on opportunities with our clearly defined portfolio of lifestyle brands that span the consumer spectrum. We are already doing a good job of leveraging that portfolio in the U.S. today but there is still considerable opportunity for us to do so in the rest of the world. It will obviously take time and investment but the opportunity is there.Our year-to-date results demonstrate that we continue to operate from a position of strength in a global marketplace that remains very uncertain. Not surprisingly, our wholesale customers remain cautious about their initial orders. And all retailers including ourselves continue to focus on receipt management, trying to drive higher profitability with less inventory. I believe our third quarter sales and profit results demonstrate we can accomplish this with our own retail operations and that we are effectively maximizing opportunities with our wholesale partners.Regardless of the external environment, I believe our consistent performance over the last several years and especially in the year to date performance, position us well for the future. And as we have done historically, we'll continue to invest in product innovation, broadening our international scope and expanding our direct-to-consumer reach, making decisions that enhance the long-term positioning of our brand and profit prospects for our company. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tracey to discuss the financial and operational highlights of the third quarter, as well as an update outlook for the remainder of the year."
362220,84499868,48217,"Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Feb-03-2010",2010-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Roger and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, consolidated net revenues were $1.2 billion, less than 1% below the prior-year period. The decline in revenues reflects lower planned wholesale shipments, particularly in the U.S. and Jap",1969,"Thank you, Roger and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, consolidated net revenues were $1.2 billion, less than 1% below the prior-year period. The decline in revenues reflects lower planned wholesale shipments, particularly in the U.S. and Japan, which were partially offset by 8% revenue growth at our retail segment. The net positive impact of currency translation on our total reported revenue growth for the quarter was approximately 2%. Our gross profit rate increased 470 basis points to 58.2% in the third quarter, which was achieved on top of a 20 basis-point gain in the prior-year period, which as you know, was a noteworthy achievement considering the high level of promotional activity in the marketplace last year. The expansion in this year's third quarter gross profit rate reflects improved wholesale and retail segment margins that were a direct result of the proactive and strategic decisions we made several months ago to calibrate inventory receipt plans to expected customer demand trends. These decisions ultimately led to fewer markdowns in our own stores and a favorable product mix across all channels. We also had some continued benefit from supply chain initiative in cost of goods and in freight.Operating expenses in the third quarter were approximately 10% greater than the comparable period last year, in line with the guidance we provided last quarter when adjusted for some impairment charges. The higher operating expenses reflect the planned acceleration in cost related to the transition of our Asia Pacific operations in January. Other drivers of the increased operating expenses include higher anticipated payouts for incentive compensation and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Operating income for the third quarter was $173 million, 4% greater than the prior-year period and our operating margin for the third quarter was 13.9%, 60 basis points above that of the third quarter of fiscal 2009. The growth in operating income and the expansion in operating margin rate were primarily due to the higher gross margin profit rate and company-wide cost control and restructuring initiatives that were partially offset by lower sales and the higher operating expenses that I just discussed.Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 rose 6% to $111 million and net income per diluted share was $1.10, which was 5% greater than the comparable period last year. The growth in net income and diluted earnings per share principally relates to higher operating income during the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 33% and approximately in line with that of the prior period last year. Moving on to some additional insight into our segment level results for the quarter, I will begin with our wholesale division, where sales declined 8% to $604 million and were down approximately 11% in constant currency, primarily due to lower planned shipments for some of our domestic products including American Living.The European wholesale shipments were down modestly in constant currency, a function of cautious specialty store orders in the context of sustained macro challenges throughout Europe. Our Japanese wholesale volume was also down in the quarter, again a function of the broader economic challenges in that market. From a category perspective in the U.S., Polo Men's Sportswear continued to be a strong performer during the quarter, supported by focused assortments, compelling gift-giving ideas and targeted marketing programs. We continue to see improved trends in our women's businesses, a category that has been challenging for us and others over the last few years. Our Lauren brand benefited from the increased representation of key sportswear items and the continued success of the Lauren Jeans Company. At Chaps, the women's Classics program resonated particularly well with the customer. Footwear shipments were very strong during the quarter for our Ralph Lauren, Polo and Lauren brands, a function of both expanded assortments and additional point of distribution.While our Lauren European specialty store customers have suffered disproportionately from the impact of the recession, our business at larger department store groups have been more resilient and offsetting some of the softness in the specialty channel. We are driving higher productivity and expanding our assortment in several major department stores such as Harrods, Selfridge's and Galleria Lafayette, which also provides tremendous exposure to global travelers and local customers alike. Our most elevated assortments are featured in their stores. In terms of product performance, shipments of our men's and women's Blue Label products were the strongest sellers and men's Black Label remained one of our fastest growing brands in Europe. In aggregate, the United Kingdom and Germany were our best performing European regions, while trends in Italy, which is predominantly a specialty store market, remain weak.Our third quarter wholesale operating income was $107 million and the operating margin rate was 17.7%, compared to a historic peak third quarter wholesale margin of 19.8% last year. In addition to the challenging comparison, the 210 basis-point decline in the wholesale operating margin rate was primarily a result of deleveraging operating expenses on lower global shipment volume and incremental costs associated with related to business expansion including costs associated with formerly licensed operations.For our retail group, third quarter sales increased 8% to $592 million. Overall comp store sales, which include ralphlauren.com, were up 6% or 4% in constant currency, reflecting 4% growth at Ralph Lauren stores, a 6% increase at factory stores and 7% growth at Club Monaco. Our third quarter comps were better than our expectations of a flat to low single-digit increase, which we shared with you on our last earnings call, due to broad-based strength across all regions and all concepts. Of course, we are comparing against the substantial comp decline in the prior-year period when the global financial crisis intensified and there was a very high level of promotional activity in the market.Overall traffic trends in our stores remained challenging during the third quarter especially in the U.S. and despite a rebound in tourist travel to gateway cities. Comp growth was primarily achieved with higher average dollar transactions mostly due to higher full price selling. We have slowly begun to see the gradual return of our core luxury customer, who purchases our collection in Black Label merchandise. At ralphlauren.com, sales rose 13% in the third quarter, with Childrenswear, menswear and footwear being the top performing categories. With respect to our European Ralph Lauren stores, the United Kingdom and the Benelux countries continue to be our top performing regions. And even though we saw improved trends in Milan, France and Germany, those markets remain challenging. Our factory stores continue to experience broad-based strength throughout Europe and across all product categories, although once again, the United Kingdom has the largest comp growth in the region.In Japan, we achieved positive sales growth at both our Ralph Lauren and factory stores clearly outperforming overall market trends, although we have a relatively modest Japanese retail network at this time. We opened five directly-operated stores globally during the quarter, including our Ralph Lauren store in Greenwich, Connecticut, which Roger shared with your earlier, which primarily showcased our women's and home products in addition to a small selection of men's sportswear. We ended the third quarter with 333 directly operated stores globally. Our Retail segment operating income grew 75% in the third quarter to $101 million. The retail operating margin was 17%, 650 basis points greater than the prior period last year when profitability was significantly pressured by a sharp comp decline and elevated promotional activity. This year's growth in retail operating income and the expansion in margin rate was primarily a result of positive same-store sales growth and stronger full price sellthrough rates across most of our retail formats in addition to disciplined operational and inventory management, including the benefit of restructuring actions that we took in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.Licensing royalties for the quarter were $48 million, 3% below the prior-year period due to a decline in fragrance and home products licensing revenues that were partially offset by higher international royalties. Operating income for our licensing segment was down 12% to $24 million in the third quarter, principally as a result of the lower licensing royalties and incremental Asia-Pacific related expenses. We ended the third quarter with more than $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments compared to $908 million in the prior-year period. Net of debt, we had $1 billion in cash and investments at the end of the quarter, up from $489 million last year. Inventory was down 7% from the third quarter last year. This decline is a function of the work we have done to calibrate shipment volumes to expected customer demand trends, which was somewhat masked during the first half of the year due to our strategic supply chain initiatives, which continued to result in higher in-transit inventory, which we have explained to you on prior calls. We spent approximately $51 million on CapEx during the third quarter to support new retail stores, wholesale shop installations and other infrastructure investments. We also repurchased approximately 1 million shares of stock during the quarter, utilizing $78 million of our outstanding share repurchase authorization and we had 352 million of share authorization remaining at the end of the quarter.In this morning's press release, we outlined our expectations for the remainder of fiscal 2010, which I would briefly like to review with you now. Based on our better-than-expected year-to-date sales performance, we raised our top line guidance and we are now looking for a low single-digit decline in consolidated revenues for the full year, which compares to our prior expectation of a mid- single-digit decline for fiscal 2010 revenues. This guidance implies a mid- single-digit decline in wholesale shipments in the fourth quarter, as well as a low double-digit increase in same-store sales for our retail segment, which does include an additional week of sales compared to the prior-year period, the 53rd week. The impact of this additional week to our consolidated earnings is not expected to be material as we will have an extra week of expense for the balance of our enterprise offsetting any incremental retail profits. Also beginning in the fourth quarter, please keep in mind that the sales results from our newly transitioned Asia-Pacific operations will now be reflected primarily in our retail segment. As we have communicated on the last few calls, incremental expenses related to our new Asia-Pacific operations are most pronounced in the fourth quarter, as we now have the full cost of our infrastructure, inclusive of all store and all shop locations with payroll for several hundred new employees as well as full occupancy expenses for running all of our points of distribution. In fact, the fourth quarter impact of the Asia-Pacific operations is expected to be dilutive to our earnings by approximately $0.08 to $0.10 per diluted share, with sales slowly ramping up through the initial network of store locations. The impact of incentive compensation accruals is also expected to yield additional expense pressure as is the higher mix of retail sales in the quarter.As a result, we're currently forecasting operating expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 to exceed those of the prior-year period, including last year's impairment and restructuring charges by a mid-single-digit rate. Let me close our prepared remarks by saying we are extremely proud as a management team of how we have navigated the business through these challenging global times, delivering $365 million of net income year-to-date or 1% above the prior-year period. As Roger indicated, and Ralph continues to reinforce to us all, it is a testament to the strength of our brand, our global management team, our global partnerships and to the strategic decisions we've consistently made over the last several years that we have been able to deliver outstanding results under such challenging circumstances. At this point, we'd like to open the call up for Q&A. Operator, can you please assist us with that?"

So",301,"First of all, last year at this time, if you remember, our third quarter, fourth quarter and first quarter of the new year had been bought by our wholesale customers before the events of September, which really accelerated the decline in the business. So at least through third, fourth and first quarter of next year, we really saw more normalized receipt flows and inventory purchases by our customer. I think it's the full impact of the September, October, November periods were felt, retailers began to cut back receipts starting with fall of this year into holiday and continuing a full 12 months into spring and summer of next year. So in the wholesale channel, we're really still lapping very strong wholesale on orders by our customers and their desire to correct their inventory and receipts really didn't take effect until fall of 2009. In our Retail businesses, we're obviously buying our own products. We corrected also our receipt flows for starting fall, holiday and now into spring. And what you're seeing in our retail results and the gross margins and operating profit improvements, are the improved sellthroughs. So the products are in demand, the inventories are in line, the sellthroughs have improved and the margins are up. And I would expect our wholesale partners are experiencing the same phenomenon. But obviously for us, it's a lower sell in and we'll have to lap all of that until we begin to see on orders anniversary-ing that and begin to move forward again. So I think it's just the timing of the two Wholesale and Retail segments, yet the sellthrough at point of sale for our wholesale customers was significantly better this third quarter. And I think that bodes well for on order going forward into the fall and holiday of next year."

The Asia-Pacific transition, which as I spent a little time on the call talking about, was a January 1 cut over. Our expectation when we took on that business is we would acquire at that point the inventory and the licensee from fall '09 forward. And then the spring on order would be ours. Dixon, who is our license partner, really sold through that fall on order to a very low level. So it is normally a clearance period in Asia, January and halfway into February for us is a period of exciting new deliveries, spring goods, but very little clearance to offer in the marketplace that in the middle of January and February is promotional. So what we've got is, you heard is all the employees, all the expenses, all the infrastructure that was built but the sales will only begin to ramp up as we work our way through the quarter and we begin to get to the back end of the quarter when they're more normalized spring selling period. So it's really the six, seven weeks in the early days where the stores are getting new inventory and presenting that to customers and we're getting a nice reaction. But obviously, we don't have any of the fall holiday clearance that all other businesses in that region are now liquidating. So that affects the dilution in the transition quarter."

So if you think about the year-over-year difference in our expense and if you think about your model and how you model our business, in the growth year-over-year, much of our growth year-over-year is coming from retail. Our Wholesale business is actually down. So when you think about how to remodel the quarter from a growth standpoint, I would keep that in mind when you're reflecting it. So a piece of it is the growth related to expenses, as Roger just talked about, for Asia-Pacific and then a piece of it is the growth related to retail of which has an extra week as well of expense in there for us. And that, those two alone represent almost 2/3 of the expense growth."

The color palettes that the Penny's customer reacts to. The product offering in terms of fashion quotient, as well as price. We came out into the marketplace at a significant premium to the Penny's high-end price point. And again, we've moderated those. So we still are positioned as the premium brand within their assortment. But the delta between where we were priced and where the customer was willing to buy a new brand, I think has been one of the big learnings. I think we've also looked at our marketing and advertising messaging in an effort to launch a new brand that had no prior customer knowledge. How we talked to that customer, how we shaped our message, the imaging we project have all been looked at, studied. And I think for spring 2010 that we're heading into, and the fall season that we've already booked, I think you'll see those product pricing, fashion, color changes reflected in all merchandise categories. And I think Penny's and Global Brand Concepts are very excited about where that's going to go."

But let me just touch on a couple of the issues you've raised. Clearly, the lag in wholesale, as I articulated earlier, we do expect as we go through fourth quarter and first quarter, again we're going against a different point of view by our wholesale audience, although we've come through with very strong holiday sellthroughs. We expect receipt dollars to be very tight until the retail community really understands what the spring business will be. So there will be a deleveraging on the core businesses. Second, we certainly have investments in startup or new concepts like Lauren handbags, where the actual sales will not be reflected until we get into the fall shipping period but we've incurred the expenses in the production and inventory to support that. And so that's playing through our thinking for next year. Additionally, Asia-Pacific, as we've talked about, the substantial commitment to that and a long-term excitement, we do have modest expectations about its contribution in the early years as we look to grow and develop that business. Lastly, I think it's also fair to say that we are demonstrating stronger Retail businesses. We're very proud of the fourth quarter comp when coupled with the gross margin improvement. Certainly, there were opportunities to whip that comp a little harder if we were willing to be more promotional and that was not the direction that our retail team took. So with the blend of the comp sales and the higher margins, we think served us well. And it's really the strategy going forward. But in a mix of retail and wholesale, we certainly make more money in wholesale than we do in retail. And the expense rates in wholesale are dramatically less than retail. So some of it's a mix issue, some of it's an investment issue and some of it will be a timing issue. And that's how we're really thinking about our fiscal '11 in total. Hope that's helpful."

So we are getting very strong sellthroughs. We talked last conference call about chased product and reorders. But I would tell you that the spring buys and summer buys were really bought long before the reaction you've just articulated for fall and holiday occurred, and I think the retailer is very cautious about leveraging current results into more on order until they see how their overall business reacts. With that said, David, the markets that we've had to date, which are the men's market, and the kid's markets and as of this week, the beginning of the footwear and handbag markets, retailers are coming in positive about the results. We clearly outperformed the market. Some of that was careful sell ins, which resulted in better sellthroughs, which helped the margins. And I think the mood going forward into the fall buys and beyond that holiday buys, I think will begin to reflect that. But it's premature to declare conclusively that that's what's going to happen and I think we'll talk more about that in May."

We are very under penetrated in Mainland China and I think we all know that over time, will be the significant opportunity. And I believe that over time, Mainland China will dwarf anything that we have today as we start at day one. And I think what Tracey said earlier, is our reporting of that business will be primarily reported through our Retail segment because the actual operating model over there really closely mirrors our Retail business. It really isn't as similar to a Wholesale business. It's where we buy the product, we own the product, we staff the stores, we manage the inventory and we're responsible for the results and/or we have our own standalone stores. So I think the current business, as well as the future business, will have characteristics that are more similar to our retail business than a wholesale business where you  sell in, they own the product, they sell it, they staff the stores and then there's a wholesale margin. So as we go forward and as a matter fact, we opened a store in Macau last week, we have two additional stores opening shortly, we will begin to manage the real estate process, future store locations and sites and our orientation will be more heavily to Mainland China than the current network of stores we've acquired."

I think there is a shift going on in Japan that has significant long-range consequences. It's a market that has been dominated by department store distribution, very intense sales per square foot. Shop-in-shops, either directly controlled by the brand or closely controlled by the brand. And that's been our primary channel of distribution. Since we acquired the business, we've obviously been focused on improving that and then integrating the Japanese business into our infrastructure, our supply chain and collapsing the three licensed entities into one. But going forward, I think we're going to have to look not only at the traditional channel of distribution but more mono-brand distribution as we see that market evolving. There is also a movement in Japan that is clear that has the pure luxury player suffering and customers looking for value, looking for faster fashion, looking for more youthful presentations, that trend is clear. And I think we're well-positioned given our brand architecture to address many of those opportunities going forward. So I don't think it's going to be an easy market in its traditional sense. But it is the second-largest luxury market in the world and I think we've started, we've made the progress. We're picking up share as you've said.

The recession and economic issues were felt there but perhaps not as strongly as it was felt here. The question is whether it will last longer or whether there's a double dip in Europe but I don't think anybody knows. Our strategy, which has included, a network of our own stores, shop-in-shops in department stores and specialty stores, continues to be the backbone of what we're doing. But what we are seeing is a contraction in the small specialty store, many of which did not fair well in the economic downturn. And we've made decisions where we did not want to ship people who might be in more difficult financial straits. We've also as we've begun to improve our network of stores, have reduced distribution of some of those smaller stores in key markets. We continue to invest in shop-in-shops in department stores and we'll use where we're putting flagships down for instance in Paris this April. We will hover around that presentation of key product lines in the department stores or specialty stores in that market as well. I think we've talked past using London as an example where we have our own stores both flagship and neighborhood, it also happens to be where we've got tremendous positioning in department stores. We are doing that now in Paris. We opened a second store last October, we'll open a third store this April. That will be a terrific representation of the brand. At the same time, we are trying to elevate the market around it to work successfully in London. It worked successfully in Milan and we're now doing that in Paris. So I think our strategy is very clear in Europe. And I think as we've elevated the brand, I think today the brand is not only large, successful and profitable, I think it's viewed in a different light. And I think that's allowing us to leverage relationships with other key customers to get the distribution we're looking for."

And again, our strategy has been to extend brands and merchandise categories, whether it's accessories, whether it's home, whether it's kids, whether it's any of the product extensions. I think as we talked about Europe, we are about a year into the launch of Lauren Sportswear. As we continue to learn and understand that business, an example would be an opportunity to extend accessory categories or other product extensions in that market, once we've established the distribution points that are appropriate. So we let the business grow incrementally as we move out. I think the same thing over time will apply in Asia as we look to broaden and deepen the portfolio of labels that are distributed in those points of distribution. So we're looking forward to doing that but we're looking forward to doing in a way that we hope we'll be successful. I think the footwear example here in the United States as you all know, we bought back that license several years ago. We put it through a rehabilitation. We have to develop the sourcing, manufacturing, supply-chain, to be experts in that. We've got a terrific team of leadership folks at both the Ralph Lauren collection level, as well as the Lauren level and we're gaining market share and points of distribution on a worldwide basis, that's all very exciting and it's encouraging to us as we now are on the cusp of broadening the assortment of handbags.

We reported strong third quarter and year-to-date results this morning. Year-to-date, our profits are at a record level, despite operating in the worst economic environment since the Great Depression. And we've exceeded our own expectations on all operating metrics. We've been able to achieve this level of performance even as we've intensified our investments and our long-term strategic initiatives, which for the first nine months of the year include building an entirely new organization in Hong Kong to support our growth aspirations through Asia, investing in important new flagships in New York, Paris and Greenwich, Connecticut and developing a host of exciting new products. We ended the third quarter with more than $1.3 billion in cash and investments, with net cash more than double last year's level, and we continue to reinvest in our business, buy back stock and reduce debt.Of course, we benefit from having exceptionally strong product and strategic merchandising initiatives. As Ralph said in today's release, customers appreciate our unwaving commitment to quality and innovation, which are defining characteristics of our company. This brand and product excellence, coupled with superb worldwide execution by the team, has allowed us to succeed. As much as our third quarter and year-to-date performances reflect the day-to-day operational excellence of our teams, they are also a result of many years of careful planning, investment, strategic decision-making that sometimes have a negative short-term impact but they have ultimately made us stronger and more profitable organization.We would not be in the position we are today without these years of preparation and execution. Two years ago, when the first signs of global financial crisis were emerging, we made a decision that our foremost priority was to protect our brand and our profits. We executed this by developing focused merchandise strategies and calibrating our global shipment volumes with the expected customer demand trends. We supported our efforts further by exploring supply chain initiatives that would allow us to capitalize on certain efficiencies without sacrificing quality or service levels. The net result of our actions have been strong retail sellthroughs of our products across channels, the benefit of which you see reflected in the 470 basis point improvement in our gross profit margins during the third quarter, and the 270 basis point improvements for the full year, both of which are on top of a margin expansion last year.Across the board, our core products have exceeded their sales plans on significantly reduced stock and tightly managed receipt flows. We achieved this level of profitability while remaining absolutely true to our luxury brand positioning. There aren't many brands or company or industry that could make a similar claim. Our retail performance during the third quarter is particularly noteworthy. We experienced a dramatic change in our worldwide same-store sales trends, with comps rising 6% after falling 7% in the first half of the year. And ralphlauren.com maintained its double-digit growth rate. Our tiered multichannel approach to our direct-to-consumer operations is a strategy that continues to serve us well. And by any measure, we had a strong holiday season. The decisions we made to adjust our merchandising assortments to accommodate the new customer mindset, in addition to taking significant cost out of the business, helped drive the operating profitability of our retail segment to 17%, up 75% in dollar terms compared to last year and just 60 basis points shy of our historic third quarter peak retail margins.The recovery in retail sales and margin was broad-based across concept and region and particularly good for our factory stores, which have been especially strong in the current environment. There is no question that customers are increasingly shopping online, where traffic to ralphlauren.com continues to grow at a double-digit rate even as visitors to brick-and-mortar stores remain down. We were pioneer in selling luxury apparel online 10 years ago and we continue to benefit from the multi-year investment we've made to develop a state-of-the-art online business with cutting-edge technology, distribution and customer service capabilities.The cumulative effect of our consistent investment in world class advertising, marketing and public relations initiatives have also proven to be valuable, particularly in the current environment. Consumers clearly recognize that our brand stands for quality and exceptional value. Our long-standing associations with premier sporting events such as the Olympics, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open not only convey the power of the Ralph Lauren brand but they also accentuate our global visibility and allure. We will also have very strong coverage at the Winter Olympics in two weeks. We are proud to be associated with these events and the world's finest athletes and we constantly explore for new ways of reaching customers to increase the visibility of our brands. For example, rugby.com staged a successful virtual fashion show during the third quarter that significantly increased the amount of attention and was highly effective in driving awareness of the site. Given the strength of our brand and a consistent sellthrough performance, we believe we are well-positioned to continue taking market share through sustained productivity gains of our core products. In addition, we continue to pursue incremental growth opportunities, most importantly in accessories. As you are aware, we've been working on developing handbag assortment for our Lauren brand and we are currently in market with our first collection of Lauren handbags. We expect to deliver this merchandise in leading department store doors this fall. The product looks fantastic and we're excited about the long-term growth prospects of this category. The recent activity to our footwear product is expanding rapidly and the profitability of this category is following suit. On January 1, we successfully assumed control of our business in several Asian markets including China, that were formerly licensed territories. I'm pleased to report that the transition was executed smoothly with no disruption to the business. We are now directly operating a multichannel business. Our ability to execute that transition, which includes the creation of an entirely new locally-based organization, speaks not only to the operational sophistication of our company but also to the tremendous opportunity we see in this part of the world. Our efforts obviously require significant investment, some of which you see reflected in our operating expenses this quarter.To give you some perspective on what we've accomplished over the last year in this region, we've hired and trained nearly 700 employees. We've obtained lease assignments for all of our locations. We've built a new world-class world supply chain and logistics network to support the region and we've built a constellation of management systems and corporate processes. The net result is that on day one of the transition, our stores were open for business with our own new POS system. They were set with spring merchandise and they were receiving goods from our distribution center daily. The store associates are now being trained in our selling and service cultures. We did not have any of this infrastructure when we first spoke to you about our plans for this region last year at this time, so we've clearly come a long way. And to make this kind of progress in difficult market conditions really highlights the operational and financial strength of our organization. With the first part of this transition now behind us, we will begin to develop this region in a measured way, as we focused on managing our existing points of distribution and learning about taste and preferences of our customers in this part of the world. Our spring buys, which were made 12 months ago, already reflect our desire to elevate the brand and educate the customer about the breadth of our offering, by presenting a more balanced mix of men's, women's, fashion and icon product, as well as accessories. For the first time ever, we are now in control of our destiny in the world's fastest-growing regions. We believe this is a powerful position for us for a number of reasons. It allows us to leverage global best practices in terms of inventory management, assortment planning, retail operations and logistics. In addition, our global advertising and marketing messages can be more appropriately aligned with our selling strategies. And perhaps, most importantly, it allows us to leverage the incarretable [ph] scope of products that we offer on a global platform. We are uniquely positioned to capitalize on opportunities with our clearly defined portfolio of lifestyle brands that span the consumer spectrum. We are already doing a good job of leveraging that portfolio in the U.S. today but there is still considerable opportunity for us to do so in the rest of the world. It will obviously take time and investment but the opportunity is there.Our year-to-date results demonstrate that we continue to operate from a position of strength in a global marketplace that remains very uncertain. Not surprisingly, our wholesale customers remain cautious about their initial orders. And all retailers including ourselves continue to focus on receipt management, trying to drive higher profitability with less inventory. I believe our third quarter sales and profit results demonstrate we can accomplish this with our own retail operations and that we are effectively maximizing opportunities with our wholesale partners.Regardless of the external environment, I believe our consistent performance over the last several years and especially in the year to date performance, position us well for the future. And as we have done historically, we'll continue to invest in product innovation, broadening our international scope and expanding our direct-to-consumer reach, making decisions that enhance the long-term positioning of our brand and profit prospects for our company. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tracey to discuss the financial and operational highlights of the third quarter, as well as an update outlook for the remainder of the year."

The decline in revenues reflects lower planned wholesale shipments, particularly in the U.S. and Japan, which were partially offset by 8% revenue growth at our retail segment. The net positive impact of currency translation on our total reported revenue growth for the quarter was approximately 2%. Our gross profit rate increased 470 basis points to 58.2% in the third quarter, which was achieved on top of a 20 basis-point gain in the prior-year period, which as you know, was a noteworthy achievement considering the high level of promotional activity in the marketplace last year. The expansion in this year's third quarter gross profit rate reflects improved wholesale and retail segment margins that were a direct result of the proactive and strategic decisions we made several months ago to calibrate inventory receipt plans to expected customer demand trends. These decisions ultimately led to fewer markdowns in our own stores and a favorable product mix across all channels. We also had some continued benefit from supply chain initiative in cost of goods and in freight.Operating expenses in the third quarter were approximately 10% greater than the comparable period last year, in line with the guidance we provided last quarter when adjusted for some impairment charges. The higher operating expenses reflect the planned acceleration in cost related to the transition of our Asia Pacific operations in January. Other drivers of the increased operating expenses include higher anticipated payouts for incentive compensation and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Operating income for the third quarter was $173 million, 4% greater than the prior-year period and our operating margin for the third quarter was 13.9%, 60 basis points above that of the third quarter of fiscal 2009. The growth in operating income and the expansion in operating margin rate were primarily due to the higher gross margin profit rate and company-wide cost control and restructuring initiatives that were partially offset by lower sales and the higher operating expenses that I just discussed.Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 rose 6% to $111 million and net income per diluted share was $1.10, which was 5% greater than the comparable period last year. The growth in net income and diluted earnings per share principally relates to higher operating income during the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 33% and approximately in line with that of the prior period last year. Moving on to some additional insight into our segment level results for the quarter, I will begin with our wholesale division, where sales declined 8% to $604 million and were down approximately 11% in constant currency, primarily due to lower planned shipments for some of our domestic products including American Living.The European wholesale shipments were down modestly in constant currency, a function of cautious specialty store orders in the context of sustained macro challenges throughout Europe. Our Japanese wholesale volume was also down in the quarter, again a function of the broader economic challenges in that market. From a category perspective in the U.S., Polo Men's Sportswear continued to be a strong performer during the quarter, supported by focused assortments, compelling gift-giving ideas and targeted marketing programs. We continue to see improved trends in our women's businesses, a category that has been challenging for us and others over the last few years. Our Lauren brand benefited from the increased representation of key sportswear items and the continued success of the Lauren Jeans Company. At Chaps, the women's Classics program resonated particularly well with the customer. Footwear shipments were very strong during the quarter for our Ralph Lauren, Polo and Lauren brands, a function of both expanded assortments and additional point of distribution.While our Lauren European specialty store customers have suffered disproportionately from the impact of the recession, our business at larger department store groups have been more resilient and offsetting some of the softness in the specialty channel. We are driving higher productivity and expanding our assortment in several major department stores such as Harrods, Selfridge's and Galleria Lafayette, which also provides tremendous exposure to global travelers and local customers alike. Our most elevated assortments are featured in their stores. In terms of product performance, shipments of our men's and women's Blue Label products were the strongest sellers and men's Black Label remained one of our fastest growing brands in Europe. In aggregate, the United Kingdom and Germany were our best performing European regions, while trends in Italy, which is predominantly a specialty store market, remain weak.Our third quarter wholesale operating income was $107 million and the operating margin rate was 17.7%, compared to a historic peak third quarter wholesale margin of 19.8% last year. In addition to the challenging comparison, the 210 basis-point decline in the wholesale operating margin rate was primarily a result of deleveraging operating expenses on lower global shipment volume and incremental costs associated with related to business expansion including costs associated with formerly licensed operations.For our retail group, third quarter sales increased 8% to $592 million. Overall comp store sales, which include ralphlauren.com, were up 6% or 4% in constant currency, reflecting 4% growth at Ralph Lauren stores, a 6% increase at factory stores and 7% growth at Club Monaco. Our third quarter comps were better than our expectations of a flat to low single-digit increase, which we shared with you on our last earnings call, due to broad-based strength across all regions and all concepts. Of course, we are comparing against the substantial comp decline in the prior-year period when the global financial crisis intensified and there was a very high level of promotional activity in the market.Overall traffic trends in our stores remained challenging during the third quarter especially in the U.S. and despite a rebound in tourist travel to gateway cities. Comp growth was primarily achieved with higher average dollar transactions mostly due to higher full price selling. We have slowly begun to see the gradual return of our core luxury customer, who purchases our collection in Black Label merchandise. At ralphlauren.com, sales rose 13% in the third quarter, with Childrenswear, menswear and footwear being the top performing categories. With respect to our European Ralph Lauren stores, the United Kingdom and the Benelux countries continue to be our top performing regions. And even though we saw improved trends in Milan, France and Germany, those markets remain challenging. Our factory stores continue to experience broad-based strength throughout Europe and across all product categories, although once again, the United Kingdom has the largest comp growth in the region.In Japan, we achieved positive sales growth at both our Ralph Lauren and factory stores clearly outperforming overall market trends, although we have a relatively modest Japanese retail network at this time. We opened five directly-operated stores globally during the quarter, including our Ralph Lauren store in Greenwich, Connecticut, which Roger shared with your earlier, which primarily showcased our women's and home products in addition to a small selection of men's sportswear. We ended the third quarter with 333 directly operated stores globally. Our Retail segment operating income grew 75% in the third quarter to $101 million. The retail operating margin was 17%, 650 basis points greater than the prior period last year when profitability was significantly pressured by a sharp comp decline and elevated promotional activity. This year's growth in retail operating income and the expansion in margin rate was primarily a result of positive same-store sales growth and stronger full price sellthrough rates across most of our retail formats in addition to disciplined operational and inventory management, including the benefit of restructuring actions that we took in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.Licensing royalties for the quarter were $48 million, 3% below the prior-year period due to a decline in fragrance and home products licensing revenues that were partially offset by higher international royalties. Operating income for our licensing segment was down 12% to $24 million in the third quarter, principally as a result of the lower licensing royalties and incremental Asia-Pacific related expenses. We ended the third quarter with more than $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments compared to $908 million in the prior-year period. Net of debt, we had $1 billion in cash and investments at the end of the quarter, up from $489 million last year. Inventory was down 7% from the third quarter last year. This decline is a function of the work we have done to calibrate shipment volumes to expected customer demand trends, which was somewhat masked during the first half of the year due to our strategic supply chain initiatives, which continued to result in higher in-transit inventory, which we have explained to you on prior calls. We spent approximately $51 million on CapEx during the third quarter to support new retail stores, wholesale shop installations and other infrastructure investments. We also repurchased approximately 1 million shares of stock during the quarter, utilizing $78 million of our outstanding share repurchase authorization and we had 352 million of share authorization remaining at the end of the quarter.In this morning's press release, we outlined our expectations for the remainder of fiscal 2010, which I would briefly like to review with you now. Based on our better-than-expected year-to-date sales performance, we raised our top line guidance and we are now looking for a low single-digit decline in consolidated revenues for the full year, which compares to our prior expectation of a mid- single-digit decline for fiscal 2010 revenues. This guidance implies a mid- single-digit decline in wholesale shipments in the fourth quarter, as well as a low double-digit increase in same-store sales for our retail segment, which does include an additional week of sales compared to the prior-year period, the 53rd week. The impact of this additional week to our consolidated earnings is not expected to be material as we will have an extra week of expense for the balance of our enterprise offsetting any incremental retail profits. Also beginning in the fourth quarter, please keep in mind that the sales results from our newly transitioned Asia-Pacific operations will now be reflected primarily in our retail segment. As we have communicated on the last few calls, incremental expenses related to our new Asia-Pacific operations are most pronounced in the fourth quarter, as we now have the full cost of our infrastructure, inclusive of all store and all shop locations with payroll for several hundred new employees as well as full occupancy expenses for running all of our points of distribution. In fact, the fourth quarter impact of the Asia-Pacific operations is expected to be dilutive to our earnings by approximately $0.08 to $0.10 per diluted share, with sales slowly ramping up through the initial network of store locations. The impact of incentive compensation accruals is also expected to yield additional expense pressure as is the higher mix of retail sales in the quarter.As a result, we're currently forecasting operating expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 to exceed those of the prior-year period, including last year's impairment and restructuring charges by a mid-single-digit rate. Let me close our prepared remarks by saying we are extremely proud as a management team of how we have navigated the business through these challenging global times, delivering $365 million of net income year-to-date or 1% above the prior-year period. As Roger indicated, and Ralph continues to reinforce to us all, it is a testament to the strength of our brand, our global management team, our global partnerships and to the strategic decisions we've consistently made over the last several years that we have been able to deliver outstanding results under such challenging circumstances. At this point, we'd like to open the call up for Q&A. Operator, can you please assist us with that?"

First of all, last year at this time, if you remember, our third quarter, fourth quarter and first quarter of the new year had been bought by our wholesale customers before the events of September, which really accelerated the decline in the busines",302,"Sure. First of all, last year at this time, if you remember, our third quarter, fourth quarter and first quarter of the new year had been bought by our wholesale customers before the events of September, which really accelerated the decline in the business. So at least through third, fourth and first quarter of next year, we really saw more normalized receipt flows and inventory purchases by our customer. I think it's the full impact of the September, October, November periods were felt, retailers began to cut back receipts starting with fall of this year into holiday and continuing a full 12 months into spring and summer of next year. So in the wholesale channel, we're really still lapping very strong wholesale on orders by our customers and their desire to correct their inventory and receipts really didn't take effect until fall of 2009. In our Retail businesses, we're obviously buying our own products. We corrected also our receipt flows for starting fall, holiday and now into spring. And what you're seeing in our retail results and the gross margins and operating profit improvements, are the improved sellthroughs. So the products are in demand, the inventories are in line, the sellthroughs have improved and the margins are up. And I would expect our wholesale partners are experiencing the same phenomenon. But obviously for us, it's a lower sell in and we'll have to lap all of that until we begin to see on orders anniversary-ing that and begin to move forward again. So I think it's just the timing of the two Wholesale and Retail segments, yet the sellthrough at point of sale for our wholesale customers was significantly better this third quarter. And I think that bodes well for on order going forward into the fall and holiday of next year."

I think previously, we had considered your guidance based on adjusted results for the fourth quarter and then release you're highlighting that it should be based on what looks like a number of $594 million from last year and then a mid-single-digit increase on top of that.

Is it different than your original expectations or was it just a misunderstanding and how much is incentive compensation? How much is sort of ongoing higher expense levels?"

The Asia-Pacific transition, which as I spent a little time on the call talking about, was a January 1 cut over. Our expectation when we took on that business is we would acquire at that point the inventory of the licensee from fall '09 forward. And then the spring on order would be ours. Dixon, who is our license partner, really sold through that fall on order to a very low level. So it is normally a clearance period in Asia, January and halfway into February for us is a period of exciting new deliveries, spring goods, but very little clearance to offer in a marketplace that in the middle of January and February is promotional. So what we've got is, you heard is all the employees, all the expenses, all the infrastructure that was built but the sales will only begin to ramp up as we work our way through the quarter and we begin to get to the back end of the quarter when they're more normalized spring selling period. So it's really the six, seven weeks in the early days where the stores are getting new inventory and presenting that to customers and we're getting a nice reaction. But obviously, we don't have any of the fall holiday clearance that all other businesses in that region are now liquidating. So that affects the dilution in the transition quarter."

There is a fairly sizable difference in mix of sales in the quarter between wholesale and retail. And that obviously for us from an expense standpoint, has a fairly sizable impact on expenses in the quarter. So if you think about the year-over-year difference in our expense and if you think about your model and how you model our business, in the growth year-over-year, much of our growth year-over-year is coming from retail. Our Wholesale business is actually down. So when you think about how to remodel the quarter from a growth standpoint, I would keep that in mind when you're reflecting it. So a piece of it is the growth related to expenses, as Roger just talked about, for Asia-Pacific and then a piece of it is the growth related to retail of which has an extra week as well of expense in there for us. And that, those two alone represent almost 2/3 of the expense growth."

We're now about ready to come up on our two year anniversary this February when we launched. Obviously, we launched into a more difficult market than we had anticipated. A couple of learnings over the last year or two have included customer preferences in terms of product content, whether it's men's, women's or kids. The color palettes that the Penny's customer reacts to. The product offering in terms of fashion quotient, as well as price. We came out into the marketplace at a significant premium to the Penny's high-end price points. And again, we've moderated those. So we still are positioned as the premium brand within their assortment. But the delta between where we were priced and where the customer was willing to buy a new brand, I think has been one of the big learnings. I think we've also looked at our marketing and advertising messaging in an effort to launch a new brand that had no prior customer knowledge. How we talked to that customer, how we shaped our message, the imaging we project have all been looked at, studied. And I think for spring 2010 that we're heading into, and the fall season that we've already booked, I think you'll see those product pricing, fashion, color changes reflected in all merchandise categories. And I think Penny's and Global Brand Concepts are very excited about where that's going to go."

But let me just touch on a couple of the issues you've raised. Clearly, the lag in wholesale, as I articulated earlier, we do expect as we go through fourth quarter and first quarter, again we're going against a different point of view by our wholesale audience, although we've come through with very strong holiday sellthroughs. We expect receipt dollars to be very tight until the retail community really understands what the spring business will be. So there will be a deleveraging on the core businesses. Second, we certainly have investments in startup or new concepts like Lauren handbags, where the actual sales will not be reflected until we get into the fall shipping period but we've incurred the expenses in the production and inventory to support that. And so that's playing through our thinking for next year. Additionally, Asia-Pacific, as we've talked about, the substantial commitment to that and a long-term excitement, we do have modest expectations about its contribution in the early years as we look to grow and develop that business. Lastly, I think it's also fair to say that we are demonstrating stronger Retail businesses. We're very proud of the fourth quarter comp when coupled with the gross margin improvement. Certainly, there were opportunities to whip that comp a little harder if we were willing to be more promotional and that was not the direction that our retail team took. So with the blend of the comp sales and the higher margins, we think served us well. And it's really the strategy going forward. But in a mix of retail and wholesale, we certainly make more money in wholesale than we do in retail. And the expense rates in wholesale are dramatically less than retail. So some of it's a mix issue, some of it's an investment issue and some of it will be a timing issue. And that's how we're really thinking about our fiscal '11 in total. Hope that's helpful."

So we are getting very strong sellthroughs. We talked last conference call about chased product and reorders. But I would tell you that the spring buys and summer buys were really bought long before the reaction you've just articulated for fall and holiday occurred, and I think the retailer is very cautious about leveraging current results into more on order until they see how their overall business reacts. With that said, David, the markets that we've had to date, which are the men's market, and the kid's markets and as of this week, the beginning of the footwear and handbag markets, retailers are coming in positive about the results. We clearly outperformed the market. Some of that was careful sell ins, which resulted in better sellthroughs, which helped the margins.

We are very under penetrated in Mainland China and I think we all know that over time, will be the significant opportunity. And I believe that over time, Mainland China will dwarf anything that we have today as we start at day one. And I think what Tracey said earlier, is our reporting of that business will be primarily reported through our Retail segment because the actual operating model over there really closely mirrors our Retail business. It really isn't as similar to a Wholesale business. It's where we buy the product, we own the product, we staff the stores, we manage the inventory and we're responsible for the results and/or we have our own standalone stores. So I think the current business, as well as the future business, will have characteristics that are more similar to our retail business than a wholesale business where you  sell in, they own the product, they sell it, they staff the stores and then there's a wholesale margin.

I think there is a shift going on in Japan that has significant long-range consequences. It's a market that has been dominated by department store distribution, very intense sales per square foot. Shop-in-shops, either directly controlled by the brand or closely controlled by the brand. And that's been our primary channel of distribution. Since we acquired the business, we've obviously been focused on improving that and then integrating the Japanese business into our infrastructure, our supply chain and collapsing the three licensed entities into one. But going forward, I think we're going to have to look not only at the traditional channel of distribution but more mono-brand distribution as we see that market evolving. There is also a movement in Japan that is clear that has the pure luxury player suffering and customers looking for value, looking for faster fashion, looking for more youthful presentations, that trend is clear. And I think we're well-positioned given our brand architecture to address many of those opportunities going forward. So I don't think it's going to be an easy market in its traditional sense. But it is the second-largest luxury market in the world and I think we've started, we've made the progress. We're picking up share as you've said. But we have a long way to go to position that market in terms of where the customers are taking us."

The recession and economic issues were felt there but perhaps not as strongly as it was felt here. The question is whether it will last longer or whether there's a double dip in Europe but I don't think anybody knows. Our strategy, which has included, a network of our own stores, shop-in-shops in department stores and specialty stores, continues to be the backbone of what we're doing. But what we are seeing is a contraction in the small specialty store, many of which did not fair well in the economic downturn. And we've made decisions where we did not want to ship people who might be in more difficult financial straits. We've also as we've begun to improve our network of stores, have reduced distribution of some of those smaller stores in key markets. We continue to invest in shop-in-shops in department stores and we'll use where we're putting flagships down for instance in Paris this April. We will hover around that presentation of key product lines in the department stores or specialty stores in that market as well. I think we've talked past using London as an example where we have our own stores both flagship and neighborhood, it also happens to be where we've got tremendous positioning in department stores. We are doing that now in Paris. We opened a second store last October, we'll open a third store this April. That will be a terrific representation of the brand. At the same time, we are trying to elevate the market around it to work successfully in London. It worked successfully in Milan and we're now doing that in Paris. So I think our strategy is very clear in Europe. And I think as we've elevated the brand, I think today the brand is not only large, successful and profitable, I think it's viewed in a different light. And I think that's allowing us to leverage relationships with other key customers to get the distribution we're looking for."

And again, our strategy has been to extend brands and merchandise categories, whether it's accessories, whether it's home, whether it's kids, whether it's any of the product extensions. I think as we talked about Europe, we are about a year into the launch of Lauren Sportswear. As we continue to learn and understand that business, an example would be an opportunity to extend accessory categories or other product extensions in that market, once we've established the distribution points that are appropriate. So we let the business grow incrementally as we move out. I think the same thing over time will apply in Asia as we look to broaden and deepen the portfolio of labels that are distributed in those points of distribution. So we're looking forward to doing that but we're looking forward to doing in a way that we hope we'll be successful. I think the footwear example here in the United States as you all know, we bought back that license several years ago. We put it through a rehabilitation. We have to develop the sourcing, manufacturing, supply-chain, to be experts in that. We've got a terrific team of leadership folks at both the Ralph Lauren collection level, as well as the Lauren level and we're gaining market share and points of distribution on a worldwide basis, that's all very exciting and it's encouraging to us as we now are on the cusp of broadening the assortment of handbags. So it's part of the company's DNA that we're trying to do it thoughtfully in this environment and I think our wholesale partners are quite excited.

We reported strong third quarter and year-to-date results this morning. Year-to-date, our profits are at a record level, despite operating in the worst economic environment since the Great Depression. And we've exceeded our own expectations on all operating metrics. We've been able to achieve this level of performance even as we've intensified our investments and our long-term strategic initiatives, which for the first nine months of the year include building an entirely new organization in Hong Kong to support our growth aspirations through Asia, investing in important new flagships in New York, Paris and Greenwich, Connecticut and developing a host of exciting new products. We ended the third quarter with more than $1.3 billion in cash and investments, with net cash more than double last year's level, and we continue to reinvest in our business, buy back stock and reduce debt.Of course, we benefit from having exceptionally strong product and strategic merchandising initiatives. As Ralph said in today's release, customers appreciate our unwaving commitment to quality and innovation, which are defining characteristics of our company. This brand and product excellence, coupled with superb worldwide execution by the team, has allowed us to succeed. As much as our third quarter and year-to-date performances reflect the day-to-day operational excellence of our teams, they are also a result of many years of careful planning, investment, strategic decision-making that sometimes have a negative short-term impact but they have ultimately made us stronger and more profitable organization.We would not be in the position we are today without these years of preparation and execution. Two years ago, when the first signs of global financial crisis were emerging, we made a decision that our foremost priority was to protect our brand and our profits. We executed this by developing focused merchandise strategies and calibrating our global shipment volumes with the expected customer demand trends. We supported our efforts further by exploring supply chain initiatives that would allow us to capitalize on certain efficiencies without sacrificing quality or service levels. The net result of our actions have been strong retail sellthroughs of our products across channels, the benefit of which you see reflected in the 470 basis point improvement in our gross profit margins during the third quarter, and the 270 basis point improvements for the full year, both of which are on top of a margin expansion last year.Across the board, our core products have exceeded their sales plans on significantly reduced stock and tightly managed receipt flows. We achieved this level of profitability while remaining absolutely true to our luxury brand positioning. There aren't many brands or company or industry that could make a similar claim. Our retail performance during the third quarter is particularly noteworthy. We experienced a dramatic change in our worldwide same-store sales trends, with comps rising 6% after falling 7% in the first half of the year. And ralphlauren.com maintained its double-digit growth rate. Our tiered multichannel approach to our direct-to-consumer operations is a strategy that continues to serve us well. And by any measure, we had a strong holiday season. The decisions we made to adjust our merchandising assortments to accommodate the new customer mindset, in addition to taking significant cost out of the business, helped drive the operating profitability of our retail segment to 17%, up 75% in dollar terms compared to last year and just 60 basis points shy of our historic third quarter peak retail margins.The recovery in retail sales and margin was broad-based across concept and region and particularly good for our factory stores, which have been especially strong in the current environment. There is no question that customers are increasingly shopping online, where traffic to ralphlauren.com continues to grow at a double-digit rate even as visitors to brick-and-mortar stores remain down. We were pioneer in selling luxury apparel online 10 years ago and we continue to benefit from the multi-year investment we've made to develop a state-of-the-art online business with cutting-edge technology, distribution and customer service capabilities.The cumulative effect of our consistent investment in world class advertising, marketing and public relations initiatives have also proven to be valuable, particularly in the current environment. Consumers clearly recognize that our brand stands for quality and exceptional value. Our long-standing associations with premier sporting events such as the Olympics, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open not only convey the power of the Ralph Lauren brand but they also accentuate our global visibility and allure. We will also have very strong coverage at the Winter Olympics in two weeks. We are proud to be associated with these events and the world's finest athletes and we constantly explore for new ways of reaching customers to increase the visibility of our brands. For example, rugby.com staged a successful virtual fashion show during the third quarter that significantly increased the amount of attention and was highly effective in driving awareness of the site. Given the strength of our brand and a consistent sellthrough performance, we believe we are well-positioned to continue taking market share through sustained productivity gains of our core products. In addition, we continue to pursue incremental growth opportunities, most importantly in accessories. As you are aware, we've been working on developing handbag assortment for our Lauren brand and we are currently in market with our first collection of Lauren handbags. We expect to deliver this merchandise in leading department store doors this fall. The product looks fantastic and we're excited about the long-term growth prospects of this category. The recent activity to our footwear product is expanding rapidly and the profitability of this category is following suit. On January 1, we successfully assumed control of our business in several Asian markets including China, that were formerly licensed territories. I'm pleased to report that the transition was executed smoothly with no disruption to the business. We are now directly operating a multichannel business. Our ability to execute that transition, which includes the creation of an entirely new locally-based organization, speaks not only to the operational sophistication of our company but also to the tremendous opportunity we see in this part of the world. Our efforts obviously require significant investment, some of which you see reflected in our operating expenses this quarter.To give you some perspective on what we've accomplished over the last year in this region, we've hired and trained nearly 700 employees. We've obtained lease assignments for all of our locations. We've built a new world-class world supply chain and logistics network to support the region and we've built a constellation of management systems and corporate processes. The net result is that on day one of the transition, our stores were open for business with our own new POS system. They were set with spring merchandise and they were receiving goods from our distribution center daily. The store associates are now being trained in our selling and service cultures. We did not have any of this infrastructure when we first spoke to you about our plans for this region last year at this time, so we've clearly come a long way. And to make this kind of progress in difficult market conditions really highlights the operational and financial strength of our organization. With the first part of this transition now behind us, we will begin to develop this region in a measured way, as we focused on managing our existing points of distribution and learning about taste and preferences of our customers in this part of the world. Our spring buys, which were made 12 months ago, already reflect our desire to elevate the brand and educate the customer about the breadth of our offering, by presenting a more balanced mix of men's, women's, fashion and icon product, as well as accessories. For the first time ever, we are now in control of our destiny in the world's fastest-growing regions. We believe this is a powerful position for us for a number of reasons. It allows us to leverage global best practices in terms of inventory management, assortment planning, retail operations and logistics. In addition, our global advertising and marketing messages can be more appropriately aligned with our selling strategies. And perhaps, most importantly, it allows us to leverage the incarretable [ph] scope of products that we offer on a global platform. We are uniquely positioned to capitalize on opportunities with our clearly defined portfolio of lifestyle brands that span the consumer spectrum. We are already doing a good job of leveraging that portfolio in the U.S. today but there is still considerable opportunity for us to do so in the rest of the world. It will obviously take time and investment but the opportunity is there.Our year-to-date results demonstrate that we continue to operate from a position of strength in a global marketplace that remains very uncertain. Not surprisingly, our wholesale customers remain cautious about their initial orders. And all retailers including ourselves continue to focus on receipt management, trying to drive higher profitability with less inventory. I believe our third quarter sales and profit results demonstrate we can accomplish this with our own retail operations and that we are effectively maximizing opportunities with our wholesale partners.Regardless of the external environment, I believe our consistent performance over the last several years and especially in the year to date performance, position us well for the future. And as we have done historically, we'll continue to invest in product innovation, broadening our international scope and expanding our direct-to-consumer reach, making decisions that enhance the long-term positioning of our brand and profit prospects for our company. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tracey to discuss the financial and operational highlights of the third quarter, as well as an update outlook for the remainder of the year."

For the third quarter, consolidated net revenues were $1.2 billion, less than 1% below the prior-year period.

For the third quarter, consolidated net revenues were $1.2 billion, less than 1% below the prior-year period. The decline in revenues reflects lower planned wholesale shipments, particularly in the U.S. and Japan, which were partially offset by 8% revenue growth at our retail segment. The net positive impact of currency translation on our total reported revenue growth for the quarter was approximately 2%. Our gross profit rate increased 470 basis points to 58.2% in the third quarter, which was achieved on top of a 20 basis-point gain in the prior-year period, which as you know, was a noteworthy achievement considering the high level of promotional activity in the marketplace last year. The expansion in this year's third quarter gross profit rate reflects improved wholesale and retail segment margins that were a direct result of the proactive and strategic decisions we made several months ago to calibrate inventory receipt plans to expected customer demand trends. These decisions ultimately led to fewer markdowns in our own stores and a favorable product mix across all channels. We also had some continued benefit from supply chain initiative in cost of goods and in freight.Operating expenses in the third quarter were approximately 10% greater than the comparable period last year, in line with the guidance we provided last quarter when adjusted for some impairment charges. The higher operating expenses reflect the planned acceleration in cost related to the transition of our Asia Pacific operations in January. Other drivers of the increased operating expenses include higher anticipated payouts for incentive compensation and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Operating income for the third quarter was $173 million, 4% greater than the prior-year period and our operating margin for the third quarter was 13.9%, 60 basis points above that of the third quarter of fiscal 2009. The growth in operating income and the expansion in operating margin rate were primarily due to the higher gross margin profit rate and company-wide cost control and restructuring initiatives that were partially offset by lower sales and the higher operating expenses that I just discussed.Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 rose 6% to $111 million and net income per diluted share was $1.10, which was 5% greater than the comparable period last year. The growth in net income and diluted earnings per share principally relates to higher operating income during the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 33% and approximately in line with that of the prior period last year. Moving on to some additional insight into our segment level results for the quarter, I will begin with our wholesale division, where sales declined 8% to $604 million and were down approximately 11% in constant currency, primarily due to lower planned shipments for some of our domestic products including American Living.The European wholesale shipments were down modestly in constant currency, a function of cautious specialty store orders in the context of sustained macro challenges throughout Europe. Our Japanese wholesale volume was also down in the quarter, again a function of the broader economic challenges in that market. From a category perspective in the U.S., Polo Men's Sportswear continued to be a strong performer during the quarter, supported by focused assortments, compelling gift-giving ideas and targeted marketing programs. We continue to see improved trends in our women's businesses, a category that has been challenging for us and others over the last few years. Our Lauren brand benefited from the increased representation of key sportswear items and the continued success of the Lauren Jeans Company. At Chaps, the women's Classics program resonated particularly well with the customer. Footwear shipments were very strong during the quarter for our Ralph Lauren, Polo and Lauren brands, a function of both expanded assortments and additional point of distribution.While our Lauren European specialty store customers have suffered disproportionately from the impact of the recession, our business at larger department store groups have been more resilient and offsetting some of the softness in the specialty channel. We are driving higher productivity and expanding our assortment in several major department stores such as Harrods, Selfridge's and Galleria Lafayette, which also provides tremendous exposure to global travelers and local customers alike. Our most elevated assortments are featured in their stores. In terms of product performance, shipments of our men's and women's Blue Label products were the strongest sellers and men's Black Label remained one of our fastest growing brands in Europe. In aggregate, the United Kingdom and Germany were our best performing European regions, while trends in Italy, which is predominantly a specialty store market, remain weak.Our third quarter wholesale operating income was $107 million and the operating margin rate was 17.7%, compared to a historic peak third quarter wholesale margin of 19.8% last year. In addition to the challenging comparison, the 210 basis-point decline in the wholesale operating margin rate was primarily a result of deleveraging operating expenses on lower global shipment volume and incremental costs associated with related to business expansion including costs associated with formerly licensed operations.For our retail group, third quarter sales increased 8% to $592 million. Overall comp store sales, which include ralphlauren.com, were up 6% or 4% in constant currency, reflecting 4% growth at Ralph Lauren stores, a 6% increase at factory stores and 7% growth at Club Monaco. Our third quarter comps were better than our expectations of a flat to low single-digit increase, which we shared with you on our last earnings call, due to broad-based strength across all regions and all concepts. Of course, we are comparing against the substantial comp decline in the prior-year period when the global financial crisis intensified and there was a very high level of promotional activity in the market.Overall traffic trends in our stores remained challenging during the third quarter especially in the U.S. and despite a rebound in tourist travel to gateway cities. Comp growth was primarily achieved with higher average dollar transactions mostly due to higher full price selling. We have slowly begun to see the gradual return of our core luxury customer, who purchases our collection in Black Label merchandise. At ralphlauren.com, sales rose 13% in the third quarter, with Childrenswear, menswear and footwear being the top performing categories. With respect to our European Ralph Lauren stores, the United Kingdom and the Benelux countries continue to be our top performing regions. And even though we saw improved trends in Milan, France and Germany, those markets remain challenging. Our factory stores continue to experience broad-based strength throughout Europe and across all product categories, although once again, the United Kingdom has the largest comp growth in the region.In Japan, we achieved positive sales growth at both our Ralph Lauren and factory stores clearly outperforming overall market trends, although we have a relatively modest Japanese retail network at this time. We opened five directly-operated stores globally during the quarter, including our Ralph Lauren store in Greenwich, Connecticut, which Roger shared with your earlier, which primarily showcased our women's and home products in addition to a small selection of men's sportswear. We ended the third quarter with 333 directly operated stores globally. Our Retail segment operating income grew 75% in the third quarter to $101 million. The retail operating margin was 17%, 650 basis points greater than the prior period last year when profitability was significantly pressured by a sharp comp decline and elevated promotional activity. This year's growth in retail operating income and the expansion in margin rate was primarily a result of positive same-store sales growth and stronger full price sellthrough rates across most of our retail formats in addition to disciplined operational and inventory management, including the benefit of restructuring actions that we took in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.Licensing royalties for the quarter were $48 million, 3% below the prior-year period due to a decline in fragrance and home products licensing revenues that were partially offset by higher international royalties. Operating income for our licensing segment was down 12% to $24 million in the third quarter, principally as a result of the lower licensing royalties and incremental Asia-Pacific related expenses. We ended the third quarter with more than $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments compared to $908 million in the prior-year period. Net of debt, we had $1 billion in cash and investments at the end of the quarter, up from $489 million last year. Inventory was down 7% from the third quarter last year. This decline is a function of the work we have done to calibrate shipment volumes to expected customer demand trends, which was somewhat masked during the first half of the year due to our strategic supply chain initiatives, which continued to result in higher in-transit inventory, which we have explained to you on prior calls. We spent approximately $51 million on CapEx during the third quarter to support new retail stores, wholesale shop installations and other infrastructure investments. We also repurchased approximately 1 million shares of stock during the quarter, utilizing $78 million of our outstanding share repurchase authorization and we had 352 million of share authorization remaining at the end of the quarter.In this morning's press release, we outlined our expectations for the remainder of fiscal 2010, which I would briefly like to review with you now. Based on our better-than-expected year-to-date sales performance, we raised our top line guidance and we are now looking for a low single-digit decline in consolidated revenues for the full year, which compares to our prior expectation of a mid- single-digit decline for fiscal 2010 revenues. This guidance implies a mid- single-digit decline in wholesale shipments in the fourth quarter, as well as a low double-digit increase in same-store sales for our retail segment, which does include an additional week of sales compared to the prior-year period, the 53rd week. The impact of this additional week to our consolidated earnings is not expected to be material as we will have an extra week of expense for the balance of our enterprise offsetting any incremental retail profits. Also beginning in the fourth quarter, please keep in mind that the sales results from our newly transitioned Asia-Pacific operations will now be reflected primarily in our retail segment. As we have communicated on the last few calls, incremental expenses related to our new Asia-Pacific operations are most pronounced in the fourth quarter, as we now have the full cost of our infrastructure, inclusive of all store and all shop locations with payroll for several hundred new employees as well as full occupancy expenses for running all of our points of distribution. In fact, the fourth quarter impact of the Asia-Pacific operations is expected to be dilutive to our earnings by approximately $0.08 to $0.10 per diluted share, with sales slowly ramping up through the initial network of store locations. The impact of incentive compensation accruals is also expected to yield additional expense pressure as is the higher mix of retail sales in the quarter.As a result, we're currently forecasting operating expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 to exceed those of the prior-year period, including last year's impairment and restructuring charges by a mid-single-digit rate. Let me close our prepared remarks by saying we are extremely proud as a management team of how we have navigated the business through these challenging global times, delivering $365 million of net income year-to-date or 1% above the prior-year period. As Roger indicated, and Ralph continues to reinforce to us all, it is a testament to the strength of our brand, our global management team, our global partnerships and to the strategic decisions we've consistently made over the last several years that we have been able to deliver outstanding results under such challenging circumstances. At this point, we'd like to open the call up for Q&A. Operator, can you please assist us with that?"

First of all, last year at this time, if you remember, our third quarter, fourth quarter and first quarter of the new year had been bought by our wholesale customers before the events of September, which really accelerated the decline in the business. So at least through third, fourth and first quarter of next year, we really saw more normalized receipt flows and inventory purchases by our customer. I think it's the full impact of the September, October, November periods were felt, retailers began to cut back receipts starting with fall of this year into holiday and continuing a full 12 months into spring and summer of next year. So in the wholesale channel, we're really still lapping very strong wholesale on orders by our customers and their desire to correct their inventory and receipts really didn't take effect until fall of 2009. In our Retail businesses, we're obviously buying our own products. We corrected also our receipt flows for starting fall, holiday and now into spring. And what you're seeing in our retail results and the gross margins and operating profit improvements, are the improved sellthroughs. So the products are in demand, the inventories are in line, the sellthroughs have improved and the margins are up. And I would expect our wholesale partners are experiencing the same phenomenon. But obviously for us, it's a lower sell in and we'll have to lap all of that until we begin to see on orders anniversary-ing that and begin to move forward again. So I think it's just the timing of the two Wholesale and Retail segments, yet the sellthrough at point of sale for our wholesale customers was significantly better this third quarter. And I think that bodes well for on order going forward into the fall and holiday of next year."

I think previously, we had considered your guidance based on adjusted results for the fourth quarter and then release you're highlighting that it should be based on what looks like a number of $594 million from last year and then a mid-single-digit increase on top of that. But it also looks like the guidance for the Asia dilution is about $15 million, so could you sort of help us bridge the gap? Is it different than your original expectations or was it just a misunderstanding and how much is incentive compensation? How much is sort of ongoing higher expense levels?"

The Asia-Pacific transition, which as I spent a little time on the call talking about, was a January 1 cut over. Our expectation when we took on that business is we would acquire at that point the inventory of the licensee from fall '09 forward. And then the spring on order would be ours. Dixon, who is our license partner, really sold through that fall on order to a very low level. So it is normally a clearance period in Asia, January and halfway into February for us is a period of exciting new deliveries, spring goods, but very little clearance to offer in a marketplace that in the middle of January and February is promotional. So what we've got is, you heard is all the employees, all the expenses, all the infrastructure that was built but the sales will only begin to ramp up as we work our way through the quarter and we begin to get to the back end of the quarter when they're more normalized spring selling period. So it's really the six, seven weeks in the early days where the stores are getting new inventory and presenting that to customers and we're getting a nice reaction. But obviously, we don't have any of the fall holiday clearance that all other businesses in that region are now liquidating. So that affects the dilution in the transition quarter."

There is a fairly sizable difference in mix of sales in the quarter between wholesale and retail.

So if you think about the year-over-year difference in our expense and if you think about your model and how you model our business, in the growth year-over-year, much of our growth year-over-year is coming from retail. Our Wholesale business is actually down. So when you think about how to remodel the quarter from a growth standpoint, I would keep that in mind when you're reflecting it. So a piece of it is the growth related to expenses, as Roger just talked about, for Asia-Pacific and then a piece of it is the growth related to retail of which has an extra week as well of expense in there for us. And that, those two alone represent almost 2/3 of the expense growth."

We're now about ready to come up on our two year anniversary this February when we launched. Obviously, we launched into a more difficult market than we had anticipated. A couple of learnings over the last year or two have included customer preferences in terms of product content, whether it's men's, women's or kids. The color palettes that the Penny's customer reacts to. The product offering in terms of fashion quotient, as well as price. We came out into the marketplace at a significant premium to the Penny's high-end price points. And again, we've moderated those. So we still are positioned as the premium brand within their assortment. But the delta between where we were priced and where the customer was willing to buy a new brand, I think has been one of the big learnings. I think we've also looked at our marketing and advertising messaging in an effort to launch a new brand that had no prior customer knowledge. How we talked to that customer, how we shaped our message, the imaging we project have all been looked at, studied. And I think for spring 2010 that we're heading into, and the fall season that we've already booked, I think you'll see those product pricing, fashion, color changes reflected in all merchandise categories. And I think Penny's and Global Brand Concepts are very excited about where that's going to go."

But let me just touch on a couple of the issues you've raised. Clearly, the lag in wholesale, as I articulated earlier, we do expect as we go through fourth quarter and first quarter, again we're going against a different point of view by our wholesale audience, although we've come through with very strong holiday sellthroughs. We expect receipt dollars to be very tight until the retail community really understands what the spring business will be. So there will be a deleveraging on the core businesses. Second, we certainly have investments in startup or new concepts like Lauren handbags, where the actual sales will not be reflected until we get into the fall shipping period but we've incurred the expenses in the production and inventory to support that. And so that's playing through our thinking for next year. Additionally, Asia-Pacific, as we've talked about, the substantial commitment to that and a long-term excitement, we do have modest expectations about its contribution in the early years as we look to grow and develop that business. Lastly, I think it's also fair to say that we are demonstrating stronger Retail businesses. We're very proud of the fourth quarter comp when coupled with the gross margin improvement. Certainly, there were opportunities to whip that comp a little harder if we were willing to be more promotional and that was not the direction that our retail team took. So with the blend of the comp sales and the higher margins, we think served us well. And it's really the strategy going forward. But in a mix of retail and wholesale, we certainly make more money in wholesale than we do in retail. And the expense rates in wholesale are dramatically less than retail. So some of it's a mix issue, some of it's an investment issue and some of it will be a timing issue. And that's how we're really thinking about our fiscal '11 in total. Hope that's helpful."

So we are getting very strong sellthroughs. We talked last conference call about chased product and reorders. But I would tell you that the spring buys and summer buys were really bought long before the reaction you've just articulated for fall and holiday occurred, and I think the retailer is very cautious about leveraging current results into more on order until they see how their overall business reacts. With that said, David, the markets that we've had to date, which are the men's market, and the kid's markets and as of this week, the beginning of the footwear and handbag markets, retailers are coming in positive about the results. We clearly outperformed the market. Some of that was careful sell ins, which resulted in better sellthroughs, which helped the margins. And I think the mood going forward into the fall buys and beyond that holiday buys, I think will begin to reflect that. But it's premature to declare conclusively that that's what's going to happen and I think we'll talk more about that in May."

We are very under penetrated in Mainland China and I think we all know that over time, will be the significant opportunity. And I believe that over time, Mainland China will dwarf anything that we have today as we start at day one. And I think what Tracey said earlier, is our reporting of that business will be primarily reported through our Retail segment because the actual operating model over there really closely mirrors our Retail business. It really isn't as similar to a Wholesale business. It's where we buy the product, we own the product, we staff the stores, we manage the inventory and we're responsible for the results and/or we have our own standalone stores. So I think the current business, as well as the future business, will have characteristics that are more similar to our retail business than a wholesale business where you  sell in, they own the product, they sell it, they staff the stores and then there's a wholesale margin. So as we go forward and as a matter fact, we opened a store in Macau last week, we have two additional stores opening shortly, we will begin to manage the real estate process, future store locations and sites and our orientation will be more heavily to Mainland China than the current network of stores we've acquired."

I think there is a shift going on in Japan that has significant long-range consequences. It's a market that has been dominated by department store distribution, very intense sales per square foot. Shop-in-shops, either directly controlled by the brand or closely controlled by the brand. And that's been our primary channel of distribution. Since we acquired the business, we've obviously been focused on improving that and then integrating the Japanese business into our infrastructure, our supply chain and collapsing the three licensed entities into one. But going forward, I think we're going to have to look not only at the traditional channel of distribution but more mono-brand distribution as we see that market evolving. There is also a movement in Japan that is clear that has the pure luxury player suffering and customers looking for value, looking for faster fashion, looking for more youthful presentations, that trend is clear. And I think we're well-positioned given our brand architecture to address many of those opportunities going forward. So I don't think it's going to be an easy market in its traditional sense. But it is the second-largest luxury market in the world and I think we've started, we've made the progress. We're picking up share as you've said.

The recession and economic issues were felt there but perhaps not as strongly as it was felt here. The question is whether it will last longer or whether there's a double dip in Europe but I don't think anybody knows. Our strategy, which has included, a network of our own stores, shop-in-shops in department stores and specialty stores, continues to be the backbone of what we're doing. But what we are seeing is a contraction in the small specialty store, many of which did not fair well in the economic downturn. And we've made decisions where we did not want to ship people who might be in more difficult financial straits. We've also as we've begun to improve our network of stores, have reduced distribution of some of those smaller stores in key markets. We continue to invest in shop-in-shops in department stores and we'll use where we're putting flagships down for instance in Paris this April. We will hover around that presentation of key product lines in the department stores or specialty stores in that market as well. I think we've talked past using London as an example where we have our own stores both flagship and neighborhood, it also happens to be where we've got tremendous positioning in department stores. We are doing that now in Paris. We opened a second store last October, we'll open a third store this April. That will be a terrific representation of the brand. At the same time, we are trying to elevate the market around it to work successfully in London. It worked successfully in Milan and we're now doing that in Paris. So I think our strategy is very clear in Europe. And I think as we've elevated the brand, I think today the brand is not only large, successful and profitable, I think it's viewed in a different light.

I think as we talked about Europe, we are about a year into the launch of Lauren Sportswear. As we continue to learn and understand that business, an example would be an opportunity to extend accessory categories or other product extensions in that market, once we've established the distribution points that are appropriate. So we let the business grow incrementally as we move out. I think the same thing over time will apply in Asia as we look to broaden and deepen the portfolio of labels that are distributed in those points of distribution. So we're looking forward to doing that but we're looking forward to doing in a way that we hope we'll be successful. I think the footwear example here in the United States as you all know, we bought back that license several years ago. We put it through a rehabilitation. We have to develop the sourcing, manufacturing, supply-chain, to be experts in that. We've got a terrific team of leadership folks at both the Ralph Lauren collection level, as well as the Lauren level and we're gaining market share and points of distribution on a worldwide basis, that's all very exciting and it's encouraging to us as we now are on the cusp of broadening the assortment of handbags.

362220,104778158,62208,"Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, May-19-2010",2010-05-19,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be reporting outstanding fourth quarter and full year results this morning, results that exceeded our expectations on virtually every operating metric and that reflect significant broad-based pr",2606,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be reporting outstanding fourth quarter and full year results this morning, results that exceeded our expectations on virtually every operating metric and that reflect significant broad-based progress across products, channels and geographies. 
The year was filled with some tremendous milestones for our company, including major strides in our international growth objectives as we assumed direct control of important Asian operations; made considerable progress with our accessory development efforts, retailing our first watch collections and having our first market for Lauren handbags; and we prepared for the opening of several important flagship stores in key global markets.
And in spite of this high level of reinvestment back into our company, we substantially improved our profitability, with gross profit margins expanding 380 basis points to a record annual level of 58.2% and earnings growing 18%. All during a period of considerable global turbulence that represented some of the most challenging issues our industry has ever had to face.
And our fiscal 2010 results are not a function of easy comparisons. They come on top of gross margin expansion and EPS growth in fiscal '09, which was yet another outstanding year for us, considering broader market conditions and our sustained level of investments back into our business.
There is no question that this remarkable performance was in fact years in the making. It comes as a direct result of our selective investment and the consistent seeding and sequencing of our strategic growth initiatives. We are leveraging efficiency gains in certain areas of the business to support growth opportunities in other areas, diversifying our operations on multiple levels in terms of brands, products, channel of distribution and geography.
Of course, our results also reflect the strength of our brand, the desirability of our products and the intense proactive operational discipline that runs through our organization, from supply chain and logistics to other corporate functions as well as to our strategic merchandising initiatives and meticulous store level management. 
The fourth quarter dynamics also suggest something of an inflection point of change in the marketplace. Worldwide, we are seeing our core luxury customers returning to the stores with an openness to spend. While they are not spending at prerecession levels and they can be focused on value, they do recognize that product availability is limited, and there is no price resistance on unique or novel items.
We also saw things get progressively better every month during the fourth quarter, and the rebound has been most pronounced in our women's products. Urban and tourist destinations are outperforming stores that cater to more regional or local customers. The dedication and hard work of our teams around the world are the other critical ingredients of our success. 
During the last 90 days, we have traveled to Europe, Asia and the Middle East and met with our teams. Their drive for excellence and desire to raise the bar on their own performance is inspiring. I believe our performance over the last two years and in particular, fiscal '10, demonstrates the unique competitive advantage for us. 
Our organizations care about every single detail of our business and work to maximize each and every opportunity and/or challenge. We are managing a tremendously complex and multifaceted mosaic across an astoundingly disparate disciplines. But we are united in our goal of elevating our brand, communicating our rich heritage and core values of quality, consistency, honesty and teamwork.
There is no better evidence of this than our newly opened Saint Germain flagship in Paris. This project was several years in the making and is our boldest brand statement to date, heralding a new era for us in France, across the Europe and around the world. The store represents the culmination of tremendous progress our company has made over the last decade, from the balance of men's and women's merchandise, the breadth of product categories available, the powerful accessory presentations and the incredible restoration of this historic site.
The richness of the Ralph Lauren brand and its unique lifestyle sensibility is accentuated further by Ralph's, a restaurant house within the store that has fast become one of Paris' chicest restaurants. The store is a true destination that reflects the excellent work of our European team that has repositioned our brand so meticulously over the last decade, resulting in a customer who understands the quality and value of our products. 
In Europe, the fashion expectation of our customers is higher than that in the United States, and we see this across all brands from Collection [Ralph Lauren Collection] to Lauren to Polo Jeans. As we've highlighted in the past, our performance in Europe has been spectacular over the last 10 years, when we've grown revenues fivefold. And the momentum continues to be with us. Notwithstanding the recent economic turmoil, we have a diverse balanced long-term growth strategy throughout the region with early-stage opportunities across brands and product categories. With only 20 directly operated and eight licensed Ralph Lauren stores and 24 factory stores, there is clearly room to expand our direct-to-consumer reach throughout Europe.
And an exciting new evolution on our European growth strategy this year is e-commerce. Based on the success of ralphlauren.com in the United States and the growing importance of this channel worldwide, we intend to launch e-commerce capabilities in Europe beginning with the U.K. this fall. We expect other countries to follow over the next several years. There is no question that the customer around the world increasingly wants to shop online. And those who do tend to be more valuable customers for us, particularly, if they also shop at our brick-and-mortar stores.
While our European e-commerce initiative will be managed in market, we are leveraging our ralphlauren.com team in the United States and our existing technology and distribution partners to help ensure a successful launch. Although the investment we are making will be dilutive in the near term, we are excited about the long-term sales and profit potential of international e-commerce. It is consistent with our overall strategy. And we have had spectacular success with ralphlauren.com's sales and profit in the United States, and we can use that as a benchmark.
Given our commitment to the Asian expansion, we are studying how and when it make sense for us to launch e-commerce capabilities there. In Asia, our focus and primary concentration will be in two countries, Japan and China. 
As you are all aware, the Japanese economic market and retail remain challenging. The once seemingly insatiable appetite for easily identifiable luxury product has evolved into a value-oriented customer with more sophisticated and individualistic mindset. We believe the scope of our various brands and products, supported by the broad iconic vernacular of the Ralph Lauren brand, present us with the unique opportunity to address these cultural changes and to grow in this market. 
We are already experiencing proof of our convictions across various channels of distribution in Japan, where performance at the Omotesando store, at our concession shops and our factory stores is outpacing industry trends, a dynamic that is maintained since taking back control of the market three years ago.  The profitability of our Japanese operations has also improved in the same time period. 
Our Japanese teams have done an excellent job with clienteling, innovative marketing and merchandising initiatives and are consistently receiving strong editorial coverage in leading fashion publications. Our department stores have taken notice, and our near-term focus is on strengthening our partnership with major department store operators to work together to elevate our distribution, enhance merchandise presentations, including new shops for Black Label and accessory products in strategic locations. 
Even though apparel sales in Japanese department stores are contracting, the reality is there's still a lot of footsteps walking through the door. And they are generating very high absolute sales and productivity levels, and we know we can affect change. It will clearly take time for us to realize our goals in Japan, and we will need the economic environment to be more supportive for us to do so, but we are confident the customer's receptivity is ultimately there.
Beyond Japan, we completed our first quarter successfully operating several new transition to Asian markets, greater China being one of them. As you know, we spent much of fiscal 2010 building a world-class organization of over 700 employees and putting in a new infrastructure to support the transformational growth our company expects in the long term.
With the leadership team in place, our strategy now focused on several initiatives, including training our employees, particularly our new sales associates, in our brand standards, refining our understanding of the customers' tastes and preferences, accelerating of distribution of various channels and product categories and elevating our visual presentation of assortments as we layer in new categories. We will simultaneously be supporting all of these efforts with advertising, marketing and public relations initiative to evolve our brand awareness in the region.
Ralph and senior members of our executive leadership team recently toured Southeast Asia, where we met with various constituents including employees, manufacturers, real estate developers and others. Now that we have control of our distribution and the stores are looking better, our goal of elevating the brand has immediately become more tangible. We all came back incredibly inspired by our tremendous growth potential in this important emerging region. 
Today, we directly operate 17 freestanding stores, which are primarily concentrated in Hong Kong; 75 concession shops, which are concentrated in China and Taiwan; and licensing partners operate an additional 34 concessions, primarily in China and the Philippines. We are managing and servicing all these points of distribution seamlessly, which is no small feat considering the unique characteristics of a concession-based selling, where we are offering fresh product locally that sell through at high velocities and really is supported with very small stockrooms.
Our brand elevation and distribution expansion plans are well underway. Since assuming control of the region, we have opened several new concession shops and two freestanding stores, one in the One Central Mall located in the new MGM Grand casino in Macau and another in the new Peninsula Hotel on the Bund in Shanghai. These stores are our first proper luxury presentations in the region, with a balanced mix of men's and women's product and an emphasis on accessories, collection, Purple Label and Black Label merchandise. 
These stores not only help to educate the consumer about who we are as a brand, but they also create excitement in the real estate community among developers who are looking for new and compelling concepts to support their growth. We actually had several of the Asian real estate developers tour our new Paris store, so they could fully appreciate the global scale of our brand development efforts. 
Beyond greater China, our focus in the rest of the newly transitioned countries will mostly be on driving better productivity existing doors through stronger assortments and shop refurbishments. While we certainly expect to grow our sales in this new part of the world at a double-digit rate in the near term, it will take a few years for this region to become a significant driver of our consolidated sales and profit. 
It takes time to find, build and open new locations, and our advertising and marketing efforts will begin in earnest once we have a more developed distribution network. This cadence is consistent with our experience in Europe, which has obviously helped develop us into a large highly profitable region, one where our brand image is impeccable and we have considerable growth opportunities in front of us.
In the United States, we've seen a dramatic rebound in the customer trends compared to last year. As I mentioned earlier, it is the core luxury customer and the return of the international tourist traveler that are driving much of the improvement. The aspirational customer remains cautious and has not returned to the stores in any meaningful way. Nevertheless, our products are performing strongly across channel and categories given the enduring value of our brand and the exceptionally focused and strategic merchandising initiatives. 
This applies to Club Monaco too, as you can see in their strong comps, which far outpaced those of most specialty apparel retailers during the fourth quarter. Thanks to its compelling women's assortment and a revitalized men's offering.
Across our brand portfolio, the U.S. consumer is selectively replenishing basics and adding newness to their wardrobe. We think that our potential in the U.S. given the breadth of our existing distribution, we expect growth to come primarily from sustained market share and productivity gains. We also have new and emerging product categories that are offering compelling incremental opportunity. The most substantial being with accessories. 
We had an encouraging response to our first market for Lauren handbags during the quarter. Our team has developed a truly iconic and differentiated assortment that incorporates a broad range of silhouettes in keeping with the lifestyle orientation of the Lauren brand. The versatility and functionality of the product has garnered accolades from our wholesale customers and fashion editors alike. 
The Lauren handbag product will initially be available in approximately 150 of the best North America department stores and select e-commerce site beginning in August, with additional distribution already being planned for holiday and beyond. Key price points range from $150 to $400, and the introduction will be supported with product-specific advertising, both at the national level and in conjunction with our various wholesale partners. We are excited about the growth potential of our Lauren handbags, particularly in light of the great success of the Lauren footwear.
Clearly, 2010 ended in a very different place than we could have imagined when we're building our plans a year ago. Remaining steadfast in our commitment to investing in our long-term strategic growth initiatives was absolutely the right thing to do. The consistent planting and harvesting of our various growth opportunities enabled us to manage through the toughest environment and drive strong earnings growth.  The talent and discipline that has guided us through these challenging times remain intact as we look to the tremendous potential the future holds for us. 
There is no question that the broader market conditions remain uncertain, from European debt concerns to exchange rate fluctuations, inflationary pressures on cost of goods and the persistent high unemployment. And while these issues will likely have an impact on our near-term results, I believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from any recovery in a global macro environment and their conditions, particularly as we continue to opportunistically invest to support sustained long-term growth and shareholder value creation. 
This is a strong vital organization with a track record of success. And there is no better evidence of that than our fiscal 2010 results. With more than $1.2 billion in cash and investments and net cash more than doubling from fiscal 2009's levels, we are reinvesting back in our business, buying back stock, reducing our debt and we still entered fiscal '11 in exceptional condition. 
With this as a backdrop, we are planning an aggressive acceleration of our investment in growth in fiscal 2011. We are seeding a new crop of opportunities with investments we are making in new flagship locations in our support of Asia and with the growth of international e-commerce. Our organization has never been stronger, and our mission has never been more clear. And as Ralph said in this morning's release, we are all inspired by what the future holds for us. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Tracey to discuss the financial and operational highlights of the fourth quarter as well as our outlook for fiscal 2011."
362220,104778158,62208,"Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, May-19-2010",2010-05-19,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, consolidated net revenues were $1.3 billion or 9% above the prior year. The growth in revenues reflects strong comparable store sales growth for the company's Retail segment, an extra 5",2682,"Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, consolidated net revenues were $1.3 billion or 9% above the prior year. The growth in revenues reflects strong comparable store sales growth for the company's Retail segment, an extra 53rd week of sales due to our April 2 fiscal year end and incremental revenues from newly transitioned Asian operations that were partially offset by a modest decline in wholesale revenue.
The net positive impact of currency translation on our reported revenue growth for the quarter was slightly below 2%. Excluding the 53rd week, which happened to be Easter week for us and represented approximately $70 million in sale, consolidated net revenues for the fourth quarter increased 3%.
Our gross profit rate increased substantially, rising 720 basis points to a record 59%, reflecting disciplined inventory management, improved product mix across all channel, reduced markdowns in our retail stores and continued supply-chain savings. 
Operating expenses in the fourth quarter were approximately 4% greater than the prior-year period. The higher operating expenses reflect the incremental costs associated with business expansions, including our newly transitioned Asian operations as well as higher incentive compensation accrual.
Operating income for the fourth quarter was $172 million, 58% better than the prior-year period when adjusting for fiscal 2009 impairment and restructuring charges. Our operating income also showed considerable improvement, reaching 12.8% from an adjusted 8.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The improvement in operating income and margin rate is primarily attributable to the improved gross profit rate.
Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 increased 32% to $114 million from an adjusted $87 million in the prior-year period, and net income per diluted share rose 31% to $1.13 from an adjusted $0.86 in prior-year period. The growth in net income and net income per diluted share principally relates to the higher operating income I just discussed, that was partially offset by higher taxes this year compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 when the company actually had a net tax benefit.
Before I discuss our segment level performance, I'd first like to provide you with a brief recap of how our actual results exceeded the previous expectations we outlined for you back in early February. Generally speaking, the upside was broad based, although the largest portion came from the strong performance of our Retail segment worldwide, where both comparable store sales trends and the gross profit margin were substantially ahead of our expectations, especially in the United States, where we experienced improved traffic trends, higher full-priced sales conversion, the return of some of our tourist customers and outstanding .com performance.
Our domestic and Japanese Wholesale operations also delivered stronger sales and profit contribution. The dilution associated with our newly transitioned Asian operation was in line with the $0.08 to $0.10 per share we provided you in February. 
Before I begin the segment highlights for the quarter, as you read in this morning's press release, we are now reporting our Japan concession shops sales and profits, which had previously been captured in our Wholesale segment, in our Retail segment. This reclassification essentially affects about half of our sales in Japan this year. We made this change in our operating reporting results to better reflect the direct selling, expense and inventory ownership dynamics of the concession model, particularly since it is also an important channel for our newly transitioned Asian operations. You can see that this reclassification had no impact on our previously reported consolidated sales, margin and net income or EPS figures.
Now moving on to our segment highlights for the fourth quarter. Let's begin with our Wholesale division, where sales declined 3% to $736 million, reflecting lower global apparel shipments that were partially offset by higher footwear sales, particularly for our men's Polo brand. While aggregate shipments were down, we experienced progressive improvement from the third quarter, which reflects a more stable environment among our Wholesale customers worldwide. 
Consistent with what we've observed over the last several quarters at Retail, our core apparel products continued to outperform overall store and department trends, and we experienced favorable basic stock replenishment trends across many product categories. We transitioned to spring a few weeks early and smoothly across most product categories, and the iconic appeal of our focused merchandising strategies has helped to drive our relative outperformance.
We also had incremental distribution related to our new RLX active apparel line and to our Winter Olympics merchandise, both of which were well received. Chaps exceeded sales plans, and American Living continues to generate solid sell-throughs on reduced inventory. 
In Europe, we continued to experience broad-based strength at key accounts across the region with notable growth in France, Germany and the U.K. and signs of stabilization in Italy. In Japan, our men's business remains very strong albeit on a relative basis. And we experienced improved trends for our women's Blue Label and Black Label products during the quarter.
Our fourth quarter Wholesale operating income was $183 million, and the operating margin rate was 24.9% or 280 basis points greater than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The higher wholesale operating margin rate was primarily a result of improved wholesale segment gross profit; a function of product mix, particularly with the basic stock replenishment merchandising stronger footwear margins; supply chain benefits; and disciplined inventory management. In addition, focused expense management helped to offset higher costs related to business expansion and new product development initiatives.
For our Retail group, fourth quarter sales rose 31% to $554 million, reflecting a substantial increase in comp store sales at our freestanding stores worldwide; the benefit of a 53rd week of sales, which, again being Easter, was a high-volume week; and the contribution from a newly assumed Asian store and concession shop business. Higher ralphlauren.com revenues also contributed to the fourth quarter strong Retail segment growth rate. 
Overall comp store sale, which are presented on a comparable 13-week-to-13-week basis and include reclassified Japanese concession shops, increased 16%, reflecting 17% growth at Ralph Lauren stores, a 9% increase in factory stores and a 29% increase at Club Monaco stores. ralphlauren.com sales increased 39% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Comp growth was primarily achieved through higher average dollar transaction values, mostly due to greater full-priced selling activity and significantly reduced clearance inventory level.
Traffic to our U.S. stores declined modestly during the quarter, although strong gains among international tourists have partially offset the lower level of activity among domestic customers. The momentum at ralphlauren.com was supported by double-digit growth in traffic and a higher conversion rate, thanks to strong merchandising assortment and interest in our Olympics-related merchandise. Easter selling was also strong on ralphlauren.com. And at Club Monaco, expanded on-trend fashion assortment supported broad-based gains across all women's categories. 
In Europe, geographic trends at our Ralph Lauren stores remain consistent with those we have articulated over the last several quarters, with the U.K. and Scandinavia remaining strong and some improvement in Italy. European factory stores have maintained their broad-based strength across regions. 
In Japan, comp trends at our Omotesando flagship store and at our factory stores were quite robust and clearly outperformed the broader retail market. Our concession shop performance was also noteworthy, particularly for our men's products. As expected, sales for our newly transitioned Asian stores and concession shops were somewhat inhibited by a lack of excess fall holiday clearance inventory for most of the fourth quarter, although we are pleased with the current product sales mix for spring, which is better aligned with our strategic brand initiatives.
During the fourth quarter, we opened three directly operated freestanding stores, closed two directly operated freestanding stores and assumed control of 16 freestanding stores in Asia, ending the year with 350 company-operated freestanding stores. We also operated 281 concession shop locations throughout Asia, mostly Japan, at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.
Our Retail segment operating income was $18 million compared to an adjusted loss of $28 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The market improvement in Retail segment profitability reflects a substantial increase in comparable store sales and gross profit rate at all of our freestanding stores worldwide, primarily as a result of higher full-priced sales and lower clearance inventory, as mentioned previously, as well as a disciplined operational management. The favorable profit margin dynamics of ralphlauren.com also contributed to improved Retail segment profitability. Partially offsetting the Retail segment profit improvement were expenses associated with our newly transitioned Asian operations. 
Licensing royalties for the quarter were $47 million, equivalent with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 as higher domestic product licensing revenues were offset by a decline in international and home licensing revenues. However, operating income for our Licensing segment increased 36% to $34 million reflecting lower net costs associated with the transition of former-licensed Asian operations to directly controlled operations.
With approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments and $940 million in net cash at the end of the year, which is more than double fiscal 2009's level, our financial condition remains strong. The fourth quarter ended with inventory down 4% from the prior-year period, and that does include the inventory associated with our newly transitioned Asian operations and the eight net new stores we added over the last year. Our return on equity for fiscal 2010 was 18%, and our return on investment was 33%.
Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2010 was $907 million, 17% greater than fiscal 2009, reflecting higher net income and improved working capital management. We spent approximately $201 million on CapEx during fiscal 2010 to support new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares of stock at an average price of $78, utilizing $78 million of our current authorization. For the full year fiscal 2010 period we repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares of Class A common stock, utilizing approximately $216 million of our authorized share repurchase program. And at the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately $550 million remaining under our authorized share repurchase program, inclusive of a new $275 million authorization recently approved by the company's Board of Directors that we announced in this morning's earnings release.
We are obviously very pleased with our strong fourth quarter and full year result. The operational management and financial discipline that characterizes our company has enabled us to maximize sales and margin opportunities to mitigate the impact of the global recession in a remarkable manner. 
There are however, a few macroeconomic dynamics that present some considerable challenges for us in this fiscal year. One of the most impactful is currency exchange rates, particularly for the euro. Comparing yesterday's EUR 1.22 per $1 rate to the average 1.4 rate we experienced in fiscal 2010, which is a 13% decline, there is obviously a substantial translation impact. 
Based on our geographic sales mix, we currently anticipate approximately 250 to 300 basis points of negative currency translation on our sales, a portion of which will flow through to profits for the full year fiscal 2011 period, with more pronounced pressure related to exchange rates in the back half of the year. There is an additional and approximately equivalent amount of unfavorable transaction exchange rate impact on our operating profits in fiscal 2011.
Another profit headwind is higher sourcing costs, which we are beginning to experience with rising raw material, freight and labor expenses as well as tightened factory and freight capacity in our global supply chain. Historically, we have generally been successful in our efforts to contain cost of goods inflation, although we appear to be up against the perfect storm in the back half of fiscal 2011, particularly with our spring 2011 merchandise delivery.
As Roger mentioned, given the resilience of our performance and our strong financial condition, we intend to accelerate our investment in our strategic growth initiatives during fiscal 2011, particularly with our international expansion and direct-to-consumer efforts. We expect to incur higher expenses as a result. Among these is incremental costs associated with our newly transitioned Asian operations, which will be most pronounced in the first half of this year. Our investment in new flagship stores around the world and the launch of international e-commerce are also expected to be dilutive in the near term.
In this morning's press release, we provided our initial outlook for the year, which I'd like to review with you now. For the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we currently expect consolidated net revenues to increase at a low double-digit rate. Our expectations are based on low double-digit growth in global wholesale shipments, with increases across all major regions, and high single-digit comps, which now include our Japanese concession shop locations, on a comparable basis. 
As a reminder, revenues for our newly assumed Asian operations are primarily reported in our Retail segment, and those will be incremental sales compared to the prior-year period. Our operating margin for the first quarter is expected to be modestly above the 11.4% achieved in the prior-year period, with gross margin improvement being mostly offset by higher operating expense deleverage related to the continued investment in our various strategic growth initiatives across geographies, distribution channels and emerging product categories. 
For the full year fiscal 2011 period, we expect consolidated revenues to increase at a mid single-digit rate, led by our Retail segment, and mitigated by a low double-digit decline in Licensing revenues, which clearly reflects the impact of our assuming more direct control over certain product categories and geographies.
As a reminder, our revenue growth outlook for fiscal 2011 is for a 52-week period and compares with fiscal 2010's 53-week period. We currently expect to achieve a low double-digit operating margin rate in fiscal 2011. The net effect of gross margin pressure that is more back-half weighted and a modest deleveraging of operating expenses that is more front-half weighted, as we are currently forecasting a modest leveraging of our operating expenses in the second half of the year. Our fiscal 2011 tax rate is expected to be 34%. Again as a reminder, our fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 tax rates were advantaged by the favorable resolution of certain non-recurring discrete tax items that we do not expect to have this year.
The higher level of investments that is flowing through the P&L is also reflected in our capital spending plan. We are planning approximately $280 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 to support our retail, wholesale and infrastructure investments and initiatives that Roger and I have outlined on this call today. About half of our capital as allocated for 15 to 20 new stores and shops, including a new 30,000 square foot flagship location to showcase our women's and home's collection merchandise across from the Rhinelander Mansion on 72nd and Madison Avenue in New York City. We are simultaneously renovating the former women's and home floor at the Mansion to accommodate additional men's merchandise, including RRL. We believe this expanded square footage for our men's, women's and home products allows us to properly showcase the breadth and scope of the world of Ralph Lauren in a manner that will resonate globally. Much of the incremental capital investment versus fiscal 2010 is also concentrated in Asia and for our global infrastructure. In fact, our capital spending in Asia is forecast to double this year in order to support our expanded distribution. As we have indicated before, a growing portion of our capital investment over the next several years will be allocated to international markets.
I'd like to reiterate that we are making this high level of reinvestment back in the business because we are confident it will deliver appreciable returns over the long term. Our conviction stems from the success we've had with this strategy in the past and, especially in light of what we have been able to achieve over the last two years, and our reporting on this call this morning. We've had a lot to tell you thus far. At this point, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist with that?"

So we'll try to stay on the call a little bit extra time to make sure we get in as many questions as we can.  To specifically answer your question, Omar, I think you heard us talk about even in a difficult environment, we generated over $900 million of operating cash flow this year. So to bump up the capital from $200 million to $280 million, for us, is still a very cautious statement about use of funds. And we think is justified given our long-term strategies to develop 2/3 of our business outside the U.S. versus approximately 1/3 it is now. In fact, Europe has its ups and downs, and Asia has its ups and downs and so does the United States to be fair. But the things we're choosing to spend on, which are systems, technology, infrastructure, logistics and distribution as a base and then on top of that, shop in shops, freestanding stores or other direct-to-customer initiatives, we have to believe are the right long-term strategies to get at these opportunities. Do we try to move them around globally or sequence them a little bit differently given our own point of view about the next two or three years in the market? The answer is yes. But I think you can count on us for the next couple of years to spend at higher levels of capital with more than half of that going into the international markets. And given our track record, which says we have an ROI north of 30% consistently, I think we've done a good job of earning against those investments. So it's going to take a little bit more than the current headwinds to slow us down meaningfully. But we'll try to be thoughtful."

It's fair to say that our product has sold through well at retail and we continue to enjoy good market share gains this spring. So while the retailer is cautious and I think has fallen a little bit in love with this lower inventory level, improves their margin scenario. And I think they're looking for manufacturers to be able to chase and react or replenishment a little bit more than upfront buy than they did in the past, we are beginning to see some opportunities to get incremental Wholesale business, somewhat offset by the currency exchanges that Tracey talked about. Because as you know, a lot of the Wholesale business in Europe, at least at the moment, will be flying into a pretty significant exchange rate issue. But under the heading of a worldwide reaction, we've had terrific Men's business and we seem to be picking up share. The Lauren business has gained strength as we've gone through the year. We're enjoying a good spring in kids. We've had tremendous growth in some of our new businesses like Footwear and Dresses. And that's part of what's giving us a good feeling about the Lauren handbag launch that's being carefully done, and will be available for sale in August. We're all very anxious to see how the customer react to that product. We think it looks good, the retailer think it looks good and they're obviously buying several seasons out already. So we think that is an opportunity for us in sort of a Non-Comp Wholesale business. So I think the retailer is cautious, I think they're going to continue to look to speed up their inventory turns. But we are trying to maximize every opportunity where appropriate."

We don't do that much business in Portugal. But Spain, Italy and some of the Southern tiers. Some of that is the macroeconomic issues there. And some of it recently, quite frankly, has been affected by this volcanic cloud, which has dramatically altered the tourist patterns in Europe, both in and intra-Europe; both people who were caught or are concerned about being caught. So there's a huge slowdown in the last month or six weeks based on that in tourist destinations. But fundamentally, the Wholesale business again, in a constant-currency measurement is holding up nicely. We're seeing increases in most of the core brands."

So those customers that are coming in, we're converting more of them to a sale and we're getting a higher sale from them. And we've modeled really, until proven otherwise, that's the rest of the year in the Ralph Lauren format. Club Monaco is experiencing higher traffic, higher conversion and higher average unit sale. And I think you could tell that in the 29% comp that we just reported on a comparable-calendar basis is extraordinary. And that's really just great product. We are seeing online, increased traffic. It's not really footsteps, I guess, that's not the vocabulary you use, but we are seeing growth in customer there and higher average unit sale. And I think that's reflected in the 39% comp that we reported for online. The other piece of it, which you didn't ask but I think is interesting is, the relatively small amount of crossover between the online shopper and the brick-and-mortar shopper. We continue to watch this carefully. We continue to try to educate ourselves about how this is unfolding. And while we're learning a lot and it's got a little bit of movement in it, it's probably less than you would instinctively believe. The other piece of that, that I find interesting is that about 25% of our traffic on the site is coming from international customers who are not able to shop but are going through the website for information and product knowledge. And that is giving us some encouragement for our launch later in the fall with e-commerce in Europe."

But let me answer your questions. We have absolutely made a dramatic sea change in the way goods are sourced and moved around the globe. And we were just talking with our Board the other day. In the last 10 years, we've raised our gross margins 950 basis points. So this is not really a one-year spike to either a quarter record or an annual record, quite frankly. This has been a strategic weapon that we've had as a company year after year, brick after brick. And with the number of brands and the complexity in the 85 countries we ship to, this has absolutely turned into a key differentiator. Having said that, last year, because of the worldwide slowdown, there were some unique opportunities in availability or production of raw materials or transportation that allowed us to accelerate the margin beyond even our plans or expectation. They are not a function of us raising prices. They really are a function of us elevating quality but managing cost of goods and then obviously the merchandising initiatives and planning initiatives helped the sell-throughs, which reduced markdowns. So going forward, our belief is we are not looking to pass on cost of good increase to the customer. We don't think the market at this point is looking for that, particularly with customers still wanting to think about a value purchase. So we will be facing, as Tracey talked about, cost of good increases in raw materials and transportation, more because capacity has been taken out of the marketplace. There are plains in the desert being mothballed and there are ships sitting idle, and so the ones that are working are looking for increases as those people are looking to repair their margins from the devastation of the last two years. But our long-term margin objectives are to maintain the highest quality and service level but maximize the gross profit potential. Over a 10-year period, that has been a very important part of our economic success. And it has allowed us to generate incremental profit that we have used to reinvest back into the business and take on a lot of other initiatives. We've developed expertise in product categories that in the past, many people thought we couldn't do like Women's or Footwear or now, Accessories as we were labeled very narrowly a men's company. And I think that's proven obviously not to be true. So as we look to take on production in Japan, which obviously was put a third-party when it was licensed, when we take on the production of Asia, or new product categories like Lauren handbags, I think gross margin and gross margin expansion over a long term is something we focus on. However, in the short run, there are some real headwinds as we look to price the back half of the year. And we'll just have to deal with it. But I don't believe we're going to be able to look to pass that out of consumer. I think that would be a short-term decision that would be a long-term mistake."

But what type of operating margin flow-through from that negative variance in sales due to currency should we expect?

Women's as a category, had been tough for a couple of years as I think the female customer was bouncing back and forth between career and casual. And I think some of the sense of more women working at home, meaning less casual clothes, maybe not the fashion trends to stimulate buying. I think we're beginning to feel that the Women's business is not only strengthening at retail but across multiple price points. So whether it's the higher-end business or whether it's the Lauren business or quite frankly, for us, the Club Monaco business, product that's a little sexier, product that's a little more feminine, product that's a little more novel, all of which seemed to be getting a good reaction from the customer. Also, the business which had migrated mostly to casual and denim, we're seeing strengthening in more of the wear-to-work product. Some of that's coming through in dresses, where the women has now for several years accepted the dress as a viable alternative. And some of that is coming through in more polished products. So we're encouraged because that's a big business that the industry has struggled with. And although I think prices have been sharpened and I think there's a real consciousness about value at any of those prices, the blood of inventory is behind the industry. There is more product scarcity. I think that's allowing people to command more original retails. And I think that's all healthy. So as we head into fall and into the back half of the year, we are expecting that to continue. I've also seen some of the reports about the Home trends, now that's encouraging. That's another business that has trailed for some number of years. Some of that is embedded in the housing starts and the problems in the mortgage markets. Some of it's been those generally are bigger-ticket decisions and those have been deferred. Some of the disruption in the market with some major retail chains going out of business and liquidating inventory, I think has depressed that market. But I think as the channel has settled down and as the consumer has delayed purchasing, we're beginning to see at retail, some signs of that customer looking for some fresh fashion, whether it's freshening a master bedroom, or whether it's redoing a dining room or whether some of the firming in the real estate values is causing people to freshen their homes. We are seeing that begin to happen and we're encouraged. I think we'd like to see more of it over a longer period of time. But for now, it does seem to be firming and that's a good sign.

Finding a key, I'm going to use the word, flagship locations in the handful of key cities in Tokyo, was extremely difficult. So those opportunities don't come around everyday and they're not easy to find. But we do have our eyes and ears open for something that's appropriate.

But we're trying to get our arms around the existing distribution network, the in-shop presentations, which has Tracey has talked to you about, the conversion into concession models really mean we're buying the goods, we're staffing the stores, we're outfitting the shops and we're responsible for the inventory. So we are learning daily about the Japanese customer through that network of hundreds of doors. And I think we will eventually be taking that learning and use it to complement our own network with that. Separately, perhaps a higher priority is our own network of stores in the Asia-Pacific region, including China, Hong Kong and some of the countries, where there is not a robust department store channel and we will have to build our own network of stores over time in order to get the infrastructure supported and the distribution that we're desiring. So I would put it a little lower on the priority of freestanding stores in Asia Pac and I would put it a little bit under the heading of learnings now that we're running these businesses vertically in Japan until we translate that into store locations."

We'll have a kid's concession store. So really, unlike our own stores where we integrate and mix brands around Ralph's vision, the Department Store business in Japan and Asia at the moment in the concession locations, are very much one-brand oriented. And then within that, there've been very much key items, basics and commodity items. So our first step in the process is really to represent a broader range of offerings and fashions in those categories. We will then try to get some of those shops repositioned to get better adjacencies to where the brand is today versus where it might have been 10 years ago when some of those locations were invested in. And we will try to add to that, higher-end products, which traditionally has not been well represented in Japan, Asia-Pacific in general. So it's upgrading of fashion, content. It's an upgrading of price points. We're not going to walk away from the core items or the core basics. But we'll give them slightly less visual representation and up the brands inclusion of fashion and movement. I think we've felt that the business has looked a little static in that part of the world, as licensees historically pursue the most simple product and the basic products. We'll wrap around that over time ongoing efforts to elevate public relations and marketing, which we think are critical. One of the interesting facts that we received when Ralph and I and the rest -- some of the senior management team were in Asia, is how consistently we heard customers there getting their brand and product information from the Internet. And so part of the connection for us in moving our brand in Asia over time, will be the ability to communicate to the customer through the online experience. And I think that will be a high focus for us as we try to remix our brand phase in that market and how to get that message out. You can get that message out online a lot faster than regional magazines, or billboards, or regional newspapers or any other media. So that's an important learning for us as we try to go forward."

I believe that the last 18 months' difficult environment has caused all retailers, whether they are internal to Polo or whether they're our wholesale partners, to be more cautious about inventory planning and to be focused on trying to sell through more at full price and turn the inventory faster. I think that is a piece of what every retailer today is looking to do. That then has to be coupled with appropriate sales planning because if your sales exceeds your plans, you're going to be caught short of inventory and obviously, if you miss sales, you're going to be hung with product that needs to be marked down. So I think what's happening is from point of manufacturer to ordering to delivery, there's a lot of pressure on the entire supply chain to be very precise about the level of inventory and the sell-throughs. Our inventory, despite the sales increase is down, and another one of those facts that we sort of stumbled onto over the last 10 years, we've added $3 billion in sales and we only have increased inventory by $110 million at Polo Ralph Lauren. So that's a startling piece of our management effort that it only took us $110 million more inventory 10 years later to add $3 billion of sales. So I think we're all getting smarter. I think we're all getting more demanding. And I think we know that what we can't do is get the customer excess inventory to pick through at discounted prices, because based on her prior experience, if they continue to believe that's possible, they're going to wait and wait and wait until the products are marked down. So I think our partners are being more careful. I think we're being more careful and I think that puts pressure on subjects like replenishment or chasing hot product if it's possible, if it's raw materials, then availability of production. But most of the wholesale models were not built on large amounts of it. So this is something that's just beginning to evolve as perhaps a longer-term trend, which will put pressure on the upfront ordering and put more pressure on the supply chain to chase demand dictated by the customer. So at this point, I appreciate it. I'm sorry, I have run 15 minutes late. I just thought the fourth quarter and the full year deserve a little fulsome conversation. Hope we've had the chance to answer all your questions. Thank you for your support. If you've got follow-up questions, Jim and Tracey can attempt to answer them during the day. It's been an incredible year for us. We're very proud of it and the results we achieved, and we're very mindful of what the next 12 months hold for us in terms of challenges. So thank you for listening."

We're pleased to be reporting outstanding fourth quarter and full year results this morning, results that exceeded our expectations on virtually every operating metric and that reflect significant broad-based pr",2606,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be reporting outstanding fourth quarter and full year results this morning, results that exceeded our expectations on virtually every operating metric and that reflect significant broad-based progress across products, channels and geographies. 
The year was filled with some tremendous milestones for our company, including major strides in our international growth objectives as we assumed direct control of important Asian operations; made considerable progress with our accessory development efforts, retailing our first watch collections and having our first market for Lauren handbags; and we prepared for the opening of several important flagship stores in key global markets.
And in spite of this high level of reinvestment back into our company, we substantially improved our profitability, with gross profit margins expanding 380 basis points to a record annual level of 58.2% and earnings growing 18%. All during a period of considerable global turbulence that represented some of the most challenging issues our industry has ever had to face.
And our fiscal 2010 results are not a function of easy comparisons. They come on top of gross margin expansion and EPS growth in fiscal '09, which was yet another outstanding year for us, considering broader market conditions and our sustained level of investments back into our business.
There is no question that this remarkable performance was in fact years in the making. It comes as a direct result of our selective investment and the consistent seeding and sequencing of our strategic growth initiatives. We are leveraging efficiency gains in certain areas of the business to support growth opportunities in other areas, diversifying our operations on multiple levels in terms of brands, products, channel of distribution and geography.
Of course, our results also reflect the strength of our brand, the desirability of our products and the intense proactive operational discipline that runs through our organization, from supply chain and logistics to other corporate functions as well as to our strategic merchandising initiatives and meticulous store level management. 
The fourth quarter dynamics also suggest something of an inflection point of change in the marketplace. Worldwide, we are seeing our core luxury customers returning to the stores with an openness to spend. While they are not spending at prerecession levels and they can be focused on value, they do recognize that product availability is limited, and there is no price resistance on unique or novel items.
We also saw things get progressively better every month during the fourth quarter, and the rebound has been most pronounced in our women's products. Urban and tourist destinations are outperforming stores that cater to more regional or local customers. The dedication and hard work of our teams around the world are the other critical ingredients of our success. 
During the last 90 days, we have traveled to Europe, Asia and the Middle East and met with our teams. Their drive for excellence and desire to raise the bar on their own performance is inspiring. I believe our performance over the last two years and in particular, fiscal '10, demonstrates the unique competitive advantage for us. 
Our organizations care about every single detail of our business and work to maximize each and every opportunity and/or challenge. We are managing a tremendously complex and multifaceted mosaic across an astoundingly disparate disciplines. But we are united in our goal of elevating our brand, communicating our rich heritage and core values of quality, consistency, honesty and teamwork.
There is no better evidence of this than our newly opened Saint Germain flagship in Paris. This project was several years in the making and is our boldest brand statement to date, heralding a new era for us in France, across the Europe and around the world. The store represents the culmination of tremendous progress our company has made over the last decade, from the balance of men's and women's merchandise, the breadth of product categories available, the powerful accessory presentations and the incredible restoration of this historic site.
The richness of the Ralph Lauren brand and its unique lifestyle sensibility is accentuated further by Ralph's, a restaurant house within the store that has fast become one of Paris' chicest restaurants. The store is a true destination that reflects the excellent work of our European team that has repositioned our brand so meticulously over the last decade, resulting in a customer who understands the quality and value of our products. 
In Europe, the fashion expectation of our customers is higher than that in the United States, and we see this across all brands from Collection [Ralph Lauren Collection] to Lauren to Polo Jeans. As we've highlighted in the past, our performance in Europe has been spectacular over the last 10 years, when we've grown revenues fivefold. And the momentum continues to be with us. Notwithstanding the recent economic turmoil, we have a diverse balanced long-term growth strategy throughout the region with early-stage opportunities across brands and product categories. With only 20 directly operated and eight licensed Ralph Lauren stores and 24 factory stores, there is clearly room to expand our direct-to-consumer reach throughout Europe.
And an exciting new evolution on our European growth strategy this year is e-commerce. Based on the success of ralphlauren.com in the United States and the growing importance of this channel worldwide, we intend to launch e-commerce capabilities in Europe beginning with the U.K. this fall. We expect other countries to follow over the next several years. There is no question that the customer around the world increasingly wants to shop online. And those who do tend to be more valuable customers for us, particularly, if they also shop at our brick-and-mortar stores.
While our European e-commerce initiative will be managed in market, we are leveraging our ralphlauren.com team in the United States and our existing technology and distribution partners to help ensure a successful launch. Although the investment we are making will be dilutive in the near term, we are excited about the long-term sales and profit potential of international e-commerce. It is consistent with our overall strategy. And we have had spectacular success with ralphlauren.com's sales and profit in the United States, and we can use that as a benchmark.
Given our commitment to the Asian expansion, we are studying how and when it make sense for us to launch e-commerce capabilities there. In Asia, our focus and primary concentration will be in two countries, Japan and China. 
As you are all aware, the Japanese economic market and retail remain challenging. The one seemingly insatiable appetite for easily identifiable luxury product has evolved into a value-oriented customer with more sophisticated and individualistic mindset. We believe the scope of our various brands and products, supported by the broad iconic vernacular of the Ralph Lauren brand, present us with the unique opportunity to address these cultural changes and to grow in this market. 
We are already experiencing proof of our conviction across various channels of distribution in Japan, where performance at the Omotesando store, at our concession shops and our factory stores is outpacing industry trends, a dynamic that is maintained since taking back control of the market three years ago.  The profitability of our Japanese operations has also improved in the same time period. 
Our Japanese teams have done an excellent job with clienteling, innovative marketing and merchandising initiatives and are consistently receiving strong editorial coverage in leading fashion publications. Our department stores have taken notice, and our near-term focus is on strengthening our partnership with major department store operators to work together to elevate our distribution, enhance merchandise presentations, including new shops for Black Label and accessory products in strategic locations. 
Even though apparel sales in Japanese department stores are contracting, the reality is there's still a lot of footsteps walking through the door. And they are generating very high absolute sales and productivity levels, and we know we can affect change. It will clearly take time for us to realize our goals in Japan, and we will need the economic environment to be more supportive for us to do so, but we are confident the customer receptivity is ultimately there.
Beyond Japan, we completed our first quarter successfully operating several new transition to Asian markets, greater China being one of them. As you know, we spent much of fiscal 2010 building a world-class organization of over 700 employees and putting in a new infrastructure to support the transformational growth our company expects in the long term.
With the leadership team in place, our strategy now focused on several initiatives, including training our employees, particularly our new sales associates, in our brand standards, refining our understanding of the customers' tastes and preferences, accelerating of distribution of various channels and product categories and elevating our visual presentation of assortments as we layer in new categories. We will simultaneously be supporting all of these efforts with advertising, marketing and public relations initiative to evolve our brand awareness in the region.
Ralph and senior members of our executive leadership team recently toured Southeast Asia, where we met with various constituents including employees, manufacturers, real estate developers and others. Now that we have control of our distribution and the stores are looking better, our goal of elevating the brand has immediately become more tangible. We all came back incredibly inspired by our tremendous growth potential in this important emerging region. 
Today, we directly operate 17 freestanding stores, which are primarily concentrated in Hong Kong; 75 concession shops, which are concentrated in China and Taiwan; and licensing partners operate an additional 34 concessions, primarily in China and the Philippines. We are managing and servicing all these points of distribution seamlessly, which is no small feat considering the unique characteristics of a concession-based selling, where we are offering fresh product locally that sell through at high velocities and really is supported with very small stockrooms.
Our brand elevation and distribution expansion plans are well underway. Since assuming control of the region, we have opened several new concession shops and two freestanding stores, one in the One Central Mall located in the new MGM Grand casino in Macau and another in the new Peninsula Hotel on the Bund in Shanghai. These stores are our first proper luxury presentations in the region, with a balanced mix of men's and women's product and an emphasis on accessories, collection, Purple Label and Black Label merchandise. 
These stores not only help to educate the consumer about who we are as a brand, but they also create excitement in the real estate community among developers who are looking for new and compelling concepts to support their growth. We actually had several of the Asian real estate developers tour our new Paris store, so they could fully appreciate the global scale of our brand development efforts. 
Beyond greater China, our focus in the rest of the newly transitioned countries will mostly be on driving better productivity existing doors through stronger assortments and shop refurbishments. While we certainly expect to grow our sales in this new part of the world at a double-digit rate in the near term, it will take a few years for this region to become a significant driver of our consolidated sales and profit. 
It takes time to find, build and open new locations, and our advertising and marketing efforts will begin in earnest once we have a more developed distribution network. This cadence is consistent with our experience in Europe, which has obviously helped develop us into a large highly profitable region, one where our brand image is impeccable and we have considerable growth opportunities in front of us.
In the United States, we've seen a dramatic rebound in the customer trends compared to last year. As I mentioned earlier, it is the core luxury customer and the return of the international tourist traveler that are driving much of the improvement. The aspirational customer remains cautious and has not returned to the stores in any meaningful way. Nevertheless, our products are performing strongly across channel and categories given the enduring value of our brand and the exceptionally focused and strategic merchandising initiatives. 
This applies to Club Monaco too, as you can see in their strong comps, which far outpaced those of most specialty apparel retailers during the fourth quarter. Thanks to its compelling women's assortment and a revitalized men's offering.
Across our brand portfolio, the U.S. consumer is selectively replenishing basics and adding newness to their wardrobe. We think that our potential in the U.S. given the breadth of our existing distribution, we expect growth to come primarily from sustained market share and productivity gains. We also have new and emerging product categories that are offering compelling incremental opportunity. The most substantial being with accessories. 
We had an encouraging response to our first market for Lauren handbags during the quarter. Our team has developed a truly iconic and differentiated assortment that incorporates a broad range of silhouettes in keeping with the lifestyle orientation of the Lauren brand. The versatility and functionality of the product has garnered accolades from our wholesale customers and fashion editors alike. 
The Lauren handbag product will initially be available in approximately 150 of the best North America department stores and select e-commerce site beginning in August, with additional distribution already being planned for holiday and beyond. Key price points range from $150 to $400, and the introduction will be supported with product-specific advertising, both at the national level and in conjunction with our various wholesale partners. We are excited about the growth potential of our Lauren handbags, particularly in light of the great success of the Lauren footwear.
Clearly, 2010 ended in a very different place than we could have imagined when we're building our plans a year ago. Remaining steadfast in our commitment to investing in our long-term strategic growth initiatives was absolutely the right thing to do. The consistent planting and harvesting of our various growth opportunities enabled us to manage through the toughest environment and drive strong earnings growth.  The talent and discipline that has guided us through these challenging times remain intact as we look to the tremendous potential the future holds for us. 
There is no question that the broader market conditions remain uncertain, from European debt concerns to exchange rate fluctuations, inflationary pressures on cost of goods and the persistent high unemployment. And while these issues will likely have an impact on our near-term results, I believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from any recovery in a global macro environment and their conditions, particularly as we continue to opportunistically invest to support sustained long-term growth and shareholder value creation. 
This is a strong vital organization with a track record of success. And there is no better evidence of that than our fiscal 2010 results. With more than $1.2 billion in cash and investments and net cash more than doubling from fiscal 2009's levels, we are reinvesting back in our business, buying back stock, reducing our debt and we still entered fiscal '11 in exceptional condition. 
With this as a backdrop, we are planning an aggressive acceleration of our investment in growth in fiscal 2011. We are seeding a new crop of opportunities with investments we are making in new flagship locations in our support of Asia and with the growth of international e-commerce. Our organization has never been stronger, and our mission has never been more clear. And as Ralph said in this morning's release, we are all inspired by what the future holds for us. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Tracey to discuss the financial and operational highlights of the fourth quarter as well as our outlook for fiscal 2011."
362220,104778158,62230,"Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, May-19-2010",2010-05-19,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, consolidated net revenues were $1.3 billion or 9% above the prior year. The growth in revenues reflects strong comparable store sales growth for the company's Retail segment, an extra 5",2682,"Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, consolidated net revenues were $1.3 billion or 9% above the prior year. The growth in revenues reflects strong comparable store sales growth for the company's Retail segment, an extra 53rd week of sales due to our April 2 fiscal year end and incremental revenues from newly transitioned Asian operations that were partially offset by a modest decline in wholesale revenue.
The net positive impact of currency translation on our reported revenue growth for the quarter was slightly below 2%. Excluding the 53rd week, which happened to be Easter week for us and represented approximately $70 million in sale, consolidated net revenues for the fourth quarter increased 3%.
Our gross profit rate increased substantially, rising 720 basis points to a record 59%, reflecting disciplined inventory management, improved product mix across all channel, reduced markdowns in our retail stores and continued supply-chain savings. 
Operating expenses in the fourth quarter were approximately 4% greater than the prior-year period. The higher operating expenses reflect the incremental costs associated with business expansions, including our newly transitioned Asian operations as well as higher incentive compensation accrual.
Operating income for the fourth quarter was $172 million, 58% better than the prior-year period when adjusting for fiscal 2009 impairment and restructuring charges. Our operating income also showed considerable improvement, reaching 12.8% from an adjusted 8.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The improvement in operating income and margin rate is primarily attributable to the improved gross profit rate.
Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 increased 32% to $114 million from an adjusted $87 million in the prior-year period, and net income per diluted share rose 31% to $1.13 from an adjusted $0.86 in prior-year period. The growth in net income and net income per diluted share principally relates to the higher operating income I just discussed, that was partially offset by higher taxes this year compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 when the company actually had a net tax benefit.
Before I discuss our segment level performance, I'd first like to provide you with a brief recap of how our actual results exceeded the previous expectations we outlined for you back in early February. Generally speaking, the upside was broad based, although the largest portion came from the strong performance of our Retail segment worldwide, where both comparable store sales trends and the gross profit margin were substantially ahead of our expectations, especially in the United States, where we experienced improved traffic trends, higher full-priced sales conversion, the return of some of our tourist customers and outstanding .com performance.
Our domestic and Japanese Wholesale operations also delivered stronger sales and profit contribution. The dilution associated with our newly transitioned Asian operation was in line with the $0.08 to $0.10 per share we provided you in February. 
Before I begin the segment highlights for the quarter, as you read in this morning's press release, we are now reporting our Japan concession shops sales and profits, which had previously been captured in our Wholesale segment, in our Retail segment. This reclassification essentially affects about half of our sales in Japan this year. We made this change in our operating reporting results to better reflect the direct selling, expense and inventory ownership dynamics of the concession model, particularly since it is also an important channel for our newly transitioned Asian operations. You can see that this reclassification had no impact on our previously reported consolidated sales, margin and net income or EPS figures.
Now moving on to our segment highlights for the fourth quarter. Let's begin with our Wholesale division, where sales declined 3% to $736 million, reflecting lower global apparel shipments that were partially offset by higher footwear sales, particularly for our men's Polo brand. While aggregate shipments were down, we experienced progressive improvement from the third quarter, which reflects a more stable environment among our Wholesale customers worldwide. 
Consistent with what we've observed over the last several quarters at Retail, our core apparel products continued to outperform overall store and department trends, and we experienced favorable basic stock replenishment trends across many product categories. We transitioned to spring a few weeks early and smoothly across most product categories, and the iconic appeal of our focused merchandising strategies has helped to drive our relative outperformance.
We also had incremental distribution related to our new RLX active apparel line and to our Winter Olympics merchandise, both of which were well received. Chaps exceeded sales plans, and American Living continues to generate solid sell-throughs on reduced inventory. 
In Europe, we continued to experience broad-based strength at key accounts across the region with notable growth in France, Germany and the U.K. and signs of stabilization in Italy. In Japan, our men's business remains very strong albeit on a relative basis. And we experienced improved trends for our women's Blue Label and Black Label products during the quarter.
Our fourth quarter Wholesale operating income was $183 million, and the operating margin rate was 24.9% or 280 basis points greater than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The higher wholesale operating margin rate was primarily a result of improved Wholesale segment gross profit; a function of product mix, particularly with the basic stock replenishment merchandising stronger footwear margin; supply chain benefits; and disciplined inventory management. In addition, focused expense management helped to offset higher costs related to business expansion and new product development initiative.
For our Retail group, fourth quarter sales rose 31% to $554 million, reflecting a substantial increase in comp store sales at our freestanding stores worldwide; the benefit of a 53rd week of sales, which, again being Easter, was a high-volume week; and the contribution from a newly assumed Asian store and concession shop business. Higher ralphlauren.com revenues also contributed to the fourth quarter strong Retail segment growth rate. 
Overall comp store sale, which are presented on a comparable 13-week-to-13-week basis and include reclassified Japanese concession shops, increased 16%, reflecting 17% growth at Ralph Lauren stores, a 9% increase in factory stores and a 29% increase at Club Monaco stores. ralphlauren.com sales increased 39% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Comp growth was primarily achieved through higher average dollar transaction values, mostly due to greater full-priced selling activity and significantly reduced clearance inventory level.
Traffic to our U.S. stores declined modestly during the quarter, although strong gains among international tourists were partially offset the lower level of activity among domestic customers. The momentum at ralphlauren.com was supported by double-digit growth in traffic and a higher conversion rate, thanks to strong merchandising assortment and interest in our Olympics-related merchandise. Easter selling was also strong on ralphlauren.com. And at Club Monaco, expanded on-trend fashion assortment supported broad-based gains across all women's categories. 
In Europe, geographic trends at our Ralph Lauren stores remain consistent with those we have articulated over the last several quarters, with the U.K. and Scandinavia remaining strong and some improvement in Italy. European factory stores have maintained their broad-based strength across regions. 
In Japan, comp trends at our Omotesando flagship store and at our factory stores were quite robust and clearly outperformed the broader retail market. Our concession shop performance was also noteworthy, particularly for our men's products. As expected, sales for our newly transitioned Asian stores and concession shops were somewhat inhibited by a lack of excess fall holiday clearance inventory for most of the fourth quarter, although we are pleased with the current product sales mix for spring, which is better aligned with our strategic brand initiatives.
During the fourth quarter, we opened three directly operated freestanding stores, closed two directly operated freestanding stores and assumed control of 16 freestanding stores in Asia, ending the year with 350 company-operated freestanding stores. We also operated 281 concession shop locations throughout Asia, mostly Japan, at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.
Our Retail segment operating income was $18 million compared to an adjusted loss of $28 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The market improvement in Retail segment profitability reflects a substantial increase in comparable store sales and gross profit rate at all of our freestanding stores worldwide, primarily as a result of higher full-priced sales and lower clearance inventory, as mentioned previously, as well as a disciplined operational management. The favorable profit margin dynamics of ralphlauren.com also contributed to improved Retail segment profitability. Partially offsetting the Retail segment profit improvement were expenses associated with our newly transitioned Asian operations. 
Licensing royalties for the quarter were $47 million, equivalent with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 as higher domestic product licensing revenues were offset by a decline in international and home licensing revenues. However, operating income for our Licensing segment increased 36% to $34 million reflecting lower net costs associated with the transition of former-licensed Asian operations to directly controlled operations.
With approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments and $940 million in net cash at the end of the year, which is more than double fiscal 2009's level, our financial condition remains strong. The fourth quarter ended with inventory down 4% from the prior-year period, and that does include the inventory associated with our newly transitioned Asian operations and the eight net new stores we added over the last year. Our return on equity for fiscal 2010 was 18%, and our return on investment was 33%.
Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2010 was $907 million, 17% greater than fiscal 2009, reflecting higher net income and improved working capital management. We spent approximately $201 million on CapEx during fiscal 2010 to support new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares of stock at an average price of $78, utilizing $78 million of our current authorization. For the full year fiscal 2010 period we repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares of Class A common stock, utilizing approximately $216 million of our authorized share repurchase program. And at the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately $550 million remaining under our authorized share repurchase program, inclusive of a new $275 million authorization recently approved by the company's Board of Directors that we announced in this morning's earnings release.
We are obviously very pleased with our strong fourth quarter and full year result. The operational management and financial discipline that characterizes our company has enabled us to maximize sales and margin opportunities to mitigate the impact of the global recession in a remarkable manner. 
There are however, a few macroeconomic dynamics that present some considerable challenges for us in this fiscal year. One of the most impactful is currency exchange rates, particularly for the euro. Comparing yesterday's EUR 1.22 per $1 rate to the average 1.4 rate we experienced in fiscal 2010, which is a 13% decline, there is obviously a substantial translation impact. 
Based on our geographic sales mix, we currently anticipate approximately 250 to 300 basis points of negative currency translation on our sales, a portion of which will flow through to profits for the full year fiscal 2011 period, with more pronounced pressure related to exchange rates in the back half of the year. There is an additional and approximately equivalent amount of unfavorable transaction exchange rate impact on our operating profits in fiscal 2011.
Another profit headwind is higher sourcing costs, which we are beginning to experience with rising raw material, freight and labor expenses as well as tightened factory and freight capacity in our global supply chain. Historically, we have generally been successful in our efforts to contain cost of goods inflation, although we appear to be up against the perfect storm in the back half of fiscal 2011, particularly with our spring 2011 merchandise delivery.
As Roger mentioned, given the resilience of our performance and our strong financial condition, we intend to accelerate our investment in our strategic growth initiatives during fiscal 2011, particularly with our international expansion and direct-to-consumer efforts. We expect to incur higher expenses as a result. Among these is incremental costs associated with our newly transitioned Asian operations, which will be most pronounced in the first half of this year. Our investment in new flagship stores around the world and the launch of international e-commerce are also expected to be dilutive in the near term.
In this morning's press release, we provided our initial outlook for the year, which I'd like to review with you now. For the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we currently expect consolidated net revenues to increase at a low double-digit rate. Our expectations are based on low double-digit growth in global wholesale shipments, with increases across all major regions, and high single-digit comps, which now include our Japanese concession shop locations, on a comparable basis. 
As a reminder, revenues for our newly assumed Asian operations are primarily reported in our Retail segment, and those will be incremental sales compared to the prior-year period. Our operating margin for the first quarter is expected to be modestly above the 11.4% achieved in the prior-year period, with gross margin improvement being mostly offset by higher operating expense deleverage related to the continued investment in our various strategic growth initiatives across geographies, distribution channels and emerging product categories. 
For the full year fiscal 2011 period, we expect consolidated revenues to increase at a mid single-digit rate, led by our Retail segment, and mitigated by a low double-digit decline in Licensing revenues, which clearly reflects the impact of our assuming more direct control over certain product categories and geographies.
As a reminder, our revenue growth outlook for fiscal 2011 is for a 52-week period and compares with fiscal 2010's 53-week period. We currently expect to achieve a low double-digit operating margin rate in fiscal 2011. The net effect of gross margin pressure that is more back-half weighted and a modest deleveraging of operating expenses that is more front-half weighted, as we are currently forecasting a modest leveraging of our operating expenses in the second half of the year. Our fiscal 2011 tax rate is expected to be 34%. Again as a reminder, our fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 tax rates were advantaged by the favorable resolution of certain non-recurring discrete tax items that we do not expect to have this year.
The higher level of investments that is flowing through the P&L is also reflected in our capital spending plan. We are planning approximately $280 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 to support our retail, wholesale and infrastructure investments and initiatives that Roger and I have outlined on this call today. About half of our capital as allocated for 15 to 20 new stores and shops, including a new 30,000 square foot flagship location to showcase our women's and home's collection merchandise across from the Rhinelander Mansion on 72nd and Madison Avenue in New York City. We are simultaneously renovating the former women's and home floor at the Mansion to accommodate additional men's merchandise, including RRL. We believe this expanded square footage for our men's, women's and home products allows us to properly showcase the breadth and scope of the world of Ralph Lauren in a manner that will resonate globally. Much of the incremental capital investment versus fiscal 2010 is also concentrated in Asia and for our global infrastructure. In fact, our capital spending in Asia is forecast to double this year in order to support our expanded distribution. As we have indicated before, a growing portion of our capital investment over the next several years will be allocated to international markets.
I'd like to reiterate that we are making this high level of reinvestment back in the business because we are confident it will deliver appreciable returns over the long term. Our conviction stems from the success we've had with this strategy in the past and, especially in light of what we have been able to achieve over the last two years, and our reporting on this call this morning. We've had a lot to tell you thus far. 
At this point, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist with that?"

So we'll try to stay on the call a little bit extra time to make sure we get in as many questions as we can.  To specifically answer your question, Omar, I think you heard us talk about even in a difficult environment, we generated over $900 million of operating cash flow this year. So to bump up the capital from $200 million to $280 million, for us, is still a very cautious statement about use of funds. And we think is justified given our long-term strategies to develop 2/3 of our business outside the U.S. versus approximately 1/3 it is now. In fact, Europe has its ups and downs, and Asia has its ups and downs and so does the United States to be fair. But the things we're choosing to spend on, which are systems, technology, infrastructure, logistics and distribution as a base and then on top of that, shop in shops, freestanding stores or other direct-to-customer initiatives, we have to believe are the right long-term strategies to get at these opportunities. Do we try to move them around globally or sequence them a little bit differently given our own point of view about the next two or three years in the market? The answer is yes. But I think you can count on us for the next couple of years to spend at higher levels of capital with more than half of that going into the international markets. And given our track record, which says we have an ROI north of 30% consistently, I think we've done a good job of earning against those investments. So it's going to take a little bit more than the current headwinds to slow us down meaningfully. But we'll try to be thoughtful."

It's fair to say that our product has sold through well at retail and we continue to enjoy good market share gains this spring. So while the retailer is cautious and I think has fallen a little bit in love with this lower inventory level, improves their margin scenario. And I think they're looking for manufacturers to be able to chase and react or replenishment a little bit more than upfront buy than they did in the past, we are beginning to see some opportunities to get incremental Wholesale business, somewhat offset by the currency exchanges that Tracey talked about. Because as you know, a lot of the Wholesale business in Europe, at least at the moment, will be flying into a pretty significant exchange rate issue. But under the heading of a worldwide reaction, we've had terrific Men's business and we seem to be picking up share. The Lauren business has gained strength as we've gone through the year. We're enjoying a good spring in kids. We've had tremendous growth in some of our new businesses like Footwear and Dresses. And that's part of what's giving us a good feeling about the Lauren handbag launch that's being carefully done, and will be available for sale in August. We're all very anxious to see how the customer react to that product. We think it looks good, the retailer think it looks good and they're obviously buying several seasons out already. So we think that is an opportunity for us in sort of a Non-Comp Wholesale business. So I think the retailer is cautious, I think they're going to continue to look to speed up their inventory turns. But we are trying to maximize every opportunity where appropriate."

Spain, which has been large has suffered with a very high reported 20% unemployment. Although, every time I go there, they tell me that that's not really the unemployment, that's the published number. But nevertheless, in rank order, those would be the highest countries: France, U.K., Germany, Italy and then Spain. And I would say from a performance point of view: France, U.K., Germany have been the best performing countries with some of the Southern-tier markets being more difficult, including Spain. We don't do that much business in Portugal. But Spain, Italy and some of the Southern tiers. Some of that is the macroeconomic issues there. And some of it recently, quite frankly, has been affected by this volcanic cloud, which has dramatically altered the tourist patterns in Europe, both in and intra-Europe; both people who were caught or are concerned about being caught. So there's a huge slowdown in the last month or six weeks based on that in tourist destinations. But fundamentally, the Wholesale business again, in a constant currency measurement is holding up nicely. We're seeing increases in most of the core brands."

So those customers that are coming in, we're converting more of them to a sale and we're getting a higher sale from them. And we've modeled really, until proven otherwise, that's the rest of the year in the Ralph Lauren format. Club Monaco is experiencing higher traffic, higher conversion and higher average unit sale. And I think you could tell that in the 29% comp that we just reported on a comparable calendar basis is extraordinary and that's really just great product. We are seeing online, increased traffic. It's not really footsteps, I guess, that's not the vocabulary you use, but we are seeing growth in customer there and higher average unit sale. And I think that's reflected in the 39% comp that we reported for online. The other piece of it, which you didn't ask but I think is interesting is, the relatively small amount of crossover between the online shopper and the brick-and-mortar shopper. We continue to watch this carefully. We continue to try to educate ourselves about how this is unfolding. And while we're learning a lot and it's got a little bit of movement in it, it's probably less than you would instinctively believe. The other piece of that, that I find interesting is that about 25% of our traffic on the site is coming from international customers who are not able to shop but are going through the website for information and product knowledge. And that is giving us some encouragement for our launch later in the fall with e-commerce in Europe."

But let me answer your questions. We have absolutely made a dramatic sea change in the way goods are sourced and moved around the globe. And we were just talking with our Board the other day. In the last 10 years, we've raised our gross margins 950 basis points. So this is not really a one-year spike to either a quarter record or an annual record, quite frankly. This has been a strategic weapon that we've had as a company year after year, brick after brick. And with the number of brands and the complexity in the 85 countries we ship to, this has absolutely turned into a key differentiator. Having said that, last year, because of the worldwide slowdown, there were some unique opportunities in availability or production of raw materials or transportation that allowed us to accelerate the margin beyond even our plans or expectation. They are not a function of us raising prices. They really are a function of us elevating quality but managing cost of goods and then obviously the merchandising initiatives and planning initiatives helped the sell-throughs, which reduced markdowns. So going forward, our belief is we are not looking to pass on cost of good increase to the customer. We don't think the market at this point is looking for that, particularly with customers still wanting to think about a value purchase. So we will be facing, as Tracey talked about, cost of good increases in raw materials and transportation, more because capacity has been taken out of the marketplace. There are plains in the desert being mothballed and there are ships sitting idle, and so the ones that are working are looking for increases as those people are looking to repair their margins from the devastation of the last two years. But our long-term margin objectives are to maintain the highest quality and service level but maximize the gross profit potential. Over a 10-year period, that has been a very important part of our economic success. And it has allowed us to generate incremental profit that we have used to reinvest back into the business and take on a lot of other initiatives. We've developed expertise in product categories that in the past, many people thought we couldn't do like Women's or Footwear or now, Accessories as we were labeled very narrowly a men's company. And I think that's proven obviously not to be true. So as we look to take on production in Japan, which obviously was put a third-party when it was licensed, when we take on the production of Asia, or new product categories like Lauren handbags, I think gross margin and gross margin expansion over a long term is something we focus on. However, in the short run, there are some real headwinds as we look to price the back half of the year. And we'll just have to deal with it. But I don't believe we're going to be able to look to pass that out of consumer. I think that would be a short-term decision that would be a long-term mistake."

Are you seeing some increases in that business in the United States, primarily? And then the Home business, we're starting to see improvements in some other retailers and suppliers. I'm just curious what the challenges are there and the opportunities? And then Tracey, if you can help us on the flow-through of your -- it was helpful on the sales end. But what type of operating margin flow-through from that negative variance in sales due to currency should we expect? I mean, typically, your flow-through seems to be lower than some of your industry peers. However, I should assume maybe 5% to 10% flow-through on earnings.

Women's as a category, had been tough for a couple of years as I think the female customer was bouncing back and forth between career and casual. And I think some of the sense of more women working at home, meaning less casual clothes, maybe not the fashion trends to stimulate buying. I think we're beginning to feel that the Women's business is not only strengthening at retail but across multiple price points. So whether it's the higher-end business or whether it's the Lauren business or quite frankly, for us, the Club Monaco business, product that's a little sexier, product that's a little more feminine, product that's a little more novel, all of which seemed to be getting a good reaction from the customer. Also, the business which had migrated mostly to casual and denim, we're seeing strengthening in more of the wear-to-work product. Some of that's coming through in dresses, where the women has now for several years accepted the dress as a viable alternative. And some of that is coming through in more polished products. So we're encouraged because that's a big business that the industry has struggled with. And although I think prices have been sharpened and I think there's a real consciousness about value at any of those prices, the blood of inventory is behind the industry. There is more product scarcity. I think that's allowing people to command more original retails. And I think that's all healthy. So as we head into fall and into the back half of the year, we are expecting that to continue. I've also seen some of the reports about the Home trends, now that's encouraging. That's another business that has trailed for some number of years. Some of that is embedded in the housing starts and the problems in the mortgage markets. Some of it's been those generally are bigger-ticket decisions and those have been deferred. Some of the disruption in the market with some major retail chains going out of business and liquidating inventory, I think has depressed that market. But I think as the channel has settled down and as the consumer has delayed purchasing, we're beginning to see at retail, some signs of that customer looking for some fresh fashion, whether it's freshening a master bedroom, or whether it's redoing a dining room or whether some of the firming in the real estate values is causing people to freshen their homes. We are seeing that begin to happen and we're encouraged. I think we'd like to see more of it over a longer period of time. But for now, it does seem to be firming and that's a good sign.

But we're trying to get our arms around the existing distribution network, the in-shop presentations, which has Tracey has talked to you about, the conversion into concession models really mean we're buying the goods, we're staffing the stores, we're outfitting the shops and we're responsible for the inventory. So we are learning daily about the Japanese customer through that network of hundreds of doors. And I think we will eventually take that learning and use it to complement our own network with that. Separately, perhaps a higher priority is our own network of stores in the Asia-Pacific region, including China, Hong Kong and some other countries, where there is not a robust department store channel and we will have to build our own network of stores over time in order to get the infrastructure supported and the distribution that we're desiring.

Tracey, it sounds like you're looking for SG&A deleverage in the first half, modest leverage in the back half. So is it fair to assume that really what gets us from what was closer to mid-teens operating margin this year to a low double-digit rate in fiscal '11 would be primarily the gross margin compression you guys maybe potentially looking for? And a related question is, are there any supply-chain efficiencies or initiatives underway that we should be looking for that would be incremental to the gross margin for fiscal '11?"

There is some deleverage full year as well from an SG&A standpoint. But the bulk of it is the gross profit decline. As it relates to the supply-chain initiative, I think Roger spoke well about the fact that we really maximize some unique conditions in fiscal 2010. In addition to some of the things that we had described, probably three quarters ago, that we had started in fiscal '09 related to our work with transportation operators that we work with in terms of consolidating shipments and really trying to manage more efficiency into the supply chain, shifting from air to ocean and continuing that process. So we really maximized a lot of that opportunity in fiscal 2010. Some opportunities for that in fiscal 2011, but not nearly to the extent that we saw in fiscal 2010."

So we have a men's Blue Label sportswear shop in a store, we may have a men's Black Label sportswear shop in a store, we'll have a women's Blue Label shop in a store, maybe a women's Black. We'll have a kid's concession store. So really, unlike our own stores where we integrate and mix brands around Ralph's vision, the Department Store business in Japan and Asia at the moment in the concession locations, are very much one-brand oriented. And then within that, there've been very much key items, basics and commodity items. So our first step in the process is really to represent a broader range of offerings and fashions in those categories. We will then try to get some of those shops repositioned to get better adjacencies to where the brand is today versus where it might have been 10 years ago when some of those locations were invested in. And we will try to add to that, higher-end products, which traditionally has not been well represented in Japan, Asia-Pacific in general. So it's upgrading of fashion, content. It's an upgrading of price points. We're not going to walk away from the core items or the core basics. But we'll give them slightly less visual representation and up the brands inclusion of fashion and movement. I think we've felt that the business has looked a little static in that part of the world, as licensees historically pursue the most simple product and the basic products. We'll wrap around that over time ongoing efforts to elevate public relations and marketing, which we think are critical. One of the interesting facts that we received when Ralph and I and the rest -- some of the senior management team were in Asia, is how consistently we heard customers there getting their brand and product information from the Internet. And so part of the connection for us in moving our brand in Asia over time, will be the ability to communicate to the customer through the online experience. And I think that will be a high focus for us as we try to remix our brand phase in that market and how to get that message out. You can get that message out online a lot faster than regional magazines, or billboards, or regional newspapers or any other media. So that's an important learning for us as we try to go forward."

I believe that the last 18 months' difficult environment has caused all retailers, whether they are internal to Polo or whether they're our wholesale partners, to be more cautious about inventory planning and to be focused on trying to sell through more at full price and turn the inventory faster. I think that is a piece of what every retailer today is looking to do. That then has to be coupled with appropriate sales planning because if your sales exceeds your plans, you're going to be caught short of inventory and obviously, if you miss sales, you're going to be hung with product that needs to be marked down. So I think what's happening is from point of manufacturer to ordering to delivery, there's a lot of pressure on the entire supply chain to be very precise about the level of inventory and the sell-throughs. Our inventory, despite the sales increase is down, and another one of those facts that we sort of stumbled onto over the last 10 years, we've added $3 billion in sales and we only have increased inventory by $110 million at Polo Ralph Lauren. So that's a startling piece of our management effort that it only took us $110 million more inventory 10 years later to add $3 billion of sales. So I think we're all getting smarter. I think we're all getting more demanding. And I think we know that what we can't do is get the customer excess inventory to pick through at discounted prices, because based on her prior experience, if they continue to believe that's possible, they're going to wait and wait and wait until the products are marked down. So I think our partners are being more careful. I think we're being more careful and I think that puts pressure on subjects like replenishment or chasing hot product if it's possible, if it's raw materials, then availability of production. But most of the wholesale models were not built on large amounts of it. So this is something that's just beginning to evolve as perhaps a longer-term trend, which will put pressure on the upfront ordering and put more pressure on the supply chain to chase demand dictated by the customer. So at this point, I appreciate it. I'm sorry, I have run 15 minutes late. I just thought the fourth quarter and the full year deserve a little fulsome conversation. Hope we've had the chance to answer all your questions. Thank you for your support. If you've got follow-up questions, Jim and Tracey can attempt to answer them during the day. It's been an incredible year for us. We're very proud of it and the results we achieved, and we're very mindful of what the next 12 months hold for us in terms of challenges.

We’re pleased to be reporting outstanding fourth quarter and full year results this morning, results that exceeded our expectations on virtually every operating metric and that reflect significant broad based progress across products, channels and geographies. 
The year was filled with some tremendous milestones for our company, including major strides in our international growth objectives as we assumed direct control of important Asian operations; made considerable progress with our accessory development efforts, retailing our first watch collections and having our first market for Lauren handbags; and we prepared for the opening of several important flagship stores in key global markets. And in spite of this high level of reinvestment back into our company, we substantially improved our profitability with gross profit margins expanding 380 basis points to a record annual level of 58.2, and earnings growing 18%, all during a period of considerable global turbulence that represented some of the most challenging issues our industry has ever had to face. And our fiscal 2010 results are not a function of easy comparisons. They come on top of gross profit margin expansion and EPS growth in fiscal ’09, which was yet another outstanding year for us considering broader market conditions and our sustained level of investments back into our business.
There is no question that this remarkable performance was, in fact, years in the making. It comes as a direct result of our selective investment in the consistent seeding and sequencing of our strategic growth initiatives, where we are leveraging efficiency gains in certain areas of the business to support growth opportunities in other areas; diversifying our operations on multiple levels in terms of brands, products, channel distribution and geography. Of course our results also reflect the strength of our brand, the desirability of our products, and the intense proactive operational discipline that runs through our organization, from supply chain and logistics to other corporate functions, as well as to our strategic merchandising initiative and meticulous, store level management.
The fourth quarter dynamics also suggest something of an inflection point of change in the marketplace. Worldwide, we are seeing our core and luxury customers returning to the stores with an openness to spend. While they are not spending at pre-recession levels, and they can be focused on value, they do recognize that product availability is limited. And there is no price resistance on unique or novel items. We also saw things get progressively better every month during the fourth quarter, and the rebound has been most pronounced in our women’s products.
Urban and tourist destinations are outperforming stores that cater to more regional or local customers. The dedication and hard work of our teams around the world are the other critical ingredients of our success. During the last 90 days, we have traveled to Europe, Asia and the Middle East and met with our teams. Their drive for excellence and desire to raise the bar on their own performance is inspiring.
I believe our performance over the last two years and in particular fiscal ’10 demonstrates the unique competitive advantage for us, our organization’s care about every single detail of our business, and work to maximize each and every opportunity and/or challenge. We are managing a tremendously complex and multifaceted mosaic across an astoundingly disparate disciplines, but we are united in our goal of elevating our brand, communicating our rich heritage and core values of quality, consistency, honesty and teamwork.
There is no better evidence of this than our newly opened Saint Germain flagship in Paris. This project was several years in the making and is our boldest brand statement to date, heralding a new era for us in France, across Europe and around the world. The store represents the culmination of tremendous progress our company has made over the last decade, from the balance of men’s and women’s merchandise, the breadth of product categories available, the powerful accessory presentations and the incredible restoration of this historic site. The richness of the Ralph Lauren brand and its unique lifestyle sensibility is accentuated further by Ralph’s, a restaurant housed within the store that has fast become one of Paris’ chicest restaurants.
The store is a true destination that reflects the excellent work of our European team that has repositioned our brand so meticulously over the last decade, resulting in a customer who understands the quality and value of our products. In Europe, the fashion expectation of our customers is higher than that in the United States, and we see this across all brands from Collection to Lauren to Polo Jeans.
As we’ve highlighted in the past, our performance in Europe has been spectacular over the last ten years, when we’ve grown revenues five fold, and the momentum continues to be with us. Notwithstanding the recent economic turmoil, we have a diverse, balanced, long-term growth strategy throughout the region, with early stage opportunities across brands and product categories. With only 20 directly operated and 8 licensed Ralph Lauren stores, and 24 factory stores, there is clearly room to expand our direct-to-consumer reach throughout Europe.
And an exciting new evolution in our European growth strategy this year is e-commerce. Based on the success of RalphLauren.com in the United States, and the growing importance of this channel worldwide, we intend to launch e-commerce capabilities in Europe beginning with the UK this fall. We expect other countries to follow over the next several years. There is no question that the customer around the world increasingly wants to shop online, and those who do tend to be more valuable customers for us, particularly if they also shop at our brick-and-mortar stores.
While our European e-commerce initiative will be managed in market, we are leveraging our RalphLauren.com team in the United States, and our existing technology and distribution partners, to help insure a successful launch. Although the investment we are making will be dilutive in the near term, we are excited about the long-term sales and profit potential of international e-commerce. It is consistent with our overall strategy, and we have had spectacular success with RalphLauren.com sales and profit in the United States, and we can use that as a benchmark.
Given our commitment to the Asian expansion, we are studying how and when it makes sense for us to launch e-commerce capabilities there. In Asia, our primary focus and concentration will be in two countries, Japan and China. As you are all aware, the Japanese economic market and retail remains challenging. The once seemingly insatiable appetite for easily identifiable luxury products has evolved into a value oriented customer with more sophisticated and individualistic mindset. We believe the scope of our various brands and products, supported by the broad iconic vernacular of the Ralph Lauren brand, present us with the unique opportunity to address these cultural changes and to grow in this market. We are already experiencing proof of our convictions across various channels of distribution in Japan, where performance at the Omotesando store, at our concession shops and at our factory stores, is outpacing industry trends, a dynamic that is maintained since taking back control of the market three years ago. The profitability of our Japanese operations has also improved in the same time period.
Our Japanese teams have done an excellent job with clienteling, innovative marketing and merchandising initiatives, and are consistently receiving strong editorial coverage in leading fashion publications. Our department stores have taken notice, and our near term focus is on strengthening our partnership with major department store operators, to work together to elevate our distribution, enhance merchandise presentations including new shops for Black Label, and accessory products in strategic locations. Even though apparel sales in Japanese department stores are contracting, the reality is there’s still a lot of footsteps walking through the door and they are generating very high absolute sales and productivity levels, and we know we can effect change. It will clearly take time for us to realize our goals in Japan, and we will need the economic environment to be more supportive for us to do so, but we are confident the customer receptivity is ultimately there.
Beyond Japan, we completed our first quarter successfully operating several new transition to Asian markets, greater China being one of them. As you know, we spent much of fiscal 2010 building a world class organization of over 700 employees, and putting in a new infrastructure to support the transformational growth our company expects in the long-term. With the leadership team in place, our strategy now focused on several initiatives, including training our employees, particularly our new sales associates, in our brand standards; refining our understanding of the customer’s tastes and preferences; accelerating of distribution of various channels and product categories; and elevating our visual presentation of assortments as we layer in new categories. We will simultaneously be supporting all of these efforts with advertising, marketing and public relations initiatives to evolve our brand awareness in the region.
Ralph and senior members of our executive leadership team recently toured Southeast Asia, where we met with various constituents including employees, manufacturers, real estate developers and others. Now that we have control of our distribution and the stores are looking better, our goal in elevating the brand has immediately become more tangible. We all came back incredibly inspired by our tremendous growth potential in this important, emerging region. Today we directly operate 17 freestanding stores, which are primarily concentrated in Hong Kong; 75 concession shops, which are concentrated in China and Taiwan; and licensing partners operate an additional 34 concessions, primarily in China and the Philippines. We are managing and servicing all of these points of distribution seamlessly, which is no small feat considering the unique characteristics of a concession based selling, where we are offering fresh product locally that sell through at high velocities and really are supported with very small stockrooms.
Our brand elevation and distribution expansion plans are well underway. Since assuming control of the region, we have opened several new concession shops and two freestanding stores, one central mall located in the new MGM Grand Casino in Macau and another in the New Peninsula Hotel on the Bund in Shanghai. These stores are our first proper luxury presentations in the region, with a balanced mix of men’s and women’s product and an emphasis on accessories, Collection, Purple Label and Black Label merchandise. These stores not only help to educate the consumer about who we are as a brand, but they also create excitement in the real estate community among developers who are looking for new and compelling concepts to support their growth.
We actually had several of the Asian real estate developers’ tour our new Paris store so they could fully appreciate the global scale of our brand development efforts.
Beyond greater China, our focus on the rest of the newly transitioned countries will mostly be on driving better productivity in existing doors through stronger assortment and shop refurbishments. While we certainly expect to grow our sales in this new part of the world at a double digit rate in the near term, it will take a few years for this region to become a significant driver of our consolidated sales and profit. It takes time to find, build and open new locations and our advertising and market efforts will begin in earnest once we have a more developed distribution network.
This cadence is consistent with our experience in Europe, which has obviously helped develop us into a large, highly profitable region, one where our brand image is impeccable and we have considerable growth opportunities in front of us. In the United States we’ve seen a dramatic rebound in the customer trends compared to last year. As I mentioned earlier, it is the core luxury customer and the return of the international tourist traveler that are driving much of the improvement. The aspirational customer remains cautious and has not returned to the stores in any meaningful way. Nevertheless, our products are performing strongly across channel and categories, given the enduring value of our brand and the exceptionally focused and strategic merchandising initiatives.
This applies to Club Monaco too, as you can see in their strong comps, which far outpace those of most specialty apparel retailers during the fourth quarter, thanks to its compelling women’s assortment and the revitalized men’s offering. Across our brand portfolio, the U.S. consumer is selectively replenishing basics and adding newness to their wardrobe. 
We think with our potential in the U.S., given the breadth of our existing distribution, we expect growth to come primarily from sustained market share and productivity gains. We also have new and emerging product categories that are offering compelling incremental opportunity, the most substantial being with accessories. We had an encouraging response to our first market for Lauren handbags during the quarter. Our team has developed a truly iconic and differentiated assortment that incorporates a broad range of silhouettes, in keeping with the lifestyle orientation of the Lauren brand. The versatility and functionality of the product has garnered accolades from our wholesale customers and fashion editors alike. 
The Lauren handbag product will initially be available in approximately 150 of the best North American department stores and select e-commerce sites beginning in August, with additional distribution already being planned for holiday and beyond. Key price points range from $150 to $400, and the introduction will be supported with product specific advertising, both at the national level and in conjunction with our various wholesale partners. We are excited about the growth potential of our Lauren handbags, particularly in light of the great success of the Lauren footwear.
Clearly, 2010 ended in a very different place than we could have imagined when we were building our plans a year ago. Remaining steadfast in our commitment to investing in our long-term strategic growth initiatives was absolutely the right thing to do. The consistent planting and harvesting of our various growth opportunities enabled us to manage through the toughest environment and drive strong earnings growth. The talent and discipline that have guided us through these challenging times remain intact as we look to the tremendous potential the future holds for us. 
There is no question that the broader market conditions remain uncertain, from European debt concerns to exchange rate fluctuations, inflationary pressures on cost of goods and the persistent high unemployment. And while these issues will likely have an impact on our near term results, I believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from any recovery in the global macro environment and their conditions, particularly as we continue to opportunistically invest to support sustained, long-term growth and shareholder value creation.
This is a strong, vital organization with a track record of success, and there is no better evidence of that than our fiscal 2010 results. With more than $1.2 billion in cash and investments, and net cash more than doubling from fiscal 2009 levels, we are reinvesting back in our business, buying back stock, reducing our debt and we still entered fiscal ’11 in exceptional condition.
With this as a backdrop, we are planning an aggressive acceleration of our investment in growth in fiscal 2011. We are seeding a new crop of opportunities with investments we are making in new flagship locations, in our support of Asia and with the growth of international e-commerce. Our organization has never been stronger and our mission has never been more clear.
And as Ralph said in this morning’s release, we are all inspired by what the future holds for us. Now I’d like to turn the call over to Tracey to discuss the financial and operational highlights of the fourth quarter, as well as our outlook for fiscal 2011.

362220,104778158,62242,"Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, May-19-2010",2010-05-19,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you Roger and good morning everyone. For the fourth quarter, consolidated net revenues were $1.3 billion or 9% above the prior year. The growth in revenues reflects strong, comparable store sales growth for the company’s retail segment; an extra 5",2721,"Thank you Roger and good morning everyone. For the fourth quarter, consolidated net revenues were $1.3 billion or 9% above the prior year. The growth in revenues reflects strong, comparable store sales growth for the company’s retail segment; an extra 53rd week of sales due to our April 2nd fiscal year end; and incremental revenues from newly transitioned Asian operations that were partially offset by a modest decline in wholesale revenue.
The net positive impact of currency translation on our reported revenue growth for the quarter was slightly below 2%. Excluding the 53rd week, which happened to be Easter week for us and represented approximately $70 million in sales, consolidated net revenues for the fourth quarter increased 3%. Our gross profit rate increased substantially, rising 720 basis points to a record 59%, reflecting disciplined inventory management; improved product mix across all channels; reduced markdowns in our retail stores; and continued supply chain savings.
Operating expenses in the fourth quarter were approximately 4% greater than the prior year period. The higher operating expenses reflect the incremental costs associated with business expansion, including our newly transitioned Asian operations, as well as higher incentive compensation accrual. 
Operating income for the fourth quarter was $172 million, 58% better than the prior year period, when adjusting for fiscal 2009’s impairment and restructuring charges. Our operating income also showed considerable improvement, reaching 12.8% from an adjusted 8.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The improvement in operating income and margin rate is primarily attributable to the improved gross profit rate.
Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 increased 32% to $114 million from an adjusted $87 million in the prior year period. And net income per diluted share rose 31% to $1.13 from an adjusted $0.86 in the prior year period. The growth in net income and net income per diluted share principally relates to the higher operating income I just discussed, that was partially offset by higher taxes this year compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 when the company actually had a net tax benefit.
Before I discuss the segment level performance, I’d first like to provide you with a brief recap of how our actual results exceeded the previous expectations we outlined for you back in early February. Generally speaking, the upside was broad based, although the largest portion came from the strong performance of our retail segment worldwide, where both comparable store sales trends and the gross profit margin were substantially ahead of our expectations, especially in the United States where we experienced improved traffic trends, higher full price sales conversion, the return of some of our tourist customers, and outstanding dot com performance. Our domestic and Japanese wholesale operations also delivered stronger sales and profit contribution. 
The dilution associated with our newly transitioned operations was in line with the $0.08 to $0.10 per share we provided you in February. 
Before I begin the segment highlights for the quarter, as you read in this morning’s press release we are now reporting our Japan concession shops sales and profits, which had previously been captured in our wholesale segment, in our retail segment. This reclassification essentially affects about half of our sales in Japan this year. We made this change in our operating reporting results to better reflect the direct selling, expense and inventory ownership dynamics of the concession model, particularly since it is also an important channel for our newly transitioned Asian operations. You can see that this reclassification had no impact on our previously reported consolidated sales, margin and net income or EPS figures.
Now moving on to our segment highlights for the fourth quarter, let’s begin with our wholesale division, where sales declined 3% to $736 million, reflecting lower global apparel shipments that were partially offset by higher footwear sales, particularly for our men’s Polo brand. While aggregate shipments were down, we experienced progressive improvement from the third quarter, which reflects a more stable environment among our wholesale customers worldwide.
Consistent with what we’ve observed over the last several quarters at retail, our core apparel products continue to outperform overall store and department trends, and we experienced favorable basic stock replenishment trends across many product categories. We transitioned to spring a few weeks early and smoothly across most product categories, and the iconic appeal of our focused merchandising strategies has helped to drive our relative outperformance.
We also had incremental distribution related to our new RLX Active Apparel line and to our Winter Olympics merchandise, both of which were well received. Chaps exceeded sales plans and American Living continues to generate solid sell throughs on reduced inventory. In Europe, we continue to experience broad based strength at key accounts across the region, with notable growth in France, Germany and the UK, and signs of stabilization in Italy.
In Japan, our men’s business remains very strong, albeit on a relative basis. And we experienced improved trends for our women’s Blue Label and Black Label products during the quarter. 
Our fourth quarter wholesale operating income was $183 million, and the operating margin rate was 24.9% or 280 basis points greater than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The higher wholesale operating margin rate was primarily a result of improved wholesale segment gross profit, a function of product mix, particularly with the basic stock replenishment merchandise and stronger footwear margins; supply chain benefits and disciplined inventory management.
In addition, focused expense management helped to offset higher costs related to business expansion and new product development initiatives.
For our retail group, fourth quarter sales rose 31% to $554 million, reflecting a substantial increase in comp store sales at our freestanding stores worldwide; the benefit of a 53rd week of sales, which again being Easter was a high volume week; and the contribution from a newly assumed Asian store and concession shop business.
Higher RalphLauren.com revenues also contributed to the fourth quarter’s strong retail segment growth rate. Overall comp store sales, which are presented on a comparable 13 week to 13 week basis, and include reclassified Japanese concession shops, increased 16%, reflecting 17% growth at Ralph Lauren stores; a 9% in factory stores; and a 29% increase at Club Monaco stores.
RalphLauren.com sales increased 39% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Comp growth was primarily achieved through higher average dollar transaction values, mostly due to greater full priced selling activity and significantly reduced clearance inventory levels.
Traffic to our U.S. stores declined modestly during the quarter, although strong gains among international tourists partially offset the lower level of activity among domestic customers. The momentum at RalphLauren.com was supported by double digit growth in traffic and a higher conversion rate, thanks to strong merchandising assortments and interest in our Olympics related merchandise. Easter selling was also strong on RalphLauren.com. And at Club Monaco, expanded on trend fashion assortment support broad based gains across all women’s categories. 
In Europe, geographic trends at our Ralph Lauren stores remained consistent with those we have articulated over the last several quarters, with the UK and Scandinavia remaining strong and some improvement in Italy. European factory stores have maintained their broad based strength across regions.
In Japan, comp trends at our Omotesando flagship store and at our factory stores were quite robust and clearly out performed the broader retail market. Our concession shop performance was also noteworthy, particularly for our men’s products. As expected, sales for our newly transitioned Asian stores and concession shops were somewhat inhibited by a lack of access fall holiday clearance inventory for most of the fourth quarter, although we are pleased with the current product sales mix for spring, which is better aligned with our strategic brand initiatives.
During the fourth quarter we opened three directly operated freestanding stores, closed two directly operated freestanding stores and assumed control of 16 freestanding stores in Asia, ending the year with 350 company operated freestanding stores. We also operated 281 concession shop locations throughout Asia, mostly Japan, at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.
Our retail segment operating income was $18 million compared to an adjusted loss of $28 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The market improvement and retail segment profitability reflects the substantial increase in comparable store sales and gross profit rate at all of our freestanding stores worldwide, primarily as the result of higher full price sales and lower clearance inventory as mentioned previously, as well as the disciplined operational management. 
The favorable profit margin dynamics of RalphLauren.com also contributed to improved retail segment profitability.
Partially offsetting the retail segment profit improvement were expenses associated with our newly transitioned Asian operations. 
Licensing royalties for the quarter were $47 million, equivalent with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, as higher domestic product licensing revenues were offset by a decline in international and home licensing revenues. However, operating income for our licensing segment increased 36% to $34 million, reflecting lower net costs associated with the transition of former licensed Asian operations to directly controlled operations.
With approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments, and $940 million in net cash at the end of the year, which is more than double fiscal 2009’s level, our financial condition remains strong. The fourth quarter ended with inventory down 4% from the prior year period, and that does include the inventory associated with our newly transitioned Asian operations and the eight net new stores we added over the last year.
Our return on equity for fiscal 2010 was 18% and our return on investment was 33%. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2010 was $907 million, 17% greater than fiscal 2009, reflecting higher net income and improved working capital management. We spent approximately $201 million on CapEx during fiscal 2010 to support new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments.
During the fourth quarter we repurchased 1 million shares of stock at an average price of $78, utilizing $78 million of our current authorization. For the full year fiscal 2010 period, we repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares of Class A common stock, utilizing approximately $216 million of our authorized share repurchase program. And at the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately $550 million remaining under our authorized share repurchase program, inclusive of a new $275 million authorization recently approved by the company’s Board of Directors, that we announced in this morning’s earnings release.
We are obviously very pleased with our strong fourth quarter and full year results. The operational management and financial discipline that characterizes our company has enabled us to maximize sales and margin opportunities to mitigate the impact of the global recession in a remarkable manner. 
There are, however, a few macro economic dynamics that present some considerable challenges for us in this fiscal year. One of the most impactful is currency exchange rates, particularly for the euro. Comparing yesterday’s 1.22 euro per dollar rate to the average 1.4 rate we experienced in fiscal 2010, which is a 13% decline, there is obviously a substantial translation impact. Based on our geographic sales mix, we currently anticipate approximately 250 to 300 basis points of negative currency translation on our sales, a portion of which will flow through to profits for the full year fiscal 2011 period, with more pronounced pressure related to exchange rates in the back half of the year. There is an additional and approximately equivalent amount of unfavorable transaction exchange rate impact on our operating profits in fiscal 2011.
Another profit headwind is higher sourcing costs, which we are beginning to experience with rising raw materials; freight and labor expenses; as well as tightened factory and freight capacity in our global supply chain. Historically we have generally been successful in our efforts to contain cost of goods inflation, although we appear to be up against the perfect storm in the back half of fiscal 2011, particularly with our spring 2011 merchandise deliveries. 
As Roger mentioned, given the resilience of our performance and our strong financial condition, we intend to accelerate our investment in our strategic growth initiatives during fiscal 2011, particularly with our international expansion and direct to consumer efforts. We expect to incur higher expenses as a result. Among these is incremental costs associated with our newly transitioned Asian operations, which will be most pronounced in the first half of this year. Our investment in new flagship stores around the world and the launch of international e-commerce are also expected to be dilutive in the near term.
In this morning’s press release we provided our initial outlook for the year, which I’d like to review with you now. For the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we currently expect consolidated net revenues to increase at a low double digit rate. Our expectations are based on low, double digit growth in global wholesale shipments, with increases across all major regions, and high single digit comps which now include our Japanese concession shop locations on a comparable basis.
As a reminder, revenues for our newly assumed Asian operations are primarily reported in our retail segment, and those will be incremental sales compared to the prior year period.
Our operating margin for the first quarter is expected to be modestly above the 11.4% achieved in the prior year period, with gross margin improvement being mostly offset by higher operating expense de-leverage related to the continued investment in our various strategic growth initiatives across geographies, distribution channels and emerging product categories.
For the full year fiscal 2011 period, we expect consolidated revenues to increase at a mid single digit rate, led by our retail segment and mitigated by a low, double digit decline in licensing revenues, which clearly reflects the impact of our assuming more direct control over certain product categories and geographies. As a reminder, our revenue growth outlook for fiscal 2011 is for a 52 week period and compares with fiscal 2010, 53 week period.
We currently expect to achieve a low, double digit operating margin rate in fiscal 2011, the net effect of gross margin pressure that is more back half weighted and a modest de-leveraging of operating expenses that is more front half weighted, as we are currently forecasting a modest leveraging of our operating expenses in the second half of the year. Our fiscal 2011 tax rate is expected to be 34%. Again as a reminder, our fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 tax rates were advantaged by the favorable resolution of certain nonrecurring discrete tax items that we do not expect to have this year.
The higher level of investment that is flowing through the P&L is also reflected in our capital spending plan. We are planning approximately $280 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 to support our retail, wholesale and infrastructure investments and initiatives that Roger and I have outlined on this call today. About half of our capital is allocated for 15 to 20 new stores and shops including a new 30,000 square foot flagship location to showcase our women’s and homes Collection merchandise across from the Rhinelander Mansion on 72nd and Madison Avenue in New York City. We are simultaneously renovating the former Women’s and Home store at the Mansion to accommodate additional men’s merchandise, including Double RL. We believe this expanded square footage for our men’s, women’s and home products allows us to properly showcase the breadth and scope of the world of Ralph Lauren in a manner that will resonate globally.
Much of the incremental capital investment versus fiscal 2010 is also concentrated in Asia, and for our global infrastructure. In fact, our capital spending in Asia is forecast to double this year in order to support our expanded distribution. As we have indicated before, a growing portion of our capital investment over the next several years will be allocated to international markets.
I’d like to reiterate that we are making this high level of reinvestment back in the business because we are confident it will deliver appreciable returns over the long-term. Our conviction stems from the success we’ve had with this strategy in the past, and especially in light of what we have been able to achieve over the last two years and our reporting on this call this morning.
We’ve had a lot to tell you thus far. At this point we’d like to open up the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist with that?

So we’ll try to stay on the call a little bit extra time to make sure we get in as many questions as we can.
To specifically answer your question, Omar, I think you heard us talk about even in a difficult environment, we generated over $900 million of operating cash flow this year. So to bump up the capital from $200 million to $280 million, for us is still a very cautious statement about the use of funds, and we think is justified given our long-term strategies to develop two-thirds of our business outside the U.S. versus the approximately one-third it is now. In fact, you know Europe has its ups and downs and Asia has its ups and downs and so does the United States, to be fair. But the things we’re choosing to spend on, which are systems technology, infrastructure, logistics and distribution as a base, and then on top of that, shop in shops, freestanding stores or other direct-to-customer initiatives, we have to believe are the right long-term strategies to get at these opportunities.
Do we try to move them around globally or sequence them a little bit differently, given our own point of view about the next two or three years in the market? The answer is yes. But I think you can count on us for the next couple of years to spend at higher levels of capital, with more than half of that going into the international markets. And given our track record, which says we have an ROI north of 30% consistently, I think we’ve done a good job of earning against those investments. So it’s going to take a little bit more than the current headwinds to slow us down meaningfully, but we’ll try to be thoughtful.

I think that when we talked at the last call in February, I think we sequenced over the 12 months sort of what happened in the past and what we’re seeing going forward. It’s fair to say that our product has sold through well at retail and we continue to enjoy good market share gains this spring. So while the retailer is cautious, and I think has fallen a little bit in love with this lower inventory level improves their margin scenario, and I think they’re looking for manufacturers to be able to chase and react or replenishment a little bit more than up front buy than they did in the past, we are beginning to see some opportunities to get incremental wholesale business, somewhat offset by the currency exchanges that Tracey talked about. Because as you know, a lot of the wholesale business in Europe at least at the moment will be flying into a pretty significant exchange rate issue.
But under the heading of worldwide reaction we’ve had terrific men’s business and we seem to be picking up share. The Lauren business has gained strength as we’ve gone through the year. We’re enjoying a good spring in kids. We’ve had tremendous growth in some of our new businesses like footwear and dresses, and that’s part of what’s giving us a good feeling about the Lauren handbag launch that’s being carefully done and will be available for sale in August. We’re all very anxious to see how the customer reacts to that product. We think it looks good, the retailer thinks it looks good, and they’re obviously buying several seasons out already. So we think that is an opportunity for us in a sort of non-comp wholesale business.
So I think the retailer is cautious. I think they’re going to continue to look to speed up their inventory turns, but we are trying to maximize every opportunity where appropriate.

Spain which has been large has suffered with the very high reported 20% unemployment, although every time I go there they tell me that that’s not really the unemployment, that’s the published number. But nevertheless in rank order those would be the highest countries; France, UK, Germany, Italy and then Spain. And I would say from a performance point of view, France, UK, Germany have been the best performing countries with some of the southern tier markets being more difficult, including Spain. We don’t do that much business in Portugal, but Spain, Italy and some of the southern tiers. Some of that is the macro economic issues there and some of it recently, quite frankly, has been affected by this volcanic cloud which has dramatically altered the tourist patterns in Europe, both in and intra Europe, both people who were caught or who are concerned about being caught. So there’s a huge slowdown in the last month or six weeks based on that and tourist’s destinations.
But fundamentally, the wholesale business again and a constant currency measurement is holding up nicely. We’re seeing increases in most of the core brands.

So those customers that are coming in we’re converting more of them to a sale and we’re getting a higher sale from them. And we’ve modeled really until proven otherwise, that’s the rest of the year in the Ralph Lauren format. Club Monaco is experiencing higher traffic, higher conversion and higher average unit sale, and I think you could tell that in the 29 comp that we just reported on a comparable calendar basis is extraordinary. And that’s really just great product.
We are seeing online increased traffic. It’s not really footsteps. I guess that’s not the vocabulary you use, but we are seeing growth in customer there and higher average unit sale. And I think that’s reflected in the 39% comp that we reported for online.
The other piece of it, which you didn’t ask but I think is interesting is, the relatively small amount of crossover between the online shopper and the brick-and-mortar shopper. We continue to watch this carefully. We continue to try to educate ourselves about how this is unfolding. And while we’re learning a lot and it’s got a little bit of movement in it, it’s probably less than you would instinctively believe.
The other piece of that that I find interesting is that about 25% of our traffic on the site is coming from international customers who are not able to shop but are going through the website for information and product knowledge, and that is giving us some encouragement for our launch later in the fall with e-commerce in Europe.

But let me answer your question. We have absolutely made a dramatic sea change in the way goods are sourced and moved around the globe. And we were just talking with our board the other day. In the last ten years we’ve raised our gross margins 950 basis points, so this is not really a one year spike to either a quarter record or an annual record, quite frankly. This has been a strategic weapon that we’ve had as a company year after year, brick after brick. And with the number of brands and the complexity and the 85 countries we ship to, this absolutely turned into a key differentiator.
Having said that, last year because of the worldwide slowdown there were some unique opportunities in availability of production or raw materials or transportation that allowed us to accelerate the margin beyond even our plans or expectation. They are not a function of us raising prices; they really are a function of us elevating quality but managing cost of goods and then obviously the merchandising initiatives and planning initiatives help the sell throughs which reduce markdowns. So going forward, our belief is we are not looking to pass on cost of goods increase to the customer. We don’t think the market at this point is looking for that, particularly with customers still wanting to think about a value purchase. 
So we will be facing, as Tracey talked about, cost of good increases in raw materials and transportation more because capacity has been taken out of the marketplace. There are planes in the desert being mothballed and there are ships sitting idle, and so the ones that are working are looking for increases as those people are looking to repair their margins from the devastation of the last two years.
But our long-term margin objectives are to maintain the highest quality of service level, but maximize the gross profit potential. Over a ten year period, that has been a very important part of our economic success and it has allowed us to generate incremental profit that we have used to reinvest back into the business and take on a lot of other initiatives. We’ve developed expertise in product categories that in the past, many people thought we couldn’t do like women’s or footwear or now accessories, as we were labeled very narrowly a men’s company. And I think that’s proven obviously not to be true.
So as we look to take on production in Japan, which obviously was put out third party when it was licensed, or we take on the production of Asia or new product categories like Lauren handbags, I think gross margin and gross margin expansion over a long-term is something we focus on. However, in the short run, there are some real headwinds as we look to price the back half of the year, and we’ll just have to deal with it. But I don’t believe we’re going to be able to look to pass that on to the consumer. I think that would be a short term decision that would be a long-term mistake.

You’re seeing some increases in that business in the United States primarily. And then the home business we’re starting to see improvement in some other retailers and suppliers. I’m just curious what the challengers are there and the opportunities.
And then Tracey, if you could help us on the flow through of your, it was helpful on the sales end but what type of operating margin flow through from that negative variance in sales due to currency should we expect? I mean typically your flow through seems to be lower than some of your industry peers. Should we assume maybe 5 to 10% flow through on earnings and also a little bit on your hedging strategies would be helpful.

You know women’s as a category had been tough for a couple years as I think the female customer was bouncing back and forth between career and casual, and I think some of the sense of more women working at home needing less casual clothes, maybe not the fashion trends that stimulate buying. I think we’re beginning to feel that the women’s business is not only strengthening at retail, but across multiple price points. So whether it’s the higher end business or whether it’s the Lauren business or quite frankly for us, the Club Monaco business, you know, a product that’s a little sexier, a product that’s a little more feminine, a product that’s a little more novel; all of which seem to be getting a good reaction from the customer. Also, you know, the business which had migrated mostly to casual and denim, we’re seeing strengthening in more the wear to work product.
Some of that’s coming through in dresses, where the woman has now for several years accepted the dress as a viable alternative. And some of that is coming through in more polished products. So you know we’re encouraged, because that’s a big business that the industry has struggled with. And although I think prices have been sharpened and I think there’s a real consciousness about value at any of those prices, you know, the glut of inventory is behind the industry; there is more product scarcity; I think that’s allowing people to command more original retails, and I think that’s all healthy.
So as we head into fall and into the back half of the year, we are expecting that to continue. I’ve also seen some of the reports about the home trends that’s encouraging. That’s another business that has trailed for some number of years. Some of that is embedded in the housing starts and the problems in the mortgage markets. Some of it’s been those generally are bigger ticket decisions and those have been deferred. Some of the disruption in the market with some major retail chains going out of business and liquidating inventory, I think, have depressed that market. But I think as the channel has settled down and as the consumer has delayed purchasing, we’re beginning to see at retail some signs of that customer looking for some fresh fashion. Whether it’s freshening a master bedroom or whether it’s redoing a dining room or whether some of the firming in the real estate values is causing people to freshen their homes, we are seeing that begin to happen and we’re encouraged.
I think we’d like to see more of it over a longer period of time, but for now, it does seem to be firming and that’s a good sign. Tracey, you want to?

We’re seeing a little bit higher flow through this quarter and this year because of hedging results, which was your other question and I’ll talk about that in a moment. So about 50% of the sales decline from a rate standpoint would impact us on an operating income basis as it relates to foreign exchange. 
We also, I think as you’re probably aware, hedge a number of different things. The biggest thing that we hedge is inventory purchases and we hedge those anywhere between six and eight months out, primarily for our European business. But we also do hedge European product for our U.S. business. And given the rate that those hedges were taken out relative to where the euro was currently trading and what we expect to settle those transactions at, we also will have a transaction impact. So the foreign exchange flow through is impacted by that hedging the transaction impact as well as the translation impact.

I think in recent quarters we heard you guys comment you might pursue more of an owned retail strategy in that environment if you didn’t see an improvement in the overall retail environment through your current distribution. It sounds like your comments today could mean you’re seeing sufficiently better trends at wholesale and the strategy may be shifting back a little bit in your minds towards focusing on maybe investing, you know, shifting that investment back to the department stores there. Is that a fair assumption? Is that how you guys are thinking about that market?

I would say the following. Finding a key, I’m going to use the word flagship locations in the handful of key cities in Tokyo is extremely difficult, so those opportunities don’t come around every day and they’re not easy to find. But we do have our eyes and ears open for something that’s appropriate. We do believe in Japan we will have a network one day of our own specialty stores, but we’re trying to get our arms around the existing distribution network, the in shop presentations which as Tracey’s talked to you about the conversion into concession models really means we’re buying the goods; we’re staffing the stores; we’re outfitting the shops; and we’re responsible for the inventory. So we are learning daily about the Japanese customer through that network of hundreds of stores, and I think we will eventually take that learning and use it to complement our own network with that.
Separately, perhaps a higher priority is our own network of stores in the Asia Pacific region, including China, Hong Kong and some of the countries where there is not a robust department store channel and we will have to build our own network of stores over time in order to get the infrastructure supported and the distribution that we’re desiring. So I would put it a little lower on the priority of freestanding stores in Asia Pac, and I would put it a little bit under the heading of learnings now that we’re running these businesses vertically in Japan until we translate that into store locations.

You know as it relates to the supply chain initiatives, I think Roger spoke well about the fact that we really maximized some unique conditions in fiscal 2010. In addition to some of the things that we had described probably three quarters ago that we had started in fiscal ‘9 related to our work with transportation operators that we work with in terms of consolidating shipments and really trying to manage more efficiency into the supply chain, shifting from air to ocean and continuing that process. So we really maximized a lot of that opportunity in fiscal 2010. Some opportunities for that in fiscal 2011, but not nearly to the extent that we saw in fiscal 2010.

So really unlike our own stores where we integrate and mix brands around Ralph’s vision, the department store business in Japan and Asia at the moment, and the concession locations, are very much one brand oriented. And then within that, they’ve been very much key items, basics and commodity items. 
So our first step in the process is really to represent a broader range of offerings and fashions in those categories. We will then try to get some of those shops repositioned to get better adjacencies to where the brand is today versus where it might have been ten years ago, when some of those locations were invested in. And we will try to add to that higher end products which traditionally have not been well represented in Japan or Asia Pacific in general. So it’s an upgrading of fashion content; it’s an upgrading of price points; we’re not going to walk away from the core items or the core basic, but we’ll give them slightly less visual representation and up the brand’s [clotion] of fashion and movement. I think we’ve felt that the business has looked a little static in that part of the world as licensees historically pursue the most simple product and the basic products.
We’ll wrap around that over time ongoing efforts to elevate public relations and marketing, which we think are critical. One of the interesting facts that we received when Ralph and I and the rest of some of the senior management team were in Asia, is how consistently we heard customers there getting their brand and product information from the Internet. And so part of the connection for us in moving our brand in Asia over time will be the ability to communicate to the customer through the online experience. And I think that will be a high focus for us as we try to remix our brand face in that market and how to get that message out.
You can get that message out online a lot faster than regional magazines or billboards or regional newspapers or any other media, so that’s an important learning for us as we try to go forward.

I believe that the last 18 months difficult environment has caused all retailers, whether they’re internal to Polo or whether they’re our wholesale partners, to be more cautious about inventory planning and to be focused on trying to sell through more at full price and turn the inventory faster. I think that is a piece of what every retailer today is looking to do. That then has to be coupled with appropriate sales planning, because if your sales exceed your plans, you’re going to be caught short of inventory and obviously if you miss sales you’re going to be hung with product that needs to be marked down.
So I think what’s happening is, from point of manufacture to ordering to delivery, there’s a lot of pressure on the entire supply chain to be very precise about the level of inventory and the sell throughs. Our inventory, despite a sales increase, is down and another one of those facts that we sort of tumbled on to over the last ten years we’ve added $3 billion in sales and we only have increased inventory by $110 million at Polo Ralph Lauren. So that’s a startling piece of our management effort, that it only took us $110 million more inventory ten years later to add $3 billion of sales.
So I think we’re all getting smarter, I think we’re all getting more demanding and I think we know that what we can’t do is give the customer excess inventory to pick through at discounted prices because based on her prior experience, if they continue to believe that’s possible, they’re going to wait and wait and wait until the products are marked down. So, I think our partners are being more careful, I think we’re being more careful, and I think that puts pressure on subjects like replenishment or chasing hot product, if it’s possible; if there’s raw materials and availability of production; but most of the wholesale models were not built on large amounts of that. So this is something that’s just beginning to evolve as perhaps a longer term trend, which will put pressure on the up front ordering and put more pressure on the supply chain to chase demand dictated by the customer.
So at this point I appreciate it. I’m sorry to have run 15 minutes late. I just thought the fourth quarter and the full year deserved a little fulsome conversation. Hope we’ve had a chance to answer all your questions. Thank you for your support. If you’ve got follow up questions, Jim and Tracey can attempt to answer them during the day. It’s been an incredible year for us. We’re very proud of it and the results we achieved, and we’re very mindful of what the next 12 months hold for us in terms of challenges.

We are reporting terrific first quarter results today with consolidated sales up 13%, operating profit increasing nearly 50% and our diluted EPS rising approximately 60%. 
With better-than-expected sales and gross profit margins in addition to disciplined expense management, we delivered very strong profit flow-through. We experienced broad-based improvements across all base business segments and in most major merchandise categories. And the profitability of our wholesale and retail segments is at or near historic high levels.
In our Wholesale segment, global sales increased 11% in the first quarter. Sales and profit trends were particularly strong in the United States and in Europe, where we are clearly gaining market share. This is especially true for the Polo Men's Sportswear brand. 
Our Lauren apparel merchandise also had a strong season across most product categories, a result of our key item merchandising initiatives. Emerging product categories such as footwear and dresses continue to benefit from expanded distribution and productivity gains at existing locations.
Internationally, our European wholesale performance was good throughout the region. Japanese trends were somewhat softer, a function of market dynamics and our proactive measures to ship less wholesale inventory into the department stores. Building on our wholesale momentum, Lauren handbags will be available in 150 of the top North America department store doors and on ralphlauren.com in less than two weeks' time. National advertising campaigns to support the launch will run in several September magazines.
Our teams have developed very compelling iconic merchandise, with price points that range from $150 to $400. We believe we are offering excellence in design and value to the customer. Of course, we've sold three seasons' worth of merchandise before the end consumer has even seen the first product, so we will update in November how the early deliveries are received by the consumer.
At our Retail segment, consolidated same-store sales were up 7%, reflecting excellent growth in all markets except Japan. Club Monaco's performance was especially noteworthy since it's 25% comp was supported by broad-based improvements in all key performance indicators. And ralphlauren.com continues to deliver outstanding results, growing 15% during the quarter. 
We're in the final stages of launching e-commerce in the United Kingdom in early October. The launch is really a first step in a broader European rollout that is expected to include several other countries over the next few years and will eventually include Asia. The development of international e-commerce will allow us to reach a meaningfully larger audience than we are able to do with brick-and-mortar stores only.
Of course, we continue to open brick-and-mortar stores in strategic locations worldwide. During the first quarter, we opened a magnificent new Paris store on Saint-Germain. There are several events in advance of the opening of that store that allowed us to reinforce to the customers the luxury lifestyle aspects of the Ralph Lauren brand. Store sales have been trending well ahead of expectations, and accessory performances have been particularly strong. This is our third store in Paris, but more than 70% of the customers shopping there are totally new customers to us.
The momentum we have coming off the Saint-Germain opening builds this Fall as we're prepared to unveil two global flagship stores in New York City. One is a new 40,000 square foot structure that will allow us to showcase an expanded assortment of Women's apparel and accessory products, as well as our home collection merchandise. The second is the renovation of the existing Rhinelander Mansion, which will become exclusively Men's Apparel and Accessory Products. 
We've worked for several years to develop this multi-store flagship complex, which also includes our two children's stores on Madison Avenue between 71st and 72nd street. We are very excited to be able to appropriately present the breadth and scope of the world of Ralph Lauren in such a comprehensive and impactful way.
Expanding and elevating our international presence is one of our highest strategic priorities. The best example of executing on this is the evolution of Europe, which has grown dramatically over the last several years and where we continue to gain market share. And despite the considerable news flow of economic and consumer instability throughout Europe, we had an excellent Spring season with our Men's, Women's and Children's products across most countries and channels of distribution.
We believe there is still considerable growth opportunity for us in Europe as we introduce new brands and merchandise categories into the market.
Two weeks ago, we announced that we will assume direct control of our distribution in South Korea beginning on January 1, 2011. Assuming control of South Korea is another important milestone in our broader Asia growth strategy. Once that transition is made, we will fully control our distribution throughout Asia, arguably the fastest-growing consumer market in the world for luxury goods. It enables us to directly operate all of Asia with greater consistency across all markets and channel in a manner that is more closely aligned with our global brand positioning and objectives.
Today, with our brand sales across Asia at approximately $850 million, concentrated primarily in Japan and South Korea, our long-term goal is to have the region represent 1/3 of our global sales, which implies significant growth from its current levels. We've been working on this goal progressively over the last several years. We started by taking control of our Japanese operations about three years ago. Since then, we've made major strides in enhancing the organizational capabilities of our operations. In the context of challenging department store trends, we are gaining market share and we're meaningfully improving our profitability.
Seven months ago, we assumed control of our operations in eight Asian countries, most notably China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. As many of you know, we've since built a Hong Kong-based hub that is not only meant to support our current and rather modest distribution in this newly transitioned countries but also to act as a platform for transformational growth throughout Asia. 
With South Korea coming on board, we will be assuming a customer base that has been developed over the last 12 years. The market currently represents $230 million in revenue through a network of 175 shop-in-shops and five free-standing locations, making it the third largest single country for us in terms of sales volume.
South Korea has developed strong appreciation for our iconic lifestyle sensibility, and we are excited to build on this success, leverage best practices as we grow our presence and build brand awareness in other parts of Asia. 
The first quarter results are strong by any measure, and we achieved this performance even as we intensified our investment in strategic growth initiatives across channels, geographies and merchandise categories. The operational discipline of our global teams and the robust sell-throughs with we consistently referred to over the last several quarters, delivered excellent margins and yielded incremental market share opportunities for us.
As we assess the outlook for the rest of the year, there's no question the overall operating environment remains uncertain. Traffic trends are lacklusters and consumers are still being selective with their purchases. A strong value orientation continues to prevail, and the mood remains subdued as evidenced by the recent decline in consumer sentiment. 
In Europe, the overwhelming belief is that economic growth will continue to slow. Wholesale customers remain conservative with their initial orders in the United States. Foreign exchange rates are dynamic and cost of goods inflations are substantial challenges that begin to merge for us in the second quarter and are expected to persist the remaining of the year. They are key drivers in the difference between our first quarter results and our full-year expectations. 
In spite of these external challenges, we are confident in our ability to execute against our strategic objectives for the balance of the year. Our portfolio of brands and products and exceptional merchandise strategies allow us to be responsive to market dynamics in a manner that is consistent with our goal of elevating and protecting our brands. The importance of trusted brands and compelling product is critical, and our unique competitive advantage in this area has enabled us to continue to perform at a high level around the world. There's no better proof of this than our first quarter results and really, our performance over the last couple years.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tracey."
362220,109483756,72065,"Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Aug-04-2010",2010-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Roger, and good morning everyone. For the first quarter, consolidated net revenues were $1.2 billion, 13% greater than the prior-year period and in line with the expectations we outlined for you in May.

For the first quarter, consolidated net revenues were $1.2 billion, 13% greater than the prior-year period and in line with the expectations we outlined for you in May. The growth in net revenues reflects double-digit gains for our Wholesale and Retail segments that were partially offset by lower Licensing revenues. 
As a reminder, Japanese concession shop sales and profits, which had previously been reported in our Wholesale segment, are now included in our Retail segment along with our newly acquired Asian concession shop business. Our press release and financials related to the press release reflect the impact of this change in our Japan segment classification, both for the current quarter and the comparable prior-year period.
The net negative impact of currency translation on our total reported revenue growth for the first quarter was less than 1%. Our gross profit rate increased 310 basis points to a record level of 61.8%, reflecting improved profitability across most major merchandise categories and geographic regions, primarily as a result of continued disciplined inventory management and higher full priced selling, as well as favorable geographic product and channel mix. Continued savings from our sourcing and supply chain initiatives also supported our gross profit margin expansion in the first quarter.
The broad-based improvement in the first quarter gross profit rate was a significant driver of our outperformance relative to our expectations on our last call. Operating expenses in the first quarter were approximately 11% greater than the prior-year period. The higher operating expenses reflect incremental costs associated with newly transitioned Asian operations and continued investment in our strategic growth initiatives, such as European e-commerce, new store openings and infrastructure support.
Despite this higher level of investment spending, we were able to achieve 70 basis points of operating expense leverage during the quarter as a result of strong sales growth and continued core business expense discipline. Our ability to leverage operating expenses was another important driver of our outperformance relative to our first quarter expectations. 
Operating income for the first quarter was $174 million, 49% greater than the prior-year period. Our operating margin also showed considerable improvement, expanding 370 basis points to 15.1%. The growth in operating income and expansion in the operating margin rate reflect improved profitability across all channels of distribution and most geographies and was partially offset by incremental expenses associated with the business expansion.
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 increased 57% to $121 million and net income per diluted share rose 59% to $1.21 compared to the prior-year period. The growth in net income and net income per diluted share principally relates to the higher operating income I just discussed, as well as a lower effective tax rate of 29% compared to 33% in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The lower tax rate this year reflects the favorable resolution of discrete tax items in the quarter.
Regarding our segment highlights for the quarter. Our Wholesale segment sales increased 11% to $523 million. The increase was supported by double-digit shipment growth in the U.S. and in constant currency in Europe. From a product perspective, shipment of our core Men's, Women's and Children's apparel merchandise were particularly strong during the quarter as were domestic shipments of Polo and Lauren branded footwear.
Our first quarter wholesale operating income rose 41% to $108 million and the wholesale operating margin expanded 440 basis points to 20.6%. The substantial improvement in wholesale operating income and margin rate were primarily a result of higher global shipments and improved Wholesale segment gross profit rates, a function of strong sell-throughs at retail supported by continued inventory discipline, favorable product mix, particularly with basic stock replenishment merchandise, and continued sourcing and supply chain benefits.
Expenses during the quarter, including investments for strategic initiatives such as handbags, were leveraged with the higher overall segment sales. For our retail group, first quarter sales rose 16% to $593 million, reflecting incremental sales from newly assumed stores and concession shops in the Asia region, solid comparable store sales growth and the contribution from newly opened stores. 
Overall comp store sales increased 7%, reflecting a 2% decline at Ralph Lauren stores, which was primarily a function of lower Japanese sales and increased 8% at factory stores and an impressive 25% increase at Club Monaco stores that was accomplished with the support of a strong Women's and Accessories assortment.
Ralphlauren.com sales increased 15% this quarter. The growth in Retail segment sales is particularly noteworthy as the comparable prior-year period included Easter, which shifted this calendar year into our fiscal fourth quarter 2010 results. Our 7% comp growth was primarily achieved through higher average dollar transaction values mostly due to greater full price selling activity. Traffic to our U.S. stores was essentially flat with the prior-year period, and urban markets and key tourist destinations continue to outperform the average comp trend. In Europe, our retail concepts benefited from an increase in transactions in addition to higher average dollar per transaction sales.
European factory store performance was particularly strong across regions during the quarter, and Japanese factory store sales grew at a strong double-digit rate. Sales for our newly transitioned Asian stores and concession shops demonstrated progressive improvement throughout the quarter. We continue to learn about the unique characteristics of each of our regions in terms of customer taste and preferences and are evolving our merchandise allocations to better address the needs of each market.
During the first quarter, we opened eight directly operated freestanding stores and closed five stores, ending the quarter with 355 company-operated stores. We also operated 293 concession shop locations throughout Asia at the end of the first quarter.
Our Retail segment operating income grew 50% to $104 million in the first quarter, and the retail operating margin increased 400 basis points to 17.5%. The substantial improvement in retail operating income and the expansion in margin rate comes as a result of broad-based profit improvement across most retail concepts, particularly in the U.S. and in Europe. 
Sales growth and reduced markdowns due to a continued focus on aligning inventory levels with sales trends were the primary drivers of the improvement, which was partially offset by incremental expenses related to our newly assumed Asian operations.
Licensing royalties for the quarter were $38 million, 8% below the first quarter of fiscal 2010, primarily due to the transition of formerly licensed Asian operations and lower home Licensing revenues. Operating income for our Licensing segment declined 7% to $24 million.
We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments and $801 million in net cash. Inventories were up 3% from the prior-year period, inclusive of the incremental inventory to support the nearly 100 newly transitioned Asian concession shops and stores and the 12 net new stores we added over the last 12 months. Excluding the incremental Asian inventory, consolidated inventory declined 4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to the comparable prior-year period last year.
For the last 12 months, our return on equity was 18% and our return on investment was 35%. We spent approximately $39 million on CapEx during the first quarter to support our new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments. We also repurchased $2.7 million shares of stock, utilizing $231 million of our current authorization. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $319 million remaining under our authorized share repurchase program.
We are very pleased with our first quarter results, recognizing that in the first quarter of last year, we were still experiencing negative comps due to challenging retail traffic trends. Our profit performance reflects the operational discipline of our organization, particularly as we continue to invest in strategic growth initiatives this year. The trends have been better than we initially anticipated back in May, and this momentum supports our commitment to continuing to invest for long-term growth.
During the remainder of fiscal 2011, we will be managing the launch of our U.K. e-commerce website and the launch of Lauren handbags. We will also continue to manage startup of our Hong Kong-based operations while assuming the additional start-up of the South Korean operations. Due to the additional investment related to these startups and the sales and distribution build required for our new products, new channels and new geographies, these initiatives won't have an immediate positive impact on profit this year. However, we do expect them to be meaningful future contributors to profit growth for the company.
In this morning's press release, we provided our updated outlook for the year. Apart from the continued momentum we are experiencing for our core business, there are a few important differences between the first quarter trends and our expectations for the remainder of fiscal 2011. 
The first is an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact, which will depress reported sales and gross profit margins. Another is the evolution of our consolidated Asia strategy, which will result in some near-term deleveraging of operating expenses in order to pursue the considerable sales and profit potential we expect from this region over the long term. And we continue to anticipate cost of goods inflation relative to rising labor and raw material costs in the latter part of our fiscal year.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we currently expect consolidated net revenues to increase at a high single-digit rate. Our expectations are based on a low single-digit increase in global wholesale sales, which reflects continued growth in the U.S. and in constant currency in Europe, that is partially offset by meaningful negative currency translation and the decline in wholesale shipments in Japan to better align with sell-through trends in the department stores. For our Retail segment, we currently expect mid-single-digit comps, which also reflects softness in our Japanese store concession sales due to sales trends and reduced clearance inventory.
The negative impact of foreign currency translation on our reported sales is expected to be most dramatic during our second quarter.
Our operating margin for the second quarter is expected to be 100 basis points to 150 basis points below that achieved in the prior-year period. This decline is a function of both gross margin pressure, due almost entirely to foreign exchange impact, and incremental expenses and reduced profit associated with our various Asian investment initiatives, inclusive of Japan.
Costs associated with preparing for the transition of the South Korean operations are expected to be diluted by $0.02 to $0.03 in the second quarter. Partially offsetting the dilution is continued growth in the U.S. and Europe in constant dollars, as I mentioned previously. 
For the full year, fiscal 2011 period, we expect consolidated revenues to increase at a mid- to high single-digit rate, led by our Retail segment and partially offset by a high single-digit decline in Licensing revenues, which primarily reflects the impact of our assuming more direct control over certain geography.
Included in our expectations is approximately 150 to 200 basis points of net unfavorable currency translation impact on our sales for the full year fiscal 2011 period. As a reminder, our outlook for fiscal 2011 is for a 52-week period and compares with fiscal 2010's 53-week period. The fourth quarter's extra week of sales and profit will not be anniversaried.
Based on the first quarter's better-than-expected profitability and in spite of higher investment spending and uncertain global economic trends that we expect to impact us for the remainder of the year, we have raised our outlook for the full fiscal year. We now expect to achieve a low-teen operating margin rate in the fiscal 2011, up from our prior expectation of low double-digit operating margin rates. 
Our outlook still assumes a decline in operating margin from fiscal 2010's level, and that's primarily due to gross margin pressure and unfavorable foreign currency.
The negative impact on our gross profit margin attributable to exchange rate dynamics is estimated at approximately 100 basis in each of the remaining quarters of fiscal 2011. We also continue to manage cost of goods inflation, particularly as it relates to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, a function of rising raw materials, labor and freight costs as well as tightened factory and freight capacity, which could limit our flexibility in our global supply chain.
Accelerated investment in our growth initiatives, most notably in Asia, international e-commerce and flagship stores is also expected to weigh on our full year operating margin rate. Dilution related to the transition of South Korea is estimated at approximately $0.08 to $0.10 per share in full fiscal 2011, reflecting the impact of transaction expenses and other costs associated with the transition of the business. 
Most of the anticipated South Korea dilution in fiscal 2011 is one-time in nature. We continue to expect a fiscal 2011 tax rate of 34%, primarily due to the anticipated geographic earnings mix for the balance of the year.
We will continue to manage our business with operational discipline, while making what we believe are the right investments to create additional shareholder value over the long term. We are pleased with the progress we have made with our strategic growth initiatives thus far, and we are excited about the many milestones fiscal 2011 will bring on that front: the expansion of handbags, integration of Asia and the launch of European e-commerce. 
And with that, I'll conclude the company's remarks and open the call up for your questions. Operator, would you assist us with that, please? Operator?"

Raw materials, if you start with that, be it cotton or wool or any of the raw materials, have seen meaningful jumps from last year at this time; although on some levels, last year's was somewhat depressed. But still, the this year-last year comparison is worth note. Second issue is really the labor situations, whether it's the real Cut, Make and Trim or the scarcity of labor that is going on around the world as a result of capacity reductions and perhaps rising labor in countries like China. And then the third piece would be the transportation around the world. I think we're going to see that slowly rising as the year goes on, but the real impact will be most critically felt in the spring merchandise, which for us will be fourth quarter. We've looked at global pricing, whether it's in Asia, Europe or the United States, and where appropriate, we've been willing to take some price increases. But we're very mindful of the economic conditions and a skittish customer. And really, there's no way we're going to take the full cost of goods increases and pass them on. So it's a merchandise category, and item carefully thought through by region is the way we're looking at it, and that would really come into play for spring calendar '11 and on. And again, I'm not sure how everybody else is treating these increases, but that's our point of view."

Adrianne, we spent a lot of time recently not only on the budgets for this year but the quarter-by-quarter outlook. And one of the conclusions we've reached upon reflection on the first quarter results is, the extraordinary performance that you've noted was really driven by the core businesses in constant currency really outperforming. And I think the headline on the quarter is not the things we identified that might be short-term drags, didn't drag down. The answer is they did. It was really the core businesses outperforming either our competitors or own expectations that powered us through the quarter, whether it's retail or wholesale, whether it was online, whether it was Ralph Lauren product or even Club Monaco, which had an extraordinary quarter as you can see. It was the core businesses that we've invested and managed so carefully over the years outperforming and the new initiatives keep going. So whether it's the start-up of handbags or the start-up of e-commerce, whether it's the start-up of Asia and now our very exciting announcement over Korea, all of those short-term impacts actually occurred. It was the core businesses outperforming. Now the only business that I would say didn't outperform were the Ralph Lauren stores, although the number we reported, which is a blend of Ralph Lauren stores and concession stores in Japan is a little misleading because the concession business in the department stores in Japan was down. And really worldwide, the Ralph Lauren Store business was up in the single digits. So it's really a rolled-up number that is a little misleading. But we are seeing the high-end customer in apparel stay more cautious than the customers in other product categories and other channels of distribution. I think based on what I'm seeing around, the high-end accessory customer has perhaps come back a little stronger than the high-end apparel business. So we're very mindful of that as we head into the Fall selling and are watching that very carefully."

But what's the wholesales -- the wholesale revenues have come in maybe a little bit below where you guys thought for a couple of quarters in a row.?

And then following up just quickly on the operating margins, also there it seems like you guys updated your guidance to be low teens from low-double digits, so maybe a couple of percentage point increase.

As to the first part, it is clear to us that the retailer continues to be very proud of themselves, for managing inventories carefully and seeing margin recoveries as people have reported spring and Summer results. I think you've all seen that. I think that's also led them to continue to be more cautious about, open to buys going forward than probably the sell-through and the results would indicate. However, as I said to Adrianne, we did have a very strong by-brand, by-merchandise category performance for spring. We do believe we're taking share in many of the major categories. And while the retailer is being cautious and some of that sales this spring was based on [ph] chase (52:21) product or reorder product or replenishment product, we are beginning to feel better about the retailer putting a little more open-to-buy on the table up front. I believe it's probably coming from some other part of their assortment, so they are not incrementally adding a lot to their total inventory, but I think we're picking up share. We have reasonable visibility through Fall, holiday and beginning to develop more visibility into spring. So we are feeling better about that in the domestic business and the Europe business. As you know, most of Asia today is not run through the wholesale model, so that's more a function of how our stores will perform over there over time. So net-net, coming out of spring, Summer, we're feeling a little more bullish than maybe we did halfway through the spring and I think we're picking up some share."

We continue to hear difficult economic news out of Europe, although the last couple weeks or months have shown some signs of stabilizing as people better digested the issues in Greece and some of the other countries. But as a headline statement, our business, I think it's fair to say, has outperformed the marketplace. We do have excellent management and excellent strategies that are operating very efficiently. But it continues to be a story of, some countries are softer, i.e., Italy and Spain, although there's been a little bit of a pick-up in Spain recently. And the more northern and central countries have outperformed, be they France, Germany, the U.K. or Scandinavia. And that's remained pretty consistent through the spring season. The Italian business particularly is based on specialty store distribution. And those specialty owners, after several years of difficult conditions, are really people that have to manage tightly their own personal cash flows and we've got to manage the credit risk. So I think we'll see turbulence in the Italian market for a while until that market gets better macroeconomic results. So overall, strong results in Europe powered by those big countries. We've also seen a return to key markets like Russia, like the Middle East, like Istanbul, which are all running strong increases versus a year ago when that business got particularly banged around. So very pleased with the results out of Europe, particular strengths in Men's wear, strong seasons in Women's, kids and jeans and improving and growing business in Lauren, where we distributed Women's product for the first time there a couple years ago and we're beginning to get some nice traction. So that's really the summary of Europe. And I think the Paris store opening, while you could say is specifically Paris, I do believe the marketing, the advertising, the brand focus did have a halo effect not only on all of the French market but really across the Western countries."

I think as a starting point for this, you have to look at what the stores did in response to the contraction over the last two years, where they eliminated perhaps smaller brands, more marginal brands as a compelling proposition to the customer. Certainly, they've been growing private label. So I think it created an opportunity for all Polo Ralph Lauren products that we are so carefully managing from a product and merchandising point of view. And our responsiveness, I think we've been very good at responding to consumer trends on much shorter lead times than perhaps in the past. So I think the overall brand equity, as we continue to raise our global profile, we continue to make investments in things like e-commerce and/or 72nd Street. That brand elevation, I think, makes the product even more appealing to a department store customer who's buying a piece of a lifestyle dream through those products in that channel. And the teams are very carefully going merchandise category by merchandise category, looking for distortion opportunities with appropriate products. Our ability to sell through at more full price sell-throughs, which allow the stores to make higher margins, our sales to square foot, which in some cases are two or three times the department average. So obviously, the gross margin dollars per foot are extraordinarily different than our peers' or competitors'. I think all of that's playing out to our advantage.

And not unlike other licensed international territories, their orientation has been to Men's Casual Sportswear. And the $230 million that we talk about is heavily oriented towards that product, and it does remarkably well. There is definitely an opportunity in that market to develop other product categories over time to much more important positions. Whether it's Women's, whether it's kids, whether it's Accessories or denim, they are very tilted towards casual Men's Sportswear. And what we observed in our multiple trips there is that South Korea is also a major shopping mecca for the Chinese. And the Chinese are very smart about arbitraging price throughout the region and throughout the world. And so getting the brand to be consistent to what they see in a Paris or what they've seen in a New York or what they're going to see in a Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, in Seoul, Korea and other parts is critical, we think, to support the network not just South Korea. But it's a distorted country. As we've said, it's the third largest single country in the world for us. And so our ability to, starting January 1, begin to move the assortments to a more elevated, tiered and broader merchandise category, we think is one of the real exciting opportunities of Asia-Pacific."

So could you give us just a little bit of color, Roger, how you're thinking about that from a long-term vantage point as far as how you trade off one versus the other?"

It's one of the reasons that we're so excited about the Europe launch. We expect to learn quickly and then move out through the rest of the countries there. That's why I said on my opening remarks that we will research and then figure out how we want to do business in Asia and Japan. It's also why you read today a lot of pundits talking about 70%, 80% of the future growth in retail could come out of e-commerce, as a general headline. So the fact that we're 10 years into this, we've got a very talented team, it's important to us, we've figured out not only the front end but the service equation and commit to very high standards, gives us a lot of encouragement. It also is relatively low capital investment compared to brick-and-mortar stores. And therefore, if you get it right and you get the necessary infrastructure right, it's really about keeping up with the technology and the ability to stay current with customers' expectations or in fact lead them with some new ideas, which we've done. The other interesting aspect of e-commerce is, it is been proven that its impact across channels, whether our wholesale channel or our own retail channel, is compelling. So you would not be wrong in saying that as we go forward, focus on retail will have a heavy component of e-commerce. I don't think it replaces doing appropriate brick-and-mortar retail, and I think our challenge will be, by market, to figure out the mix and the ROIs and the how to reach customers and what the messaging will be. But there's no doubt that e-commerce from here on out will grow in its penetration through retail, and in fact will grow in its penetration to our total distribution strategy and should provide very nice profit returns and ROI returns as we expand and open around the world. There are obviously some start-up costs opening in Europe and there will eventually be in Asia, but I think our willingness to stay with this business in the early years and figure it out, for a single brand site that has distribution around the world, I think it's been a remarkable success for us and we're going look to grow that as a percent of our total business and particularly retail. 
So with that, I think we've concluded the first quarter remarks. I appreciate the support and interest on all of your parts. First quarter was clearly beyond our expectations, and we'll see how the rest of the year plays out. Thank you."

We are reporting terrific first quarter results today with consolidated sales up 13%, operating profit increasing nearly 50% and our diluted EPS rising approximately 60%. 
With better-than-expected sales and gross profit margins in addition to disciplined expense management, we delivered very strong profit flow-through. We experienced broad-based improvements across all base business segments and in most major merchandise categories. And the profitability of our wholesale and retail segments is at or near historic high levels.
In our Wholesale segment, global sales increased 11% in the first quarter. Sales and profit trends were particularly strong in the United States and in Europe, where we are clearly gaining market share. This is especially true for the Polo Men's Sportswear brand. 
Our Lauren apparel merchandise also had a strong season across most product categories, a result of our key item merchandising initiatives. Emerging product categories such as footwear and dresses continue to benefit from expanded distribution and productivity gains at existing locations.
Internationally, our European wholesale performance was good throughout the region. Japanese trends were somewhat softer, a function of market dynamics and our proactive measures to ship less wholesale inventory into the department stores. Building on our wholesale momentum, Lauren handbags will be available in 150 of the top North America department store doors and on ralphlauren.com in less than two weeks' time. National advertising campaigns to support the launch will run in several September magazines.
Our teams have developed very compelling iconic merchandise, with price points that range from $150 to $400. We believe we are offering excellence in design and value to the customer. Of course, we've sold three seasons' worth of merchandise before the end consumer has even seen the first product, so we will update in November how the early deliveries are received by the consumer.
At our Retail segment, consolidated same-store sales were up 7%, reflecting excellent growth in all markets except Japan. Club Monaco's performance was especially noteworthy since it's 25% comp was supported by broad-based improvements in all key performance indicators. And ralphlauren.com continues to deliver outstanding results, growing 15% during the quarter. 
We're in the final stages of launching e-commerce in the United Kingdom in early October. The launch is really a first step in a broader European rollout that is expected to include several other countries over the next few years and will eventually include Asia. The development of international e-commerce will allow us to reach a meaningfully larger audience than we are able to do with brick-and-mortar stores only.
Of course, we continue to open brick-and-mortar stores in strategic locations worldwide. During the first quarter, we opened a magnificent new Paris store on Saint-Germain. There are several events in advance of the opening of that store that allowed us to reinforce to the customers the luxury lifestyle aspects of the Ralph Lauren brand. Store sales have been trending well ahead of expectations, and accessory performances have been particularly strong. This is our third store in Paris, but more than 70% of the customers shopping there are totally new customers to us.
The momentum we have coming off the Saint-Germain opening builds this Fall as we're prepared to unveil two global flagship stores in New York City. One is a new 40,000 square foot structure that will allow us to showcase an expanded assortment of Women's apparel and accessory products, as well as our home collection merchandise. The second is the renovation of the existing Rhinelander Mansion, which will become exclusively Men's Apparel and Accessory Products. 
We've worked for several years to develop this multi-store flagship complex, which also includes our two children's stores on Madison Avenue between 71st and 72nd street. We are very excited to be able to appropriately present the breadth and scope of the world of Ralph Lauren in such a comprehensive and impactful way.
Expanding and elevating our international presence is one of our highest strategic priorities. The best example of executing on this is the evolution of Europe, which has grown dramatically over the last several years and where we continue to gain market share. And despite the considerable news flow of economic and consumer instability throughout Europe, we had an excellent Spring season with our Men's, Women's and Children's products across most countries and channels of distribution.
We believe there is still considerable growth opportunity for us in Europe as we introduce new brands and merchandise categories into the market.
Two weeks ago, we announced that we will assume direct control of our distribution in South Korea beginning on January 1, 2011. Assuming control of South Korea is another important milestone in our broader Asia growth strategy. Once that transition is made, we will fully control our distribution throughout Asia, arguably the fastest-growing consumer market in the world for luxury goods. It enables us to directly operate all of Asia with greater consistency across all markets and channel in a manner that is more closely aligned with our global brand positioning and objectives.
Today, with our brand sales across Asia at approximately $850 million, concentrated primarily in Japan and South Korea, our long-term goal is to have the region represent 1/3 of our global sales, which implies significant growth from its current levels. We've been working on this goal progressively over the last several years. We started by taking control of our Japanese operations about three years ago. Since then, we've made major strides in enhancing the organizational capabilities of our operations. In the context of challenging department store trends, we are gaining market share and we're meaningfully improving our profitability.
Seven months ago, we assumed control of our operations in eight Asian countries, most notably China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. As many of you know, we've since built a Hong Kong-based hub that is not only meant to support our current and rather modest distribution in this newly transitioned countries but also to act as a platform for transformational growth throughout Asia. 
With South Korea coming on board, we will be assuming a customer base that has been developed over the last 12 years. The market currently represents $230 million in revenue through a network of 175 shop-in-shops and five free-standing locations, making it the third largest single country for us in terms of sales volume.
South Korea has developed strong appreciation for our iconic lifestyle sensibility, and we are excited to build on this success, leverage best practices as we grow our presence and build brand awareness in other parts of Asia. 
The first quarter results are strong by any measure, and we achieved this performance even as we intensified our investment in strategic growth initiatives across channels, geographies and merchandise categories. The operational discipline of our global teams and the robust sell-throughs with we consistently referred to over the last several quarters, delivered excellent margins and yielded incremental market share opportunities for us.
As we assess the outlook for the rest of the year, there's no question the overall operating environment remains uncertain. Traffic trends are lacklusters and consumers are still being selective with their purchases. A strong value orientation continues to prevail, and the mood remains subdued as evidenced by the recent decline in consumer sentiment. 
In Europe, the overwhelming belief is that economic growth will continue to slow. Wholesale customers remain conservative with their initial orders in the United States. Foreign exchange rates are dynamic and cost of goods inflations are substantial challenges that begin to merge for us in the second quarter and are expected to persist the remaining of the year. They are key drivers in the difference between our first quarter results and our full-year expectations. 
In spite of these external challenges, we are confident in our ability to execute against our strategic objectives for the balance of the year. Our portfolio of brands and products and exceptional merchandise strategies allow us to be responsive to market dynamics in a manner that is consistent with our goal of elevating and protecting our brands. The importance of trusted brands and compelling product is critical, and our unique competitive advantage in this area has enabled us to continue to perform at a high level around the world. There's no better proof of this than our first quarter results and really, our performance over the last couple years.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tracey.

362220,109483756,72083,"Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Aug-04-2010",2010-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Roger, and good morning everyone.

For the first quarter, consolidated net revenues were $1.2 billion, 13% greater than the prior-year period and in line with the expectations we outlined for you in May. The growth in net revenues reflects double-digit gains for our Wholesale and Retail segments that were partially offset by lower Licensing revenues. 
As a reminder, Japanese concession shop sales and profits, which had previously been reported in our Wholesale segment, are now included in our Retail segment along with our newly acquired Asian concession shop business. Our press release and financials related to the press release reflect the impact of this change in our Japan segment classification, both for the current quarter and the comparable prior-year period.
The net negative impact of currency translation on our total reported revenue growth for the first quarter was less than 1%. Our gross profit rate increased 310 basis points to a record level of 61.8%, reflecting improved profitability across most major merchandise categories and geographic regions, primarily as a result of continued disciplined inventory management and higher full priced selling, as well as favorable geographic product and channel mix. Continued savings from our sourcing and supply chain initiatives also supported our gross profit margin expansion in the first quarter.
The broad-based improvement in the first quarter gross profit rate was a significant driver of our outperformance relative to our expectations on our last call. Operating expenses in the first quarter were approximately 11% greater than the prior-year period. The higher operating expenses reflect incremental costs associated with newly transitioned Asian operations and continued investment in our strategic growth initiatives, such as European e-commerce, new store openings and infrastructure support.
Despite this higher level of investment spending, we were able to achieve 70 basis points of operating expense leverage during the quarter as a result of strong sales growth and continued core business expense discipline. Our ability to leverage operating expenses was another important driver of our outperformance relative to our first quarter expectations. 
Operating income for the first quarter was $174 million, 49% greater than the prior-year period. Our operating margin also showed considerable improvement, expanding 370 basis points to 15.1%. The growth in operating income and expansion in the operating margin rate reflect improved profitability across all channels of distribution and most geographies and was partially offset by incremental expenses associated with the business expansion.
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 increased 57% to $121 million and net income per diluted share rose 59% to $1.21 compared to the prior-year period. The growth in net income and net income per diluted share principally relates to the higher operating income I just discussed, as well as a lower effective tax rate of 29% compared to 33% in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The lower tax rate this year reflects the favorable resolution of discrete tax items in the quarter.
Regarding our segment highlights for the quarter. Our Wholesale segment sales increased 11% to $523 million. The increase was supported by double-digit shipment growth in the U.S. and in constant currency in Europe. From a product perspective, shipment of our core Men's, Women's and Children's apparel merchandise were particularly strong during the quarter as were domestic shipments of Polo and Lauren branded footwear.
Our first quarter wholesale operating income rose 41% to $108 million and the wholesale operating margin expanded 440 basis points to 20.6%. The substantial improvement in wholesale operating income and margin rate were primarily a result of higher global shipments and improved Wholesale segment gross profit rates, a function of strong sell-throughs at retail supported by continued inventory discipline, favorable product mix, particularly with basic stock replenishment merchandise, and continued sourcing and supply chain benefits.
Expenses during the quarter, including investments for strategic initiatives such as handbags, were leveraged with the higher overall segment sales. For our retail group, first quarter sales rose 16% to $593 million, reflecting incremental sales from newly assumed stores and concession shops in the Asia region, solid comparable store sales growth and the contribution from newly opened stores. 
Overall comp store sales increased 7%, reflecting a 2% decline at Ralph Lauren stores, which was primarily a function of lower Japanese sales and increased 8% at factory stores and an impressive 25% increase at Club Monaco stores that was accomplished with the support of a strong Women's and Accessories assortment.
Ralphlauren.com sales increased 15% this quarter. The growth in Retail segment sales is particularly noteworthy as the comparable prior-year period included Easter, which shifted this calendar year into our fiscal fourth quarter 2010 results. Our 7% comp growth was primarily achieved through higher average dollar transaction values mostly due to greater full price selling activity. Traffic to our U.S. stores was essentially flat with the prior-year period, and urban markets and key tourist destinations continue to outperform the average comp trend. In Europe, our retail concepts benefited from an increase in transactions in addition to higher average dollar per transaction sales.
European factory store performance was particularly strong across regions during the quarter, and Japanese factory store sales grew at a strong double-digit rate. Sales for our newly transitioned Asian stores and concession shops demonstrated progressive improvement throughout the quarter. We continue to learn about the unique characteristics of each of our regions in terms of customer taste and preferences and are evolving our merchandise allocations to better address the needs of each market.
During the first quarter, we opened eight directly operated freestanding stores and closed five stores, ending the quarter with 355 company-operated stores. We also operated 293 concession shop locations throughout Asia at the end of the first quarter.
Our Retail segment operating income grew 50% to $104 million in the first quarter, and the retail operating margin increased 400 basis points to 17.5%. The substantial improvement in retail operating income and the expansion in margin rate comes as a result of broad-based profit improvement across most retail concepts, particularly in the U.S. and in Europe. 
Sales growth and reduced markdowns due to a continued focus on aligning inventory levels with sales trends were the primary drivers of the improvement, which was partially offset by incremental expenses related to our newly assumed Asian operations.
Licensing royalties for the quarter were $38 million, 8% below the first quarter of fiscal 2010, primarily due to the transition of formerly licensed Asian operations and lower home Licensing revenues. Operating income for our Licensing segment declined 7% to $24 million.
We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments and $801 million in net cash. Inventories were up 3% from the prior-year period, inclusive of the incremental inventory to support the nearly 100 newly transitioned Asian concession shops and stores and the 12 net new stores we added over the last 12 months. Excluding the incremental Asian inventory, consolidated inventory declined 4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to the comparable prior-year period last year.
For the last 12 months, our return on equity was 18% and our return on investment was 35%. We spent approximately $39 million on CapEx during the first quarter to support our new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments. We also repurchased $2.7 million shares of stock, utilizing $231 million of our current authorization. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $319 million remaining under our authorized share repurchase program.
We are very pleased with our first quarter results, recognizing that in the first quarter of last year, we were still experiencing negative comps due to challenging retail traffic trends. Our profit performance reflects the operational discipline of our organization, particularly as we continue to invest in strategic growth initiatives this year. The trends have been better than we initially anticipated back in May, and this momentum supports our commitment to continuing to invest for long-term growth.
During the remainder of fiscal 2011, we will be managing the launch of our U.K. e-commerce website and the launch of Lauren handbags. We will also continue to manage startup of our Hong Kong-based operations while assuming the additional start-up of the South Korean operations. Due to the additional investment related to these startups and the sales and distribution build required for our new products, new channels and new geographies, these initiatives won't have an immediate positive impact on profit this year. However, we do expect them to be meaningful future contributors to profit growth for the company.
In this morning's press release, we provided our updated outlook for the year. Apart from the continued momentum we are experiencing for our core business, there are a few important differences between the first quarter trends and our expectations for the remainder of fiscal 2011. 
The first is an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact, which will depress reported sales and gross profit margins. Another is the evolution of our consolidated Asia strategy, which will result in some near-term deleveraging of operating expenses in order to pursue the considerable sales and profit potential we expect from this region over the long term. And we continue to anticipate cost of goods inflation relative to rising labor and raw material costs in the latter part of our fiscal year.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we currently expect consolidated net revenues to increase at a high single-digit rate. Our expectations are based on a low single-digit increase in global wholesale sales, which reflects continued growth in the U.S. and in constant currency in Europe, that is partially offset by meaningful negative currency translation and the decline in wholesale shipments in Japan to better align with sell-through trends in the department stores. For our Retail segment, we currently expect mid-single-digit comps, which also reflects softness in our Japanese store concession sales due to sales trends and reduced clearance inventory.
The negative impact of foreign currency translation on our reported sales is expected to be most dramatic during our second quarter.
Our operating margin for the second quarter is expected to be 100 basis points to 150 basis points below that achieved in the prior-year period. This decline is a function of both gross margin pressure, due almost entirely to foreign exchange impact, and incremental expenses and reduced profit associated with our various Asian investment initiatives, inclusive of Japan.
Costs associated with preparing for the transition of the South Korean operations are expected to be diluted by $0.02 to $0.03 in the second quarter. Partially offsetting the dilution is continued growth in the U.S. and Europe in constant dollars, as I mentioned previously. 
For the full year, fiscal 2011 period, we expect consolidated revenues to increase at a mid- to high single-digit rate, led by our Retail segment and partially offset by a high single-digit decline in Licensing revenues, which primarily reflects the impact of our assuming more direct control over certain geography.
Included in our expectations is approximately 150 to 200 basis points of net unfavorable currency translation impact on our sales for the full year fiscal 2011 period. As a reminder, our outlook for fiscal 2011 is for a 52-week period and compares with fiscal 2010's 53-week period. The fourth quarter's extra week of sales and profit will not be anniversaried.
Based on the first quarter's better-than-expected profitability and in spite of higher investment spending and uncertain global economic trends that we expect to impact us for the remainder of the year, we have raised our outlook for the full fiscal year. We now expect to achieve a low-teen operating margin rate in the fiscal 2011, up from our prior expectation of low double-digit operating margin rates. 
Our outlook still assumes a decline in operating margin from fiscal 2010's level, and that's primarily due to gross margin pressure and unfavorable foreign currency.
The negative impact on our gross profit margin attributable to exchange rate dynamics is estimated at approximately 100 basis in each of the remaining quarters of fiscal 2011. We also continue to manage cost of goods inflation, particularly as it relates to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, a function of rising raw materials, labor and freight costs as well as tightened factory and freight capacity, which could limit our flexibility in our global supply chain.
Accelerated investment in our growth initiatives, most notably in Asia, international e-commerce and flagship stores is also expected to weigh on our full year operating margin rate. Dilution related to the transition of South Korea is estimated at approximately $0.08 to $0.10 per share in full fiscal 2011, reflecting the impact of transaction expenses and other costs associated with the transition of the business. 
Most of the anticipated South Korea dilution in fiscal 2011 is one-time in nature. We continue to expect a fiscal 2011 tax rate of 34%, primarily due to the anticipated geographic earnings mix for the balance of the year.
We will continue to manage our business with operational discipline, while making what we believe are the right investments to create additional shareholder value over the long term. We are pleased with the progress we have made with our strategic growth initiatives thus far, and we are excited about the many milestones fiscal 2011 will bring on that front: the expansion of handbags, integration of Asia and the launch of European e-commerce. 
And with that, I'll conclude the company's remarks and open the call up for your questions. Operator, would you assist us with that, please? Operator?

Raw materials, if you start with that, be it cotton or wool or any of the raw materials, have seen meaningful jumps from last year at this time; although on some levels, last year's was somewhat depressed. But still, the this year-last year comparison is worth note. Second issue is really the labor situations, whether it's the real Cut, Make and Trim or the scarcity of labor that is going on around the world as a result of capacity reductions and perhaps rising labor in countries like China. And then the third piece would be the transportation around the world. I think we're going to see that slowly rising as the year goes on, but the real impact will be most critically felt in the spring merchandise, which for us will be fourth quarter. We've looked at global pricing, whether it's in Asia, Europe or the United States, and where appropriate, we've been willing to take some price increases. But we're very mindful of the economic conditions and a skittish customer. And really, there's no way we're going to take the full cost of goods increases and pass them on. So it's a merchandise category, and item carefully thought through by region is the way we're looking at it, and that would really come into play for spring calendar '11 and on. And again, I'm not sure how everybody else is treating these increases, but that's our point of view.

Adrianne, we spent a lot of time recently not only on the budgets for this year but the quarter-by-quarter outlook. And one of the conclusions we've reached upon reflection on the first quarter results is, the extraordinary performance that you've noted was really driven by the core businesses in constant currency really outperforming. And I think the headline on the quarter is not the things we identified that might be short-term drags, didn't drag down. The answer is they did. It was really the core businesses outperforming either our competitors or own expectations that powered us through the quarter, whether it's retail or wholesale, whether it was online, whether it was Ralph Lauren product or even Club Monaco, which had an extraordinary quarter as you can see. It was the core businesses that we've invested and managed so carefully over the years outperforming and the new initiatives keep going. So whether it's the start-up of handbags or the start-up of e-commerce, whether it's the start-up of Asia and now our very exciting announcement over Korea, all of those short-term impacts actually occurred. It was the core businesses outperforming. Now the only business that I would say didn't outperform were the Ralph Lauren stores, although the number we reported, which is a blend of Ralph Lauren stores and concession stores in Japan is a little misleading because the concession business in the department stores in Japan was down. And really worldwide, the Ralph Lauren Store business was up in the single digits. So it's really a rolled-up number that is a little misleading. But we are seeing the high-end customer in apparel stay more cautious than the customers in other product categories and other channels of distribution. I think based on what I'm seeing around, the high-end accessory customer has perhaps come back a little stronger than the high-end apparel business. So we're very mindful of that as we head into the Fall selling and are watching that very carefully.

But what's the wholesales -- the wholesale revenues have come in maybe a little bit below where you guys thought for a couple of quarters in a row.? And the guidance for the second quarter looks like a pretty good inflection point in the two-year growth rate and I'm seeing the inventories are starting to build a little bit for the first time in a while. It seems like you have pretty good confidence in that number going in this time but then I just look back and see maybe it's coming a little bit short of where you're hoping for. So maybe you can just talk about what's different in your confidence now in the growth rate you gave for the second quarter today? And then following up just quickly on the operating margins, also there it seems like you guys updated your guidance to be low teens from low-double digits, so maybe a couple of percentage point increase. But since first quarter you're also adding in some operating costs related to Korea so it seems like x Korea, you're feeling maybe a little bit better than the improved guidance would imply. Maybe you could give us some detail on, x Korea, some of the moving parts as you're thinking about the SG&A spend for the year?

I'm going to ask Tracey to pick up the second part of your question. As to the first part, it is clear to us that the retailer continues to be very proud of themselves, for managing inventories carefully and seeing margin recoveries as people have reported spring and Summer results. I think you've all seen that. I think that's also led them to continue to be more cautious about, open to buys going forward than probably the sell-through and the results would indicate. However, as I said to Adrianne, we did have a very strong by-brand, by-merchandise category performance for spring. We do believe we're taking share in many of the major categories. And while the retailer is being cautious and some of that sales this spring was based on [ph] chase (52:21) product or reorder product or replenishment product, we are beginning to feel better about the retailer putting a little more open-to-buy on the table up front. I believe it's probably coming from some other part of their assortment, so they are not incrementally adding a lot to their total inventory, but I think we're picking up share. We have reasonable visibility through Fall, holiday and beginning to develop more visibility into spring. So we are feeling better about that in the domestic business and the Europe business. As you know, most of Asia today is not run through the wholesale model, so that's more a function of how our stores will perform over there over time. So net-net, coming out of spring, Summer, we're feeling a little more bullish than maybe we did halfway through the spring and I think we're picking up some share.

We continue to hear difficult economic news out of Europe, although the last couple weeks or months have shown some signs of stabilizing as people better digested the issues in Greece and some of the other countries. But as a headline statement, our business, I think it's fair to say, has outperformed the marketplace. We do have excellent management and excellent strategies that are operating very efficiently. But it continues to be a story of, some countries are softer, i.e., Italy and Spain, although there's been a little bit of a pick-up in Spain recently. And the more northern and central countries have outperformed, be they France, Germany, the U.K. or Scandinavia. And that's remained pretty consistent through the spring season. The Italian business particularly is based on specialty store distribution. And those specialty owners, after several years of difficult conditions, are really people that have to manage tightly their own personal cash flows and we've got to manage the credit risk. So I think we'll see turbulence in the Italian market for a while until that market gets better macroeconomic results. So overall, strong results in Europe powered by those big countries. We've also seen a return to key markets like Russia, like the Middle East, like Istanbul, which are all running strong increases versus a year ago when that business got particularly banged around. So very pleased with the results out of Europe, particular strengths in Men's wear, strong seasons in Women's, kids and jeans and improving and growing business in Lauren, where we distributed Women's product for the first time there a couple years ago and we're beginning to get some nice traction. So that's really the summary of Europe. And I think the Paris store opening, while you could say is specifically Paris, I do believe the marketing, the advertising, the brand focus did have a halo effect not only on all of the French market but really across the Western countries.

I think as a starting point for this, you have to look at what the stores did in response to the contraction over the last two years, where they eliminated perhaps smaller brands, more marginal brands as a compelling proposition to the customer. Certainly, they've been growing private label. So I think it created an opportunity for all Polo Ralph Lauren products that we are so carefully managing from a product and merchandising point of view. And our responsiveness, I think we've been very good at responding to consumer trends on much shorter lead times than perhaps in the past. So I think the overall brand equity, as we continue to raise our global profile, we continue to make investments in things like e-commerce and/or 72nd Street. That brand elevation, I think, makes the product even more appealing to a department store customer who's buying a piece of a lifestyle dream through those products in that channel. And the teams are very carefully going merchandise category by merchandise category, looking for distortion opportunities with appropriate products. Our ability to sell through at more full price sell-throughs, which allow the stores to make higher margins, our sales to square foot, which in some cases are two or three times the department average. So obviously, the gross margin dollars per foot are extraordinarily different than our peers' or competitors'. I think all of that's playing out to our advantage. Even in a channel that's experiencing low single-digit growth, I think we're picking up share.

And not unlike other licensed international territories, their orientation has been to Men's Casual Sportswear. And the $230 million that we talk about is heavily oriented towards that product, and it does remarkably well. There is definitely an opportunity in that market to develop other product categories over time to much more important positions. Whether it's Women's, whether it's kids, whether it's Accessories or denim, they are very tilted towards casual Men's Sportswear. And what we observed in our multiple trips there is that South Korea is also a major shopping mecca for the Chinese. And the Chinese are very smart about arbitraging price throughout the region and throughout the world. And so getting the brand to be consistent to what they see in a Paris or what they've seen in a New York or what they're going to see in a Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, in Seoul, Korea and other parts is critical, we think, to support the network not just South Korea. But it's a distorted country. As we've said, it's the third largest single country in the world for us. And so our ability to, starting January 1, begin to move the assortments to a more elevated, tiered and broader merchandise category, we think is one of the real exciting opportunities of Asia-Pacific.

It's one of the reasons that we're so excited about the Europe launch. We expect to learn quickly and then move out through the rest of the countries there. That's why I said on my opening remarks that we will research and then figure out how we want to do business in Asia and Japan. It's also why you read today a lot of pundits talking about 70%, 80% of the future growth in retail could come out of e-commerce, as a general headline. So the fact that we're 10 years into this, we've got a very talented team, it's important to us, we've figured out not only the front end but the service equation and commit to very high standards, gives us a lot of encouragement. It also is relatively low capital investment compared to brick-and-mortar stores. And therefore, if you get it right and you get the necessary infrastructure right, it's really about keeping up with the technology and the ability to stay current with customers' expectations or in fact lead them with some new ideas, which we've done. The other interesting aspect of e-commerce is, it is been proven that its impact across channels, whether our wholesale channel or our own retail channel, is compelling. So you would not be wrong in saying that as we go forward, focus on retail will have a heavy component of e-commerce. I don't think it replaces doing appropriate brick-and-mortar retail, and I think our challenge will be, by market, to figure out the mix and the ROIs and the how to reach customers and what the messaging will be. But there's no doubt that e-commerce from here on out will grow in its penetration through retail, and in fact will grow in its penetration to our total distribution strategy and should provide very nice profit returns and ROI returns as we expand and open around the world. There are obviously some start-up costs opening in Europe and there will eventually be in Asia, but I think our willingness to stay with this business in the early years and figure it out, for a single brand site that has distribution around the world, I think it's been a remarkable success for us and we're going look to grow that as a percent of our total business and particularly retail. 
So with that, I think we've concluded the first quarter remarks. I appreciate the support and interest on all of your parts. First quarter was clearly beyond our expectations, and we'll see how the rest of the year plays out. Thank you.

We are reporting terrific first quarter results today with consolidated sales up 13%, operating profit increasing nearly 50% and our diluted EPS rising approximately 60%. 
With better-than-expected sales and gross profit margins in addition to disciplined expense management, we delivered very strong profit flow-through. We experienced broad-based improvements across all base business segments and in most major merchandise categories. And the profitability of our wholesale and retail segments is at or near historic high levels.
In our Wholesale segment, global sales increased 11% in the first quarter. Sales and profit trends were particularly strong in the United States and in Europe, where we are clearly gaining market share. This is especially true for the Polo Men's Sportswear brand. 
Our Lauren apparel merchandise also had a strong season across most product categories, a result of our key item merchandising initiatives. Emerging product categories such as footwear and dresses continue to benefit from expanded distribution and productivity gains at existing locations.
Internationally, our European wholesale performance was good throughout the region. Japanese trends were somewhat softer, a function of market dynamics and our proactive measures to ship less wholesale inventory into the department stores. Building on our wholesale momentum, Lauren handbags will be available in 150 of the top North America department store doors and on ralphlauren.com in less than two weeks' time. National advertising campaigns to support the launch will run in several September magazines.
Our teams have developed very compelling iconic merchandise, with price points that range from $150 to $400. We believe we are offering excellence in design and value to the customer. Of course, we've sold three seasons' worth of merchandise before the end consumer has even seen the first product, so we will update in November how the early deliveries are received by the consumer.
At our Retail segment, consolidated same-store sales were up 7%, reflecting excellent growth in all markets except Japan. Club Monaco's performance was especially noteworthy since its 25% comp was supported by broad-based improvements in all key performance indicators. And ralphlauren.com continues to deliver outstanding results, growing 15% during the quarter. 
We're in the final stages of launching e-commerce in the United Kingdom in early October. The launch is really a first step in a broader European rollout that is expected to include several other countries over the next few years and will eventually include Asia. The development of international e-commerce will allow us to reach a meaningfully larger audience than we are able to do with brick-and-mortar stores only.
Of course, we continue to open brick-and-mortar stores in strategic locations worldwide. During the first quarter, we opened a magnificent new Paris store on Saint Germain. There are several events in advance of the opening of that store that allowed us to reinforce to the customers the luxury lifestyle aspects of the Ralph Lauren brand. Store sales have been trending well ahead of expectations, and accessory performances have been particularly strong. This is our third store in Paris, but more than 70% of the customers shopping there are totally new customers to us.
The momentum we have coming off the Saint Germain opening builds this fall as we're prepared to unveil two global flagship stores in New York City. One is a new 40,000 square foot structure that will allow us to showcase an expanded assortment of Women's apparel and accessory products, as well as our home collection merchandise. The second is the renovation of the existing Rhinelander Mansion, which will become exclusively Men's Apparel and Accessory Products. 
We've worked for several years to develop this multi-store flagship complex, which also includes our two children's stores on Madison Avenue between 71st and 72nd Streets. We are very excited to be able to appropriately present the breadth and scope of the world of Ralph Lauren in such a comprehensive and impactful way.
Expanding and elevating our international presence is one of our highest strategic priorities. The best example of executing on this is the evolution of Europe, which has grown dramatically over the last several years and where we continue to gain market share. And despite the considerable news flow of economic and consumer instability throughout Europe, we had an excellent spring season with our Men's, Women's and Children's products across most countries and channels of distribution.
We believe there is still considerable growth opportunity for us in Europe as we introduce new brands and merchandise categories into the market.
Two weeks ago, we announced that we will assume direct control of our distribution in South Korea beginning on January 1, 2011. Assuming control of South Korea is another important milestone in our broader Asia growth strategy. Once that transition is made, we will fully control our distribution throughout Asia, arguably the fastest-growing consumer market in the world for luxury goods. It enables us to directly operate all of Asia with greater consistency across all markets and channels in a manner that is more closely aligned with our global brand positioning and objectives.
Today, with our brand sales across Asia at approximately $850 million, concentrated primarily in Japan and South Korea, our long-term goal is to have the region represent 1/3 of our global sales, which implies significant growth from its current levels. We've been working on this goal progressively over the last several years. We started by taking control of our Japanese operations about three years ago. Since then, we've made major strides in enhancing the organizational capabilities of our operations. In the context of challenging department store trends, we are gaining market share and we're meaningfully improving our profitability.
Seven months ago, we assumed control of our operations in eight Asian countries, most notably China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. As many of you know, we've since built a Hong Kong-based hub that is not only meant to support our current and rather modest distribution in this newly transitioned countries but also to act as a platform for transformational growth throughout Asia. 
With South Korea coming on board, we will be assuming a customer base that has been developed over the last 12 years. The market currently represents $230 million in revenue through a network of 175 shop-in-shops and five freestanding locations, making it the third largest single country for us in terms of sales volume.
South Korea has developed strong appreciation for our iconic lifestyle sensibility, and we are excited to build on this success, leverage best practices as we grow our presence and build brand awareness in other parts of Asia. 
The first quarter results are strong by any measure, and we achieved this performance even as we intensified our investment in strategic growth initiatives across channels, geographies and merchandise categories. The operational discipline of our global teams and the robust sell-throughs, which we consistently referred to over the last several quarters, delivered excellent margins and yielded incremental market share opportunities for us.
As we assess the outlook for the rest of the year, there's no question the overall operating environment remains uncertain. Traffic trends are lacklusters and consumers are still being selective with their purchases. A strong value orientation continues to prevail, and the mood remains subdued as evidenced by the recent decline in consumer sentiment. 
In Europe, the overwhelming belief is that economic growth will continue to slow. Wholesale customers remain conservative with their initial orders in the United States. Foreign exchange rates are dynamic and cost of goods inflations are substantial challenges that begin to merge for us in the second quarter and are expected to persist the remaining of the year. They are key drivers in the difference between our first quarter results and our full-year expectations. 
In spite of these external challenges, we are confident in our ability to execute against our strategic objectives for the balance of the year. Our portfolio of brands and products and exceptional merchandise strategies allow us to be responsive to market dynamics in a manner that is consistent with our goal of elevating and protecting our brands. The importance of trusted brands and compelling product is critical, and our unique competitive advantage in this area has enabled us to continue to perform at a high level around the world. There's no better proof of this than our first quarter results and really, our performance over the last couple years.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tracey."
362220,109483756,74809,"Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Aug-04-2010",2010-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Roger, and good morning everyone. For the first quarter, consolidated net revenues were $1.2 billion, 13% greater than the prior-year period and in line with the expectations we outlined for you in May. The growth in net revenues reflects doubl",2237,"Thank you, Roger, and good morning everyone. For the first quarter, consolidated net revenues were $1.2 billion, 13% greater than the prior-year period and in line with the expectations we outlined for you in May. The growth in net revenues reflects double-digit gains for our Wholesale and Retail segments that were partially offset by lower Licensing revenues. 
As a reminder, Japanese concession shop sales and profits, which had previously been reported in our Wholesale segment, are now included in our Retail segment along with our newly acquired Asian concession shop business. Our press release and financials related to the press release reflect the impact of this change in our Japan segment classification, both for the current quarter and the comparable prior-year period.
The net negative impact of currency translation on our total reported revenue growth for the first quarter was less than 1%. Our gross profit rate increased 310 basis points to a record level of 61.8%, reflecting improved profitability across most major merchandise categories and geographic regions, primarily as a result of continued disciplined inventory management and higher full priced selling, as well as favorable geographic product and channel mix. Continued savings from our sourcing and supply chain initiatives also supported our gross profit margin expansion in the first quarter.
The broad-based improvement in the first quarter gross profit rate was a significant driver of our outperformance relative to our expectations on our last call. Operating expenses in the first quarter were approximately 11% greater than the prior-year period. The higher operating expenses reflect incremental costs associated with newly transitioned Asian operations and continued investment in our strategic growth initiatives, such as European e-commerce, new store openings and infrastructure support.
Despite this higher level of investment spending, we were able to achieve 70 basis points of operating expense leverage during the quarter as a result of strong sales growth and continued core business expense discipline. Our ability to leverage operating expenses was another important driver of our outperformance relative to our first quarter expectations. 
Operating income for the first quarter was $174 million, 49% greater than the prior-year period. Our operating margin also showed considerable improvement, expanding 370 basis points to 15.1%. The growth in operating income and expansion in the operating margin rate reflect improved profitability across all channels of distribution and most geographies and was partially offset by incremental expenses associated with the business expansion.
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 increased 57% to $121 million and net income per diluted share rose 59% to $1.21 compared to the prior-year period. The growth in net income and net income per diluted share principally relates to the higher operating income I just discussed, as well as a lower effective tax rate of 29% compared to 33% in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The lower tax rate this year reflects the favorable resolution of discrete tax items in the quarter.
Regarding our segment highlights for the quarter. Our Wholesale segment sales increased 11% to $523 million. The increase was supported by double-digit shipment growth in the U.S. and in constant currency in Europe. From a product perspective, shipment of our core Men's, Women's and Children's apparel merchandise were particularly strong during the quarter as were domestic shipments of Polo and Lauren branded footwear.
Our first quarter wholesale operating income rose 41% to $108 million and the wholesale operating margin expanded 440 basis points to 20.6%. The substantial improvement in wholesale operating income and margin rate were primarily a result of higher global shipments and improved Wholesale segment gross profit rates, a function of strong sell-throughs at retail supported by continued inventory discipline, favorable product mix, particularly with basic stock replenishment merchandise, and continued sourcing and supply chain benefits.
Expenses during the quarter, including investments for strategic initiatives such as handbags, were leveraged with the higher overall segment sales. For our retail group, first quarter sales rose 16% to $593 million, reflecting incremental sales from newly assumed stores and concession shops in the Asia region, solid comparable store sales growth and the contribution from newly opened stores. 
Overall comp store sales increased 7%, reflecting a 2% decline at Ralph Lauren stores, which was primarily a function of lower Japanese sales and increased 8% at factory stores and an impressive 25% increase at Club Monaco stores that was accomplished with the support of a strong Women's and Accessories assortment.
Ralphlauren.com sales increased 15% this quarter. The growth in Retail segment sales is particularly noteworthy as the comparable prior-year period included Easter, which shifted this calendar year into our fiscal fourth quarter 2010 results. Our 7% comp growth was primarily achieved through higher average dollar transaction values mostly due to greater full price selling activity. Traffic to our U.S. stores was essentially flat with the prior-year period, and urban markets and key tourist destinations continue to outperform the average comp trend. In Europe, our retail concepts benefited from an increase in transactions in addition to higher average dollar per transaction sales.
European factory store performance was particularly strong across regions during the quarter, and Japanese factory store sales grew at a strong double-digit rate. Sales for our newly transitioned Asian stores and concession shops demonstrated progressive improvement throughout the quarter. We continue to learn about the unique characteristics of each of our regions in terms of customer taste and preferences and are evolving our merchandise allocations to better address the needs of each market.
During the first quarter, we opened eight directly operated freestanding stores and closed five stores, ending the quarter with 355 company-operated stores. We also operated 293 concession shop locations throughout Asia at the end of the first quarter.
Our Retail segment operating income grew 50% to $104 million in the first quarter, and the retail operating margin increased 400 basis points to 17.5%. The substantial improvement in retail operating income and the expansion in margin rate comes as a result of broad-based profit improvement across most retail concepts, particularly in the U.S. and in Europe. 
Sales growth and reduced markdowns due to a continued focus on aligning inventory levels with sales trends were the primary drivers of the improvement, which was partially offset by incremental expenses related to our newly assumed Asian operations.
Licensing royalties for the quarter were $38 million, 8% below the first quarter of fiscal 2010, primarily due to the transition of formerly licensed Asian operations and lower home Licensing revenues. Operating income for our Licensing segment declined 7% to $24 million.
We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments and $801 million in net cash. Inventories were up 3% from the prior-year period, inclusive of the incremental inventory to support the nearly 100 newly transitioned Asian concession shops and stores and the 12 net new stores we added over the last 12 months. Excluding the incremental Asian inventory, consolidated inventory declined 4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to the comparable prior-year period last year.
For the last 12 months, our return on equity was 18% and our return on investment was 35%. We spent approximately $39 million on CapEx during the first quarter to support our new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments. We also repurchased $2.7 million shares of stock, utilizing $231 million of our current authorization. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $319 million remaining under our authorized share repurchase program.
We are very pleased with our first quarter results, recognizing that in the first quarter of last year, we were still experiencing negative comps due to challenging retail traffic trends. Our profit performance reflects the operational discipline of our organization, particularly as we continue to invest in strategic growth initiatives this year. The trends have been better than we initially anticipated back in May, and this momentum supports our commitment to continuing to invest for long-term growth.
During the remainder of fiscal 2011, we will be managing the launch of our U.K. e-commerce website and the launch of Lauren handbags. We will also continue to manage startup of our Hong Kong-based operations while assuming the additional start-up of the South Korean operations. Due to the additional investment related to these startups and the sales and distribution build required for our new products, new channels and new geographies, these initiatives won't have an immediate positive impact on profit this year. However, we do expect them to be meaningful future contributors to profit growth for the company.
In this morning's press release, we provided our updated outlook for the year. Apart from the continued momentum we are experiencing for our core business, there are a few important differences between the first quarter trends and our expectations for the remainder of fiscal 2011. 
The first is an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact, which will depress reported sales and gross profit margins. Another is the evolution of our consolidated Asia strategy, which will result in some near-term deleveraging of operating expenses in order to pursue the considerable sales and profit potential we expect from this region over the long term. And we continue to anticipate cost of goods inflation relative to rising labor and raw material costs in the latter part of our fiscal year.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we currently expect consolidated net revenues to increase at a high single-digit rate. Our expectations are based on a low single-digit increase in global wholesale sales, which reflects continued growth in the U.S. and in constant currency in Europe, that is partially offset by meaningful negative currency translation and the decline in wholesale shipments in Japan to better align with sell-through trends in the department stores. For our Retail segment, we currently expect mid-single-digit comps, which also reflects softness in our Japanese store concession sales due to sales trends and reduced clearance inventory.
The negative impact of foreign currency translation on our reported sales is expected to be most dramatic during our second quarter.
Our operating margin for the second quarter is expected to be 100 basis points to 150 basis points below that achieved in the prior-year period. This decline is a function of both gross margin pressure, due almost entirely to foreign exchange impact, and incremental expenses and reduced profit associated with our various Asian investment initiatives, inclusive of Japan.
Costs associated with preparing for the transition of the South Korean operations are expected to be diluted by $0.02 to $0.03 in the second quarter. Partially offsetting the dilution is continued growth in the U.S. and Europe in constant dollars, as I mentioned previously. 
For the full year, fiscal 2011 period, we expect consolidated revenues to increase at a mid- to high single-digit rate, led by our Retail segment and partially offset by a high single-digit decline in Licensing revenues, which primarily reflects the impact of our assuming more direct control over certain geography.
Included in our expectations is approximately 150 to 200 basis points of net unfavorable currency translation impact on our sales for the full year fiscal 2011 period. As a reminder, our outlook for fiscal 2011 is for a 52-week period and compares with fiscal 2010's 53-week period. The fourth quarter's extra week of sales and profit will not be anniversaried.
Based on the first quarter's better-than-expected profitability and in spite of higher investment spending and uncertain global economic trends that we expect to impact us for the remainder of the year, we have raised our outlook for the full fiscal year. We now expect to achieve a low-teen operating margin rate in the fiscal 2011, up from our prior expectation of low double-digit operating margin rates. 
Our outlook still assumes a decline in operating margin from fiscal 2010's level, and that's primarily due to gross margin pressure and unfavorable foreign currency.
The negative impact on our gross profit margin attributable to exchange rate dynamics is estimated at approximately 100 basis in each of the remaining quarters of fiscal 2011. We also continue to manage cost of goods inflation, particularly as it relates to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, a function of rising raw materials, labor and freight costs as well as tightened factory and freight capacity, which could limit our flexibility in our global supply chain.
Accelerated investment in our growth initiatives, most notably in Asia, international e-commerce and flagship stores is also expected to weigh on our full year operating margin rate. Dilution related to the transition of South Korea is estimated at approximately $0.08 to $0.10 per share in full fiscal 2011, reflecting the impact of transaction expenses and other costs associated with the transition of the business. 
Most of the anticipated South Korea dilution in fiscal 2011 is one-time in nature. We continue to expect a fiscal 2011 tax rate of 34%, primarily due to the anticipated geographic earnings mix for the balance of the year.
We will continue to manage our business with operational discipline, while making what we believe are the right investments to create additional shareholder value over the long term. We are pleased with the progress we have made with our strategic growth initiatives thus far, and we are excited about the many milestones fiscal 2011 will bring on that front: the expansion of handbags, integration of Asia and the launch of European e-commerce. 
And with that, I'll conclude the company's remarks and open the call up for your questions. Operator, would you assist us with that, please? Operator?"

Raw materials, if you start with that, be it cotton or wool or any of the raw materials, have seen meaningful jumps from last year at this time, although on some levels, last year's was somewhat depressed. But still, the this-year/last-year comparison is worth note. Second issue is really the labor situations, whether it's the real Cut, Make and Trim or the scarcity of labor that is going on around the world as a result of capacity reductions and perhaps rising labor in countries like China. And then the third piece would be the transportation around the world. I think we're going to see that slowly rising as the year goes on, but the real impact will be most critically felt in the spring merchandise, which for us will be fourth quarter. We've looked at global pricing, whether it's in Asia, Europe or the United States, and where appropriate, we've been willing to take some price increases. But we're very mindful of the economic conditions and a skittish customer. And really, there's no way we're going to take the full cost of goods increases and pass them on. So it's a merchandise category, and item carefully thought through by region is the way we're looking at it, and that would really come into play for spring calendar '11 and on. And again, I'm not sure how everybody else is treating these increases, but that's our point of view."

Adrianne, we spent a lot of time recently not only on the budgets for this year but the quarter-by-quarter outlook. And one of the conclusions we've reached upon reflection on the first quarter results is, the extraordinary performance that you've noted was really driven by the core businesses in constant currency really outperforming. And I think the headline on the quarter is not the things we identified that might be short-term drags, didn't drag down. The answer is they did. It was really the core businesses outperforming either our competitors or own expectations that powered us through the quarter, whether it's retail or wholesale, whether it was online, whether it was Ralph Lauren product or even Club Monaco, which had an extraordinary quarter as you can see. It was the core businesses that we've invested and managed so carefully over the years outperforming and the new initiatives keep going. So whether it's the start-up of handbags or the start-up of e-commerce, whether it's the start-up of Asia and now our very exciting announcement over Korea, all of those short-term impacts actually occurred. It was the core businesses outperforming. Now the only business that I would say didn't outperform were the Ralph Lauren stores, although the number we reported, which is a blend of Ralph Lauren stores and concession stores in Japan is a little misleading because the concession business in the department stores in Japan was down. And really worldwide, the Ralph Lauren Store business was up in the single digits. So it's really a rolled-up number that is a little misleading. But we are seeing the high-end customer in apparel stay more cautious than the customers in other product categories and other channels of distribution. I think based on what I'm seeing around, the high-end accessory customer has perhaps come back a little stronger than the high-end apparel business. So we're very mindful of that as we head into the fall selling and are watching that very carefully."

I'm going to ask Tracey to pick up the second part of your question. As to the first part, it is clear to us that the retailer continues to be very proud of themselves for managing inventories carefully and seeing margin recoveries as people have reported spring and summer results. I think you've all seen that. I think that's also led them to continue to be more cautious about open to buys going forward than probably the sell-through and the results would indicate. However, as I said to Adrianne, we did have a very strong by-brand, by-merchandise category performance for spring. We do believe we're taking share in many of the major categories. And while the retailer is being cautious and some of that sales this spring was based on chase product or reorder product or replenishment product. We are beginning to feel better about the retailer putting a little more open-to-buy on the table up front. I believe it's probably coming from some other part of their assortment, so they’re not incrementally adding a lot to their total inventory, but I think we're picking up share. We have reasonable visibility through fall, holiday and beginning to develop more visibility into spring. So we are feeling better about that in the domestic business and the Europe business. As you know, most of Asia today is not run through the wholesale model, so that's more a function of how our stores will perform over there over time. So net-net, coming out of spring, summer, we're feeling a little more bullish than maybe we did halfway through the spring and I think we're picking up some share."

We continue to hear difficult economic news out of Europe, although the last couple weeks or months have shown some signs of stabilizing as people better digested the issues in Greece and some of the other countries. But as a headline statement, our business, I think it's fair to say, has outperformed the marketplace. We do have excellent management and excellent strategies that are operating very efficiently. But it continues to be a story of, some countries are softer, i.e., Italy and Spain, although there's been a little bit of a pick-up in Spain recently. And the more northern and central countries have outperformed, be they France, Germany, the U.K. or Scandinavia. And that's remained pretty consistent through the spring season. The Italian business particularly is based on specialty store distribution. And those specialty owners, after several years of difficult conditions, are really people that have to manage tightly their own personal cash flows and we've got to manage the credit risk. So I think we'll see turbulence in the Italian market for a while until that market gets better macroeconomic results. So overall, strong results in Europe powered by those big countries. We've also seen a return to key markets like Russia, like the Middle East, like Istanbul, which are all running strong increases versus a year ago when that business got particularly banged around. So very pleased with the results out of Europe, particular strengths in Men's wear, strong seasons in Women's, kids and jeans and improving and growing business in Lauren, where we distributed Women's product for the first time there a couple years ago and we're beginning to get some nice traction. So that's really the summary of Europe. And I think the Paris store opening, while you could say is specifically Paris, I do believe the marketing, the advertising, the brand focus did have a halo effect not only on all of the French market but really across the Western countries."

I think as a starting point for this, you have to look at what the stores did in response to the contraction over the last two years, where they eliminated perhaps smaller brands, more marginal brands as a compelling proposition to the customer. Certainly, they've been growing private label. So I think it created an opportunity for all Polo Ralph Lauren products that we are so carefully managing from a product and merchandising point of view. And our responsiveness, I think we've been very good at responding to consumer trends on much shorter lead times than perhaps in the past. So I think the overall brand equity, as we continue to raise our global profile, we continue to make investments in things like e-commerce and/or 72nd Street. That brand elevation, I think, makes the product even more appealing to a department store customer who's buying a piece of a lifestyle dream through those products in that channel. And the teams are very carefully going merchandise category by merchandise category, looking for distortion opportunities with appropriate products. Our ability to sell through at more full price sell-throughs, which allow the stores to make higher margins, our sales to square foot, which in some cases are two or three times the department average. So obviously, the gross margin dollars per foot are extraordinarily different than our peers' or competitors'. I think all of that's playing out to our advantage. Even in a channel that's experiencing low single-digit growth, I think we're picking up share."

And not unlike other licensed international territories, their orientation has been to Men's Casual Sportswear. And the $230 million that we talk about is heavily oriented towards that product, and it does remarkably well. There is definitely an opportunity in that market to develop other product categories over time to much more important positions. Whether it's Women's, whether it's kids, whether it's Accessories or denim, they are very tilted towards casual Men's Sportswear. And what we observed in our multiple trips there is that South Korea is also a major shopping mecca for the Chinese. And the Chinese are very smart about arbitraging price throughout the region and throughout the world. And so getting the brand to be consistent to what they see in a Paris or what they see in a New York or what they're going to see in a Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, in Seoul, Korea and other parts is critical, we think, to support the network not just South Korea. But it's a distorted country. As we've said, it's the third largest single country in the world for us. And so our ability to, starting January 1, begin to move the assortments to a more elevated, tiered and broader merchandise category, we think is one of the real exciting opportunities of Asia-Pacific."

So could you give us just a little bit of color, Roger, how you're thinking about that from just a long-term vantage point as far as how you trade off one versus the other?"

It's one of the reasons that we're so excited about the Europe launch. We expect to learn quickly and then move out through the rest of the countries there. That's why I said on my opening remarks that we will research and then figure out how we want to do business in Asia and Japan. It's also why you read today a lot of pundits talking about 70%, 80% of the future growth in retail could come out of e-commerce, as a general headline. So the fact that we're 10 years into this, we've got a very talented team, it's important to us, we've figured out not only the front end but the service equation and commit to very high standards, gives us a lot of encouragement. It also is relatively low capital investment compared to brick-and-mortar stores. And therefore, if you get it right and you get the necessary infrastructure right, it's really about keeping up with the technology and the ability to stay current with customers' expectations or in fact lead them with some new ideas, which we've done. The other interesting aspect of e-commerce is it is been proven that its impact across channels, whether our wholesale channel or our own retail channel, is compelling. So you would not be wrong in saying that as we go forward, focus on retail will have a heavy component of e-commerce. I don't think it replaces doing appropriate brick-and-mortar retail, and I think our challenge will be, by market, to figure out the mix and the ROIs and the how to reach customers and what the messaging will be. But there's no doubt that e-commerce from here on out will grow in its penetration through retail, and in fact will grow in its penetration to our total distribution strategy and should provide very nice profit returns and ROI returns as we expand and open around the world. There are obviously some start-up costs opening in Europe and there will eventually be in Asia, but I think our willingness to stay with this business in the early years and figure it out, for a single brand site that has distribution around the world, I think it's been a remarkable success for us and we're going look to grow that as a percent of our total business and particularly retail. 
So with that, I think we've concluded the first quarter remarks. I appreciate the support and interest on all of your parts. First quarter was clearly beyond our expectations, and we'll see how the rest of the year plays out. Thank you."

Consolidated sales rose 11%, and operating profits increased 25%, delivering record operating profit margins of 20.1%. The results were substantially better than we had planned for. They reflect the exceptional appeal of our brands, our products, which drove strong retail sell-throughs.
Around the globe, our teams are leveraging the strength of our products, with compelling merchandise strategies and effective and innovative marketing efforts and world-class customer service. As a result, our momentum was broad based across regions, channels and products.
We achieved some important milestones over the last several months. We opened our spectacular new global flagships on Madison Avenue in New York, where the historic Rhinelander Mansion has been dedicated for our men's product, and we've built a new store for our women's and home collection merchandise that is adjacent to our existing kid's stores.
Simply put, the Madison Avenue flagships are the most spectacular retail environments in the world. For the first time, customers are able to experience each of our labels in an environment that was custom designed to showcase their unique lifestyle sensibilities. The clarity of the presentations that these stores offer speak not only to the tremendous growth potential we have across brands and products but also to the financial, creative and managerial strengths of this organization. In fact, they are microcosm of the strategic work we've done over the last decade on many dimensions.
They reflect our success with elevating the brand, taking more direct control of our strategies and high-growth product categories, as well as innovating with new labels and lifestyle opportunities. They also showcased product with key partners such as eyewear, watches and fine jewelry. Ralph's vision is supported and executed by talent in design, production, distribution, visual merchandising, creative services and marketing and advertising. The competitive advantage we have by controlling all these aspects of our business is tremendous, and you can see it all coming together in the flagships.
The new Madison Avenue stores follow the opening of our Paris flagship in the first quarter and the reopening of our renovated Milan flagship this quarter. Together, these stores showcase the world of Ralph Lauren for the 21st century. You'll notice that all feature bold accessory statements across a wide array of categories, from dedicated handbag areas and footwear and watch salons to more comprehensive assortments of small leather goods, eyewear, scarves and belts.
While stores like these tend to have a favorable impact on our local business trends across channels, and we are experiencing that dynamic with each of the flagships now, there is no doubt the halo effect is much broader. These stores are tourist destinations that resonate on a global level. This is particularly true for our Asian tourists, who still do not have easy access to many of our brands and products in their local markets and who are really only beginning to get acquainted with the world of Ralph Lauren. 
Another recent milestone was the launching of our first collection of Lauren handbags and 150 North American department stores and on ralphlauren.com. We are encouraged by the early results, which demonstrated broad acceptance of the products across styles and price poise.
Customers are responding to the quality of the make and the iconic detail that has supported the Lauren status as the leading women's apparel brand in the United States department stores. We intend to add incremental distribution over the next several seasons, with exciting holiday assortments reaching new silhouettes and vibrant color choices, which will be in the stores soon. We are particularly excited about our giftable small leather goods merchandise for this holiday and beyond, recognizing the importance of small leather goods as a pillar of our broader accessory efforts.
If the growth of our Lauren footwear is any indication, handbags and small leather goods are poised to become meaningful contributors to our sales and profit expansion over the next several years.
Ralphlauren.com 21% sales growth during the second quarter is not only a testimony to our brand strength and effective marketing strategies but a clear indicator that consumers are increasingly interested in shopping online. With our broader portfolio of products and lifestyle options, from the pinnacle of luxury with Ralph Lauren's Purple Label to the modern attitude of Black Label, to the classic appeal of Polo, RLX for activewear and plenty of gifts for kids at home. We believe we are uniquely able to satisfy growing customer interest in shopping online.
The success in learnings of ralphlauren.com in the United States provided us with a powerful platform to leverage global growth. In mid-October, we successfully launched our U.K. e-commerce site. The site features bold new looks and enhance technology that is delivering an enriched customer shopping experience. The U.K. site is really a stepping stone to a much larger international rollout strategy, which will include France and Germany in the next year, followed by other parts of Europe and eventually parts of Asia.
Club Monaco is currently enjoying success online, a chop-up, and we intend to launch a dedicated Club Monaco e-commerce site in August of 2011. As an aside, today is a very special day for ralphlauren.com. And at 8:00 p.m. local time tonight in London and 8:00 p.m. in New York, we'll be presenting a sensational 4D light installation to commemorate the launch of ralphlauren.com in the U.K., and the 10th anniversary of ralphlauren.com in the United States. So for those of you on London, please drop by our 1 New Bon Street flagship. And if you're in New York, please come visit our 72nd Street in Madison Avenue store, to see the world of Ralph Lauren brought to life on the stores to the façade via video mapping technology, an innovative combination of art, fashion and music.
In case you're wondering what the fourth dimension is, it's smell. And as our new big pony fragrance will be integrated into this ground-breaking experience. This is another example of leadership and breakthrough thinking by our ad and marketing group.
We're also actively preparing for the transition of our current license in South Korea over the next two months. Fresh off the successful transition of other Asian countries earlier this year, our Hong Kong-based management team is engaged with nearly 200 employees dedicated to the existing South Korea operations. We expect many of these employees to be joining the Polo Ralph Lauren family as part of the transition in January. 
As a result, we will assume control of the region with a strong, knowledgeable team already in place. But as we have done with other international territories, in the near term, we intend to take time to learn more about the customers face and preferences in order to build a strong platform for future growth.
Our year-to-date results are a combination of several years of consistent execution against our long-term objectives. We elevated the brand and consumer experience across channels globally, bolstered our authority as a destination resource for luxury and aspiring consumers worldwide. Our teams have effectively leveraged these investments to drive robust sell-throughs and deliver excellent profit margins that are yielding incremental market share opportunities for us worldwide. This momentum supports our improved sales and profit outlooks for fiscal 2011, which Tracey will outline later.
But the operating environment is not without its challenges. While customers have demonstrated a greater willingness to spend, they remain extremely selective, and traffic trends are inconsistent. Macro economics and geopolitical uncertainties remain high. 
We will also be up against intense pressure from higher sourcing costs and negative exchange rate impact in the back half of the year. However, these external variables ultimately play out, we are confident that we are focused on executing the right strategies to deliver enhanced shareholder value over the long term.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tracey."
362220,114762439,87271,"Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 10, 2010",2010-11-10,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, consolidated net revenues were $1.5 billion, 11% greater than the prior year period. The growth in net revenues reflect double-digit constant currency gains for our wholesale and retail",2013,"Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, consolidated net revenues were $1.5 billion, 11% greater than the prior year period. The growth in net revenues reflect double-digit constant currency gains for our wholesale and retail segment. It also reflects the incremental sales from our newly acquired Asia region.
Revenue growth exceeded our expectations, primarily due to stronger wholesale shipments in the U.S. and in Europe, as well as higher sales in our factory stores worldwide. The net negative impact of currency translation on our total reported revenue growth for the second quarter was approximately 100 basis points, as the lower euro dollar exchange rate was mitigated by the stronger yen.
The second quarter's gross profit rate of 58% was 90 basis points greater than the prior year period. Continued strength and full price selling, primarily in our Retail segment, drove most of the upside to last year. Operating expenses in the second quarter were approximately 8% greater than the prior year period, and we achieved 130 basis points of operating expense leverage. Our strong sales growth, combined with continued expense discipline in our core businesses, did offset the impact of the incremental costs associated with the newly transitioned Asian operations and continued investment in our strategic growth initiatives, such as new store openings, the European e-commerce launch, South Korea transition costs and infrastructure support.
Our ability to leverage operating expenses on the stronger sales performance despite our initiative investment was another important driver of our out performance relative to our expectations. 
We achieved $307 million in operating income in the second quarter, which was 25% above the prior year  period. Our operating margin also showed considerable improvement, expanding 220 basis points to a record level of 20.1%. 
The growth in operating income and expansion in the operating margin rate reflect the gross margin expansion and expense leverage I just discussed. They also reflect improved profitability across all of our channels of distributions.
Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 increased 16% to $205 million, and net income per diluted share rose 19% to $2.09 compared to the prior year period. The growth in net income and net income per diluted share principally relate to a higher operating income and was partially offset by a higher effective tax rate of 33% this year compared to 27% in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. And as a reminder, the prior year's tax rate benefited primarily from the favorable resolution of discrete tax items in last fiscal year.
Moving on to segment highlights for the quarter. Our Wholesale segment sales rose 8% to $827 million. The increase was supported by double-digit shipment growth in both the U.S. and in constant currency in Europe. And that was partially offset by a mid-teens decline in Japanese wholesale revenues. From a product perspective, shipments of our footwear in the United States and men's and women's apparel merchandise globally were particularly strong in the quarter.
In Europe, shipments were higher in the United Kingdom, France and Germany, and were slightly offset by continued softness in Italy and Spain.
Our second quarter Wholesale operating income increased 9% to $238 million, and the wholesale operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 28.8%, surpassing the prior peak margin achieved in last year's second quarter.
Higher shipment volumes, favorable product mix and disciplined operational management were the primary drivers of the improvement in the wholesale operating income and the margin rate.
For our Retail group, second quarter revenue rose 17% to $659 million, reflecting incremental sales from our newly assumed stores and concession shops in the Asia region, solid comparable store sales growth and the contribution from newly opened stores. Overall, comp store sales increased 8%, reflecting 1% growth at Ralph Lauren stores, which does include the impact of lower Japanese concession shop sales, an 8% increase at our global factory stores and 10% growth at Club Monaco stores.
Generally speaking, increased full price selling and improved conversion drove comp sales gains as domestic traffic remains challenging.
For Ralph Lauren stores, urban markets and stores in key tourist destinations continue to outperform the average comp trend. Regarding Club Monaco, compelling women's assortment did drive increased traffic into the stores during the quarter for this format. Ralphlauren.com's 21% sales growth was also supported by higher traffic to the site.
During the second quarter, we opened eight directly operated free-standing stores, including five in the Asia-Pacific region, ending the quarter with 363 company-operated stores. We also operated 301 concession shop locations throughout Asia at the end of the second quarter.
Retail segment operating income grew 59% to $105 million in the second quarter, and the retail operating margin increased 420 basis points to 16%. This substantial improvement in retail operating income and the expansion in margin rate come as a result of broad-based profit improvement across most retail concepts worldwide. 
Sales growth and reduced markdowns were the primary driver of this improvement, which was partially offset by incremental expenses related to our newly assumed Asian operations and start-up costs for our international e-commerce efforts.
Second quarter licensing royalties of $47 million were essentially equivalent to the prior year period, as lower international licensing royalties from the transition of formerly licensed Asian operations and lower home licensing royalties were most mostly offset by our domestic product licensing royalties and an improvement in fragrance royalties due to the success of our new Big Pony fragrances. Operating income for a licensing segment increased 17% to $27 million as a result of lower net costs associated with the transition of formerly licensed Asian operations.
We did end the quarter with approximately $1 billion in cash and investment and $712 million in net cash. Consolidated inventories were up 20% at the end of the quarter from the prior year period, and this includes the incremental inventory to support over 100 Asian concession shops and stores and the 17 net new stores we have added over the last 12 months. Excluding the incremental Asian inventory, consolidated inventory was up 14% at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2011 versus the comparable period last year.
The early receipt of merchandise at the end of the quarter to support sales growth accounts for much of the increase for the prior year periods. Based on our year-to-date sales momentum and third quarter revenue expectations, we are very comfortable that the currency of our inventory. For the last 12 months, our return on equity was 18% and our return on investment was 38%.
We spend approximately $55 million on capital expenditures during the second quarter to support new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments. We also repurchased 1.2 million shares of stock, utilizing $100 million of our current authorization. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $469 million remaining under our authorized share repurchase programs.
So as Roger said, we are very pleased with our accomplishments to date. As we focused on the second half of the year, we are obviously comparing against the recovery in business trends in the second half of 2010. And as we have outlined for you in previous quarters, we do expect to experience increasing challenges relative to last year, including unfavorable foreign currency rate comparison, dilution related to the transition of our South Korean operations and assuming cost of goods inflation related to rising labor, raw material and transportation costs for most of our products.
The anticipated cost of goods inflation will begin to impact our gross profit margin in the third quarter and most prominently in the fourth quarter. As a result, we are currently forecasting a decline in gross profit in both third and fourth quarters.
Since we believe much of this pressure is a function of near-term supply, demand and balances, it does not alter our commitment to investing in our strategic growth initiatives. With that in mind, let's move on to our financial outlook for the remainder of the year.
We've experienced continued momentum across channels and regions in the third quarter-to-date period. As outlined in this morning's press release, we currently expect consolidated net revenues to increase at a high-teens percent rate in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. Our expectations are based on a mid-teen increase in global wholesale sales, which reflects continued growth in the United States and in constant currency in Europe.
The cadence of our expected spring summer shipment schedule is wholesale revenue growth in the third quarter, which will ultimately result in flatter growth in fourth quarter shipments. As a result, we think it is more representative to consider growth trends for the two quarters in aggregate. And on that basis, we expect a continuation of the year-to-date momentum we have experienced with our wholesale shipments.
For our Retail segment, we are forecasting mid-single-digit comps in the third quarter. Our operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be down approximately 100 basis points from the prior year period. This decline is primarily a function of gross profit margin pressure due to cost of goods inflation and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. We will also be incurring incremental expenses associated with our various Asian investment initiatives including cost to prepare for the transition of the South Korean operations.
However, in aggregate, we expect modest operating expense leverage to partially offset some of the expected gross profit margin decline in the third quarter.
For the full year, fiscal 2011 period, we now expect consolidated revenues to increase at a low double-digit rate. Growth is still expected to be led by our Retail segment, with a single-digit decline in licensing revenue, which primarily reflects the impact of our assuming more direct control of our certain geographies. And as a reminder, our outlook for fiscal 2011 is for a 52-week period and compares with fiscal 2010's 53-week period. The fourth quarter extra week of sales and profit, which just happened to be Easter for us, will not be anniversaried this year.
We expect our full year operating margin to be approximately 50 basis points below fiscal 2010's level. Our outlook is a function of strong year-to-date results, which we expect will be mitigated in the back half of the year as a result of the external and non-comparable dynamics I just outlined. This implies a meaningful decline in our operating profit margin for the fourth quarter. Most of that is a function of the inflationary cost of goods and exchange rate pressures, but there are other variables I'd like to highlight.
Expense de-leveraging that we expect as a result of flatter fourth quarter wholesale shipments, which is a result of the anticipated shift in wholesale shipments between the third and fourth quarters, unwell predominantly fixed cost operations in our wholesale business. And in South Korea, we will be assuming control of the distribution network with leaner clearance inventory, which will impact lower sales level to nurture what we experienced when we transitioned our Southeast Asia license last year.
We are maintaining our fiscal 2011 tax rate of 34%, primarily due to anticipated geographic earnings mix. 
Again, we are proud of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, which demonstrate our ability to grow profit even as we make significant investments and long-term growth initiatives. Around the world, our strategic merchandising initiatives are driving improved productivity and profitability and are helping to establish a stronger foundation for us to grow from over the long term, and our teams are executing masterfully. And while we face increasing profit margin pressure in the second half of the year and our sales and profit margin comparisons with the prior year period become more challenging, particularly in the fourth quarter, the current momentum in our core operations is very encouraging.
Our teams continue to raise the bar in executing with excellence, and we will manage our business with the same operational disciplines that have supported our profitable growth over the last several years. 
And with that, I'll conclude the company's remarks and open the call up for questions. Operator, will you assist us with that, please?"

It's a combination of one-time costs plus the January, February, March operating quarter, where I think Tracey touched on. Not inconsistent with other licenses, they tend to run the inventory down to the end of the license, which in this case is December 31, to maximize their cash out, which leaves us a little lean in the first three or four months even though we're flowing product and staging it for delivery on January 1. It does create some transitional. So that dilution number is real. Back to your earlier questions, the business in Europe has actually been incredibly strong. And the regional strength has come out of really central and northern Europe. France has been incredibly strong, particularly with the halo from the store. The business in England, the business in Scandinavian countries, Germany, all have been strong. We saw strengthening in Spain towards the end of spring, summer into fall. And really, the weakest market at the moment is Italy, which is mostly specialty stores. And I think they've struggled a bit more in this economic environment than other parts of Europe. So overall, Europe is quite strong. There are slight pockets of disruption based on the striking and the protesting in and around France. But overall, even with a negative exchange rate, we're very pleased with what's going on in Europe."

Let me try to put this i",622,"Okay, Omar, so we lasted one question on the second quarter and the first half and we're now into the cost pressures which is, as you correctly point out, we called out at the beginning of the year when I think others were silent. Let me try to put this in a sequential way that may help everybody understand how we're thinking about, and I think every company is doing their own analysis and thought. The cost of goods for us is really four pieces. One is clearly raw materials. Two is the actual manufacturing costs. Three is the cost of moving it for us somewhere in the world. And four is really the design and product development, which for us is a very meaningful part of our success because it gives us  that unique positioning in the market. So from two pieces of that, one is design and development, while for us, we invest a lot in it, that is not feeling, obviously, the inflationary pressure. The second piece, which earlier on had some anxious moments, which is transportation, we just spent a lot of time with our really terrific team, who believe that the worldwide supply and demand, which was driving an imbalance of about 11% differential, is now down to 1%. And that will balance out by 2011, which will cause rates to, perhaps, come in line or even soften. Some of the seasonal peak surcharges are beginning to disappear and we're beginning to see that come in line. So what's you're really left with is then the cost of goods and/or the manufacturing. The one truism that I would also say is we're not going to take something out of the product or shortchange the customer. It's not been our philosophy, and we're going to stick with it. So we're seeing the same cotton or kashmir or silk spiking that you all have. Some of that's supply and demand, some of that's bouncing off a low base. And some of that is probably driven by speculation, which I think, overtime, will level out. So the pressure points on raw materials starting in the back of the year, as Tracey articulated, and then into next year, are real. I think the question of how you're going to manage through that, how you're going to merchandise around it, how you're going to price around it. And I think every brand, every channel of distribution and every product category will be analyzing that very carefully as we look forward. Our third and fourth quarters, which for us, were placed a year ago, we're in the shoot. So our pricing decisions and our ability to deal with those variables have already been made. And we balanced out price changes and/or market share and in value equations, I think, very well. So we're really now looking at fall calendar '11, where the biggest impact of raw materials is going to be felt. And we're still thinking that through and won't make our final decisions till market weeks open up really in January and February. So it's a complicated story that we've been on top of. And every day, I wake up thankful that we own our own manufacturing and sourcing group. We have a global logistics team with controlled powers in Hong Kong. I think we've talked about this before, to have 17 points along the way to make decisions. And that experience and know-how, I think, will serve us well during this unpredictable times. So I didn't mean to ramble on, but I know many of you may want to ask about it, and hopefully, a more complete answer will allow us to get through this and into other questions as well."

It starts with the strength of the brand. And does the brand have pricing power based on its appeal, its distribution, and we believe all of our brands have that. We've been very thoughtful about our pricing on a worldwide basis. We don't price the same in every market. So excluding that taxes, we still have and believe in regional pricing. We think there is opportunities in the Asia-Pac region. And as we look at our pricing from Europe to the United States to Asia, we make those decisions carefully. Obviously, the higher price labels and the higher quality goods, I think, can command prices. And then there are labels and channels of distribution where pricing is a critical factor in a customer's buying, and we're going to be very careful in those channels. So worldwide, it's a network of decisions that will ultimately have us responding to the cost of goods pressures."

What caused the over achievement in the second quarter, and may or may not affect the third quarter, was not our missed forecasting of cost of goods. It really came through in the extraordinary sell-through of the products. So whether it was the retail sell-throughs with the extraordinary comps or whether it was the terrific wholesale performance, the margin that has been delivered in the second quarter, and really, the first half of the year, is more a reflection of full price selling improvement, the merchandise strategies that have the right products in the right place than it is the cost of goods was different than we anticipated. Because the cost of goods is known to us well in advance. So the margin uptick against the expectation in Q2, and if we can beat Q3, in my opinion, it's going to come out a better sell-throughs that we've currently got forecasted. You can see the sales were also better than expected Q2. And Tracey told you, we're expecting strong Q3 results with October continuing the trend. We've been running, we're feeling positive about the holiday shopping experience, although the bulk of the holiday season is really in the next six, seven weeks. So it's a sell-through improvement to expectation, not a difference on cost of goods that drove the margin."

So we have managed to not only flow the incremental sales very profitability, which means we're not doing it promotionally. And second, we've been able to do it at the same time we've been incrementally investing in a lot of start-up. Lauren accessories is a start-up, europe.com was a start-up. What's going on in Asia is a start up. So we are flowing through incremental sales to the bottom line, even with the investments made and the strategies we think will pay off. So for us, at our margin rates, incremental sales, whether the margin rate is up 100 basis points or down 100 basis points, is very accretive. So as we look at this subject and study it and try to merchandise our answers worldwide, we are clear that incremental sales at the kind of margin rates we have will be accretive. So I think others have to come to their own conclusions based on their strategies, their brand strength, their margin flow-throughs. But I think our business model has allowed us to carefully look at market share and fairly priced product and incremental flow-through while we're investing.

The second piece of Asia is that we are, today, in China, and in the other parts of Asia, we are lapping. We didn't have the business in our control this time last year. So we were doing the staging and preparation for the January cut over at this time last year for Asia, and now we'll be moving in a more seamless way. Tracey touched on the third part of inventory that makes this quarter look higher because of the 52, 53 week, the cut-over quarter was one week different the last year, so we ended up holding one week of shipping in our inventory versus having it shipped out, which is just a timing issue. And lastly, with inventories being so effectively managed, we are feeding what we think is a high-teens sales forecast for our third quarter. And that's strong comps, as well as wholesale and online thinking on our part. One of the misleading things about our comps is the flatter  1% Ralph Lauren store number, which is really a composite of a 9% comp in the U.S. stores, offset by a 9% comp in the concessions in Japan, which are now rolled into one. Those concession comps in Japan are a combination of economic trends and our decision to ship less into those channels and not end up taking it back at the end of the season in the quantities we've traditionally had. We think silking up some of that is a good strategy. So our 20% inventory increase is a combination of all of those things."

So for us, the international expansion of Ralph Lauren at an elevated level has come through in Europe, and we continue to invest there. But we will distort time, energy and money in Asia. And we actually announced last night new head of Asia that will be transitioning in over the next three or four months. We're very excited about that. And Jackie and I will be traveling to Asia on Saturday to introduce him. We are very clear about our direct-to-consumer strategies. That's both brick and mortar as exemplified by the various flagships or smaller neighborhood stores. But more importantly, we're very aware and we're 10 years invested in direct-to-consumer through e-commerce. While not in the quarter, the U.K. launch has gone very well, and that's both from a reaction from the customer, as well as our ability to handle and service that customer. So we think e-commerce, overlay it on a global map, is going to be an important strategy and will be a dominant theme in our direct-to-consumer strategies. And lastly, we've said that new product development and new product categories with accessories in the lead role will be critical to our success, both wholesale and Direct-to-Customer. And we're doing that. And we wrap it all around with a commitment to world-class infrastructure. Tracey and are leading a very complicated and thoughtful commitment over many years to bring our technology up to world class. I said earlier and I believe that our manufacturing and supply-chain people are second to none. And our creative teams, which we've invested significantly, are really the ones who will bring this magic to life. So our ability to develop the infrastructure and the talent, I think, is our ultimate secret weapon. And we'll stay focused on those three legs of the stool and work hard on the pieces and parts that needed to support it. And I think with some zigging and zagging and some issues over currency exchange and some other subjects which are real, I'm very committed and the team is very committed and competitive about getting to where we think we can arrive on a global basis. 
So with that, I think we'll thank everybody for their interest. It's been an amazing six months. We're very excited about Christmas and all the other initiatives going on. Please come by the stores if you're here in New York or in London. Look at the show tonight. I think it's going to be a jaw-dropping, and it's just a taste of the kind of innovation that I think we're going to continue to provide in the years to come. Thank you."

Consolidated sales rose 11%, and operating profits increased 25%, delivering record operating profit margins of 20.1%. The results were substantially better than we had planned for. They reflect the exceptional appeal of our brands, our products, which drove strong retail sell-throughs.
Around the globe, our teams are leveraging the strength of our products with compelling merchandise strategies and effective and innovative marketing efforts and world-class customer service. As a result, our momentum was broad-based across regions, channels and products.
We achieved some important milestones over the last several months. We opened our spectacular new global flagships on Madison Avenue in New York, where the historic Rhinelander Mansion has been dedicated to our men's products, and we've built a new store for our women's and home collection merchandise that is adjacent to our existing kids' stores.
Simply put, the Madison Avenue flagships are the most spectacular retail environments in the world. For the first time, customers are able to experience each of our labels in an environment that was custom-designed to showcase their unique lifestyle sensibilities. The clarity of the presentations that these stores offer speak not only to the tremendous growth potential we have across brands and products but also to the financial, creative and managerial strengths of this organization. In fact, they are a microcosm of the strategic work we've done over the last decade on many dimensions.
They reflect our success with elevating the brand, taking more direct control of our strategies and high-growth product categories as well as innovating with new labels and lifestyle opportunities. They also showcased product with key partners such as eyewear, watches and fine jewelry. Ralph's vision is supported and executed by talent in design, production, distribution, visual merchandising, creative services and marketing and advertising. The competitive advantage we have by controlling all these aspects of our business is tremendous, and you can see it all coming together in the flagships.
The new Madison Avenue stores follow the opening of our Paris flagship in the first quarter and the reopening of our renovated Milan flagship this quarter. Together, these stores showcase the world of Ralph Lauren for the 21st century. You'll notice that all feature bold accessory statements across a wide array of categories, from dedicated handbag areas and footwear and watch salons to more comprehensive assortments of small leather goods, eyewear, scarves and belts.
While stores like these tend to have a favorable impact on our local business trends across channels, and we are experiencing that dynamic with each of the flagships now, there is no doubt the halo effect is much broader. These stores are tourist destinations that resonate on a global level. This is particularly true for our Asian tourists, who still do not have easy access to many of our brands and products in their local markets and who are really only beginning to get acquainted with the world of Ralph Lauren. 
Another recent milestone was the launching of our first collection of Lauren handbags and 150 North American department stores and on ralphlauren.com. We are encouraged by the early results, which demonstrated broad acceptance of the products across styles and price poise.
Customers are responding to the quality of the make and the iconic detail that has supported the Lauren status as the leading women's apparel brand in the United States department stores. We intend to add incremental distribution over the next several seasons, with exciting holiday assortments featuring new silhouettes and vibrant color choices, which will be in the stores soon. We are particularly excited about our giftable small leather goods merchandise for this holiday and beyond, recognizing the importance of small leather goods as a pillar of our broader accessory efforts.
If the growth of our Lauren footwear is any indication, handbags and small leather goods are poised to become meaningful contributors to our sales and profit expansion over the next several years.
Ralphlauren.com, 21% sales growth during the second quarter, is not only a testimony to our brand strength and effective marketing strategies but a clear indicator that consumers are increasingly interested in shopping online. With our broader portfolio of products and lifestyle options, from the pinnacle of luxury with Ralph Lauren's Purple Label to the modern attitude of Black Label, to the classic appeal of Polo, RLX for activewear and plenty of gifts for kids at home, we believe we are uniquely able to satisfy growing customer interest in shopping online.
The success in learnings of ralphlauren.com in the United States provided us with a powerful platform to leverage global growth. In mid-October, we successfully launched our U.K. e-commerce site. The site features bold new looks and enhanced technology that is delivering an enriched customer shopping experience. The U.K. site is really a stepping stone to a much larger international rollout strategy which will include France and Germany in the next year, followed by other parts of Europe and eventually parts of Asia.
Club Monaco is currently enjoying success online, a chop-up, and we intend to launch a dedicated Club Monaco e-commerce site in August of 2011. As an aside, today is a very special day for ralphlauren.com. And at 8:00 p.m. local time tonight in London and 8:00 p.m. in New York, we'll be presenting a sensational 4D light installation to commemorate the launch of ralphlauren.com in the U.K., and the 10th anniversary of ralphlauren.com in the United States. So for those of you in London, please drop by our 1 New Bond Street flagship, and if you're in New York, please come visit our 72nd Street and Madison Avenue store to see the world of Ralph Lauren brought to life on the stores' façade via video mapping technology, an innovative combination of art, fashion and music.
In case you're wondering what the fourth dimension is, it's smell. And as our new Big Pony fragrance will be integrated into this ground-breaking experience. This is another example of leadership and breakthrough thinking by our advertising and marketing group.
We're also actively preparing for the transition of our current license in South Korea over the next two months. Fresh off the successful transition of other Asian countries earlier this year, our Hong Kong-based management team is engaged with nearly 200 employees dedicated to the existing South Korea operations. We expect many of these employees to be joining the Polo Ralph Lauren family as part of the transition in January. 
As a result, we will assume control of the region with a strong, knowledgeable team already in place. But as we have done with other international territories, in the near term, we intend to take time to learn more about the customers' face and preferences in order to build a strong platform for future growth.
Our year-to-date results are a culmination of several years of consistent execution against our long-term objectives. We elevated the brand and consumer experiences across channels globally, bolstered our authority as a destination resource for luxury and aspiring consumers worldwide. Our teams have effectively leveraged these investments to drive robust sell-throughs and deliver excellent profit margins that are yielding incremental market share opportunities for us worldwide. This momentum supports our improved sales and profit outlooks for fiscal 2011, which Tracey will outline later.
But the operating environment is not without its challenges. While customers have demonstrated a greater willingness to spend, they remain extremely selective, and traffic trends are inconsistent. Macroeconomics and geopolitical uncertainties remain high. 
We will also be up against intense pressure from higher sourcing costs and negative exchange rate impact in the back half of the year. However these external variables ultimately play out, we are confident that we are focused on executing the right strategies to deliver enhanced shareholder value over the long term.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tracey."
362220,114762439,87333,"Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 10, 2010",2010-11-10,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, consolidated net revenues were $1.5 billion, 11% greater than the prior year period. The growth in net revenues reflect double-digit constant currency gains for our wholesale and retail",2009,"Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, consolidated net revenues were $1.5 billion, 11% greater than the prior year period. The growth in net revenues reflect double-digit constant currency gains for our wholesale and retail segments. It also reflects the incremental sales from our newly acquired Asia region.
Revenue growth exceeded our expectations, primarily due to stronger wholesale shipments in the U.S. and in Europe as well as higher sales in our factory stores worldwide. The net negative impact of currency translation on our total reported revenue growth for the second quarter was approximately 100 basis points as the lower euro dollar exchange rate was mitigated by the stronger yen.
The second quarter's gross profit rate of 58% was 90 basis points greater than the prior year period. Continued strength and full-price selling, primarily in our Retail segment, drove most of the upside to last year. Operating expenses in the second quarter were approximately 8% greater than the prior year period, and we achieved 130 basis points of operating expense leverage. Our strong sales growth, combined with continued expense discipline in our core businesses, did offset the impact of the incremental costs associated with the newly transitioned Asian operations and continued investment in our strategic growth initiatives, such as new store openings, the European e-commerce launch, South Korea transition costs and infrastructure support.
Our ability to leverage operating expenses on the stronger sales performance despite our initiative investment was another important driver of our outperformance relative to our expectations. 
We achieved $307 million in operating income in the second quarter, which was 25% above the prior year  period. Our operating margin also showed considerable improvement, expanding 220 basis points to a record level of 20.1%. 
The growth in operating income and expansion in the operating margin rate reflect the gross margin expansion and expense leverage I just discussed. They also reflect improved profitability across all of our channels of distributions.
Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 increased 16% to $205 million, and net income per diluted share rose 19% to $2.09 compared to the prior year period. The growth in net income and net income per diluted share principally relate to a higher operating income and was partially offset by a higher effective tax rate of 33% this year compared to 27% in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. And as a reminder, the prior year's tax rate benefited primarily from the favorable resolution of discrete tax items in last fiscal year.
Moving on to segment highlights for the quarter. Our Wholesale segment sales rose 8% to $827 million. The increase was supported by double-digit shipment growth in both the U.S. and in constant currency in Europe. And that was partially offset by a mid-teens decline in Japanese wholesale revenues. From a product perspective, shipments of our footwear in the United States and men's and women's apparel merchandise globally were particularly strong in the quarter.
In Europe, shipments were higher in the United Kingdom, France and Germany and were slightly offset by continued softness in Italy and Spain.
Our second quarter Wholesale operating income increased 9% to $238 million, and the wholesale operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 28.8%, surpassing the prior peak margin achieved in last year's second quarter.
Higher shipment volumes, favorable product mix and disciplined operational management were the primary drivers of the improvement in the wholesale operating income and the margin rate.
For our Retail group, second quarter revenue rose 17% to $659 million, reflecting incremental sales from our newly assumed stores and concession shops in the Asia region, solid comparable store sales growth and the contribution from newly opened stores. Overall comp store sales increased 8%, reflecting 1% growth at Ralph Lauren stores, which does include the impact of lower Japanese concession shop sales; an 8% increase at our global factory stores; and 10% growth at Club Monaco stores.
Generally speaking, increased full price selling and improved conversion drove comp sales gains as domestic traffic remains challenging.
For Ralph Lauren stores, urban markets and stores in key tourist destinations continue to outperform the average comp trend. Regarding Club Monaco, compelling women's assortment did drive increased traffic into the stores during the quarter for this format. Ralphlauren.com's 21% sales growth was also supported by higher traffic to the site.
During the second quarter, we opened eight directly operated free-standing stores, including five in the Asia-Pacific region, ending the quarter with 363 company-operated stores. We also operated 301 concession shop locations throughout Asia at the end of the second quarter.
Retail segment operating income grew 59% to $105 million in the second quarter, and the retail operating margin increased 420 basis points to 16%. This substantial improvement in retail operating income and the expansion in margin rate come as a result of broad-based profit improvement across most retail concepts worldwide. 
Sales growth and reduced markdowns were the primary driver of this improvement, which was partially offset by incremental expenses related to our newly assumed Asian operations and start-up costs for our international e-commerce efforts.
Second quarter licensing royalties of $47 million were essentially equivalent to the prior year period, as lower international licensing royalties from the transition of formerly licensed Asian operations and lower home licensing royalties were most mostly offset by our domestic product licensing royalties and an improvement in fragrance royalties due to the success of our new Big Pony fragrances. Operating income for our licensing segment increased 17% to $27 million as a result of lower net costs associated with the transition of formerly licensed Asian operations.
We did end the quarter with approximately $1 billion in cash and investments and $712 million in net cash. Consolidated inventories were up 20% at the end of the quarter from the prior year period, and this includes the incremental inventory to support over 100 Asian concession shops and stores and the 17 net new stores we have added over the last 12 months. Excluding the incremental Asian inventory, consolidated inventory was up 14% at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2011 versus the comparable period last year.
The early receipt of merchandise at the end of the quarter to support sales growth accounts for much of the increase for the prior year periods. Based on our year-to-date sales momentum and third quarter revenue expectations, we are very comfortable with the currency of our inventory. For the last 12 months, our return on equity was 18% and our return on investment was 38%.
We spent approximately $55 million on capital expenditures during the second quarter to support new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments. We also repurchased 1.2 million shares of stock, utilizing $100 million of our current authorization. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $469 million remaining under our authorized share repurchase programs.
So as Roger said, we are very pleased with our accomplishments to date. As we focus on the second half of the year, we are obviously comparing against the recovery in business trends in the second half of 2010. And as we have outlined for you in previous quarters, we do expect to experience increasing challenges relative to last year, including unfavorable foreign currency rate comparison, dilution related to the transition of our South Korean operations and assuming cost of goods inflation related to rising labor, raw material and transportation costs for most of our products.
The anticipated cost of goods inflation will begin to impact our gross profit margin in the third quarter and most prominently in the fourth quarter. As a result, we are currently forecasting a decline in gross profit in both third and fourth quarters.
Since we believe much of this pressure is a function of near-term supply-demand imbalances, it does not alter our commitment to investing in our strategic growth initiatives. With that in mind, let's move on to our financial outlook for the remainder of the year.
We've experienced continued momentum across channels and regions in the third quarter-to-date period. As outlined in this morning's press release, we currently expect consolidated net revenues to increase at a high-teens percent rate in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. Our expectations are based on a mid-teen increase in global wholesale sales, which reflects continued growth in the United States and in constant currency in Europe.
The cadence of our expected spring-summer shipment schedule is wholesale revenue growth in the third quarter, which will ultimately result in flatter growth in fourth quarter shipments. As a result, we think it is more representative to consider growth trends for the two quarters in aggregate. And on that basis, we expect a continuation of the year-to-date momentum we have experienced with our wholesale shipments.
For our Retail segment, we are forecasting mid-single-digit comps in the third quarter. Our operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be down approximately 100 basis points from the prior year period. This decline is primarily a function of gross profit margin pressure due to cost of goods inflation and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. We will also be incurring incremental expenses associated with our various Asian investment initiatives including costs to prepare for the transition of the South Korean operations.
However, in aggregate, we expect modest operating expense leverage to partially offset some of the expected gross profit margin decline in the third quarter.
For the full year fiscal 2011 period, we now expect consolidated revenues to increase at a low double-digit rate. Growth is still expected to be led by our Retail segment, with a single-digit decline in licensing revenues, which primarily reflect the impact of our assuming more direct control of our certain geographies. And as a reminder, our outlook for fiscal 2011 is for a 52-week period and compares with fiscal 2010's 53-week period. The fourth quarter extra week of sales and profit, which just happened to be Easter for us, will not be anniversaried this year.
We expect our full year operating margin to be approximately 50 basis points below fiscal 2010's level. Our outlook is a function of strong year-to-date results, which we expect will be mitigated in the back half of the year as a result of the external and non-comparable dynamics I just outlined. This implies a meaningful decline in our operating profit margin for the fourth quarter. Most of that is a function of the inflationary cost of goods and exchange-rate pressures, but there are other variables I'd like to highlight.
Expense de-leveraging that we expect as a result of flatter fourth quarter wholesale shipments, which is a result of the anticipated shift in wholesale shipments between the third and fourth quarters on what are predominantly fixed cost operations in our wholesale business. And in South Korea, we will be assuming control of the distribution network with leaner clearance inventory, which will impact normal sales level similar to what we experienced when we transitioned our Southeast Asia license last year.
We are maintaining our fiscal 2011 tax rate of 34%, primarily due to anticipated geographic earnings mix. 
Again, we are proud of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, which demonstrates our ability to grow profit even as we make significant investments and long-term growth initiatives. Around the world, our strategic merchandising initiatives are driving improved productivity and profitability and are helping to establish a stronger foundation for us to grow from over the long term, and our teams are executing masterfully. And while we face increasing profit margin pressure in the second half of the year and our sales and profit margin comparisons with the prior year period become more challenging, particularly in the fourth quarter, the current momentum in our core operations is very encouraging.
Our teams continue to raise the bar in executing with excellence, and we will manage our business with the same operational disciplines that have supported our profitable growth over the last several years. 
And with that, I'll conclude the company's remarks and open the call up for questions. Operator, will you assist us with that, please?"

It's a combination of one-time costs plus the January, February, March operating quarter, where I think Tracey touched on. Not inconsistent with other licenses, they tend to run the inventory down to the end of the license, which in this case is December 31, to maximize their cash out, which leaves us a little lean in the first three or four months, even though we're flowing product and staging it for delivery on January 1, it does create some transitional. So that dilution number is real. Back to your earlier questions, the business in Europe has actually been incredibly strong. And the regional strength has come out of, really, central and northern Europe. France has been incredibly strong, particularly with the halo from the store. The business in England, the business in Scandinavian countries, Germany all have been strong. We saw strengthening in Spain towards the end of spring, summer and into fall. And really, the weakest market at the moment is Italy, which is mostly specialty stores. And I think they've struggled a bit more in this economic environment than other parts of Europe. So overall, Europe is quite strong. There are slight pockets of disruption based on the striking and the protesting in and around France. But overall, even with a negative exchange rate, we're very pleased with what's going on in Europe."

Let me try to put this in",626,"Okay, Omar, so we lasted one question on the second quarter and the first half, and we're now into the cost pressures, which, as you correctly point out, we called out at the beginning of the year when I think others were silent. Let me try to put this in a sequential way that may help everybody understand how we're thinking about it, and I think every company is doing their own analysis and thought. The cost of goods for us is really four pieces. One is clearly raw materials. Two is the actual manufacturing costs. Three is the cost of moving it for us somewhere in the world. And four is really the design and product development, which for us is a very meaningful part of our success, because it gives us  that unique positioning in the market. So from two pieces of that, one is design and development, while for us, we invest a lot in it, that is not feeling, obviously, the inflationary pressure. The second piece, which earlier on had some anxious moments, which is transportation, we just spent a lot of time with our really terrific team, who believe that the worldwide supply and demand, which was driving an imbalance of about 11% differential, is now down to 1%. And that will balance out by 2011, which will cause rates to, perhaps, come in line or even soften. Some of the seasonal peak surcharges are beginning to disappear, and we're beginning to see that come in line. So what's you're really left with is, then, the cost of goods and/or the manufacturing. The one truism that I would also say is we're not going to take something out of the product or shortchange the customer. It's not been our philosophy, and we're going to stick with it. So we're seeing the same cotton or cashmere or silk spiking that you all have. Some of that's supply and demand, some of that's bouncing off a low base, and some of that is probably driven by speculation, which I think, over time, will level out. So the pressure points on raw materials starting in the back half of the year, as Tracey articulated, and then into next year, are real. I think it's a question of how you're going to manage through that, how you're going to merchandise around it, how you're going to price around it. And I think every brand, every channel of distribution and every product category will be analyzing that very carefully as we look forward. Our third and fourth quarters, which for us, were placed a year ago, were in the chute. So our pricing decisions and our ability to deal with those variables have already been made. And we balanced out the price changes and/or market share and in value equations, I think, very well. So we're really now looking at fall calendar '11, where the biggest impact of raw materials is going to be felt. And we're still thinking that through and won't make our final decisions till market weeks open up, really, in January and February. So it's a complicated story that we've been on top of. And every day, I wake up thankful that we own our own manufacturing and sourcing group. We have a global logistics team with controlled powers in Hong Kong, I think we've talked about this before, we have 17 points along the way to make decisions. And that experience and know-how, I think, will serve us well during these unpredictable times. So I didn't mean to ramble on, but I know many of you may want to ask about it, and hopefully, a more complete answer will allow us to get through this and into other questions as well."

We've been very thoughtful about our pricing on a worldwide basis. We don't price the same in every market. So excluding VAT taxes, we still have and believe in regional pricing. We think there is opportunities in the Asia-Pac region. And as we look at our pricing from Europe to the United States to Asia, we make those decisions carefully. Obviously, the higher-price labels and the higher-quality goods, I think, can command prices. And then there are labels and channels of distribution where pricing is a critical factor in a customer's buying, and we're going to be very careful in those channels. So worldwide, it's a network of decisions that will ultimately have us responding to the cost of goods pressures."

If you could first give us a sense where, relative to your plan, where the biggest variances were there, considering what you thought you were going to deliver versus what you were able to deliver?  And then the follow-up, as we think about your guidance for the third quarter, you're similarly looking for operating margins down 100 basis points.  Recognizing there's some pressure points, but given the strong momentum heading into this quarter, could we see some opportunity in the third quarter much like we saw in the second?"

What caused the over-achievement in the second quarter, and may or may not affect the third quarter, was not our misforecasting of cost of goods. It really came through in the extraordinary sell-through of the products. So whether it was the retail sell-throughs with the extraordinary comps or whether it was the terrific wholesale performance, the margin that has been delivered in the second quarter, and really, the first half of the year, is more a reflection of full price selling improvement, the merchandise strategies that have the right products in the right place, than it is the cost of goods was different than we anticipated. Because the cost of goods is known to us well in advance. So the margin uptick against the expectation in Q2, and if we can beat Q3, in my opinion, it's going to come out a better sell-throughs that we've currently got forecasted. You can see the sales were also better than expected Q2. And Tracey told you, we're expecting strong Q3 results with October continuing the trend. We've been running, we're feeling positive about the holiday shopping experience, although the bulk of the holiday season is really in the next six, seven weeks. So it's a sell-through improvement to expectation, not a difference on cost of goods that drove the margin."

So we have managed to not only flow the incremental sales very profitability, which means we're not doing it promotionally, and second, we've been able to do it at the same time we've been incrementally investing in a lot of start-up. Lauren accessories is a start-up, europe.com was a start-up. What's going on in Asia is a start-up. So we are flowing through incremental sales to the bottom line, even with the investments made and the strategies we think will pay off. So for us, at our margin rates, incremental sales, whether the margin rate is up 100 basis points or down 100 basis points, is very accretive. So as we look at this subject and study it and try to merchandise our answers worldwide, we are clear that incremental sales at the kind of margin rates we have will be accretive. So I think others have to come to their own conclusions based on their strategies, their brand strength, their margin flow-throughs.

We really can't move that inventory into the stores until January 1. So we'll have a mad  dash from distribution center to multiple selling points as quickly as we can, within a day or two. The second piece of Asia is that we are, today, in China, and in the other parts of Asia, we are lapping. We didn't have the business in our control this time last year. So we were doing the staging and preparation for the January cutover at this time last year for Asia, and now we'll be moving in a more seamless way. Tracey touched on the third part of inventory that makes this quarter look higher because of the 52-53 week, the cutover quarter was one week different the last year, so we ended up holding one week of shipping in our inventory versus having it shipped out, which is just a timing issue. And lastly, with inventories being so effectively managed, we are feeding what we think is a high-teens sales forecast for our third quarter. And that's strong comps as well as wholesale and online thinking on our part. One of the misleading things about our comps is the flatter 1% Ralph Lauren store number, which is really a composite of a 9% comp in the U.S. stores offset by a 9% comp in the concessions in Japan, which are now rolled into one. Those concession comps in Japan are a combination of economic trends and our decision to ship less into those channels and not end up taking it back at the end of the season in the quantities we've traditionally had. We think soaking up some of that is a good strategy. So our 20% inventory increase is a combination of all of those things."

And I think we've tried to be clear publicly about what our agenda is and how you could follow and some of the ups and downs, not everything has worked perfectly. But directionally, I think we've been clear. We are very committed to what we've articulated as headline issues. So for us, the international expansion of Ralph Lauren at an elevated level has come through in Europe, and we continue to invest there. But we will distort time, energy and money in Asia. And we actually announced last night a new head of Asia that will be transitioning in over the next three or four months. We're very excited about that. And Jackie and I will be traveling to Asia on Saturday to introduce him. We are very clear about our direct-to-consumer strategies. That's both brick and mortar as exemplified by the various flagships or smaller neighborhood stores. But more importantly, we're very aware and we're 10 years invested in direct-to-consumer through e-commerce. While not in the quarter, the U.K. launch has gone very well, and that's both from a reaction from the customer as well as our ability to handle and service that customer. So we think e-commerce, overlaid on a global map, is going to be an important strategy and will be a dominant theme in our direct-to-consumer strategies. And lastly, we've said that new product development and new product categories with accessories in the lead role will be critical to our success, both wholesale and Direct-to-Customer. And we're doing that. And we wrap it all around with a commitment to world-class infrastructure. Tracey and team are leading a very complicated and thoughtful commitment over many years to bring our technology up to world class. I said earlier and I believe that our manufacturing and supply-chain people are second to none. And our creative teams, which we've invested significantly in, are really the ones who will bring this magic to life. So our ability to develop the infrastructure and the talent, I think, is our ultimate secret weapon. And we'll stay focused on those three legs of the stool and work hard on the pieces and parts that needed to support it. And I think with some zigging and zagging and some issues over currency exchange and other subjects which are real, I'm very committed and the team is very committed and competitive about getting to where we think we can arrive on a global basis. 
So with that, I think we'll thank everybody for their interest. It's been an amazing six months. We're very excited about Christmas and all the other initiatives going on. Please come by the stores if you're here in New York or in London. Look at the show tonight. I think it's going to be jaw-dropping, and it's just a taste of the kind of innovation that I think we're going to continue to provide in the years to come. Thank you."

We're pleased to be reporting excellent second quarter results today. Consolidated sales rose 11% and operating profits increased 25%, delivering record operating profit margins of 20.1%.
The results were substantially better than we had planned for. They reflect the exceptional appeal of our brands, our products, which drove strong retail sell-throughs. Around the globe our teams are leveraging the strength of our product with compelling merchandise strategies and effective and innovative marketing efforts and world-class customer service. As a result, our momentum was broad-based across regions, channels and products.
We achieved some important milestones over the last several months. We opened our spectacular new global flagships on Madison Avenue in New York, with the historic Rhinelander Mansion has been dedicated to our men's products and we built a new store for our women's and home collection merchandise that is adjacent to our existing kids stores.
Simply put, the Madison Avenue flagships are the most spectacular retail environments in the world. For the first time customers are able to experience each of our labels in an environment that was custom designed to showcase their unique lifestyle sensibilities. The clarity of the presentations that these stores offer speak not only to the tremendous growth potential we have across brands and products, but also to the financial, creative and managerial strengths of this organization.
In fact, they are microcosm of the strategic work we have done over the last decade on many dimensions. They reflect our success with elevating the brand, taking more direct control of our strategies in high growth product categories, as well as innovating with new labels and lifestyle opportunities. They also showcase product with key partners such as eyewear, watches and fine jewelry.
Ralph's vision is supported and executed by talent in design, production, distribution, visual merchandising, creative services and marketing and advertising. The competitive advantage we have by controlling all these aspects of our business is tremendous and you can see it all coming together in the flagships.
The new Madison Avenue stores follow the opening of our Paris flagship in the first quarter and the reopening of our renovated Milan flagship this quarter. Together, these stores showcase the world of Ralph Lauren for the 21st Century.
You'll notice that all feature bold accessory statements across a wide array of categories, from dedicated handbag areas and footwear and watch salons, to more comprehensive assortments of small leather goods, eyewear, scarves and belts. While stores like these tend to have a favorable impact on our local business trends across channel and we are experiencing that dynamic with each of the flagships now, there is no doubt the halo effect is much broader.
These stores are tourist destinations that resonate on a global level. This is particularly true for our Asian tourists who still do not have easy access to many of our brands and products in their local markets and who are really only beginning to get acquainted with the world of Ralph Lauren.
Another recent milestone was the launching of our first collection of Lauren handbags in a 150 North American department stores and on RalphLauren.com. We're encouraged by the early results, which demonstrated broad acceptance of the products across styles and price points. Customers are responding to the quality of the make and the iconic detail that has supported the Lauren status as the leading women's apparel brand in the United States department stores.
We intend to add incremental distribution over the next several seasons with exciting holiday assortments featuring new silhouettes and vibrant color choices, which will be in the stores soon. We're particularly excited about our giftable small leather goods merchandise for this holiday and beyond, recognizing the importance of small leather goods as a pillar of our broader accessory efforts.
If the growth of our Lauren footwear is any indication, handbags and small leather goods are poised to become meaningful contributors to our sales and profit expansion over the next several years.
RalphLauren.com 21% sales growth during the second quarter is not only a testimony to our brand strength and effective marketing strategies, but a clear indictor that consumers are increasingly interested in shopping online.
With our broader portfolio of products and lifestyle options from the pinnacle of luxury with Ralph Lauren’s Purple Label to the modern attitude of Black Label to the classic appeal of Polo, RLX for active wear and plenty of gifts for kids at home, we believe we are uniquely able to satisfy growing customer interest in shopping online.
The success in learnings of RalphLauren.com in the United States provided us with a powerful platform to leverage global growth. In mid-October, we successfully launched our U.K. e-commerce site. The site features bolder looks and enhanced technology that is delivering an enriched customer shopping experience.
The U.K. side is really a stepping stone to a much larger international rollout strategy, which will include France and Germany in the next year followed by other parts of Europe and eventually parts of Asia.
Club Monaco is currently enjoying success online at (shop up) and we intend to launch a dedicated Club Monaco e-commerce site in August of 2011.
As an aside, today is a very special day for RalphLauren.com and at 8 p.m. local time tonight in London and 8 p.m. in New York, we'll be presenting the sensational 4D light installation to commemorate the launch of RalphLauren.com in the U.K. and the 10th anniversary of Ralphlauren.com in the United States. So, for those of you in London, please drop by our 1 New Bond Street Flagship, and if you're in New York, please come visit our 72nd Street and Madison Avenue store to see the world of Ralph Lauren brought to life on the stores to the sub and by a video mapping technology and innovative combination of art, fashion, and music.
In case you're wondering what the fourth dimension is, it's smell as our new Big Pony Fragrance will be integrated into this groundbreaking experience. This is another example of leadership and breakthrough thinking by our advertising and marketing group.
We are also actively preparing for the transition of our current license in South Korea over the next two months. Fresh off to successful transition of other Asian countries earlier this year, our Hong Kong based management team is engaged with nearly 200 employees dedicated to the existing South Korea operations.
We expect many of these employees to be joining the Polo Ralph Lauren family as part of the transition in January. As a result, we will assume control of the region with a strong, knowledgeable team already in place. But as we have done with other international territories, in the near term, we intend to take time to learn more about the customers’ taste and preferences in order to build a strong platform for future growth.
Our year-to-date results are a combination of several years of consistent execution against our long-term objectives. We elevated the brand and consumer experiences across channels globally, bolstered our authority as a destination resource for luxury and aspiring consumers worldwide. Our teams have effectively leveraged these investments to drive robust sell-throughs and deliver excellent profit margins that are yielding incremental market share opportunities for us worldwide. This momentum supports our improved sales and profit outlooks for fiscal 2011, which Tracey will outline later.
But the operating environment is not without its challenges. While customers have demonstrated a greater willingness to spend, they remain extremely selective and traffic trends are inconsistent. Macroeconomics and geopolitical uncertainties remain high. We will also be up against intense pressure from higher sourcing costs, a negative exchange rate impact in the back half of the year. However, these external variables ultimately play out. We are confident that we are focused on executing the right strategies to deliver enhanced shareholder value over the long term.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Tracey.

362220,114762439,87625,"Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 10, 2010",2010-11-10,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, consolidated net revenues were $1.5 billion, 11% greater than the prior year period. The growth in net revenues reflects double-digit constant currency gains for our Wholesale and Retai",2006,"Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, consolidated net revenues were $1.5 billion, 11% greater than the prior year period. The growth in net revenues reflects double-digit constant currency gains for our Wholesale and Retail segments. It also reflects the incremental sales from our newly acquired Asia region. Revenue growth exceeded our expectations, primarily due to stronger wholesale shipments in the U.S. and in Europe as well as higher sales in our factory stores worldwide.
The net negative impact of currency translation on our total reported revenue growth for the second quarter was approximately 100 basis points as the lower euro dollar exchange rate was mitigated by a stronger yen. The second quarter's gross profit rate of 58% was 90 basis points greater than the prior year period. Continued strength in full price selling, primarily in our Retail segment drove most of the upside to last year.
Operating expenses in the second quarter were approximately 8% greater than the prior year period and we achieved 130 basis points of operating expense leverage.
Our strong sales growth, combined with continued expense discipline in our core businesses did offset the impact of the incremental costs associated with the newly transitioned Asian operations and continued investments in our strategic growth initiatives, such as new store openings, the European e-commerce launch, South Korea transition cost and infrastructure support.
Our ability to leverage operating expenses on the stronger sales performance despite our initiative investment was another important driver of our outperformance relative to our expectations.
We achieved $307 million in operating income in the second quarter, which was 25% above the prior year period. Our operating margin also showed considerable improvements, expanding 220 basis points to a record level of 20.1%. The growth in operating income and expansion in the operating margin rate reflect the gross margin expansion and expense leverage I just discussed. They also reflect improved profitability across all of our channels of distribution.
Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 increased 16% to $205 million and net income per diluted share rose 19% to $2.09 compared to the prior year period. The growth in net income and net income per diluted share principally relate to higher operating income and was partially offset by a higher effective tax rate of 33% this year compared to 27% in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. As a reminder, the prior year's tax rate benefited primarily from the favorable resolution of discrete tax items in last fiscal year.
Moving on to segment highlights for the quarter. Our wholesale segment sales rose 8% to $827 million. The increase was supported by double-digit shipment growth in both the U.S. and in constant currency in Europe, and that was partially offset by a mid-teens decline in Japanese wholesale revenues. From a products perspective, shipments of our footwear in the United States and men's and women's apparel merchandise globally were particularly strong in the quarter. In Europe, shipments were higher in the United Kingdom, France and Germany, and were slightly offset by continued softness in Italy and Spain.
Our second quarter wholesale operating income increased 9% to $238 million and the wholesale operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 28.8%, surpassing the prior peak margin achieved in last year's second quarter. Higher shipment volumes, favorable product mix and disciplined operational management were the primary drivers of the improvement in the wholesale operating income and the margin rates.
For our retail group, second quarter revenue rose 17% to $659 million, reflecting incremental sales from our newly assumed stores and concession shops in the Asia region, solid comparable store sales growth and the contribution from newly opened stores.
Overall, comp store sales increased 8%, reflecting 1% growth at Ralph Lauren stores, which does include the impact of lower Japanese concession shop sales and an 8% increase at our global factory stores and 10% growth at Club Monaco stores. Generally speaking, increased full price selling and improved conversion drove comp sales gains as domestic traffic remains challenging.
For Ralph Lauren stores, urban markets and stores in key tourist destinations continue to outperform the average comp trend. Regarding Club Monaco, compelling women's assortments did drive increased traffic into the stores during the quarter for this format. RalphLauren.com's 21% sales growth was also supported by higher traffic to the site.
During the second quarter, we opened eight directly operated freestanding stores, including five in the Asia Pacific region, ending the quarter with 363 Company-operated stores. We also operated 301 concession shop locations throughout Asia at the end of the second quarter.
Retail segment operating income grew 59% to $105 million in the second quarter and the retail operating margin increased 420 basis points to 16%. The substantial improvement in retail operating income and the expansion in margin rate come as a result of broad-based profit improvement across most retail concepts worldwide. Sales growth and reduced markdowns were the primary drivers of the improvement, which was partially offset by incremental expenses related to our newly assumed Asian operations and start-up costs for international e-commerce efforts.
Second quarter licensing royalties of $47 million were essentially equivalent to the prior year period as lower international licensing royalties from the transition of formally licensed Asian operations and lower home licensing royalties were mostly offset by higher domestic product licensing royalties and an improvement in fragrance royalties due to the success of our new Big Pony Fragrances.
Operating income for our licensing segment increased 17% to $27 million as a result of lower net cost associated with the transition of formally licensed Asian operations.
We did end the quarter with approximately $1 billion in cash and investments, and $712 million in net cash. Consolidated inventories were up 20% at the end of quarter from the prior year period and this includes the incremental inventory to support over 100 Asian concession shops and stores, and the 17 net new stores we have added over the last 12 months. Excluding the incremental Asian inventory, consolidated inventory was up 14% at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2011 versus the comparable period last year. The early receipt of merchandise at the end of the quarter to support sales growth accounts for much of the increase from the prior year period.
Based on our year-to-date sales momentum and third quarter revenue expectations, we are very comfortable with the currency of our inventory. For the last 12 months, our return on equity was 18% and our return on investment was 38%.
We spent approximately $55 million on capital expenditures during the second quarter to support new retail stores, shop installations, and infrastructure investments. We also repurchased 1.2 million shares of stock utilizing $100 million of our current authorization. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $469 million remaining under our authorized share repurchase programs.
So as Roger said, we are very pleased with our accomplishments to date. As we focus on the second half of the year, we are obviously comparing against a recovery in business trends in the second half of 2010. As we have outlined for you in previous quarters, we do expect to experience increasing challenges relative to last year, including unfavorable foreign currency rate comparisons, dilution related to the transition of our South Korean operations, and assuming cost of goods inflation related to rising labor, raw material and transportation cost for most of our products.
The anticipated cost of goods inflation will begin to impact our gross profit margin in the third quarter and most prominently in the fourth quarter. As a result, we are currently forecasting a decline in gross profit in both third and fourth quarters. Since we believe much of this pressure is a function of near-term supply demand imbalances, it does not alter our commitment to investing in our strategic growth initiatives.
With that in mind, let's move on to our financial outlook for the remainder of the year. We've experienced continued momentum across channels and regions in the third quarter to date period. As outlined in this morning's press release, we currently expect consolidated net revenues to increase at a high-teens percent rate in the third quarter of fiscal 2011.
Our expectations are based on the mid-teen increase in global wholesale sales, which reflects continued growth in the United States and in constant currency in Europe. The cadence of our expected spring summer shipment schedule is accentuating wholesale revenue growth in the third quarter, which will ultimately result in flatter growth in fourth quarter shipments.
As a result, we think it is more representative to consider growth trends for the two quarters in aggregate. On that basis, we expect the continuation of the year-to-date momentum we have experienced with our wholesale shipments. For our Retail segment, we are forecasting mid-single digit comps in the third quarter.
Our operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be down approximately 100 basis points from the prior year period. This decline is primarily a function of gross profit margin pressure due to cost of goods inflation and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. We'll also be incurring incremental expenses associated with our various Asian investment initiatives including cost to prepare for the transition of the South Korean operations. However, in aggregate, we expect modest operating expense leverage to partially offset some of the expected gross profit margin decline in the third quarter.
For the full year fiscal 2011 period, we now expect consolidated revenues to increase at a low double digit rate. Growth is still expected to be led by our Retail segments with a single digit decline in licensing revenues, which primarily reflects the impact of our assuming more direct control over certain geographies. As a reminder, our outlook for fiscal 2011 is for a 52-week period and compares with fiscal 2010's 53-week period.
The fourth quarter extra week of sales and profit which just happened to be Easter for us will not be anniversaried this year. We expect our full year operating margin to be approximately 50 basis points below fiscal 2010's level.
Our outlook is a function of strong year-to-date results, which we expect will be mitigated in the back half of the year as a result of the external and non-comparable dynamics I just outlined.
This implies a meaningful decline in our operating profit margin for the fourth quarter. Most of that is a function of the inflationary cost to goods and exchange rate pressures but there are other variables I'd like to highlight.
Expense deleveraging that we expect as a result of flatter fourth quarter wholesale shipments, which is a result of the anticipated shift in wholesale shipments between the third and fourth quarter on our predominantly fixed cost operations in our wholesale business.
In South Korea, we will be assuming control of the distribution network with leaner clearance inventory, which will impact normal sales levels similar to what we experienced when we transitioned our Southeast Asia license last year.
We are maintaining our fiscal 2011 tax rate of 34%, primarily due to anticipated geographic earnings mix.
Again, we are proud of our second quarter and year-to-date performance which demonstrates our ability to grow profits even as we make significant investments in long-term growth initiatives.
Around the world our strategic merchandising initiatives are driving improved productivity and profitability and are helping to establish a stronger foundation for us to grow from over the long term and our teams executing masterfully.
While we face increasing profit margin pressure in the second half of the year and our sales and profit margin comparisons with the prior year period become more challenging, particularly in the fourth quarter, the current momentum in our core operations is very encouraging. Our teams continue to raise the bar in executing with excellence and we will manage our business with the same operational disciplines that have supported our profitable growth over the last several years.
With that I'll conclude the Company's remarks and open the call up for questions. Operator, will you assist us with that please?

It's a combination of one-time cost plus the January, February, March operating quarter, where I think Tracy touched on, not inconsistent with other licenses, they tend to run the inventory down to the end of the license, which in this case is December 31, to maximize their cash out, which leaves us a little lean in the first three to four months. Even though we're flowing product and staging it for delivery on January 1, it does create some transition. So that dilution number is real. Back to your earlier questions, the business in Europe has actually been incredibly strong and the regional strength has come out of really Central and Northern Europe, France has been incredibly strong, particularly with the halo from the store. 
The business in England, the business in the Scandinavian countries, Germany, all have been strong. We saw strengthening in Spain towards the end of spring/summer and into fall. Really the weakest market at the moment is Italy, which is mostly specialty stores. I think they have struggled a bit more in this economic environment than other parts of Europe. So, overall, Europe is quite strong. There are slight pockets of disruption based on the striking and the protesting in and around France, but overall, even with a negative exchange rate, I was very pleased with what's going on in Europe.

Let me try to put this is in",626,"Omar, so we left at one question on the second quarter and the first half and we're now into the cost pressures, which is, as you correctly point out, we called out at the beginning of the year when I think others were silent. Let me try to put this is in a sequential way that may help everybody understand how we're thinking about it and I think every company is doing their own analysis and thought. The cost of goods for us is really four pieces. One, is clearly raw materials, two is the actual manufacturing cost, three is the cost of moving it for us somewhere in the world and four is really the design and product development, which for us is a very meaningful part of our success because it gives us that unique positioning in the market. So from two pieces of that, one is design and development. While for us, we invest a lot in it. That is not feeling obviously the inflationary pressure. 
The second piece, which earlier on had some anxious moments, which is transportation, we just spent a lot of time with our really terrific team who believe that the worldwide supply and demand which was driving it (imbalanced), of about 11% differential, is now down to 1%. That will balance out by 2011, which will cause rates to perhaps come in line or even soften some of the seasonal peaks. Surcharges are beginning to disappear and we're beginning to see that come in line. So what you are really left with is then the cost of goods and/or the manufacturing. The one truism that I would also say is, we're not going to take something out of the product or short change the customer. It has not been our philosophy and we're going to stick with it. So we're seeing the same pattern for cashmere, for silk, spiking that you all have, some of that supply and demand, some of that's bouncing off a low base and some of that is probably driven by speculation, which I think over time will level out. 
So the pressure points on raw materials starting in the back half of the year, as Tracey articulated, and then into next year are real. I think it’s a question of how you're going to manage through that, how you're going to merchandise around it, how you're going to price around it. I think every brand, every channel of distribution and every product category will be analyzing that very carefully as we look forward. Our third quarter and fourth quarter, which for us, were placed a year ago, we're in the shoot. So our pricing decisions and our ability to deal with those variables have already been made and we balanced out the price changes and/or market share and value equations I think very well. 
So we're really now looking at fall calendar '11, where the biggest impact of raw materials is going to be felt and we're still thinking that through and won't make our final decisions until market weeks open up really in January and February. So it’s a complicated story that we've been on top of, and every day I wake up, thankful that we own our own manufacturing and sourcing group. We have a Global Logistics team with control powers in Hong Kong, and we’ve talked about this before to have 17 points along the way to make decisions. That experience and know-how I think will service well during these unpredictable times. So, I didn't mean to ramble on, but I know many of you may want to ask about it and hopefully a more complete answer will allow us to get through this and into other questions as well.

So, it starts with the strength of the brand and does the brand have pricing power based on its appeal, its distribution, and we believe all of our brands have that. We've been very thoughtful about our pricing on a worldwide basis. We don't price the same in every market. So, excluding (that) taxes we still have and believe in regional pricing. We think there are opportunities in the Asia Pac region. 
As we look at our pricing from Europe to the United States to Asia, we make those decisions carefully. Obviously, the higher priced labels and the higher quality goods, I think can command prices and then there are labels and channels of distribution, where pricing is a critical factor in a customer's buying, and we're going to be very careful in those channels. So, worldwide it's a network of decisions that will ultimately have us responding to the cost of goods pressures.

We appreciate your supportive comments and hope to see with the light show tonight. What caused the overachievement in the second quarter and may or may not affect the third quarter was not our misforecasting of cost of goods. It really came through in the extraordinary sell-through of the products. So whether it was the retail sell-throughs with the extraordinary comps or whether there was the terrific wholesale performance, the margin that has been delivered in the second quarter and really the first half of the year is more reflection of full price selling improvement, the merchandise strategies that have the right products in the right place. 
And then it is the cost of goods was different than we anticipated, because the cost of goods is known to us well in advance. So the margin upticked against expectation in Q2 and if we can beat Q3, in my opinion, it's going to come out a better sell-throughs than we currently got forecasted. You can see the sales were also better than expected Q2, and Tracey told you, we're expecting strong Q3 results. With October continuing the trend we've been running, we're feeling positive about the holiday shopping experience, although the bulk of the holiday season is really in the next six, seven weeks. So, it’s a sell-through improvement to expectation, not a difference on cost of goods that drove the margin.

I think one of the great successes of Q2 is an 11% sales increase, but a 30% plus operating increase. So we have managed to not only flow the incremental sales very profitably, which means we're not doing it promotionally; and secondly, we've been able to do it at the same time we've been incrementally investing in a lot of start-ups. Lauren accessories is a start-up, Europe.com was a start up, what's going on in Asia is a start-up. So we are flowing through incremental sales to the bottom-line. 
Even with investments made into strategies, we think will pay off. So, for us, at our margin rates, incremental sales whether the margin rate is up a 100 basis points or down a 100 basis points is very accretive. So as we look at this subject and study it and try to merchandise our answers worldwide, we are clear that incremental sales at the kind of margin rates we have will be accretive. So I think others have to come to their own conclusions based on their strategies, their brand strength, their margin, flow throughs, but I think our business model has allowed us to carefully look at market share and fairly priced product, and incremental flow through while we are investing. So as we head into the back half of next year, we'll have to make those decisions on a worldwide basis as well.

So, we were doing the staging and preparation for the January cutover at this time last year for Asia, and now we'll be moving in on a more seamless way. Tracey touched on the third part of inventory that makes this quarter look higher, which is because of the 52, 53 week. 
The cutover quarter was one week different than last year, so we ended up holding one week of shipping in our inventory versus having it shipped out, which is just a timing issue. Lastly, with inventories being so effectively managed, we're feeding what we think is a high teens sales forecast for our third quarter and that's strong comps, as well as wholesale and online thinking on our part. One of the misleading things about our comps is the flatter 1% Ralph Lauren store number, which is really a composite of a 9% comp in the U.S. stores offset by a 9% comp in the concessions in Japan, which are now rolled into one. Those concession comps in Japan are a combination of economic trend and our decision to ship less into those channels and not end up taking it back at the end of the season and the quantities we've traditionally had. We think soaking up some of that is a good strategy. So our 20% inventory increase is a combination of all of those things.

While not in the quarter, the U.K. launch has gone very well and that's both from a reaction from the customer as well as our ability to handle and service that customer. So we think e-commerce overlaid on a global map is going to be an important strategy and will be a dominant theme in our direct-to-customer strategies. Lastly, we said that new product development and new product categories with accessories in the lead role will be critical to our success, both wholesale and direct-to-customer and we're doing that. 
We wrap it all around with a commitment to world-class infrastructure. Tracey and team are leading a very complicated and thoughtful commitment over many years to bring our technology up to world-class. I said earlier and I believe that our manufacturing and supply chain people are second to none. Our creative teams, which we've invested significantly in are really the ones who will bring this magic to life. So our ability to develop the infrastructure and the talent, I think is our ultimate secret weapon, and we'll stay focused on those three legs of the stool and work hard on the pieces and parts that needed the support them, and I think with some zigging and zagging and some issues over currency exchange and other subjects which are real, I'm very committed and the team is very committed and competitive about getting to where we think we can arrive on a global basis. 
So, with that, I think, we'll thank everybody for their interest. It's been an amazing six months. We are very excited about Christmas and all the other initiatives going on. Please come by the stores if you're here in New York or in London. Look at the show tonight. I think it's going to be jaw dropping. It's just a taste of the kind of innovation that I think we're going to continue to provide in the years to come. Thank you.
