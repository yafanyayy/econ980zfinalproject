I want to thank our employees for their continued efforts to meet customer needs and provide service to our clients in what has been a challenging year for everyone in the financial services sector. Our busines",1172,"Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. I want to thank our employees for their continued efforts to meet customer needs and provide service to our clients in what has been a challenging year for everyone in the financial services sector. Our business results fluctuated, but our commitment to our customers did not. Our capital and asset management strategies helped us strengthen our balance sheet. Meanwhile, we have taken and will continue to take actions to grow our business, manage expenses, and improve our results.
Let me highlight some key items in our results. In 2009, we generated an operating return on equity of 10.1%. Although this result is not indicative of our aspirations or historic performance, it is solid, especially when evaluated in context of the environment. We grew our book value per diluted share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income by 9% for the year despite significant legal expenses and a goodwill impairment charge.
We instituted cost reduction and expense saving initiatives that resulted in restructuring charges of about $12 million after-tax in the quarter and about $19 million for the year. These initiatives will generate run rate savings of about $22 million after-tax annually at current expense levels across the company.
As we highlighted in our news release, we took an $83 million impairment charge to goodwill this quarter. The accounting rules on this issue are very technical, but I want to put it in context. This is a non-cash charge. It has no impact on statutory earnings or our deployable capital position. And finally, it has not changed our outlook for our businesses.
Let me comment upon the litigation reserve increase of $24 million after-tax in Assurant Health. Last Friday, a jury in Colorado returned a $37 million verdict against us on a case that was filed in 2006. While we cannot comment on the specifics of this case, we disagree strongly with the verdict and will vigorously pursue post-trial motions as well as an appeal.
Independent of this verdict, the health insurance landscape is changing quickly. Assurant Health has taken steps to help ensure that customers better understand the individual and short-term policies they are purchasing. We offer an independent third-party medical review beyond our internal appeals process for any situations where there is a rescission of coverage.
Before turning to Mike for an in-depth view of results, let me highlight our outlook for 2010. Beginning with our businesses, we expect continued evolution in the marketplace at Specialty Property. We know that the overall number of mortgage loans outstanding is declining and expect this trend to continue until the residential real estate market recovers. The decline will be more pronounced in the subprime sector where policy placement rates are higher.
The movement of portfolios between loan servicers will continue to create quarterly variability in gross written premiums beyond the seasonality we have seen in this business. Consolidation of mortgage portfolios by our clients will pressure margins as loans transition to terms found in the most favorable portfolio contract.
We estimate this will be a reduction to our earnings of between $10 million and $20 million after-tax in 2010. The team at Specialty Property is working hard to manage expenses, capital and catastrophic risk exposure. Property should continue producing strong operating results and ROEs, leveraging our leading position in the creditor-placed market.
Now let’s turn to Assurant Solutions. Although profits improved in the quarter and the year, results in the UK are very disappointing and have masked the improvements within the rest of Solutions. So we are taking further actions to remedy this problem in addition to those already implemented. We expect to see our international combined ratio improve by 1% to 2% per quarter over the course of 2010.
Revenue growth prospects at Solutions are good. We are pleased to announce the addition of several new clients this year in the international area totaling nearly $100 million in production. New clients include Brazil’s third largest wireless carrier TIM where we leveraged expertise from our Signal acquisition, and two top retailers in Brazil, Marisa and Centauro. The new clients in distribution channels we are adding will help offset business loss from client bankruptcies and a slowdown in consumer spending.
Our strategy to partner with original equipment manufacturers is producing results, and we are pleased to announce a relationship with Whirlpool in Italy. We are benefiting from our preneed partnership with SCI, as they continue to add new funeral homes, which will start producing for us in this year. Solutions will begin to execute on a two-year plan to streamline its organizational structure, which we estimate we will free $75 million to $150 million in capital. All of these actions will lead to meaningful improvements to this business’s ROE.
Moving next to Assurant Employee Benefits, our focus remains on the small employer, particularly through the sale of Worksite or voluntary employee-paid products, which should continue growing at a double-digit pace. We’ve taken actions during 2009 to improve our dental results, and additional changes are planned for this year.
We recently extended our shared dental network relationship with Aetna through 2012, allowing us to continue to offer small employers one of the largest dental networks in the country in conjunction with our product. Combined with expense efforts, we expect profits to improve this year.
At Assurant Health, the pricing and plan changes we’ve implemented, combined with expense reduction efforts, are expected to return the Health business to target profitability in the range of 4% after-tax by late this year. Results are tracking consistent with our assumptions based on our experience in the second half of 2009.
We continue to work closely with the industry and with members of Congress to offer constructive suggestions for the reform of our healthcare system in the US. We are hopeful that reform will focus on programs that work to reduce costs and provide affordable healthcare options to all Americans.
And finally, as we look ahead, I’ll comment on our capital position. At year-end, we had $710 million of total corporate capital. This reflects following through on our promise to build our corporate capital position. Excluding the $250 million capital buffer we established, we have over $450 million of capital that is available for deployment, which is significantly more than has been available in the last two years.
A strong capital base provides us with the flexibility to execute on our capital management priorities, investing in our businesses, pursuing prudent acquisitions, and returning capital to our shareholders via dividends and share repurchase programs.
Currently, we believe our stock is undervalued, and with the SEC matter now behind us, we expect to begin repurchasing shares after the earnings blackout period ends on February 8. We have a total of $770 million in share repurchase authorization. This represents about 20% of the total shares outstanding at today’s price. We expect to use at least half of this authorization over the next few years.
Now I’ll turn it over to Mike to talk about our results in more detail. Mike?

4026111,83890690,48411,"Assurant Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2010",2010-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob. Let’s now take a deeper dive into each of our businesses, starting with Assurant Specialty Property that once again displayed its market strength during 2009. Net operating income for the fourth quarter was $107 million, down from $118.5 mi",1970,"Thanks, Rob. Let’s now take a deeper dive into each of our businesses, starting with Assurant Specialty Property that once again displayed its market strength during 2009. Net operating income for the fourth quarter was $107 million, down from $118.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, but still our highest quarter of net operating income in 2009. For the full year, NOI was $406 million, flat with 2008.
The drop in fourth quarter earnings reflects lower earned premiums, higher non-catastrophe claims, and higher reinsurance costs versus 2008. These increased costs were partially offset by the absence of reportable catastrophe losses in 2009. Our full year NOI benefited greatly from the benign hurricane season.
We had no reportable catastrophe losses for the year compared with $100 million of after-tax catastrophe-related costs in 2008. On the other hand, a significant decrease in premiums from real estate owned policies, higher reinsurance costs, and higher non-catastrophe losses adversely impacted our operating results.
Net earned premiums were down 4% for the quarter and 5% for the full year compared to 2008. The decreases were primarily driven by reduced premiums from real estate owned properties and were partially offset by increased placement rates in our non-real estate owned creditor-placed business. Reinsurance costs, which reduced net earned premiums, increased by $10 million for the quarter and $30 million for the year.
Gross written premiums increased over the fourth quarter of 2008 and were up considerably versus the third quarter of 2009. The fourth quarter gross written premiums reflect non-recurring factors related to two specific clients. We expect gross written premiums in the first quarter of 2010 to return to lower levels, in line with the normal seasonality of the business.
We previously announced that we would lose 230,000 subprime loans to consolidation in January. However, we are now pleased to announce that we have added 155,000 subprime loans, approximately half from consolidation and half from a new client. 75,000 of these will begin producing premium in the first quarter this year and the other 80,000 will begin producing in the second quarter.
While our leading position in the creditor-placed market allows us to retain many of the portfolios when they are combined, industry consolidation will affect our top and bottom lines. Some of the larger clients share more of the risk on their portfolios and their contracts reflect the scale of their operations. We expect that an additional $150 million of premium in certain client portfolios will be reinsured in 2010, thus reducing our net earned premiums.
The Specialty Property team continues to diligently manage expenses and look for new opportunities to add value for their clients in the rapidly changing environment. In the meantime, we are focused on dividend in our earnings out of the business and maintaining our overall financial flexibility. We believe that we will be able to dividend all of our properties’ earnings for 2010 to the holding company. In 2009, property dividended [ph] out about 120% of its earnings.
So in summary, we are pleased with another very solid quarter and year at Assurant Specialty Property. While revenue is moderating, we expect the business to continue to produce strong returns.
Let’s now move to Assurant Solutions, where in spite of a collapse in consumer spending, profits improved and growth opportunities were identified, but we still have work to do in the UK. Net operating income improved for both the fourth quarter and full year versus 2008 despite continued very poor loss experienced in the UK. Typically we do not disclose individual country results. But since the UK results are so far below expectations, I want to provide some additional color.
The UK losses continue to be driven primarily by our unemployment-related products. As we have previously reported, losses from the Internet distribution channel for these products have ceased due to our exit from that channel. Unfortunately, in the latter part of the year, losses from similar products sold through more traditional channels increased as a result of the prolonged high unemployment situation, thus delaying the profit recovery.
The poor experience resulted in an after-tax loss of $11 million for the quarter and $35 million for the year. This compares to losses of $5 million and $7 million for the comparable 2008 periods. These results are clearly unacceptable, and we have accelerated efforts to fix the problems. While we are pursuing all possible corrective actions, the continued poor economy in the UK makes rapid progress difficult.
The international combined ratio for the fourth quarter increased versus the fourth quarter of 2008 and sequentially to 114.5%. In addition to the UK losses, we incurred $10.4 million of pretax restructuring expenses in our European operations during the quarter, as we made a number of organizational changes to increase our operating efficiency.
We are pleased with our domestic results, where the combined ratio for the quarter decreased to 94.6%, its lowest level in the past two years and below its long-term target of 97% to 98%. This result reflects the particularly good loss experienced in the extended service contract business from existing and run-off clients.
Revenue grew modestly in Solutions when adjusted for the impact of the change in accounting for preneed and the impact of foreign exchange. Absent these two factors, premiums were up 3.7% year-over-year. Preneed sales growth was strong, driven by growth at our sales partner SCI. We saw positive same-store client sales trends and added nearly $100 million of sales from new clients in 2009, including Whirlpool and the Royal Bank of Canada.
Efforts to reduce expenses and gain efficiency were a continued priority in the fourth quarter. Total restructuring charges, including the international restructuring costs I mentioned earlier, were $8.4 million after-tax for the quarter and $10.8 million for the year. Through various restructuring and consolidation initiatives, a total of about 240 full-time equivalent positions were eliminated in 2009. While painful, these reductions will provide run rate savings of about $15 million pretax per year going forward.
Looking forward, we expect Solutions to make significant ROE improvements over the next few years. The 2009 ROE of 7.5% was well below our targeted range of 14% to 16%, but we expect steady improvements over the next two years as the UK experience is corrected, new clients come online, and we reduce the capital in the business.
Now let’s move to Assurant Employee Benefits, where results have been pressured by the persisting economic challenges in the small group sector, leading to higher lapse rates and lower premium growth on in-force policies. Although we are seeing more optimism in small business owners’ outlook, they remain cautious in adding new employees, and wage growth continues to be modest.
Net operating income was down 18% for the quarter and 40% for the year. The declines reflect the decrease in premiums and lower investment income. Results include restructuring charges of $1 million for the quarter and $2.5 million for the year. We were pleased to see modest sequential improvement in our dental loss ratios during the quarter, as our pricing actions begin to take hold and we expect dental experience to continue to improve in 2010.
Employee Benefits is finding other ways to grow even in this difficult environment. Full year sales of voluntary coverage were up 13% to almost $60 million for the year. 2010 revenue will also increase by approximately $100 million due to new client addition at Disability RMS and the Shenandoah Life block we acquired in 2009. I should note that neither of these are reflected in the sales figures in our financial supplement.
Now let’s turn to Assurant Health. 2009 was a challenging and disappointing year for Health with a loss of $29.7 million for the quarter and $30.2 million for the year. The fourth quarter includes the $24 million after-tax charge due to the adverse jury verdict Rob mentioned. I should note that the operating results we are discussing today reflect the full amount of the jury verdict that was delivered last Friday. If a final judgment is entered by the court before we file our 10-K, then the amount is materially different. We will reflect this revised amount in our filings.
Health fourth quarter also includes H1N1 expenses of $2.5 million after-tax. This was less than we projected on our last call, as the virus has not been as widespread as originally feared. We now anticipate that we will incur another $2.5 million to $3.5 million after-tax of H1N1-related claims costs in the first half of 2010.
The quarter also includes restructuring charges of $2.9 million after-tax, as the business took action to reduce its expense base. We expect this to reduce our annual run rate of expenses by approximately $5 million after-tax. In addition, we took advantage of a soft advertising market to increase direct marketing presence in the fourth quarter, adding about $1.5 million to expense levels for the period. In 2009, sales in this channel grew by 48% to $54 million.
Net earned premiums were down 3% and 4% for the quarter and year respectively. The decreases were caused by high lapses of individual and small group policies, driven by the combination of price increase and general concerns over the affordability of coverage.
In summary, at Assurant Health, we are facing some tough and sometimes unpredictable challenges, but we are taking actions to best prepare and operate in the new health insurance environment that continues to evolve in the United States. Our overall experience in the fourth quarter, absent the Colorado jury verdict, was consistent with the assumptions underlying our pricing actions, and we continue to believe that in the absence of similar large events, Health is on track to return to profitability in the range of a 4% net margin late in 2010.
I’ll turn next to our investment portfolio. AOCI was a positive $66 million at year-end 2009 compared to a negative of $671 million at year-end 2008. The $737 million improvement is primarily due to gains in the portfolio market values. Lower interest rates have led to lower investment income, however we have a reinvested most of the cash held at the operating companies in higher yielding intermediate term securities, which has helped stabilize quarterly investment income, albeit at lower levels versus 2008.
We remain quite pleased with the performance of our commercial mortgage portfolio, which accounts for about 11% of the total investment. We do, however, expect that 2010 will be a more challenging year for the commercial property market due to the effects of sustained high unemployment.
Let me now turn to goodwill. We recently concluded our annual goodwill impairment testing. We hold our goodwill in the corporate segment of our balance sheet, but the testing is done at the business segment level. We concluded that we did not have an impairment in the goodwill assigned to our Solutions, Specialty Property, or Health businesses.
Our test indicated, however, that an impairment of $83 million was necessary for the goodwill allocated to our Employee Benefits segment. The impairment resulted from the continued gap between the estimated fair value and book value of the segment from the challenging near-term growth environment in the Benefits business. We remain confident in the long-term prospects for Assurant Employee Benefits. Going forward, we expect to maintain our policy of testing our goodwill asset annually in the fourth quarter.
So in summary, while we are not satisfied with our overall results for 2009, each of the businesses confronted the reality of the economic environment and took the size of actions to better position itself for the future. Each has identified solid opportunities for growth, and each will continue to focus its resources on those opportunities while minimizing expenditures on other areas.
And with that, I’d like to open the floor for questions. Operator, we are ready for questions.

We think just - and again, to anticipate a potential other questions that might come up, we’ve decided against an accelerate share repurchase program. We think that that has certain short-term benefits, but doesn’t make sense over the long-term. I think capital management, we prefer to be more dynamic and more flexible. Again, the priority is of investing in the business, pursuing prudent acquisitions, and then again returning capital to the shareholders. We’re going to reevaluate our dividend policy, which we do typically in the second quarter every year. But to maintain the flexibility as we get better line of sight on earnings, dividend, capacity and risks of the business, we think it makes sense to return the capital over time in a way that allows us to prioritize according.

I think maybe the easiest way to think about it, Ed, is we are in a position to dividend the earnings out of all of our business. Okay? And then we have some expenses at the holding company that are not allocated out to the businesses. And those have typically run in the neighborhood of $50 million, plus or minus. We have interest expense that we need to pay, and we have dividends to shareholders. So those are the three subtractions, if you will, against the operating earnings from the business. And of course, we are talking about slight differences between GAAP earnings and stat earnings. Stat earnings are what we can dividend out of the companies around the capitalization levels.

Okay? I think one of the other ones to look at that we are mentioning here today is we are working on streamlining operations in Solutions, which would allow us to dividend more than the earnings. Okay? And so we’ve started another restructuring project around organizational streamlining. We are not exactly sure of the timing, but we think we can free another $75 million to $150 million of capital there as well. So again, we are trying to manage the capital very efficiently and put it in the context of making and prioritizing deployment of the capital on a long-term basis.

So - but we do think if you were to go forward into June that we’re going to see some absolute cost savings in terms of our reinsurance program. Now, the other variable - and this will come back to sort of what kind of cat experience we have in 2010. Our ability to buy second and third event covers cat (inaudible) et cetera. That’s typically something that we will do as part of the June placement. The other variable will be the cat bond, which we are still considering as a possibility. The capital markets pricing there is very attractive, and we will consider that as we go through the first and second quarters.

And we think - we think that they are probably pretty close as a percentage of our total to historic levels, but that was a big driver of things and it has an impact on our geographic footprint because more of those just happened to be in non-cat prone areas.

Specific actions initiated in 2009 are gaining traction and improving profitability. We continue to create opportunities for growth instead of waiting for economic recovery. Our strong financial position allows us to deploy corporate capital. At the same time we remain mindful of the challenges that the sluggish economy in many parts of the world and health care reform legislation that was recently enacted.
Let me begin by providing some financial highlights on the quarter as well as our 2010 business outlook. In the first quarter we generated an annualized operating return on equity of 12.9%. Results were driven by strong performance at Assurant’s Specialty property and favorable operating results at Assurant benefits. We grew our book value per diluted share by 3% from year-end. This excludes the impact of accumulated other comprehensive income for AOCI.
We have repurchased shares of what we believe are very attractive prices and below book value per share. Through last Friday, April, 23, we have repurchased 4.8 million shares for about a $157 million. These actions are consistent with our capital management strategy and highlight the free cash flow we’re able to generate.
Now, let me make a few comments on the businesses. Specialty Property had a terrific quarter. We achieved an excellent combined ratio driven by both favorable expense and mass ratios. Although our top line results were good we continue to expect pressure on our revenues looking ahead for three reasons.
First, the overall number of mortgage loans number of mortgage loans outstanding is declining, particularly, subprime since new loan originations are at low levels. Second, we expect placement rates to peak soon and return to more normal levels in the years ahead. And finally, portfolio consolidation will tighten margins requiring us to be even more vigilant in managing expenses. The team at Specialty Property continues to execute at a high level and maintains its leading position in the credit replace business.
At Assurant Solutions, we were satisfied with our growth in target areas under difficult market conditions. Our business continues to be impacted by high unemployment in the UK. In addition, the European economy is struggling to recover. We were pleased to see sequential improvement in the international combined ratio. We have made solid progress in reshaping our European business during the past several months and we expect international combined ratios to continue to improve on average by 100 basis points to 200 basis points per quarter for the rest of the year.
In the U.S. Assurant Solutions continues to create opportunities to grow rather than wait for economic recovery. We were pleased to enter into a contract with Lowe’s the home improvement retailer which will be later this year.
Our strategy to partner with original equipment manufacturers is also gaining traction and we are benefiting from our preneed partnership with SCI which continues to add new funeral homes.
We are on track to offset revenues that will last from prime bankruptcies and a slowdown in consumer spending. Assurant’s employees’ benefits provided a good example of how we’re creating our growth opportunities as well. Our top-line benefited from the block of business we acquired from Shenandoah Life as well as new clients at Disability RMS, our turnkey distribution channel.
High levels of unemployment continue to limit small employer payrolls which drive premiums. Expense management and continued improvement of dental results will remain key elements of our efforts ahead.
At Assurant Health, it was good to see quarter results improve in line with our expectations. Of course, the issue at the forefront of everyone’s mind is the impact of Healthcare Reform. The legislation signed by President Obama on May 23rd reshapes the health insurance industry. Since detailed implementation regulations have not yet been issued the full extent of the impact on our business is still being assessed. However, we know modifications in how we operate will be necessary. In particular, we will need to operate with a lower expense structure at both the business unit and enterprise level.
As we prepare for the future we have begun a comprehensive review of all the options for Assurant Health. A Steering Committee co-chaired by our CFO, Mike Peninger, and Assurant Health CEO, Don Hamm, is leading the effort.
We are completing a thorough evaluation of our auctions in the individual medical market. We’re also assessing the impact on the enterprise, including all intangible assets on our balance sheet. The analysis is well underway and we expect to present our findings and made recommendations to our Board of Directors this summer.
Assurant has a long history of successfully adapting the changes in the marketplace. And this legislation will test our ability to do so again. We will take the best course of action to benefit our shareholders and our customers.
And now, I would like to turn things over to Mike who will give a more in-depth review of the businesses. Mike?

4026111,99263469,58410,"Assurant Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-29-2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob. Let’s now take a more in-depth look at the results for each of our businesses.

Let’s now take a more in-depth look at the results for each of our businesses. I’ll begin with Assurant Health which is continuing to take corrective actions to improve the underlying business results in the near-term.
For the quarter net operating income decreased significantly versus as reported in the first quarter of 2009, however, as we discussed on several calls last year, first quarter 2009 results did not fully reflect the increased medical benefit utilization that began in late 2008.
First quarter 2010 results developed consistent with our assumption and reflect pricing and benefit design changes as well as expense reduction initiatives we implemented. Sales of both individual medical and small employer group policies increased versus 2009. Sales growth continue to come primarily from our affordable healthcare plans that provide more first dollar coverage, but continued high elapse rates offset sales growth waiting to address of about 1% in net earned premiums for the quarter.
In summary, the changes we made to pricing and plan designs over the past year have us on track to return our book to a 4% after-tax margin by the fourth quarter. So of course, this may be impacted by changes made in response to healthcare reform. The team at Assurant Health continues to work towards that goal even as they began to make the changes necessary for future success.
I’ll turn next to Assurant Employee Benefits where net operating income was at its highest level since third quarter of 2008. Very favorable disability incidence and life mortality rates drove the improved earnings. In addition, just is in medical, pricing and plan design actions are producing improvement to dental loss ratios.
Net earned premium growth was driven by the block of business acquired last year from Shenandoah Life and two new clients at Disability RMS. These additions brought an additional $35 million in net earned premiums in the quarter and we expect their full year 2010 contribution to be around $100 million. Although overall sales were flat voluntary product sales continue to be a bright spot, increasing by 21% to $21.8 million for the quarter.
While we are pleased with the first quarter results, remember, the low frequency high severity nature of our life and disability products can cause loss ratios to vary from quarter-to-quarter. Also, organic growth in small employer payrolls will require job creation. Until then we will continue to work to increase voluntary product sales.
Now, I’ll turn to Assurant Solutions where overall earnings were down about 5% versus the first quarter of 2009, but where they were also several times of improvement. The decline was primarily due to a one-time tax charge of $2.8 million resulting from the restructuring of the European business and a $4 million after-tax change in the value of assets used to protect against inflation risk in our preneed business.
Net operating income benefited from favorable domestic service contract loss experience and improved preneed experience. Our domestic combined ratio continued to reflect favorable loss experience from both new business and run-off clients.
Gross written premiums for domestic service contract business increased by about 12% versus 2009, driven mostly by non-recurring items. Absent these items, written premiums were flat which we view as a good thing since first quarter 2009 results included about $20 million of gross written premiums from Circuit City. We saw modest organic growth for several current retail clients as we saw consumer spending showing possible signs of improvement.
As Rob noted, we’re pleased to enter into an agreement to provide service contracts for Lowe's which will begin to produce gross written premium in the fourth quarter of this year. Because Lowe’s retains most of the risk and performs a service functions under the contract it will add only modestly to our net earned premiums and earnings over the next few years. We hope to expand the relationship overtime as we demonstrate the value we can add to Lowe’s.
Despite a positive impact from foreign exchange our first quarter international results are down versus 2009 even prior to the $2.8 million tax charge I mentioned earlier. Going forward, the effective tax rate should decline to normal levels.
Sequentially we saw improvement in our UK underwriting experience that was consistent with our expectations. The international combined ratio decreased by 670 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2009 and was down by about a 180 basis points excluding the impact of the fourth quarter restructuring charges. We continue to expect an average of 100 basis points to 200 basis points per quarter reduction in this ratio over the rest of 2010 as our pricing and underwriting changes take effect.
While overall net earned premiums for Solutions were level with prior year international net earned premiums increased 26% due to favorable impact of foreign exchange rate and growth from new and existing clients in Canada, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico.
International gross written premiums increased by over 30% due to favorable foreign exchange and new client growth in several countries. Our service contract relationship with Whirlpool in Italy will start producing premium in the second quarter and our wireless business with Tim, Brazil's third largest wireless carrier is expected to produce premium by year-end.
We added a new page to our financial supplement this quarter that breaks out our preneed business and shows that steady contribution to Solutions results. The exhibit also illustrate the impact of our CPI caps which are financial instruments purchased several years ago to protect against inflation risk on certain preneed policies.
These caps which were valued at about $8.5 million at quarter end are important parts of our risk management strategy for the preneed products, but they are mark-to-market each quarter and thus create some variability in earnings.
Preneed earnings grew for the quarter despite a negative impact from the cap and sales were up sequentially. We expect further growth as the funeral homes acquired in 2009 by SCI, our sales partner; begin to sell our preneed policies.
In summary, Solutions is adding new clients and growing in key target areas such as wireless service contracts and preneed while looking for new niche market opportunities. We need to see continued improvement in the UK results and to reach revenue and profit targets in our developing countries.
Our domestic combined ratios are likely to drift back toward our target in the high 90s over time but sales are improving and we believe that our growth expense, control and risk management initiatives are beginning to take hold.
I’ll now turn to Assurant Specialty Property which produced another very strong quarter and drove our overall financial results. The business benefited from a $7.6 million after-tax adjustment in our credit replaced unearned premium reserves but even absent this item net operating income increased 6% versus 2009 due to lower expense in loss ratios.
Combined ratios were the lowest we’ve reported since the fourth quarter of 2008.
As we stated last quarter we continue to expect earnings to reflect margin compression of $10 million to $20 million from client consolidation. However, due to more favorable contracting and slower run-off of loans lost there was minimal impact on our earnings in the first quarter. We now expect that the impact will begin in the second quarter but will not be fully realized until the middle of 2011.
Our net earned premiums rose by 3% primarily due to the change in unearned premium reserves which increased earned premiums by $13.6 million. Excluding this item, net earned premiums were flat with last year.
Real estate owned premiums declined from 20% of credit replaced premiums in 2009 to 12% in 2010. However, premiums from non-REO of business kept total earned premiums level.
We benefited from the fact that the policies on the 230,000 subprime loan lost in January 2010 that we mentioned on our year-end call were not canceled upon client termination. The premium on existing policies is therefore running off more slowly which favorably impacted both earned premiums and earnings in the first quarter.
In the short run it appears that REO premiums have stabilized as loan services have developed more programs to modify loans and hopefully avoid for closures. Placement rates have continued to increase and based on our analysis of delinquent loans we anticipate that they will continue to see near the current levels for the remainder of this year.
75,000 new subprime loans that we gained through consolidation modestly raise written premiums in the first quarter. We will see further growth beginning in the third quarter of this year from a previously disclosed new 80,000 subprime loan account.
Specialty Property continues to manage expenses in capital level carefully, while also looking for new growth opportunities in the creditor placed market and increasing sales of adjacency products such as (inaudible) and creditor placed flood insurance.
Turning now to our investment portfolio on balance sheet. Our investment portfolio continues to perform well. At the end of the first quarter net after-tax unrealized gains were $267 million, an increase of $89 million since year-end. During the quarter we realized $4.5 million in pretax gains from the portfolio despite a $6.7 million increase in our mortgage reserve and under $1 million in other-than-temporary impairments.
Since we took minimal dividends from the businesses during the quarter our holding company capital position declined from $710 million at year-end to about $480 million at March 31 or about $230 million of deployable capital after subtracting our $250 million buffer.
Our debt-to-capital ratio was a low 16.9% down from 18% a year ago. These metrics and the free cash flows our businesses generate are all indicative of our solid financial position, a position that continues to provide us with capital management flexibility.
So in summary, we’re pleased with our first quarter results and continue to remain focused on the macroeconomic challenges and post Healthcare Reform market ahead of us.
And with that, I’d like to open the floor for questions. Operator, we’re ready for questions.

I guess the question though is it how do we look at this, given the replacement rates are so high on subprime with no originations how quickly does this number go to zero? And if it does, does that mean we should start thinking about higher placement rates on a normal basis for prime because some of that stuffs somehow ends up in the prime category. How do we think about sort of a normalized revenue level?

But some primes always been 10%, 15% of the overall market. Now, remember what’s reported to us by our clients, they classify the loans. And we have some suspicion that prime loans may get reclassified to subprime when they started to having problems with the loan.
But I think if you go back and look at placement rates in an '06 timeframe, you can get a feel for what more normal subprime placement rates are and then the real issue is when is there going to be new loan originations coming back in the market. I think the key for us is Gene and his team has continued to find opportunities to grow, when we can get clients in RFP situations we typically do very well and we’re aligned with market leaders who as the consolidation takes place has us well positioned as portfolios move around. When I look at the overall revenues I very much look at it as placement rates and some estimate of what’s going on in the overall number of loan.

Just to get us from the 715 I guess to the 480 roughly, so 235 million of reconciliation, 127 of that again was returned to shareholders to repurchase plus the dividend, we had an interest expense, February and August are debt payments, that’s about 30 million. About 50 million on a net basis plus or minus was put back into the segment, half of that was in Health in response to the increase in litigation reserve and the other half went back into solutions due to point growth. And then the balance of it was what I would call normal course operating expenses for the company. The inc operating expenses are front loaded in the first quarter and a lot of that just related to compensation expense we pay our year-end bonus in the first quarter of the following year. And then we have a 401(k) matched out.
First off we did not take any dividends of consequence from the subs in the first quarter. We will look to be taking the dividends in the second quarter going forward. I think that gives you an example of the advantage of being in such a strong capital position. We’re able to go out repurchase shares at attractive levels both relative to current market and as a percent of book, without having significant upstreaming of dividends from the segments and above average operating expenses at the corporate level.

I just want to make a clarification, I think and I could be wrong, but I believe your net dividend capacity is 525 million. I do want to point out that that is a regulatory number and does not necessarily indicate what we can or cannot take out of the businesses. When I think about dividend capacity I think about earnings plus minus. The minuses would be held back for growth and as we have seen in years past sometimes the portfolio effect will cause us to, we’ll have to retain more capital and not be able to access it from the operating companies. And, of course, on the plus side you mentioned potential shrinking of the business on the property side, again, also our efforts to take some excess capital solutions over the next 12 months to 18 months.
The other thing I would point out again, Ed asked the question I provided reconciliation. Some of the infusions and taking dividends out of the subs are timing issues. This past quarter we did put some money into Solutions (inaudible) to some additional client growth that doesn’t change the fact that over time we’d like, we think we can get out the earnings and then from the Solutions segment over the next several years. The other thing you’ve got to keep in mind in a variable that we’ve talked about in the past is the cap, the AM Best capital requirement; we do capitalize the best to the extent that those change from one year to the next that might have some effect. We’re in regular dialogue with the rating agencies, have not gotten any indication of the material changes there, but will know that as the year progresses.

But I think it’s just a big part of it is how our model operates in that is looking in arrears to know what our coverage comes into a fact. Then if you look at the number of portfolios that have moved around over the last couple of years, which are unprecedented, those exacerbated all the numbers as well.

Again, the apples to apples comparison versus last year is probably best done by looking at last year’s cap on and where it’s trading in the secondary market.

We’re very pleased with the results, clear evidence of available capacity and more attractive pricing versus prior year.
The flip side though is that it’s not apples to apples, the other thing we have to keep in mind is how the reinsurance program has changed, the exposures have changed from a geographic perspective, and also the tower has grown; the reinsurance needs have grown since last year.

So we can deal with pre-existing, we’re going to have to see how all the regulations ultimately unfold to figure out if the penalty is enough to provide protection there. And we’ll do all that.

Good morning, everyone. Our results for the first half of 2010 are solid. We are achieving year-over-year profit improvement because of disciplined decision making and our ability to adapt and better position our businesses.
Actions include redesigning products, reducing expenses and when necessary adjusting prices. We are adding new clients, retaining existing accounts and finding opportunities in the areas we have targeted for growth. Overall, we are encouraged and believe our year-to-date results demonstrate the strength of our specialty strategy.
Let me begin by providing some financial highlights on the quarter as well as our outlook for the year. In the second quarter, we generated an annualized operating return on equity of 12.7%. All of our businesses saw results improved from the similar period in 2009. Specialty property led results for the quarter.
We are building long-term value for our shareholders as demonstrated by a 3.8% increase in our diluted book value per share during the quarter and a 7.3% increase since year end. This excludes the impact of accumulated other comprehensive income or AOCI.
During the quarter, we took advantage of what we believe is an attractive share price by repurchasing 6.1 million shares for about $215 million. We also paid $18 million in dividends as we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.16 per share. This is the sixth consecutive year we have raised our dividend.
So in total, we returned $233 million of capital to shareholders during the second quarter. In July, through the 23rd, we’ve repurchased an additional 910,000 shares for slightly less than $33 million. We have slowed repurchase activity as we enter hurricane season.
We ended the second quarter with $575 million in corporate capital, up about $100 million from the end of the first quarter. This includes about $80 million in capital, we were able to free up in our Solutions business.
Remember, we’re holding a $250 million capital buffer for tail-event risk leaving $325 million in deployable capital. For the year, we expect to dividend all of the businesses’ earnings to corporate unless there are material changes to A.M. Best capital formulas. Overall, our solid capital position continues to provide us with a sufficient buffer against risk and great financial flexibility.
Now let me make a few comments on the business results and our future outlook. Assurant Specialty Property had another terrific quarter. We added the new client with $550,000 subprime loans. We also benefited from our partnership with a specialty servicer who added subprime loans to their portfolio. In combination, these two wins help mitigate the macro trends of declining loan originations and subprime loans outstanding.
At Assurant Solutions, we continued to see improvement in the U.K. operating results. Our international combined ratio improved 50 basis points from the first quarter, slightly below our goal. However, we’ve added several new clients in Latin America and incurred some costs associated with adding them. We still expect the fourth quarter international combined ratio to be in the range of 103 to 105, which is consistent with our previously discussed targets.
The slowdown in consumer spending continues to hurt retail sales. However, we are finding new clients, both internationally and domestically, to increase our sales. Finally, our OEM and wireless strategies have us well positioned for long-term growth, especially when consumer spending rebounds.
Moving to Assurant Employee Benefits, our results were good as experience continues to be favorable. However, small business clients continue to be challenged by a difficult economic environment. In order to achieve efficiencies, make our products more competitive and position the business for growth, Employee Benefits made the difficult decision to reduce its workforce, to make the Company stronger moving forward.
Even in this difficult environment, we’ve been able to grow through Disability RMS, our alternative distribution channel. We continue to invest in our voluntary capabilities to remain positioned to meet employer and employee needs for the long term.
At Assurant Health, we are seeing improvement in the core business due to the pricing and product actions we’ve discussed with you in the past. The key long-term question at Assurant Health revolves around our response to the impact of health care reform.
During the second quarter, we completed an extensive review of our Health business, and considered a number of possible future strategies for the business. Three critical themes emerged from our work.
First, we believe there is a significant opportunity in the individual medical marketplace. Second, although the dynamics and characteristics of the post-reform market are different, they will still require specialty expertise. And third, we believe we can earn attractive returns in the business over the long-term without making large commitments of corporate capital. With the approval of our Board, we are moving forward with our comprehensive business plan to position ourselves for what we believe the future will be.
All of the healthcare reform transition rules are not in place. As of September 24, several new provisions go into effect. Others, including new minimum loss ratio requirements, begin in January 2011.
We’ve already filed new product offerings that will be available to both new and existing customers. We also know that modifications in how we operate will be necessary. We will need to lower the cost of doing business. And while agents will continue to play a critical role in distribution of our products, they will need to do it even more efficiently in the future.
Last month, we announced the Don Hamm, will retire in January and Adam Lamnin, currently Chief Operating Officer, will move into the role of President and CEO at Assurant Health. Adam is a great example of the deep leadership bench we have within our Company. He has been responsible for the development, marketing, pricing, and selling of Assurant Health’s products for the last year. Since March, Adam has led our Health Care Reform Working Group which has built the roadmap for how we will operate moving forward.
Together, Don and Adam are executing on this plan for the future and restructuring the business for the changes necessary for success. Remember, we have a long history of successfully adapting to changes in the marketplace. As always, our commitment is to pursue the best course of action for the benefit of our customers and shareholders.
With that, I will turn it over to Mike who will talk further about the operating results for each business. Mike?

We referred to our efforts to streamline and target growth opportunities and in-depth look at our second quarter results for each business demonstrates our progress. I will start with Assurant Specialty Property, which produced another strong quarter with improvements in both loss and expense ratios versus the second quarter of 2009.
The loss ratio improved for the quarter and the year despite nearly $5 million of catastrophe related after-tax losses from the recent Tennessee storms. As a reminder, we had no reportable catastrophes during 2009.
Even after adjusting for restructuring charges in the second quarter of 2009, expense ratios improved for the quarter and the year him due to efficiency gains and reduced commission expenses associated with additional premium ceded declines.
Net earned premiums for the quarter and six months were level after adjusting for the unearned premium reserve change we disclosed last quarter. Growth in creditor-placed homeowners, creditor-placed flood and renters insurance was offset by lower real estate owned premiums.
In addition, and as we discussed at year-end, changes in certain client contracts are causing increased amounts of creditor-placed homeowners premiums to be ceded to clients.
We are very pleased to announce that we will add 730,000 new subprime loans later this year. In addition to the new client Rob mentioned, an existing client added 180,000 new loans from an acquisition. These loans will be added to our portfolio in the fourth quarter and will begin to gradually produce premium in the first quarter of 2011. We will also see premium production beginning in the third quarter from an 80,000 loan subprime portfolio we won in the fourth quarter of last year.
From a loan count perspective, these additions will be partially offset by the loss of 550,000 prime loans later this year, which are transferring to other services. The loss of these loans will not have a significant impact on our revenue due to the low prime penetration rates.
So while we still expect our credit replaced revenue to decline in the future as the housing market recovers, our new clients will help mitigate the impact of a declining mortgage loan inventory, particularly in subprime loans.
During the second quarter, we announced the completion of our 2010 catastrophe reinsurance program and complete details are available on our Web site. We also added a table detailing the geographic distribution of our total insured values on page 12 of our financial supplement. Overall, we are very pleased with Specialty Property’s results for the first half of the year.
I’ll now turn to Assurant Health, which reported improved results for the quarter and six months, as corrective pricing and plan design changes reduced loss ratios and we realized savings from 2009 expense initiatives. Net operating income for the quarter increased versus second quarter of 2009. The current quarter includes a $17.4 million after-tax benefit from the settlement of a previously disclosed Colorado lawsuit for less than the original judgment.
Second quarter 2009 earnings were negatively impacted by a $9 million charge for reserve strengthening. Net earned premiums were flat for the quarter and down year-to-date. High lapse rates driven by the increasing cost of medical coverage continued to negatively impact our results.
Total sales of individual medical policies were down slightly for the quarter versus 2009 due to modifications to some of our products in response to health care reform, and we’re up slightly for the six months. While total sales are flat, the split of our sales by product is changing dramatically.
We are seeing tremendous growth in sales of our Health Access plans, which provide more affordable coverage to consumers desiring access to the health care system and a corresponding reduction in sales of more traditional major medical products.
As Rob described, Assurant Health made significant progress during the second quarter and is well on the way toward adapting its business model for the new environment. We will refine our strategy as the regulations affecting our business are issued.
Next, I’ll turn to Assurant Employee Benefits, where net operating income rose slightly for the quarter and increased significantly for the six-month period compared to 2009. We have experienced very favorable disability incidents, fewer challenges in transitioning claimants back to work, and excellent life mortality this year.
We continue to see modest improvement in dental loss ratios due to pricing actions taken in 2009. Net operating income for the quarter was reduced by a $4.4 million after-tax restructuring charge related to our workforce reduction, compared to a similar $1.5 million charge in the second quarter of 2009. This reduction will ultimately lower Employee Benefits’ annualized expenses by $12 million.
Net earned premiums for the quarter and six months of 2010 grew as a result of the addition of the previously disclosed Shenandoah Life Block and assumed business from clients at Disability RMS in 2009. The new DRMS clients in Shenandoah accounted for $30 million of premium in the second quarter and $65 million for the six months, and are on track to add $100 million of premiums for the full year.
While we’re pleased with our second quarter results, remember that the low frequency, high severity nature of our life and disability products can cause loss ratio severity from quarter-to-quarter. We believe our voluntary products and services are well suited for the current challenging environment for small businesses.
I’ll now turn to Assurant Solutions, where second quarter results were leveled with the same period last year after adjusting for the second quarter 2009 restructuring charge of $2.4 million. I should also note that the Solutions’ tax rate has been high in 2010. Due to changes in the mix of our earnings by country and increases in state income taxes, it is likely to remain elevated for the next several quarters.
Second quarter results benefited from improved underwriting experience in the U.K. and cost savings realized from expense reductions in the fourth quarter of 2009. We continue to believe, we will see reductions of 100 to 200 basis points per quarter in our international combined ratios.
While we have seen modest sales growth at a handful of clients, we are still not seeing a meaningful pickup in retail sales in the U.S. Domestically, total gross written premiums are down as credit business continues to run off.
Despite weak consumer spending, sales for domestic service contract business increased. New client growth including a one-time assumption of $11 million of premiums in the quarter and increased vehicle service contract sales contributed to the quarterly increase. It’s important to remember that gross written premiums in the second quarter of 2009 included $29 million from a one-time campaign with Ford Motor Company.
International gross written premiums grew by more than 18% during the quarter due to new client additions in Latin America and favorable foreign exchange rates.
Net earned premiums for Solutions were down for the quarter and the first half of the year; however, international net earned premiums for the first half of the year increased 17% due primarily to growth from both new and existing clients in Canada and Latin America.
Domestic earned premiums decreased due to the impact of lower service contract written premiums in 2009 and the continued runoff of business in areas we are not targeting for growth. Preneed continues to be a strong performer for Solutions. Operating income excluding the impact of the CPI CAP was up over 20% in the quarter and 40% for the six months versus the comparable periods in 2009.
Second quarter sales in our Canadian preneed business were up substantially versus 2009. The increase was driven by the impact of a higher consumer tax rate that went into effect July 1 in certain provinces. This change added about $50 million of state sales during the quarter to the normal run rate for Canada. We have a strong business model in preneed and our sales outlook is positive as our partner, SCI continues to expand its market share.
In summary, we are pleased with Solutions’ results for the quarter and its efforts to grow its client roster in a challenging economic climate. We continue to focus on managing expenses and improving the profitability of our international business.
Turning now to Corporate, results reflect an after-tax restructuring charge of $3 million due to a corporate workforce reduction. This will decrease our annualized expenses by approximately $11 million. Our corporate areas support our businesses, and these reductions are consistent with efforts to achieve efficiency across all areas of Assurant.
Moving to the balance sheet, our investment portfolio appreciated by $334 million from 2009 and we had $604 million of net unrealized gains at June 30, 2010. We generated $19.1 million of net realized gains during the quarter, including $1.9 million of other than temporary impairments
Our investment income has stabilized increasing modestly during the past two quarters, as we are finding attractive risk-adjusted yields compared to holding cash.
In summary, we are pleased with second quarter and first half year results. We made significant progress on many of the initiatives that we have discussed with you in the past and look forward to continuing our progress in the second half of the year.
With that, I’ll turn the call back to Rob.

We are refining the customer needs in a changing environment with a variety of new products across our Specialty platform. We’re not waiting for the economic recovery as we work to grow our business, as seen by new client additions in Specialty Property, Solutions and Employee Benefits.
We are becoming more efficient with $23 million in expense reductions to better position our businesses for the future. We continue to grow and manage our capital to enhance flexibility, protect against future risks and deliver value to our shareholders. To summarize, we are demonstrating notable progress in 2010.
At this time, I would like to open the floor for questions. Operator, we’re ready for questions.

The next criteria we look at is the purchase price, does it produce the return that’s in line with our target expectations for the risks we’re taking on, which is at a minimum, the excess of our cost of capital, which right now is probably somewhere in the 10% to 12% range. We also look at deals based upon cash flows, what is the internal rate of return, and if we find that to be an attractive opportunity, we then start to think about the GAAP reporting issues.
The other thing we think about is our financial situation. Again, what is our current capital position? Do we have flexibility to do a deal? But the deal has to stand on its own merits. The fact that we can make an acquisition doesn’t mean that we should or that we will. So, again, the common element here is discipline when we think about M&A and the capital position that we’re in.

When I thinking about debt capacity, I think about what do we have available to make an opportunistic capital rise. Right now, we’ve got a 17% debt to total cap. We think there is probably 5% or 6% of additional debt capacity that we can take on at this point, which is about somewhere in the $500 million range, but the fact is we have no need for that right now because we have a source of capital in the form of the operating earnings that we’ve been able to dividend up to the holding company.
Debt capacity as it relates to a specific use of proceeds is a different discussion. It’s one that involves collaboration with the rating agencies, discussions about short-term and long-term debt ratios and plans for what the capital structure look like going forward. I can tell you when we think about our capital structure, we have tremendous flexibility to if we do identify a deal that makes sense to further optimize our capital structure and that puts us in a very good position going forward.

I think the first thing is with everything that’s happened and been passed in the world of reform, it’s hard to sort out, what is the market going to look like? Okay. We believe the individual market, which is pretty good size today is going to expand. I know medical all gets one together, but there are many different verticals operating within the health insurance marketplace and we believe that the health insurance market is going to continue to be a specialty marketplace with skills we can lever.
Now you bring up the issue of things like community rating. Our historical strength has been world-class risk management around underwriting, but we, in looking of things, have said that’s kind of a 1.0 version of risk management. In the new world, we’re going to move to risk management 2.0. It’s going to have different characteristics, but it will still be important. We think the fundamental issue of looking at how the consumer buys health care is still going to be complicated and they are going to look for help in consultation on how to access and navigate the system.
And then, on all of that, hey, that’s all interesting, but can you earn attractive returns there? We think we can. So, again, it’s based on a set of assumptions, some of those, Mike mentioned, the success we’re having with new plans. We think all those fit in as part of our future, but we’re going to play things out and evaluate what we think is an exciting future here moving forward, and we think we’re going to be right.

Remember, we spend a lot of time in the area of understanding consumer needs in this market and have pivoted our products to things that respond to that affordability issue, and that is really paying off. Now the focus on the loss ratio is a good one and something we need to pay attention to, but I just also want you to think about and point out the game of driving to the low combined ratio is the old model, okay, because the new model says you need to play in an environment where there’s a constraint on a piece of the combined ratio, which is the minimum medical loss ratio yet to be defined. So what you really talk about is how do you operate with the remaining piece and be in a position to generate profits.

If you just look at things originally, they plan to make recommendations in June. It has move further out. There is issues around how our issues like quality of care is going to be dealt with, which is a center point I think of what the reform is focused on, but when you get into the detail of what is the reason for that kind of thing, there are still very healthy debate underway.

We are pleased with our third quarter performance. Operating results improved in all four businesses compared to the third quarter of 2009.Net operating income was up 9% and diluted earnings per share increas",823,"Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our third quarter performance. Operating results improved in all four businesses compared to the third quarter of 2009.
Net operating income was up 9% and diluted earnings per share increased 19%. Annualized operating return on equity was 11.5% for the quarter. Our diluted book value per share increased about 3% in the quarter and about 10% compared to year end 2009.
Our actions to adapt our product offerings and manage expenses while pursuing new sources of revenue are building a stronger foundation for long-term growth. I will begin by highlighting a few trends and market conditions related to performance from each of our businesses.
During the quarter Assurant Solutions made progress in developing new customers and distribution channels. International profitability improved and our premium business continued to grow by successfully executing its business plan.
Based upon the actions we have taken the international combined ratio showed meaningful improvement in the quarter. We expect continued improvement in the fourth quarter consistent with our prior estimates.
Our premium life insurance business continues to produce strong results from our partnership with SCI, the leading funeral services provider in North America. Operating income in faith sales both showed nice gains over the third quarter of 2009.
Looking ahead, we expect international credit insurance service contracts worldwide including wireless and our pre-funded funeral products will drive growth for Solutions. We have solid sales pipelines in each of these areas that we expect to translate into revenues. This will help compensate for the run-off from Circuit City and our domestic credit products. At Solutions revenue growth and operational efficiency remain priorities.
Turning to Assurant Specialty Property, third quarter results were strong aided by the mild hurricane season. The business continues to deliver outstanding results in a very dynamic market. We are seeing production from a new client added during the last quarter. At the same time, our efforts to expand other products such as renters and flood are going well. Our new clients will continue to support solid results for specialty property in 2011.
Moving on to Assurant Health, the business continues to focus operations around customers. Improve financial results over the prior year were driven primarily by pricing actions and plan design changes implemented in the second half of 2009. However, health care reform is beginning to impact our results. We expect this will continue in both the fourth quarter and 2011 as the marketplace evolves.
We pride ourselves in our ability to adapt to changing markets. Health demonstrated this by modifying products, discontinuing the sale of other products and reducing expenses. We also developed and introduced new products that address customer needs around coverage and affordability. These products were introduced in mid-September initial feedback from our agents and customer’s is positive, an encouraging signs as we move forward.
We continue to believe there are significant opportunities in the individual medical market and that we have the specialty expertise to be successful. Our experience with individual Health products and our excellent relationship with our distribution partners will continue to serve as well.
We are in the early innings of repositioning our Health business. We have taking costs out of the business and will continue to drive for greater efficiency and effectiveness in our operations. While the transformation will not be easy or quick, we believe we are on the right path for success. Our commitment remains the same, to pursue the best course of action for the benefit of our customers and shareholders.
At Assurant Employee Benefits, we achieved strong results through continued focus on the small employer, pricing discipline and expense management. Operating results benefited from very favorable disability incidents rates and improving dental product line and continued good mortality experience.
Looking ahead, we expect the disability loss ratio to move upward as disability experience begins to revert to more traditional levels and the low interest rate environment requires higher reserves for new claims. However, dental loss experience should continue to improve and the business will continue to benefit from the expense reductions implemented earlier this year.
On the revenue side, when our small business customers start hiring again, premiums will increase. In the meantime, Employee Benefits is focused on driving grow through disability RMS, our alternative distribution channel along with work site and voluntary products.
Moving to highlights on the balance sheet. Our corporate capital position increased to $710 million during the quarter. It provides us with a great deal of financial flexibility. As we enter the last two months of 2010, we will continue to be disciplined in deploying our capital. Our priorities are to continue to make prudent investments to fuel growth and return capital to our shareholders.
So, overall, a good quarter for Assurant. Our businesses are creating opportunities aimed at generating long-term results, while managing changing market dynamics.
Now, I’ll let Mike walk you through the operating results for each business. Mike?

4026111,113912518,82745,"Assurant Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob. I’ll start with Assurant Solutions where international results showed strong improvement while domestic pressures remain. Net operating income of about $32 million for the third quarter of 2010 increased 2% compared to third quarter of 2009",1516,"Thanks, Rob. I’ll start with Assurant Solutions where international results showed strong improvement while domestic pressures remain. Net operating income of about $32 million for the third quarter of 2010 increased 2% compared to third quarter of 2009.
Income increased due to improved international underwriting experience particularly in the United Kingdom, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower tax rates. Domestically net earned premiums declined for the quarter primarily due to the discontinuation of extended service contracts sales from Circuit City in 2009 and the continued decline of credit insurance.
Gross written premiums decreased 2.4% versus the third quarter of 2009 due to lower credit insurance premiums. Sales of service contracts were up by about 5%. The domestic combined ratio increased during the quarter due to higher lost experienced in Extended Service Contracts resulting from an increase in the severity of claims within the consumer goods market.
Internationally, we saw increases in net earned premiums in Canada and Latin America reflecting new and existing client growth and favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Gross written premiums increased 7.5% due to the growth of Extended Service Contracts in Brazil and Argentina, growth in new and existing Latin American credit insurance clients.
As Rob mentioned, the international combined ratio improved 104.1%, overall sales increases improve results in the U.K. due to our pricing and underwriting actions and expense reductions in our European business drove the improvement.
Preneed Life Insurance continue to be a strong performer for Solutions. Preneed net operating income increased 12.5% versus the third quarter of 2009. Third quarter Canadian Preneed sales were higher than expected as we work through a backlog of business sold in anticipation of provincial tax changes that went into effect in July.
As a result, the business in Canada added about $45 million of faith sales during the third quarter on top of $55 million last quarter. That backlog has now been process so Canadian Preneed sales should revert to more normal levels in the fourth quarter. We have a strong business model in Preneed with a positive sales outlook.
In summary, we are pleased with progress internationally during the quarter. Solutions continues to find growth opportunities which help offset premium pressures cause by the run-off block of business. We look for further growth and profit improvement from international through the rest of this year and next. We continue to review experience with our domestic clients and make the modifications necessary to drive improved results.
I’ll now turn to Assurant Specialty Property which produced another strong quarter. Net operating income was approximately $107 million, a 3% improvement versus the third quarter of 2009. We experienced no reportable third quarter catastrophes in either 2009 or 2010.
Operational improvements along with lower commission expenses due to greater clients ceded reinsurance activity drove the expense ratio down and the combined ratio dropped. Net earned premiums for the quarter increased slightly primarily due to growth in creditor-placed homeowners and flood insurance, as well as, renters insurance.
This was partially offset by increased ceded creditor-placed homeowners premiums and lower real estate-owned premiums. The increased in ceded premium was result of previously disclosed changes in client contracts.
Overall, Specialty Property delivered excellent results for the quarter and the first nine months of the year. We’ve told you in the past that we expect a decline in creditor-placed revenue overtime but we are pleased to say that new clients we have added during the past several quarters are helping to counter this longer-term trend.
Turning next to Assurant Health, which continues to make progress in adapting to the new healthcare landscape. Net operating income of $5.3 million for the quarter compared favorably to a loss of $4.8 million in the prior year. Workforce reductions that we announced in August reduced third quarter income by about $5 million after-tax and will have an additional $1.3 million after-tax impact in the fourth quarter.
I’d also note that Assurant Health’s third quarter and year-to-date results reflect higher tax rate due to limitations under the health care reform act on the deductibility of employee compensation.
Net earned premiums for the quarter were down slightly versus 2009 primarily due to a decline in members. The impact of the membership decline was partially offset by pricing and plan design changes implemented to prove -- improve underwriting results.
Sales during the quarter were adversely impacted as we modified our product portfolio to comply with the healthcare legislation. Certain products were discontinued and others were replaced in order to address the affordability concerns of the consumers.
Sales of these new products began in mid-September despite encouraging early responses to them sales in the fourth quarter are likely to be lower then our prior levels due to lingering consumer uncertainty related to health care reform.
The Assurant Health team is responding to the changing marketplace by reducing expenses and making numerous pricing and plan design changes. Overall, we are confident that our actions preserve a path towards achieving a sustainable specialty business model.
Turning now to Assurant Employee Benefits, net operating income increased significantly during the -- versus the third quarter of 2009 to approximately $17 million in the current quarter due to extremely favorable long-term disability incidents and improved dental results.
Premiums grew compared to the prior-year due to the addition of the previously reported assumption of the Shenandoah Block and business assumed from clients that disability RMS in 2009. These accounted for $29 million of premium in the third quarter and $94 million for the nine months. Sales in our traditional channel remain challenging.
The continued low interest rate environment will pressure investment income from employee benefits as we move into 2011. As a result, we expect to lower the reserve interest assumption for new long-term disability claims beginning in 2011.
Our disability rate for all LTD reserves is currently 5.25%. 2011 rate has not been determined but to give you a sense of the impact a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate applied to reserves for new claims would increase policy holder benefits by roughly $8 billion pre-tax in 2011.
Turning now to Corporate matters. Our capital position remains strong. At the end of the third quarter we had $710 million of capital at the holding company, an increase of $135 million since the end of the second quarter. This total includes our $250 million capital buffer for tail event risks. So our total deployable capital was approximately $460 million at the end of the quarter.
For 2010, we continue to expect that total dividend up stream will equal operating income plus the excess capital freed-up by our restructuring and solutions. Year-to-date, we have taken dividends in more than $450 million from our operating companies, including $90 million from the solutions restructuring. Annual uses of capital excluding share repurchases are approximately $170 million.
Our investment portfolio continues to track the broad investment grade corporate bonds index. At the end of the third quarter, net pre-tax unrealized gains were $944 million, an increase of $663 million during 2010.
We also think it’s important to comment on the current interest rate environment. While we expect rates to rise eventually the timing is uncertain. And similar to other insurance companies we face reductions in investment income from declining reinvestment yields.
However, we believe that our low turnover investment strategy will moderate the pace of declined in our overall portfolio yield. In addition, our business mix with its low asset leverage means that a decrease in investment yields will have less of an impact on overall earnings compared to companies with greater asset leverage.
There are however, certain areas where low interest rates do have a meaningful impact in our results, such as the employee benefits LTD reserve as I mentioned earlier. Additionally, all of our businesses are affected by the cost of our retirement benefit plans.
Due to reductions in the pension liability discount rate used to value our plans, 2010 pre-tax retirement expenses will be about $10 million higher than in 2009. Approximately $4 million of that increase will be expense in the fourth quarter of this year. We expect the discount rate next year to decline by approximately 70 basis points to about 5.2% which will cause a further increase of approximately $10 million pre-tax in 2011.
We also want to remind you that in line with our accounting policy, we’ll perform our annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter. While we hold our goodwill in the corporate segment our testing is done at the business unit level.
We will carefully consider the impact of the economic environment on each business and Health will also factor in the impact of health care reform. We’ll report the results of our goodwill testing on our fourth quarter call.
In summary, we are pleased with the third quarter and year-to-date results for 2010. We made significant progress on many of the initiatives we have discussed with you and look forward to continuing our progress as we close out the balance of this year.
And with that, I’ll turn the call back to Rob.

So again I think that the key thing because we’ve got other new clients coming on you know in the fourth quarter and first quarter of next year really relates to their particular placement rates and the way we are taking things on. Let me take that back. I guess, the client we added during the third quarter was a flat cancellation so that’s what causing a part of the rise in the gross written.

We are working on all those things. So I think you can see meaningful improvement. I haven’t quite centered it around basis point improvement in the ROE but I think we can see meaningful improvement.

We still think that the affordability issue is huge in the marketplace, Mark. Consumers really want some lower cost options and so that’s what these plans are designed to give them.
