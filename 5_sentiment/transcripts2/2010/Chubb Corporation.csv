Before we begin, Chubb has asked me to make the following statements. In order to help you understand Chubb's industry and its results, members of Chubb's management team will include in today's presentation forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is possible that actual results may differ from estimates and forecasts that Chubb's management team might take today, additional information regarding factors that could cause such differences to appear in Chubb's filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In the prepared remarks and responses to questions during today's presentation of Chubb's fourth quarter 2009 financial results, Chubb's management may refer to financial measures that are not derived from generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP.

We had another excellent quarter capping off a terrific year. Despite a weak economy and negative premium growths throughout the industry, we produced outstanding results for 2009, the second best operating income per share in Chubb's",370,"Thank you very much. We had another excellent quarter capping off a terrific year. Despite a weak economy and negative premium growths throughout the industry, we produced outstanding results for 2009, the second best operating income per share in Chubb's history, an ROE of 15.4%, and book value per share growth of 23% for the year. Each of our SPUs produced a combined ratio below 90% for both the fourth quarter and the full year.
The drivers of our success have not changed. We have good underwriters. We have the best producers in the industry. We take care of our customers with unparalleled service. We invest conservatively. And we actively manage our capital.
For the fourth quarter, operating income per share was up 5% to $1.56. For all of 2009, operating income per share was up 10% to $6.14. The strength of our fourth quarter performance is further evidenced by the fact that unlike many other companies in the industry, our operating results do not include increases in the net value of our alternative investments.
For the fourth quarter, increases in the net value of alternative investments amounted to $159 million or $0.32 per share after tax. This increase is largely responsible for our net realized capital gains of $0.37 per share after tax bringing our fourth quarter reported net income to $2.03 per share, an increase of 80% over the quarter of 2008. On a net income basis, our return on equity in the fourth quarter of 2009 was 18%.
Net written premiums for the fourth quarter were down 4% or 5% excluding currency, driven largely by lower exposures that have resulted from the decline in economic activity. Recent investment and underwriting results produced a GAAP book value per share of $47.09 at 2009 year-end. That's a 4% increase since September 30th, 2009, and a 23% increase since year-end 2008.
Our capital position is excellent. And Ricky will talk about the progress we've made in our share buyback program. As you saw in our press release, we provided operating income per share guidance for 2010 of $5.15 to $5.55. I have more to say in guidance in my closing remarks.
And now, John Degnan will discuss our operating performance.

I'm going to begin with a review of the individual business unit results for the fourth quarter.Chubb Personal Insurance net written premiums were down 3%, and CPI produced a combined ratio of 80.7, slightly better than 2008's outstanding",1780,"Thanks, John. I'm going to begin with a review of the individual business unit results for the fourth quarter.
Chubb Personal Insurance net written premiums were down 3%, and CPI produced a combined ratio of 80.7, slightly better than 2008's outstanding 80.9. CPI had negligible CAT in the fourth quarter, whereas in the fourth quarter of 2008, CPI had a 1.2% point benefit from CATs due to a downward revision of our estimates for losses from Hurricane Ike. On an ex-CAT basis, CPI's fourth quarter combined was 80.8 in 2009, contrasted with 82.1 in 2008, a great result.
Homeowners premiums were down 4% with a combined ratio of 75.8. Personal auto premiums increased 3% driven by growth outside the US, and the combined ratio is 94.2. In other personal lines, premiums were down 7%, and the combined ratio was 75.5. Reduced purchases of new homes, cars, yachts, jewelry, and fine art continue to adversely affect premium growth.
But it seems obvious to us, from our homeowners results particularly, that our masterpiece product in the superb claim service had backed it up, which were the subject of a very positive story in balance last week, continued to meet both our customers' needs and our shareholders' expectations.
For the full year, CPI turned in a combined ratio of 84.1, three points better than 2008. Excluding CAT, CPI's combined ratio was 83.2 in 2009 and 81.7 in 2008.
At Chubb Commercial Insurance, premiums were down 6% for the quarter. Premiums for multiple peril and property and marine were down only 3%, casualty was down about 5%. But worker's comp, the CCI line that is perhaps most impacted by the current adverse economic conditions, was down 18%.
Worker's comp renewal retention was comparable to prior quarters, and renewal rates increased slightly. The worker's comp renewal exposures were down significantly due to lower payrolls resulting in an overall premium change of about negative 7% on renewal. In addition, there was a similar negative on fourth quarter worker's comp growth from audit premium adjustments related to prior quarters as actual payrolls turned out to be lower than original estimates. The balance of the decline of worker's comp premiums is due to fewer new business opportunities.
CCI's combined ratio for the quarter was 89.9, compared to 88.8 in 2008. For the full year, CCI's combined ratio was 89.9, which was four points better than 2008. Excluding CAT, CCI's combined ratio was 88.7 in 2009 and 85.8 in 2008.
CCI's renewal retention rate in the US was 84% for the quarter with an average renewal rate increase of 2%, evidence of our success in retaining business at profitable rates. The ratio of new to loss business in the US was 0.9 to a 1.
At Chubb's Specialty Insurance, net written premiums were down 1% for the fourth quarter, and the combined ratio was 84.1, compared to 83.8 in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year, CSI's combined ratio was 84.1 in 2009 and 83.3 in 2008.
Professional liability premiums declined two points in the fourth quarter, and the combined ratio was 89.5, compared to 88.4 in the fourth quarter of 2008. In the US, fourth quarter renewal retention was 84%, average renewal rate was up one point, and the ratio to new to loss business was 0.7 to 1.
New business is hard to come by as some of our competitors appear to be willing to under-price new business with the expectation that they'll return to rate adequacy when a hardening market permits it. But as that's a game that can have a bad ending and it's a game we won't play.
Surety fourth quarter net written premiums were up 80%, and profitability was strong with a combined ratio of 40.5 for the quarter and 37.4 for the year.
We'd explained during our last several conference calls the adverse impact on premium growth, which results from the weakened global economic climate. So it was no surprise to us that Chubb's premiums for the year were down about 4% ex-currency. Exposures are down in all three lines of business. They run the gamut from lower luxury home construction and reduced purchases of valuable articles and personal items, to lower payrolls and fewer new plans and additions in commercial lines, to reduced M&A and IPO activity and professional liability. While we obviously have not yet seen all the year-end numbers for the industry, we believe that the economic environment has had a similar negative impact on the industry as a whole.
As we ended 2009, there were some signs that an economic recovery was underway. But as we said in October, it will be a while before economic divisions are sufficiently robust to generate premium growth which is lag in the economic recovery. Accordingly, we expect the industry to experience negative premium growth in 2010 for the fourth consecutive year. However, if economic conditions improve, we would expect the incremental or (inaudible) improvements in premium trends over the course of the year.
We obviously look for any signs of market firming. And based on what we have done over the past two years to centralize and make more efficient our processing, along with managing our superb distribution system, we are poised to take advantage of any opportunity. So don't worry about our missing the signs. That said, they're not here yet. And when they do emerge, they'll probably be more incremental than dramatic, but we're ready.
In the meantime, we'll continue to focus on good underwriting, solid bottom line results, and doing the things we need to do to be ready for more dramatic improvement down the line. Our ability to carefully navigate the shoals of the soft market while we're waiting for a return to more rational pricing in the industry should be evident in our ability to secure two points of average renewal rate increases in CCI, and three points in professional liability in 2009 in the midst of tough economic conditions and declining premiums.
Last July, I gave you a comprehensive overview of how we were assessing our exposure to credit crisis claims, which have emerged over the past three accident years, 2007, '08, and '09. In the six months since then, the observations relied upon to support our conclusion that we are prudently reserving those accident years for such claims remain accurate, and in some cases, even more convincing.
I described the exposure-based analysis we prefer to use to establish our reserve, in contrast to the methods which start with an industry exposure pick, and then extrapolate the individual carrier exposure by allocating the industry estimate among carriers based on market share. Our own analysis looks at the actual claims we have and the developments in the underlying litigation. So the longer we have to manage our claims, the higher level of confidence we have in our estimates. As a result, six months later, we have a more developed experiential base on which to predicate our accident year estimates. And as a result, even - have even more confidence in assessment that current reserves are adequate.
With respect to D&O securities transaction credit crisis claims, the last six months in Chubb's experience have not reduced significant additional D&O exposure. Both the Nera and the Cornerstone year-end reports confirmed Chubb's experience, noting a significant decline in 2009 of credit crisis related to securities transaction filings. As for the financial sector claims where the greatest activity has occurred, one leading commentator concluded that all of the major cases that were profitable have already been filed and the pool was in effect fished out.
With respect to E&O claims where there's been more activity relatively in credit crisis claims since early 2008, that continued in the second half of 2009. As I mentioned last year, a significant amount of this E&O claim activity involves investor class action claims that target the offering materials for credit derivative securities. They are typically brought against multiple defendants including the issuers, underwriters, and the rating agency that were involved in the offerings. We cover only some of these defendants. And of those we do cover, we had already received claims for most of them.
In our July call, I also discussed a number of mitigating factors affecting our potential E&O exposures in these claims, including the type of insurers we have in these claims, our limits and excess attachments profiles, significant defenses for liability, and mitigating coverage issues. Given that the continuing claims activity in the fourth quarter involves many of the same insurers and policies, which contain annual single aggregates of liability, these factors have not changed.
As with earlier types of E&O claim activity, we're watching the development of these claims closely and believe that we're prudently deserving for the exposures we see developing. We continue to believe that in the end, the exposure we do have will be relatively lower in E&O than in D&O. The bottom line is that we're even more confident today than we were six months ago that we are adequately reserved for the accident years in which the claims have been made.
Jumping back from the credit crisis claims activities for the moment, there have been varying reports over the past several weeks about the trend in 2009 of overall securities transactions, some of those reports suggesting that there has been a dramatic increase. For our purposes and we believe for those who are trying to assess insurance carriers exposure, the relevant statistics to look at is not the number of filings because that counts multiple defendants in a lawsuit including non-issue co-defendants such as law firms, and accounting firms, and investment banks as well as multiple lawsuits against one issuer, rather than simply the number of issuers sued. As a result, it tends to inflate or amplify losses because it doesn't clarify the actual limits exposed.
Therefore, a count of the number of unique publicly traded companies sued in securities transactions as appears in the Cornerstone report is the preferable tool for analyzing exposure. In CSI, we take care to count the number of public companies sued in securities transactions, which drives the severity to this class, as opposed to counting the number of lawsuits or the number of defendants in each lawsuit. Our approach to industry statistics suggests that the number of securities transactions against publicly traded companies was down dramatically in 2009, in fact to the lowest point in the last six years, and comparable Cornerstone calculation shows a similar result and has the 2009 number the second lowest in the last six years. That's good news for professional liability carriers.
With that, I'll turn it over to Ricky Spiro.

We're also very pleased with our financial performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Looking first at our operating results, underwriting income continue to be strong, amounted to $436 million in the quarter. Property and casualty investment income after tax was flat during the quarter at $317 million, impacted by the low yield environment, partially offset by a modest favorable effect of currency fluctuations on our international investments.
Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $193 million or $0.37 per share after tax. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we had net realized investment losses before tax of $250 million or $0.45 per share after tax.
Let me elaborate for a moment on John's earlier comment on how we present the results of alternative investments. We include our share of the change in the net equity of our alternative investments in net realized investment gains and losses, which is not a component of operating income. In contrast, many of our competitors include the change in net equity from their alternative investments in investment income, and therefore in operating income. The distinction is important when comparing operating results among different P&C companies.
For example, in the fourth quarter of 2009, our net realized investment gains before tax included $169 million of gains from our alternative investment portfolio, including $90 million from a single private equity investment. In the fourth quarter of 2008, our net realized investment losses before tax included a $125 million of losses from our alternative investments.
On an after tax basis, we have net realized investment gains from alternative investments of $0.32 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to net realized investment losses of $0.23 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008. As a result, we had a $0.55 per share after tax improvement in the performance of our alternative investments in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. This positive swing is not reflected in our increase in operating income in the fourth quarter of '09, compared to the year earlier quarter, but it is recognized in that income.
Unrealized depreciation before tax at December 31st, 2009 declined to $1.6 billion from $1.8 billion at the end of the third quarter. This decrease was largely attributable to the increase in Treasury rates during the fourth quarter. The total carrying value of our consolidated and investment portfolio was $42 billion as of December 31st, 2009, unchanged from the end of the third quarter. The composition of our portfolio also remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 4.1 years, and the average credit is AA, too.
We also continue to have excellent liquidity of the holding company. At December 31st, 2009, our holding company portfolio included $2.6 billion of investments, including $1 billion of short term investments. Book value per share under GAAP at December 31, '09 was $47.09, compared to $38.13 at year-end 2008, an increase of 23%. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available for sales fixed maturities at amortized costs, was $44.37, compared to $38.38 at 2008 year-end.
As for reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the fourth quarter of 2009 on prior year reserves by SBU as follows, in CPI, we had about $35 million; CCI, we had about $40 million; CSI, had about a $125 million; and, reinsurance assumed had about $15 million; bringing the total favorable development for Chubb to about $215 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the fourth quarter combined ratio of about 7.5 points overall.
For comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2008, we had about $210 million of favorable development for the company overall, including about $40 million in CPI, $30 million in CCI, $115 million in CSI, and $25 million in reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2008 was about 7 points.
During the fourth quarter of 2009, our loss reserves increased by $26 million, including an increase of $74 million for the insurance business, and a decrease of $48 million for the reinsurance assumed business, which is in run off. The impact of currency fluctuation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in an increase in reserves of about $70 million.
The expense ratio for the quarter is 30.1, compared to 30.4 in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Turning to capital management, we were very active with our share buyback program during the fourth quarter. We repurchased $9.8 million shares at an aggregate cost of $489 million. This completed the $20 million share repurchase program we announced in December 2008. Last month, we announced a new $25 million share repurchase program, and we began in December to buy back shares under the new authorization. Our intention is to complete this new repurchase program by the end of the year. The average cost of our repurchases in 2009 was $47.09 per share.
And now, I'll turn it back to John Finnegan.

In this environment, Chubb performed extremely well in both the fourth quarter and the full year. Here are the highlights.
For the fourth quarter, we had operating income per share of $1.66. For the full year, we had operating income per share of $6.14 and operating ROE of 15.4% even after five years of soft market conditions. These results were achieved through disciplined underwriting and a focus on bottom line profitability rather than premium growth.
We also enjoyed a substantial fourth quarter net realized capital gain bringing net income for the year to $2.2 billion, a 21% increase over 2008. Premium renewal rates of CCI and CSI continued to be positive in the fourth quarter as they have been all year. Our conservative investment portfolio continued to perform well and remains a major contributor to the strength and stability of our balance sheet.
Book value per share increased 4% in the three months ended December 31, and was up 23% for the full year. We continue to manage our capital for share repurchases and dividends, while still leaving us sufficient capital to maintain our ratings and take advantage of any significant upturn in insurance market conditions.
We have developed our 2010 guidance within the following framework, we are assuming that the industry will continue to experience a decline in net written premiums, that capital losses will revert to more historical average, and that interest rates in the US dollar will remain at 2009 year-end levels. On that basis, we expect operating income per share to be in the range of $5.15 to $5.55. This guidance is based on our expectation that net written premiums will be flat to down 2%, including about a 2% point positive impact of currency based on current exchange rates. We'll have a combined ratio of 90 to 92 for the year based on a combined ratio of 90 to 93 for CPI, 92 to 95 for CCI, and 84 to 87 for CSI. Property and casualty investment income will be flat. Finally, we will have $328 million average diluted shares outstanding for the year.
The guidance assumes 3% points of catastrophe losses in line with our historical average. This compares to the unusually benign 0.8 points of CATs we had in 2009. In terms of sensitivity, the impact of each percentage point of catastrophe loss in 2010 operating income per share is approximately $0.22.
At the mid-point of the guidance range, our projected operating income per share for 2010 is down $0.79 from our actual operating income in 2009. About $0.50 of this anticipated year-over-year decline relates to the higher assumed level of CATs in 2010 versus the unusually low level in 2009. The balance largely reflects the negative impact of the continued soft market on both the margins and lower earn premium, which more than offsets the positive effect of our stock buyback program.
In summary, Chubb posted terrific results in 2009 in a difficult industry environment. Going forward, we expect 2010 to continue to present major for the industry related to both the economy and the likelihood that CATs will increase this year to levels more aligned with historical experience. Accordingly, we expect earnings to decline in 2010, but to levels that will still be attractive by historical standards especially that - given that we're on the sixth year of a soft market. Moreover, we believe that excellent capital position, conservative investment portfolio, and strong credit ratings will allow us to leverage our demonstrated underwriting talent to generate solid returns in an uncertain economic environment, capital on market opportunities and rate increases as they materialize.
And with that, I'll open up the call the line to your questions.

Also, with respect to the 2010 accident year, we don't even establish yet (inaudible) your number until we get into the first quarter. But as John indicated, we believe that the credit crisis appears to be subsiding.

When I weigh those things together with an economy that is likely to be at least modestly growing, I guess the only conclusion I reached is that you must be assuming a fairly significant amount of new to loss businesses. You may be a 0.8 or 0.7 new to loss business ratio in order to square all of those factors and come out to that level of guidance.

As we noted in today's press release, the big story for the property and casualty insurance industry in the first quarter was the extraordinary level of natural catastrophes worldwide. Although these catastrophes have a negative impact of $0.67 per share on Chubb's first quarter results, we still produced operating income of $1.14 per share for the quarter, an excellent result, which reflected outstanding underwriting results for the combined ratio excluding catastrophes of 81.3%, nearly six percentage points better than a year ago. This was our best ex-cat combined ratio since 2007, and it was driven by strong contributions from each of our business units.
Our investment portfolio also continue to perform well with net realized investment gains of $127 million pretax or $0.25 per share after tax. That brought our first quarter net income per share to $1.39. In addition, our portfolio of unrealized appreciation before tax increased by about $170 million from year-end 2009. 
These investment and underwriting results produced a GAAP book value per share of $48.17 at March 31, 2010. That's a 2% increase since year-end 2009 and a 23% increase since March 31, 2009. 
Our capital position is excellent. During the quarter, we raised our common stock dividend for the 28th consecutive year and also have been actively buying back our stock. 
And now John Degnan will discuss our operating performance."

This included a 4% positive impact of currency translation with a generally similar impact in each business unit. For Chubb Personal Insurance net written premiums were up 4% and CPI produced a combined ratio of 104.4% compared to 90% last year. However, CPI had 22.8 points of cats [catastrophes] in the first quarter this year compared to only 1.5 points in the first quarter of 2009. On an ex-CAT basis, CPI's first quarter combined ratio was 81.6 in 2010, nearly seven points better than a year ago when it was 88.5.
Homeowners premiums were up a point with a combined ratio of 113.3, including 35.1 points of cats. On an ex-cat basis, the combined ratio for homeowners in the first quarter was 78.2 in 2010, a substantial improvement over a year ago when it was 85.8. Personal Auto premiums increased 11% driven by growth outside the U.S., a combined ratio with 91.5.  In other Personal lines, premiums were up 7% and the combined ratio was 87.5. 
At Chubb Commercial Insurance, premiums for the quarter were down 1%. Premiums for multiple peril and for workers comp were down 6%, but casualty premiums increased 1% and property and marine was up 2%.
CPI combined ratio for the quarter was 93.8 compared to 90.2 a year earlier. Excluding the 11.4 point impact of cats, CCI's first quarter combined ratio this year was 82.4, nearly seven points better than last year's 89.2. 
CCI's renewal retention rate in the U.S. was 84% for the quarter with an average renewal rate increase of 1%, further evidence of our success in retaining business at profitable rates in a competitive marketplace.  The ratio of new to lost business in the U.S. was 1:1.
At Chubb Specialty Insurance, net written premiums were up 3% for the first quarter, and the combined ratio was 80.9%, more than four points better than the 85.1% we recorded in the first quarter of 2009. Professional Liability premiums grew 3% in the first quarter, and the combined ratio was 86.2% compared to 91.3% in the first quarter of 2009. In the U.S., first quarter retention renewal was 85% and average renewal rates were down 1%. The ratio of new to lost business was 1:1. For Surety, first quarter net written premiums were down 1%, but profitability was strong with a combined ratio of 39.8 for the quarter.
Before I comment on what we are seeing in the marketplace, let me give you some context around our first quarter cat numbers. First, the $344 million pretax impact of catastrophes that we reported today is higher than the $290 million we estimated in our press release on March 29 largely because of the impact of a late March storm on the East Coast of the U.S. that produced additional losses that were not included in the March 29 announcement.
Second, although our cat losses in the quarter add up to a large number, these losses are consistent with our overall presence in the affected markets. For example, this year's Mid-Atlantic and Northeast storms hit many of Chubb's high-concentration territories. In contrast, our cat losses in last year's first quarter were substantially lower than many other companies because the majority of U.S. cat activity then was in the Midwest and the South where Chubb has a relatively modest market share.
Each time we're confronted at Chubb with a widespread cat, I'm reminded of one consistent dynamic. For us, a catastrophe is a business event, one which will affect our financial results and will challenge our value-added business proposition of providing world-class service. For our insurers, particularly homeowners, it is a personal event, involving disruption of their lives as well as property damage. As such, it presents a unique opportunity for us to demonstrate value and the timeliness, empathy and fairness with which we respond.
Our most loyal customers tend to be the ones who have had a claim. I am pleased to say that our survey results from customers impacted by the largest of the March storms in the U.S. indicate a satisfied or very satisfied rating of more than 97%. That means to me our folks are responding yet again in the way which has distinguished this company for 128 years.
As John said earlier, we are very pleased with our outstanding underwriting results. They were not easy to come by. The marketplace remain quite competitive. Average commercial renewal rates in the U.S. were up 1% in CCI, but down 1% in CSI. So overall, basically flat. It appears that for now, rates have plateaued from the slightly higher increases we were seeing last year. We are still not seeing the broad-based weakening of terms and conditions which characterized the soft markets of the late 90s with two exceptions among our competitors.
In Commercial lines, we see some insurers dramatically increasing flood and quake sublimits in certain lines without any commensurate premium increase. And in Specialty lines, some competitors are substantially lower in deductibles on non-financial institution public D&O without any corresponding premium increase. Neither of these paths is sustainable long term.
Turning now to New Commercial business. We were successful in writing well-priced new accounts in our targeted niches. Furthermore, our renewal exposures and audit premiums were less negative in the first quarter of this year than in the fourth quarter of 2009, suggesting that the negative impacts of reduced payrolls and other recession-related phenomena are beginning to trail off. Other encouraging signs include stable to slightly higher renewal retention, submission counts and written to submitted ratios. 
We have commented previously about the aggressive pricing we've observed from some of our competitors in their quest for new business. When those accounts that we lost, as a result of this behavior came up for renewal in the first quarter this year, we won some of that business back in the face of dramatic rate increase demands often at the last minute in the renewal process by those very same competitors.
Over the long haul, what we have always supposed to be the case is bearing out. Our customers, both producers and insurers, place a high value on consistency and predictability, two qualities we have always reflected. And in the end, they prevail. 
While we are encouraged by the modest improvement in premium growth this quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year, we are not yet prepared to say that it reflects a trend. In fact, given the ongoing economic uncertainty and the historically erratic property and casualty market, we believe any sustained improvement will likely emerge in a choppy fashion. 
In January, I gave you a pretty detailed update on our credit crisis claim experience. I'm happy to say that the positive trends we saw then in the frequency of securities class action suits and in some of the judicial trends of dismissals have continued. And we remain confident that we are appropriately reserved during credit crisis claims in the accident years in which the claims have been made. I am particularly pleased about developments in two areas I want to mention specifically: the frequency of non-credit crisis security class-action claims and the recent rulings in credit crisis derivative actions.
For the second straight quarter, even as the number of new credit crisis securities class actions virtually disappeared, we did not see a corresponding increase in the number of non-credit crisis class actions. So for those observers who have speculated that there was a substantial number of backlog claims waiting to be filed, the evidence so far doesn't support that. And the two-year statute of limitations is already a bar to actions in which the triggering event, typically a corrective disclosure, took place in 2007 and early 2008, the years in which I presume backlog would have been building. 
In addition, we are encouraged by the continuing relatively high-dismissal rate in the first quarter of derivative actions which might otherwise trigger our Side A coverages. Unlike the stock option backdating claims which were heavily weighted toward derivative actions, credit crisis claims have been predominantly securities class actions.
However, in connection with the credit crisis derivative claims which have been brought, we are seeing the application of well-established legal protection governing mismanagement allegation and the defendants are having great, in some cases even unexpected success in defending those claims. For example, in the recent decision involving AIG's credit crisis woes, the court has made it clear that they will not engage in second-guessing management's legitimate business decisions regardless of how badly those decisions played out.
So although some observers have asserted that credit crisis derivative claims have the potential to impact Side A coverages, we are not currently seeing an increased level of exposure as a result of them. And now, I'll turn it over to Ricky Spiro."

As usual, I will review our financial results for the quarter. I will also provide commentary on capital management, the impact of currency and the April 1 renewal of our property reinsurance program. Looking first at our first quarter ope",1171,"Thanks, John. As usual, I will review our financial results for the quarter. I will also provide commentary on capital management, the impact of currency and the April 1 renewal of our property reinsurance program. 
Looking first at our first quarter operating results, we had underwriting income of $204 million even in a difficult cat quarter. Property and casualty investment income after tax was up 2% during the quarter to $313 million. The continued impact of the low-yield environment was offset this quarter by a modest favorable effect of currency fluctuation on the income from our international investment.
Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $127 million or $0.25 per share after tax, including net gain of $88 million on our alternative investments portfolio. For comparison, in the first quarter of 2009, we had net realized investment losses before tax of $266 million or $0.48 per share after tax largely due to losses on our alternative investments portfolio related to the credit crisis.  As a reminder, we account for alternative investments on a one-quarter lag and we include the changes in the net equity of our alternative investments in net realized gains and losses. Unlike some insurers, we will include them in investment income.
During the first quarter of 2010, we incurred a one-time tax charge of $22 million or $0.07 per share related to the recently enacted Federal health care legislation which eliminated the tax benefit associated with Medicare Part D subsidies to be received by companies that provide qualifying prescription drug coverage to retirees. 
Unrealized appreciation before tax at March 31, 2010 increased to $1.8 billion from $1.6 billion at the end of 2009. The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $42.3 billion as of March 31, 2010, slightly higher than the amount at year end 2009.
The composition of our portfolio also remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 4.1 years and the average credit rating is Aa2. We also continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At March 31, 2010, our holding company portfolio included $2.4 billion of investments, including $868 million of short-term investments.
Book value per share under GAAP at March 31, 2010 was $48.17 compared to $47.09 at year end 2009, an increase of 2%. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, was $45.19 compared to $44.37 at 2009 year end.
As for reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the first quarter of 2010 on prior-year reserves by SBU [strategic business units] as follows: In CPI, we had about $30 million; CCI had about $90 million; CSI had about $90 million; and Reinsurance Assumed had about $10 million, bringing our total favorable development to about $220 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the first quarter combined ratio of nearly eight points overall.
For comparison, in the first quarter of 2009, we had about $130 million of favorable development for the company overall, including none in CPI, $35 million in CCI, $80 million in CSI and $15 million at reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact from the combined ratio in the first quarter of 2009 was about five points. 
During the first quarter of 2010, our loss reserves increased by $242 million including an increase of $288 million for the Insurance business, nearly all of which was accounted for by the increase in reserves for cat. This was partially offset by a decrease of $46 million for the Reinsurance Assumed business which is in run-off and the impact of currency fluctuation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in a decline in reserves of about $55 million. 
At this point, let me say a few additional words about the impact of currency fluctuation on our financial results. Since about one quarter of our premiums come from outside the U.S., our results expressed in dollars are affected by movement in exchange rates. For example, we had a positive currency impact in the first quarter of 2010 of about 4% on net written premium. This reflects the fact that the U.S. dollar was significantly weaker against most major currencies in this year's first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009.  Going forward, assuming currency rates during the rest of 2010 remain similar to recent exchange rates, we would expect that the favorable impact of currency fluctuation will decline in the coming quarters given the weakening of the U.S. dollar that occurred throughout the remainder of 2009.
Turning to capital management. We were very active with our share buyback program during the first quarter. We repurchased 7 million shares at an aggregate cost of $344 million, and the average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was $49.47 per share. Through the end of the first-quarter, we have repurchased about 10 million shares for approximately 40% of the 25 million share buyback program that we announced in December 2009. This high level of activity reflects the fact that we are opportunistically taking advantage of the attractive economics that we purchased in our stock at current levels. As we have previously stated, our intention is to complete this new repurchase program by the end of the year. In addition, as we said on our fourth quarter conference call, we will continue to review the size of our buyback program in light of our capital position, the prevailing insurance market environment, portfolio investment opportunity cost and other factors. 
In February, our board raised the quarterly common stock dividend by 6% to $0.37 per share or $1.48 on an annual basis. As John said earlier, this was our 28th consecutive annual dividend increase, a continued indication of our financial strength and resilience in a cyclical industry.
As you may know, on April 1, we renewed our major property treaties including our North American cat treaty, our non-U.S. cat treaty and our commercial property per risk treaty. All of these were renewed with the same limits in coverage that we had in the 2009 program. The reinsurance market was orderly, and there was plenty of capacity to meet our needs in each treaty. We were able to achieve an overall cost reduction of approximately 8% across the three treaties. 
Finally, I would like to make a comment regarding our 2010 earnings guidance. As John Finnegan and John Degnan discussed earlier, the adverse effect of the high level of cat activity in the first quarter was partially offset by the strong ex-CAT performance of our core Property and Casualty businesses. As we've done in the past, we intend to defer revisiting our guidance until after the second quarter when we have more information about how the year is progressing. We believe that you have enough information available regarding the impact of cat to make any adjustments that you deem appropriate at this time. 
And now I'll turn it back to John Finnegan."

In a very difficult catastrophe environment, Chubb performed extremely well in the first quarter. Here are the highlights. Operating income per share of $1.14 despite a $0.67 per share adverse impact of cat and a one-time $0.07 per share Medicare-related tax charge. Our ex-cat combined ratio of 81.3% was nearly six points better than last year's excellent 87.2%. On an ex-cat basis, CPI and CCI's combined ratios were nearly seven points better than last year.
In addition, CSI's combined ratio was more than four points better, clearly outstanding underwriting results. Premium growth improved in what continue to be a difficult economic competitive environment. Retention rates remained consistent, and new to lost ratio has improved. Our conservative investment portfolio continued to perform well, generating a substantial first quarter net realized capital gain, as well as an increase in unrealized appreciation. Book value per share increased by more than $1 since 2009 year end to $48.17. And we continue to actively manage our capital by buying back shares at attractive prices and by increasing our dividend by 6%.
In summary, we had a good first quarter despite substantial cat losses. Our financial strength, conservative investment portfolio, strong credit ratings, underwriting talent, producer relationships, unparalleled claim service and commitment to managing capital for our shareholders' benefit are true differentiated, which we believe enable us to continue to provide superior returns to our investors. 
And with that, I'll open the line to questions."

So I need to talk generally. The one thing I would point out is that the article that's reported that Goldman has an extensive Side A D&O coverage and mentioned that one of our competitors at the primary needs to be understood in the context of what I know you know Side A is, and that is it only comes into play if either the company is unable, by state law, to indemnify its employee or by virtue of its insolvency, it cannot. The kind of claims that were brought by the SEC, for example, against Goldman are clearly indemnifiable results, and there's no indication that the company doesn't intend to indemnify the individual who is named in those complaints. I don't think the Goldman suit is going to have much impact on exposure of insurers. It's a unique kind of action. First of all, it's more likely to trigger E&O coverage than it is D&O coverage. And a lot of the investment banks had a hard time buying E&O coverage. We certainly got out of that business a few years ago. And then secondly, the SEC damages sought are either for fines and penalties or disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, two items that are excluded in our and most E&O policies. So even if they have E&O coverage, it may very well not be included as a covered event. And it's also a transactional suit. It's brought based on that single transaction that Goldman entered into. So it's less likely to trigger an E&O claim. The last one I would make is if there is a likelihood of D&O claim, it would be that Goldman failed to disclose early enough that it was impending. But the story suggest that Goldman was blindsided by the complaint and that they heard nothing from the SEC since it issued its wealth notice in the summer of 2009. So I think even a D&O suit is probably unlikely. If it is, it's not going to trigger Side A coverage."

We had a lot of freezes and things that weren't characterized as CATs, and we incurred some losses there. So it was a good quarter. That's not really a speculative number. That's really mostly related to the losses you incurred, so it's actual. Similarly in Commercial, we have some long tailed and some short tailed. But in terms of the accident year performance, property stood out. And commercial property, again, it relates to -- we just didn't have that many losses this quarter. It was 
better-than-expected. It's really go to the actual amount of losses as we had, and most of this is in short-tail lines. And it's lumpy again, so we're not saying it's going to be this way all-year. We don't know that, but we had a very benign quarter in terms of homeowners and commercial property losses."

First, our policy language happily, is different from that one.  That was before the state court there. We have a provision dealing with corrosion that was not present in the same form in the AIG policy. So it would not be an abetted decision to our own exposure; which in homeowners in Louisiana would be pretty modest anyway. And secondly, a state court decision in Louisiana, as we saw in Katrina, is not the end of the story. There is an excellent federal district court judge in charge of a multidistrict litigation in Louisiana, same guy that handled many of the Katrina claims who's made it pretty clear that he's going to take an active role in managing his litigations. And a decision there, particularly if it was on a language that was similar to ours, would worry me somewhat more. With respect to the claims that might come out of Chinese drywall other than homeowners, they fall under a variety of different commercial policies. They can come under the general liability policy or an environmental site liability or a contractor's pollution liability. All of them have particular coverage issues, which would not be impacted by that decision, but which will affect coverage. In the couple handfuls of claims that we have on the Commercial side, we're often not the primary writer, so that the language that will ultimately adjust the claims. Because as you know, the excess carriers follow forms in the language of the primary policy, will not necessarily be ours. We're looking at what we have, and deserving where it's appropriate. But at the moment, they're not regarding this as a materially significant investment."

As we noted in today's press release, the big story for the property and casualty insurance industry in the first quarter was the extraordinary level of natural catastrophes worldwide. Although these catastrophes have a negative impact of $0.67 per share on Chubb's first quarter results, we still produced operating income of $1.14 per share for the quarter, an excellent result, which reflected outstanding underwriting results for the combined ratio excluding catastrophes of 81.3%, nearly six percentage points better than a year ago. This was our best ex-cat combined ratio since 2007, and it was driven by strong contributions from each of our business units.
Our investment portfolio also continue to perform well with net realized investment gains of $127 million pretax or $0.25 per share after tax. That brought our first quarter net income per share to $1.39. In addition, our portfolio of unrealized appreciation before tax increased by about $170 million from year-end 2009. 
These investment and underwriting results produced a GAAP book value per share of $48.17 at March 31, 2010. That's a 2% increase since year-end 2009 and a 23% increase since March 31, 2009. 
Our capital position is excellent. During the quarter, we raised our common stock dividend for the 28th consecutive year and also have been actively buying back our stock.

This included a 4% positive impact of currency translation with a generally similar impact in each business unit. For Chubb Personal Insurance net written premiums were up 4% and CPI produced a combined ratio of 104.4% compared to 90% last year. However, CPI had 22.8 points of cats [catastrophes] in the first quarter this year compared to only 1.5 points in the first quarter of 2009. On an ex-CAT basis, CPI's first quarter combined ratio was 81.6 in 2010, nearly seven points better than a year ago when it was 88.5.
Homeowners premiums were up a point with a combined ratio of 113.3, including 35.1 points of cats. On an ex-cat basis, the combined ratio for homeowners in the first quarter was 78.2 in 2010, a substantial improvement over a year ago when it was 85.8. Personal Auto premiums increased 11% driven by growth outside the U.S., a combined ratio with 91.5.  In other Personal lines, premiums were up 7% and the combined ratio was 87.5. 
At Chubb Commercial Insurance, premiums for the quarter were down 1%. Premiums for multiple peril and for workers comp were down 6%, but casualty premiums increased 1% and property and marine was up 2%.
CPI combined ratio for the quarter was 93.8 compared to 90.2 a year earlier. Excluding the 11.4 point impact of cats, CCI's first quarter combined ratio this year was 82.4, nearly seven points better than last year's 89.2. 
CCI's renewal retention rate in the U.S. was 84% for the quarter with an average renewal rate increase of 1%, further evidence of our success in retaining business at profitable rates in a competitive marketplace.  The ratio of new to lost business in the U.S. was 1:1.
At Chubb Specialty Insurance, net written premiums were up 3% for the first quarter, and the combined ratio was 80.9%, more than four points better than the 85.1% we recorded in the first quarter of 2009. Professional Liability premiums grew 3% in the first quarter, and the combined ratio was 86.2% compared to 91.3% in the first quarter of 2009. In the U.S., first quarter retention renewal was 85% and average renewal rates were down 1%. The ratio of new to lost business was 1:1. For Surety, first quarter net written premiums were down 1%, but profitability was strong with a combined ratio of 39.8 for the quarter.
Before I comment on what we are seeing in the marketplace, let me give you some context around our first quarter cat numbers. First, the $344 million pretax impact of catastrophes that we reported today is higher than the $290 million we estimated in our press release on March 29 largely because of the impact of a late March storm on the East Coast of the U.S. that produced additional losses that were not included in the March 29 announcement.
Second, although our cat losses in the quarter add up to a large number, these losses are consistent with our overall presence in the affected markets. For example, this year's Mid-Atlantic and Northeast storms hit many of Chubb's high-concentration territories. In contrast, our cat losses in last year's first quarter were substantially lower than many other companies because the majority of U.S. cat activity then was in the Midwest and the South where Chubb has a relatively modest market share.
Each time we're confronted at Chubb with a widespread cat, I'm reminded of one consistent dynamic. For us, a catastrophe is a business event, one which will affect our financial results and will challenge our value-added business proposition of providing world-class service. For our insurers, particularly homeowners, it is a personal event, involving disruption of their lives as well as property damage. As such, it presents a unique opportunity for us to demonstrate value and the timeliness, empathy and fairness with which we respond.
Our most loyal customers tend to be the ones who have had a claim. I am pleased to say that our survey results from customers impacted by the largest of the March storms in the U.S. indicate a satisfied or very satisfied rating of more than 97%. That means to me our folks are responding yet again in the way which has distinguished this company for 128 years.
As John said earlier, we are very pleased with our outstanding underwriting results. They were not easy to come by. The marketplace remain quite competitive. Average commercial renewal rates in the U.S. were up 1% in CCI, but down 1% in CSI. So overall, basically flat. It appears that for now, rates have plateaued from the slightly higher increases we were seeing last year. We are still not seeing the broad-based weakening of terms and conditions which characterized the soft markets of the late 90s with two exceptions among our competitors.
In Commercial lines, we see some insurers dramatically increasing flood and quake sublimits in certain lines without any commensurate premium increase. And in Specialty lines, some competitors are substantially lower in deductibles on non-financial institution public D&O without any corresponding premium increase. Neither of these paths is sustainable long term.
Turning now to New Commercial business. We were successful in writing well-priced new accounts in our targeted niches. Furthermore, our renewal exposures and audit premiums were less negative in the first quarter of this year than in the fourth quarter of 2009, suggesting that the negative impacts of reduced payrolls and other recession-related phenomena are beginning to trail off. Other encouraging signs include stable to slightly higher renewal retention, submission counts and written to submitted ratios. 
We have commented previously about the aggressive pricing we've observed from some of our competitors in their quest for new business. When those accounts that we lost, as a result of this behavior came up for renewal in the first quarter this year, we won some of that business back in the face of dramatic rate increase demands often at the last minute in the renewal process by those very same competitors.
Over the long haul, what we have always supposed to be the case is bearing out. Our customers, both producers and insurers, place a high value on consistency and predictability, two qualities we have always reflected. And in the end, they prevail. 
While we are encouraged by the modest improvement in premium growth this quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year, we are not yet prepared to say that it reflects a trend. In fact, given the ongoing economic uncertainty and the historically erratic property and casualty market, we believe any sustained improvement will likely emerge in a choppy fashion. 
In January, I gave you a pretty detailed update on our credit crisis claim experience. I'm happy to say that the positive trends we saw then in the frequency of securities class action suits and in some of the judicial trends of dismissals have continued. And we remain confident that we are appropriately reserved during credit crisis claims in the accident years in which the claims have been made. I am particularly pleased about developments in two areas I want to mention specifically: the frequency of non-credit crisis security class-action claims and the recent rulings in credit crisis derivative actions.
For the second straight quarter, even as the number of new credit crisis securities class actions virtually disappeared, we did not see a corresponding increase in the number of non-credit crisis class actions. So for those observers who have speculated that there was a substantial number of backlog claims waiting to be filed, the evidence so far doesn't support that. And the two-year statute of limitations is already a bar to actions in which the triggering event, typically a corrective disclosure, took place in 2007 and early 2008, the years in which I presume backlog would have been building. 
In addition, we are encouraged by the continuing relatively high-dismissal rate in the first quarter of derivative actions which might otherwise trigger our Side A coverages. Unlike the stock option backdating claims which were heavily weighted toward derivative actions, credit crisis claims have been predominantly securities class actions.
However, in connection with the credit crisis derivative claims which have been brought, we are seeing the application of well-established legal protection governing mismanagement allegation and the defendants are having great, in some cases even unexpected success in defending those claims. For example, in the recent decision involving AIG's credit crisis woes, the court has made it clear that they will not engage in second-guessing management's legitimate business decisions regardless of how badly those decisions played out.
So although some observers have asserted that credit crisis derivative claims have the potential to impact Side A coverages, we are not currently seeing an increased level of exposure as a result of them. And now, I'll turn it over to Ricky Spiro."

As usual, I will review our financial results for the quarter.

As usual, I will review our financial results for the quarter. I will also provide commentary on capital management, the impact of currency and the April 1 renewal of our property reinsurance program. 
Looking first at our first quarter operating results, we had underwriting income of $204 million even in a difficult cat quarter. Property and casualty investment income after tax was up 2% during the quarter to $313 million. The continued impact of the low-yield environment was offset this quarter by a modest favorable effect of currency fluctuation on the income from our international investment.
Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $127 million or $0.25 per share after tax, including net gain of $88 million on our alternative investments portfolio. For comparison, in the first quarter of 2009, we had net realized investment losses before tax of $266 million or $0.48 per share after tax largely due to losses on our alternative investments portfolio related to the credit crisis.  As a reminder, we account for alternative investments on a one-quarter lag and we include the changes in the net equity of our alternative investments in net realized gains and losses. Unlike some insurers, we will include them in investment income.
During the first quarter of 2010, we incurred a one-time tax charge of $22 million or $0.07 per share related to the recently enacted Federal health care legislation which eliminated the tax benefit associated with Medicare Part D subsidies to be received by companies that provide qualifying prescription drug coverage to retirees. 
Unrealized appreciation before tax at March 31, 2010 increased to $1.8 billion from $1.6 billion at the end of 2009. The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $42.3 billion as of March 31, 2010, slightly higher than the amount at year end 2009.
The composition of our portfolio also remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 4.1 years and the average credit rating is Aa2. We also continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At March 31, 2010, our holding company portfolio included $2.4 billion of investments, including $868 million of short-term investments.
Book value per share under GAAP at March 31, 2010 was $48.17 compared to $47.09 at year end 2009, an increase of 2%. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, was $45.19 compared to $44.37 at 2009 year end.
As for reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the first quarter of 2010 on prior-year reserves by SBU [strategic business units] as follows: In CPI, we had about $30 million; CCI had about $90 million; CSI had about $90 million; and Reinsurance Assumed had about $10 million, bringing our total favorable development to about $220 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the first quarter combined ratio of nearly eight points overall.
For comparison, in the first quarter of 2009, we had about $130 million of favorable development for the company overall, including none in CPI, $35 million in CCI, $80 million in CSI and $15 million at reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact from the combined ratio in the first quarter of 2009 was about five points. 
During the first quarter of 2010, our loss reserves increased by $242 million including an increase of $288 million for the Insurance business, nearly all of which was accounted for by the increase in reserves for cat. This was partially offset by a decrease of $46 million for the Reinsurance Assumed business which is in run-off and the impact of currency fluctuation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in a decline in reserves of about $55 million. 
At this point, let me say a few additional words about the impact of currency fluctuation on our financial results. Since about one quarter of our premiums come from outside the U.S., our results expressed in dollars are affected by movement in exchange rates. For example, we had a positive currency impact in the first quarter of 2010 of about 4% on net written premium. This reflects the fact that the U.S. dollar was significantly weaker against most major currencies in this year's first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009.  Going forward, assuming currency rates during the rest of 2010 remain similar to recent exchange rates, we would expect that the favorable impact of currency fluctuation will decline in the coming quarters given the weakening of the U.S. dollar that occurred throughout the remainder of 2009.
Turning to capital management. We were very active with our share buyback program during the first quarter. We repurchased 7 million shares at an aggregate cost of $344 million, and the average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was $49.47 per share. Through the end of the first-quarter, we have repurchased about 10 million shares for approximately 40% of the 25 million share buyback program that we announced in December 2009. This high level of activity reflects the fact that we are opportunistically taking advantage of the attractive economics that we purchased in our stock at current levels. As we have previously stated, our intention is to complete this new repurchase program by the end of the year. In addition, as we said on our fourth quarter conference call, we will continue to review the size of our buyback program in light of our capital position, the prevailing insurance market environment, portfolio investment opportunity cost and other factors. 
In February, our board raised the quarterly common stock dividend by 6% to $0.37 per share or $1.48 on an annual basis. As John said earlier, this was our 28th consecutive annual dividend increase, a continued indication of our financial strength and resilience in a cyclical industry.
As you may know, on April 1, we renewed our major property treaties including our North American cat treaty, our non-U.S. cat treaty and our commercial property per risk treaty. All of these were renewed with the same limits in coverage that we had in the 2009 program. The reinsurance market was orderly, and there was plenty of capacity to meet our needs in each treaty. We were able to achieve an overall cost reduction of approximately 8% across the three treaties. 
Finally, I would like to make a comment regarding our 2010 earnings guidance. As John Finnegan and John Degnan discussed earlier, the adverse effect of the high level of cat activity in the first quarter was partially offset by the strong ex-CAT performance of our core Property and Casualty businesses. As we've done in the past, we intend to defer revisiting our guidance until after the second quarter when we have more information about how the year is progressing. We believe that you have enough information available regarding the impact of cat to make any adjustments that you deem appropriate at this time. 
And now I'll turn it back to John Finnegan."

And we continue to actively manage our capital by buying back shares at attractive prices and by increasing our dividend by 6%.
In summary, we had a good first quarter despite substantial cat losses. Our financial strength, conservative investment portfolio, strong credit ratings, underwriting talent, producer relationships, unparalleled claim service and commitment to managing capital for our shareholders' benefit are true differentiated, which we believe enable us to continue to provide superior returns to our investors. 
And with that, I'll open the line to questions."

So I need to talk generally. The one thing I would point out is that the article that's reported that Goldman has an extensive Side A D&O coverage and mentioned that one of our competitors at the primary needs to be understood in the context of what I know you know Side A is, and that is it only comes into play if either the company is unable, by state law, to indemnify its employee or by virtue of its insolvency, it cannot. The kind of claims that were brought by the SEC, for example, against Goldman are clearly indemnifiable results, and there's no indication that the company doesn't intend to indemnify the individual who is named in those complaints. I don't think the Goldman suit is going to have much impact on exposure of insurers. It's a unique kind of action. First of all, it's more likely to trigger E&O coverage than it is D&O coverage. And a lot of the investment banks had a hard time buying E&O coverage. We certainly got out of that business a few years ago. And then secondly, the SEC damages sought are either for fines and penalties or disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, two items that are excluded in our and most E&O policies. So even if they have E&O coverage, it may very well not be included as a covered event. And it's also a transactional suit. It's brought based on that single transaction that Goldman entered into. So it's less likely to trigger an E&O claim. The last one I would make is if there is a likelihood of D&O claim, it would be that Goldman failed to disclose early enough that it was impending. But the story suggest that Goldman was blindsided by the complaint and that they heard nothing from the SEC since it issued its wealth notice in the summer of 2009. So I think even a D&O suit is probably unlikely. If it is, it's not going to trigger Side A coverage."

First, our policy language happily, is different from that one.  That was before the state court there. We have a provision dealing with corrosion that was not present in the same form in the AIG policy. So it would not be an abetted decision to our own exposure; which in homeowners in Louisiana would be pretty modest anyway. And secondly, a state court decision in Louisiana, as we saw in Katrina, is not the end of the story. There is an excellent federal district court judge in charge of a multidistrict litigation in Louisiana, same guy that handled many of the Katrina claims who's made it pretty clear that he's going to take an active role in managing his litigations. And a decision there, particularly if it was on a language that was similar to ours, would worry me somewhat more. With respect to the claims that might come out of Chinese drywall other than homeowners, they fall under a variety of different commercial policies. They can come under the general liability policy or an environmental site liability or a contractor's pollution liability. All of them have particular coverage issues, which would not be impacted by that decision, but which will affect coverage. In the couple handfuls of claims that we have on the Commercial side, we're often not the primary writer, so that the language that will ultimately adjust the claims. Because as you know, the excess carriers follow forms in the language of the primary policy, will not necessarily be ours. We're looking at what we have, and deserving where it's appropriate.

As we noted in today's press release, the big story for the property and casualty insurance industry in the first quarter was the extraordinary level of natural catastrophes worldwide. Although these catastrophes have a negative impact of $0.67 per share on Chubb's first quarter results, we still produced operating income of $1.14 per share for the quarter, an excellent result, which reflected outstanding underwriting results for the combined ratio excluding catastrophes of 81.3%, nearly six percentage points better than a year ago. This was our best x cat combined ratio since 2007, and it was driven by strong contributions from each of our business units.
Our investment portfolio also continue to perform well with net realized investment gains of $127 million pretax or $0.25 per share after tax. That brought our first quarter net income per share to $1.39. In addition, our portfolio of unrealized appreciation before tax increased by about $170 million from year-end 2009. 
These investment and underwriting results produced a GAAP book value per share of $48.17 at March 31, 2010. That's a 2% increase since year-end 2009 and a 23% increase since March 31, 2009.

This included a 4% positive impact of currency translation with a generally similar impact in each business unit. For Chubb Personal Insurance, net written premiums were up 4% and CPI produced a combined ratio of 104.4% compared to 90% last year. However, CPI had 22.8 points of cats [catastrophes] in the first quarter this year compared to only 1.5 points in the first quarter of 2009. On an x cat basis, CPI's first quarter combined ratio was 81.6% in 2010, nearly seven points better than a year ago when it was 88.5%.
Homeowners premiums were up a point with a combined ratio of 113.3%, including 35.1 points of cats. On an x cat basis, the combined ratio for Homeowners in the first quarter was 78.2% in 2010, a substantial improvement over a year ago when it was 85.8%. Personal Auto premiums increased 11% driven by growth outside the U.S., a combined ratio with 91.5%. In other Personal lines, premiums were up 7% and the combined ratio was 87.5%.
At Chubb Commercial Insurance, premiums for the quarter were down 1%. Premiums for multiple peril and for workers comp were down 6%, but casualty premiums increased 1% and property and marine was up 2%. CCI's combined ratio for the quarter was 93.8% compared to 90.2% a year earlier. Excluding the 11.4 point impact of cats, CCI's first quarter combined ratio this year was 82.4%, nearly seven points better than last year's 89.2%.
CCI's renewal retention rate in the U.S. was 84% for the quarter with an average renewal rate increase of 1%, further evidence of our success in retaining business at profitable rates in a competitive marketplace. The ratio of new to lost business in the U.S. was 1:1.
At Chubb Specialty Insurance, net written premiums were up 3% for the first quarter and the combined ratio was 80.9%, more than four points better than the 85.1% we recorded in the first quarter of 2009. Professional Liability premiums grew 3% in the first quarter and the combined ratio was 86.2% compared to 91.3% in the first quarter of 2009. 
In the U.S., first quarter retention renewal was 85% and average renewal rates were down 1%. The ratio of new to lost business was 1:1. For Surety, first quarter net written premiums were down 1%, but profitability was strong with the combined ratio of 39.8% for the quarter.
Before I comment on what we are seeing in the marketplace, let me give you some context around our first quarter cat numbers. First, the $344 million pretax impact of catastrophes that we reported today is higher than the $290 million we estimated in our press release on March 29, largely because of the impact of a late March storm on the East Coast of the U.S. that produced additional losses that were not included in the March 29 announcement.
Second, although our cat losses in the quarter add up to a large number, these losses are consistent with our overall presence in the affected markets. For example, this year's Mid-Atlantic and Northeast storms hit many of Chubb's high-concentration territories. In contrast, our cat losses in last year's first quarter were substantially lower than many other companies because the majority of U.S. cat activity then was in the Midwest and the South where Chubb has a relatively modest market share.
Each time we're confronted at Chubb with a widespread cat, I'm reminded of one consistent dynamic. For us, a catastrophe is a business event, one which will affect our financial results and will challenge our value-added business proposition of providing world-class service. For our insurers, particularly homeowners, it is a personal event, involving disruption of their lives as well as property damage. As such, it presents a unique opportunity for us to demonstrate value and the timeliness, empathy and fairness with which we respond.
Our most loyal customers tend to be the ones who have had a claim. I am pleased to say that our survey results from customers impacted by the largest of the March storms in the U.S. indicate a satisfied or very satisfied rating of more than 97%. That means to me our folks are responding yet again in the way which has distinguished this company for 128 years.
As John said earlier, we are very pleased with our outstanding underwriting results. They were not easy to come by. The marketplace remain quite competitive. Average commercial renewal rates in the U.S. were up 1% in CCI, but down 1% in CSI. So overall, basically flat. It appears that for now, rates have plateaued from the slightly higher increases we were seeing last year. We are still not seeing the broad-based weakening of terms and conditions which characterized the soft markets of the late 90s with two exceptions among our competitors.
In Commercial lines, we see some insurers dramatically increasing flood and quake sublimits in certain lines without any commensurate premium increase. And in Specialty lines, some competitors are substantially lower in deductibles on non-financial institution public D&O without any corresponding premium increase. Neither of these paths is sustainable long term.
Turning now to New Commercial business. We were successful in writing well-priced new accounts in our targeted niches. Furthermore, our renewal exposures and audit premiums were less negative in the first quarter of this year than in the fourth quarter of 2009, suggesting that the negative impacts of reduced payrolls and other recession-related phenomena are beginning to trail off. Other encouraging signs include stable to slightly higher renewal retention, submission counts and written to submitted ratios. 
We have commented previously about the aggressive pricing we've observed from some of our competitors in their quest for new business. When those accounts that we lost, as a result of this behavior came up for renewal in the first quarter this year, we won some of that business back in the face of dramatic rate increase demands often at the last minute in the renewal process by those very same competitors.
Over the long haul, what we have always supposed to be the case is bearing out. Our customers, both producers and insurers, place a high value on consistency and predictability, two qualities we have always reflected. And in the end, they prevail. 
While we are encouraged by the modest improvement in premium growth this quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year, we are not yet prepared to say that it reflects a trend. In fact, given the ongoing economic uncertainty and the historically erratic property and casualty market, we believe any sustained improvement will likely emerge in a choppy fashion. 
In January, I gave you a pretty detailed update on our credit crisis claim experience. I'm happy to say that the positive trends we saw then in the frequency of securities class action suits and in some of the judicial trends of dismissals have continued. And we remain confident that we are appropriately reserved during credit crisis claims in the accident years in which the claims have been made. I am particularly pleased about developments in two areas I want to mention specifically: the frequency of non-credit crisis security class-action claims and the recent rulings in credit crisis derivative actions.
For the second straight quarter, even as the number of new credit crisis securities class actions virtually disappeared, we did not see a corresponding increase in the number of non-credit crisis class actions. So for those observers who have speculated that there was a substantial number of backlog claims waiting to be filed, the evidence so far doesn't support that. And the two-year statute of limitations is already a bar to actions in which the triggering event, typically a corrective disclosure, took place in 2007 and early 2008, the years in which I presume backlog would have been building. 
In addition, we are encouraged by the continuing relatively high-dismissal rate in the first quarter of derivative actions which might otherwise trigger our Side A coverages. Unlike the stock option backdating claims which were heavily weighted toward derivative actions, credit crisis claims have been predominantly securities class actions.
However, in connection with the credit crisis derivative claims which have been brought, we are seeing the application of well-established legal protection governing mismanagement allegation and the defendants are having great, in some cases even unexpected success in defending those claims. For example, in the recent decision involving AIG's credit crisis woes, the court has made it clear that they will not engage in second-guessing management's legitimate business decisions regardless of how badly those decisions played out.
So although some observers have asserted that credit crisis derivative claims have the potential to impact Side A coverages, we are not currently seeing an increased level of exposure as a result of them. And now, I'll turn it over to Ricky Spiro."

The continued impact of the low-yield environment was offset this quarter by a modest favorable effect of currency fluctuation on the income from our international investment.
Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $127 million or $0.25 per share after tax, including net gain of $88 million on our alternative investments portfolio. For comparison, in the first quarter of 2009, we had net realized investment losses before tax of $266 million or $0.48 per share after tax largely due to losses on our alternative investments portfolio related to the credit crisis.  As a reminder, we account for alternative investments on a one-quarter lag and we include the changes in the net equity of our alternative investments in net realized gains and losses. Unlike some insurers, we will include them in investment income.
During the first quarter of 2010, we incurred a one-time tax charge of $22 million or $0.07 per share related to the recently enacted Federal health care legislation which eliminated the tax benefit associated with Medicare Part D subsidies to be received by companies that provide qualifying prescription drug coverage to retirees. 
Unrealized appreciation before tax at March 31, 2010 increased to $1.8 billion from $1.6 billion at the end of 2009. The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $42.3 billion as of March 31, 2010, slightly higher than the amount at year end 2009.
The composition of our portfolio also remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 4.1 years and the average credit rating is Aa2. We also continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At March 31, 2010, our holding company portfolio included $2.4 billion of investments, including $868 million of short-term investments.
Book value per share under GAAP at March 31, 2010 was $48.17 compared to $47.09 at year end 2009, an increase of 2%. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, was $45.19 compared to $44.37 at 2009 year end.
As for reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the first quarter of 2010 on prior-year reserves by SBU [strategic business units] as follows: In CPI, we had about $30 million; CCI had about $90 million; CSI had about $90 million; and Reinsurance Assumed had about $10 million, bringing our total favorable development to about $220 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the first quarter combined ratio of nearly eight points overall.
For comparison, in the first quarter of 2009, we had about $130 million of favorable development for the company overall, including none in CPI, $35 million in CCI, $80 million in CSI and $15 million at reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact from the combined ratio in the first quarter of 2009 was about five points. 
During the first quarter of 2010, our loss reserves increased by $242 million including an increase of $288 million for the Insurance business, nearly all of which was accounted for by the increase in reserves for cat. This was partially offset by a decrease of $46 million for the Reinsurance Assumed business which is in run-off and the impact of currency fluctuation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in a decline in reserves of about $55 million. 
At this point, let me say a few additional words about the impact of currency fluctuation on our financial results. Since about one quarter of our premiums come from outside the U.S., our results expressed in dollars are affected by movement in exchange rates. For example, we had a positive currency impact in the first quarter of 2010 of about 4% on net written premium. This reflects the fact that the U.S. dollar was significantly weaker against most major currencies in this year's first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009.  Going forward, assuming currency rates during the rest of 2010 remain similar to recent exchange rates, we would expect that the favorable impact of currency fluctuation will decline in the coming quarters given the weakening of the U.S. dollar that occurred throughout the remainder of 2009.
Turning to capital management. We were very active with our share buyback program during the first quarter. We repurchased 7 million shares at an aggregate cost of $344 million, and the average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was $49.47 per share. Through the end of the first-quarter, we have repurchased about 10 million shares for approximately 40% of the 25 million share buyback program that we announced in December 2009. This high level of activity reflects the fact that we are opportunistically taking advantage of the attractive economics that we purchased in our stock at current levels. As we have previously stated, our intention is to complete this new repurchase program by the end of the year. In addition, as we said on our fourth quarter conference call, we will continue to review the size of our buyback program in light of our capital position, the prevailing insurance market environment, portfolio investment opportunity cost and other factors. 
In February, our board raised the quarterly common stock dividend by 6% to $0.37 per share or $1.48 on an annual basis. As John said earlier, this was our 28th consecutive annual dividend increase, a continued indication of our financial strength and resilience in a cyclical industry.
As you may know, on April 1, we renewed our major property treaties including our North American cat treaty, our non-U.S. cat treaty and our commercial property per risk treaty. All of these were renewed with the same limits in coverage that we had in the 2009 program. The reinsurance market was orderly, and there was plenty of capacity to meet our needs in each treaty. We were able to achieve an overall cost reduction of approximately 8% across the three treaties. 
Finally, I would like to make a comment regarding our 2010 earnings guidance. As John Finnegan and John Degnan discussed earlier, the adverse effect of the high level of cat activity in the first quarter was partially offset by the strong x cat performance of our core Property and Casualty businesses. As we've done in the past, we intend to defer revisiting our guidance until after the second quarter when we have more information about how the year is progressing. We believe that you have enough information available regarding the impact of cat to make any adjustments that you deem appropriate at this time. 
And now I'll turn it back to John Finnegan."

In a very difficult catastrophe environment, Chubb performed extremely well in the first quarter. Here are the highlights. Operating income per share of $1.14 despite a $0.67 per share adverse impact of cat and a one-time $0.07 per share Medicare-related tax charge. Our x cat combined ratio of 81.3% was nearly six points better than last year's excellent 87.2%. On an x cat basis, CPI and CCI's combined ratios were nearly seven points better than last year.
In addition, CSI's combined ratio was more than four points better, clearly outstanding underwriting results. Premium growth improved in what continues to be a difficult economic competitive environment. Retention rates remained consistent, and new to lost ratio has improved. Our conservative investment portfolio continued to perform well, generating a substantial first quarter net realized capital gain, as well as an increase in unrealized appreciation. Book value per share increased by more than $1 since 2009 year end to $48.17. And we continue to actively manage our capital by buying back shares at attractive prices and by increasing our dividend by 6%.
In summary, we had a good first quarter despite substantial cat losses. Our financial strength, conservative investment portfolio, strong credit ratings, underwriting talent, producer relationships, unparalleled claim service and commitment to managing capital for our shareholders' benefit are true differentiators, which we believe enable us to continue to provide superior returns to our investors. 
And with that, I'll open the line to questions."

So I need to talk generally. The one thing I would point out is that the article that's reported that Goldman has an extensive Side A D&O coverage and mentioned that one of our competitors at the primary needs to be understood in the context of what I know you know Side A is, and that is it only comes into play if either the company is unable, by state law, to indemnify its employee or by virtue of its insolvency, it cannot. The kind of claims that were brought by the SEC, for example, against Goldman are clearly indemnifiable results, and there's no indication that the company doesn't intend to indemnify the individual who is named in those complaints. I don't think the Goldman suit is going to have much impact on exposure of insurers. It's a unique kind of action. First of all, it's more likely to trigger E&O coverage than it is D&O coverage. And a lot of the investment banks had a hard time buying E&O coverage. We certainly got out of that business a few years ago. And then secondly, the SEC damages sought are either for fines and penalties or disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, two items that are excluded in our and most E&O policies. So even if they have E&O coverage, it may very well not be included as a covered event. And it's also a transactional suit. It's brought based on that single transaction that Goldman entered into. So it's less likely to trigger an E&O claim. The last one I would make is if there is a likelihood of a D&O claim, it would be that Goldman failed to disclose early enough that it was impending. But the story suggest that Goldman was blindsided by the complaint and that they heard nothing from the SEC since it issued its wealth notice in the summer of 2009. So I think even a D&O suit is probably unlikely. If it is, it's not going to trigger Side A coverage."

First, our policy language happily, is different from that one.  That was before the state court there. We have a provision dealing with corrosion that was not present in the same form in the AIG policy. So it would not be an abetted decision to our own exposure; which in homeowners in Louisiana would be pretty modest anyway. And secondly, a state court decision in Louisiana, as we saw in Katrina, is not the end of the story. There is an excellent federal district court judge in charge of a multidistrict litigation in Louisiana, same guy that handled many of the Katrina claims who's made it pretty clear that he's going to take an active role in managing his litigations. And a decision there, particularly if it was on a language that was similar to ours, would worry me somewhat more. With respect to the claims that might come out of Chinese drywall other than homeowners, they fall under a variety of different commercial policies. They can come under the general liability policy or an environmental site liability or a contractor's pollution liability. All of them have particular coverage issues, which would not be impacted by that decision, but which will affect coverage. In the couple handfuls of claims that we have on the Commercial side, we're often not the primary writer, so that the language that will ultimately adjust the claims. Because as you know, the excess carriers follow forms in the language of the primary policy, will not necessarily be ours. We're looking at what we have, and deserving where it's appropriate.

It is possible that actual results might differ from estimates and forecasts that Chubb's management team might make today. Additional information regarding factors that could cause such differences appear in Chubb's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

We are very pleased to report excellent results for the second quarter and the first half, notwithstanding substantially higher-than-expected catastrophe losses in both quarters. 
Operating income per share for the second quarter was $1.41, despite $0.38 of cats [catastrophes]. That compares to $1.49 in last year's second quarter when the impact of cats was only $0.08. The second quarter combined ratio in 2010 was a very strong 90.4%, even including 6.9 points of cats, our highest second quarter cat impact ever. The x cat combined ratio for the quarter was 83.5%, nearly a point better than last year's second quarter. For the first six months, operating income per share was $2.54 and the combined ratio of 92%, which is exceptionally good considering it included 9.6 points of cats. The six-month x cat combined ratio of 82.4% was nearly 3.5 points better than the first half of last year.
In addition, our investment portfolio continued to perform extremely well. During the second quarter, it produced a net realized capital gain before tax of $90 million. At June 30, our net unrealized appreciation before tax stood at $1.9 billion, which is an increase of $88 million over March 31. The effect of these investment on operating results was a reported book value per share of $49.39 at June 30, 2010, a 19% increase compared to a year ago. 
Our excellent capital position enabled us to substantially increase our share repurchase program in order to take advantage of the attractive opportunity in the market to acquire our own shares. Ricky will talk more about the buyback program in his remarks. 
As you will recall, last January, we provided 2010 operating income guidance of $5.15 to $5.55 per share, based in part at an assumption of three points of cats for the year. Substantially higher-than-expected cats in the first half have led us to change that assumption to seven points of cats for the full year. Nonetheless, we are affirming our January earnings guidance based on our excellent x cat results year-to-date and our outlook for the second half of the year. I will elaborate on our updated guidance in my closing remarks. 
Let me turn it over now to John Degnan, who will talk about our operating results."

I'm going to begin with a review of the individual business units for the second quarter. Chubb Personal Insurance net written premiums increased 5%, led by strong growth outside the U.S. About half that growth was attributable to currency fluctuation, and CPI produced the combined ratio of 92.9% compared to 84.2% last year. Cat losses for CPI were 13.8 points in the second quarter of 2010 compared to only 3.2 points a year earlier. So excluding the cat impact, CPI's combined ratio improved nearly two points to 79.1% from 81%. 
Homeowners premiums were up 2%, and the combined ratio was 94.5%, including 20.3 points of cats. Our Personal Auto premiums were up 14% with a combined ratio of 90.2%. In Other Personal lines, which includes the Accident business, premiums increased 9%, and the combined ratio was 90.5%. Premiums for both Personal Auto and Accident reflect strong growth outside the U.S. and the positive effect of currency.
At Chubb Commercial Insurance, premiums were flat. It was the first time since the first quarter of 2008 that CCI's reported premiums did not decline. The combined ratio was 92.9% compared to last year's 89.2%, but CCI's second quarter included a 5.6 point impact of cats compared with only 1.2 points in 2009. So excluding the cat impact, CCI's combined ratio for the quarter improved to 87.3% from 88% last year. CCI retained 86% of the U.S. premiums that came up for renewal, and the ratio of new-to-lost business was 1.3:1. Both the retention and that new-to-lost ratio improved compared to the year ago second quarter, as well as compared to this year's first quarter. Average U.S. renewal rates were flat. 
At Chubb Specialty, net written premiums were flat, and the combined ratio improved to 82.5% from 83.9% in the second quarter of 2009. Premiums for Professional Liability were also flat, and the combined ratio was 87.2% compared to 90.1% in last year's second quarter. 
Average U.S. renewal rates for Professional Liability were down 3%. Renewal retention in the U.S. improved to 86% and the ratio of new-to-lost business was 1:1. For Surety, net written premiums were down 2%. Profitability was strong with a combined ratio of 47.7% for the quarter. 
So now, I'll move on to a few comments on the overall market environment. Based on our experience, the marketplace seems analogous to A Tale of Two Cities. On the one hand, there are indications that the impact of the economy on the market, as seen in exposures, endorsements and audit adjustments, may be improving from its low point. On the other hand, the marketplace also seems more competitive. We believe that our consistently solid execution is enabling Chubb to perform effectively in this challenging market, as evidenced by our overall financial results. 
In Commercial lines, our experience suggests a reason for optimism about the impact of the economy on the marketplace. For example, our Commercial renewal exposure bases, while still down slightly, are improving significantly. Common examples of those renewal exposure bases include payrolls for workers comp policies, sales for general liability contracts and shipments from Marine policies. In the second quarter, CCI had only a slight renewal exposure decline of one point in the U.S. This is the smallest quarterly decrease we've experienced since the fourth quarter of 2008 and is an improvement over the 3% decline in the second quarter of 2009. Even more encouraging, CCI actually had a slightly positive renewal exposure change in the month of June, the first time since October 2008. 
Likewise, midterm policy endorsement activity, which is another measure of exposure change, picked up nicely in the quarter. Yielding nearly twice as much additional premium as in the second quarter of 2009. While endorsement activity hasn't yet reached historical levels, it's encouraging to see some customers, at least, adding new exposure units to activities such as acquiring machinery and equipment. As I mentioned, the new-to-lost business ratio in the U.S. was 1.3:1 in the second quarter for CCI. That was another bright spot and an improvement over past quarters. The uptick was aided by very strong renewal retention of 86% and by writing more targeted prospects in proven niches. 
We were particularly pleased last quarter to win back some customers who left us over the past few years for cheaper pricing. Not surprisingly, some of those win-backs had experienced poor service after leaving us. Others returned as they discovered their premiums were eventually increased back to levels comparable to what we had been charging. 
At CPI, we're also seeing positive trends and exposures. So endorsement activity was positive for the first time since the third quarter of 2008. While here, too, the level of endorsement activity isn't yet near its historical level, we are encouraged to see it adding to growth. The rate environment in CPI continue to be relatively stable.
Obviously, we have not yet seen whether most of our competitors are experiencing similar exposure on premium trends. To the extent they are, it would be encouraging about the overall marketplace. To the extent they're not, it would be encouraging about our relative performance. 
While there are indications that the negative impact of economic conditions on premium growth may be abating, we are being adversely affected by the negative movement of rates due to the highly competitive environment. For example, U.S. renewal rates for CCI were flat, versus up 1% in the previous quarter and up 2% in the second quarter of 2009. Increased competitive pressure is constraining our ability to maintain the rate increases that we were seeing in 2009.
Terms and conditions also came under pressure in certain lines of business such as large property accounts. For example, we saw several competitors offer double and even triple the limits for flood and earthquake risks without any increase in premium. Surprisingly, we saw this erosion in terms and conditions even for some customers with large exposures and known flood and quake zones. As our results confirm, we are navigating these issues successfully by adhering to our traditional underwriting diligence and discipline.
Turning to CSI. The good news is that second quarter renewal, retention in Professional Liability increased in the U.S. by three points to 86%, helping to drive our new-to-lost business ratio to 1:1 from 0.9:1 in last year's second quarter. The CCI team is doing an excellent job of retaining its best customers and carefully pricing exposures. 
CSI's renewal exposure base and endorsement activity were steady with previous quarters. Unfortunately, as we have seen with respect to rates in CCI, Professional Liability renewal rates in the U.S., which had shown signs of improving last year, were down 3% versus down 1% in the previous quarter and up 4% in the second quarter of 2009. That rate decline was led by public D&O, which was our most challenging line in the second quarter. We suspect that the highly competitive public D&O market is being fueled by relatively new entrants and by their overreliance on some recent positive claim indications. We also believe that market participants now view the credit crisis as being over and expect significantly improved loss experience, especially in non-financial public D&O.
The fact is, as I will explain in a minute, the first half of 2010 has been a very favorable period, particularly in terms of the level of new securities class action. However, we do not believe that these developments fully support the very aggressive price quotes we continue to see in the public D&O market. The bottom line is that we suspect some competitors are pricing these long-tail lines too aggressively. While recent loss experience maybe good, Professional Liability losses are not linear, and systemic events can arise quickly and unexpectedly. Some of the pricing we see in the market today suggest the illusion that the more favorable loss environment will last forever and seems to make no provision for the risks inherent in this business. 
In the face of these pressures, Chubb is using our decades of experience in data to carefully choose which customers we write and where best to position ourselves on their programs. Fortunately, our CSI book is very diversified and the private and not-for-profit D&O segments, E&O, EPL, fiduciary crime and financial fidelity lines did not experience the same level of price pressure as public D&O. 
So developments in the marketplace during the second quarter have been decidedly a mixed bag. While we are seeing some movements in exposure trends, premium growth and retention, which may indicate the downward pressure of economic conditions could be abating, we still see a very competitive marketplace in which the mildly positive rate trends we saw for several quarters have deteriorated, and the soft market continues. 
Now let me offer just a few thoughts in credit crisis claims. The evidence continues to mount that insofar as credit crisis losses are concerned, we are appropriately reserved in the accident years in which the claims have been made. Across all impacted lines, new credit crisis claim activity has dwindled since the beginning of the year, and those few claims we have received typically involve insureds who have reported earlier claims, and as a result, do not even implicate fresh limits. 
Given what we've seen over the past few quarters, we're nearing the point where we believe that the credit crisis as a source of new claims exposure is coming to an end. In addition, dismissal rates of credit crisis D&O cases continue to run in excess of 50%, and they're beginning to be upheld by the circuit courts of appeal. Those decisions reflect the heightened pleading standards I referred to in previous calls under cases like Tellabs and Dura. And the fact that the losses behind much of the credit crisis activity were driven by extraordinary market events rather than distinct corporate conduct appears to have made it more difficult for plaintiffs' attorneys to meet the threshold for pleading securities fraud in those cases. Many cases remain to be decided, of course, and a number of dismissals are still on appeal. But overall, these developments give us added comfort in the approach we've taken to these claims from the outset of the crisis. 
Similarly, on the E&O side, the factors that I've discussed previously as mitigating our credit crisis exposures still apply. In particular, the rating agencies, which have been a major target of the more recent E&O claims activity, continue to have considerable success in obtaining dismissals of the claims asserted against them, particularly in those cases in which plaintiffs have attempted to hold them liable as underwriters of the securities that they were involved in rating or structuring. 
And finally in the fiduciary lines. Once again, we saw no new credit crisis claims this past quarter. We are managing those claims we have, and we continue to believe that such fiduciary claims present less exposure than either D&O or E&O claims. 
Before I conclude, let me comment on our cat losses this quarter. They were driven by a series of storms throughout the United States. The largest of which for us was a May hailstorm in Oklahoma, which accounted for about half of our second quarter cat losses. About 35% of those losses were in Commercial Lines, attributable mostly to a few large losses and about 65% in Personal Lines. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Ricky."

As usual, I will review our financial results for the quarter. I will also provide commentary on our international investment portfolio and our capital management efforts. Overall, as you've heard, we are very pleased with our performance",933,"Thanks, John. As usual, I will review our financial results for the quarter. I will also provide commentary on our international investment portfolio and our capital management efforts. 
Overall, as you've heard, we are very pleased with our performance in the second quarter, and we continue to have excellent capital and liquidity positions. Looking first at our second quarter operating results, we had solid underwriting income of $263 million despite another relatively heavy cat quarter for the industry and for Chubb. 
Property and casualty investment income after tax was essentially flat at $311 million. Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter, due to net realized investment gains before tax of $90 million or $0.18 per share after tax, including $86 million in net gains before tax on our alternative investments portfolio. 
As a reminder, we account for our alternative investments on a one quarter lag, and we include the changes in the net equity of our alternative investments and net realized gains and losses. Accordingly, the net realized gains that we reported in the second quarter reflected the strong performance of equity markets in the first quarter. Conversely, the impact on our alternative investment of the subsequent decline in the equity markets during the second quarter will be reflected in our results in the third quarter. 
Unrealized depreciation before tax at June 30, 2010, increased to $1.9 billion from $1.8 billion at the end of the first quarter and $1.6 billion at year end 2009. 
Turning to our investment portfolio. The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $42 billion as of June 30, 2010, compared to $42.3 billion at the end of the first quarter. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is four years, and the average credit rating is Aa2.
In light of the continued volatility in global financial markets, we thought that you would appreciate some details about our international investment portfolio, which represented 22% of our total invested assets as of June 30. Our international investment portfolio totaled $9.2 billion, of which $9.1 billion was invested in high-quality fixed maturity securities and short-term investments. The international fixed maturity portfolio has an average credit rating of Aa1 and is heavily concentrated in AAA-rated sovereigns and supranationals. Our five largest sovereign exposures, which account for 45% of our total international investment portfolio, are Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany and France. We have no direct exposure to Greece, minimal exposure to Portugal and our total exposure to the so-called PIGs is approximately 5% of our international investment portfolio and 1% of our total invested assets. 
We also continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At June 30, 2010, our holding company portfolio had $2.3 billion of investments, including $760 million of short-term investments. Book value per share under GAAP at June 30 was $49.39 compared to $47.09 at year end 2009 and $41.45 a year ago. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available-for-sale fixed maturities and amortized costs, was $45.61, compared to $44.37 at 2009 year end and $40.41 a year ago. 
As for reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the second quarter of 2010 on prior year reserves by SPU as follows: In CPI, we had about $55 million; CCI also had about $55 million; CSI had about $70 million; and Reinsurance Assumed had essentially none. That brings our total favorable development to about $180 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the second quarter combined ratio of about 6.5 points overall. 
For comparison, in the second quarter of 2009, we had about $210 million of favorable development for the company overall, including about $20 million in CPI, $19 million in CCI, $85 million in CSI and $15 million in Reinsurance Assumed. The favorable impact on a combined ratio in the second quarter of '09 was about 7.5 points. 
During the second quarter of 2010, our loss reserves decreased by $176 million to $20.9 billion. Reserves on our Reinsurance Assumed business, which is now in runoff, declined by $27 million. Reserves in the Insurance business decreased by $149 million during the quarter, and the impact of currency fluctuation on loss reserves during in the quarter resulted in a decrease in reserves of $150 million.
Turning to capital management. We continue to be very active buying back our shares. During the second quarter, we repurchased 12.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $636 million or an average cost of $51.14 per share. For the first six months, our repurchases totaled about $980 million with an average cost of $50.54 per share. In June, our board authorized an increase of 14 million shares to our existing share repurchase program. Including these new shares, we had 16.8 million shares remaining under our current repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter. 
As we have said previously, we are in a very strong capital position, and we also believe that this is an opportune time to acquire our shares at a very attractive valuation. The pace of the buyback will depend on overall market conditions and the potential opportunities for profitable growth in the P&C insurance market. However, should conditions remain relatively stable, we would expect to complete the increased program by year end 2010. This increased size and pace of our share repurchase program would add approximately $0.08 to our 2010 operating income per share and is incorporated in our updated earnings guidance. 
And now I'll turn it back to John Finnegan."

Some of the highlights were: Six-month operating income per share of $2.54; excellent performance in the 6th year of a soft market, especially in the face of almost 10 points of catastrophe losses; terrific x cat combined ratios of 83.5% for the second quarter and 82.4% for the first half, this was one point better than the second quarter of last year and about 3.5 points better than the first half of 2009; excellent renewal retention in the second quarter for all SPUs; an increase in book value per share to $49.39, which is 19% higher than a year ago; and a strong capital position, which we expect will enable us to complete our increased share repurchase program by year end, while still leaving us sufficient capital to take advantage of any significant upturn in the insurance market. 
Based on our results for the first half and our outlook for the rest of the year, we are affirming our guidance for operating income per share in the range of $5.15 to $5.55 for the full year. This includes a four-point increase in our cat assumption from three points to seven points, which results in a negative impact of $0.90 per share versus our initial guidance for the calendar year. 
The fact that we're able to affirm our January earnings guidance despite such a substantial increase in the cat assumption highlights the strength of our underlying performance. Although our operating income per share guidance for 2010 has not changed, some of the underlying assumptions have. We expect net written premiums that are approximately flat for the full year, including the benefit from currency of about one point. The January 2010 guidance assume net written premiums that will be flat to down 2%, including a two-point positive impact of currency. 
Based on our actual catastrophe losses of 9.6 points in the first half, we have revised our cat assumption for the full year to seven points, which implies about four to 4.5 points of cat losses in the second half. For those who would like to make a higher or lower cat assumption, the impact of each percentage point of catastrophe losses on operating from per share for the full year is approximately $0.22. 
For our 2010 combined ratio, we expect a range of 90% to 92%, unchanged from the January guidance assumption. The assumption is based on revised combined ratio ranges of 94% to 96% for CPI, 93% to 95% for CCI and 82% to 84% for CSI. We expect property and casualty investment income after tax to decline approximately 1% compared to an assumption of flat in the January guidance. Finally, our operating income per share guidance is based on an assumption of 321 million average diluted shares outstanding for the full year compared to the 328 million shares assumed in our earlier guidance. 
In closing, as I've said in other occasions, we continue to manage the company for our shareholders and the way we achieve shareholder value by underwriting prudently, investing conservatively, actively managing our capital and providing products and services to our customers and producers that are unmatched in the marketplace. We've demonstrated that we can execute on the both favorable and unfavorable market conditions, and we're confident in our continued ability to produce superior results by adapting to economic and industry developments. And with that, we'll open it to your questions."

And I would say that in Professional Liability, we're running 99 this year versus 102 last year. Last year was a third year of major credit crisis claims, so we had a big load in our accident year for potential credit crisis claims. We're not seeing anything like that this year. We're seeing really an abatement of credit crisis claim, so we don't have as big a cap load in Specialty. In the Property classes and the Short Tail lines, those lines tend to be more influenced by claims activity and losses, actual experience not so much as a pick, and we've just had a much better experience in the first two quarters of this year than last. But to put this in some perspective, let me close this out, in our guidance, we are assuming about a three-point to four-point deterioration in our accident year x cat performance during the second half of the year, because we think we've been unduly lucky perhaps in the first half, and the numbers have just been great. So we expect a little bit more reversion to the 2009 x cat level. So we're not expecting extrapolating a continued performance at this very, very high level, still expecting a very good performance but somewhat worse in the second half than we've got in the first half."

This is -- what we see all the time here are measurements of the quarters year back and a year here. When we say exposures picking up -- the fact is, exposure was down one in the second quarter this year, so we're not talking about buoyant exposure. It's just that it was negative three or so in the second quarter of last year. So exposure in the second quarter of 2009 was effectively defined by what happened between the second quarter of 2008 and 2009, which was very negative. Between 2009 and 2010, things have stabilized somewhat. So unemployment has stayed pretty much the same. It hasn't improved, and I think that's just generally true. Same with premium adjustments. I mean, you're measuring against the change that occurred a year ago, so the improvement is an improvement, but it doesn't mean that things are actually going up. It's still, right now, we're still about flat on exposure, maybe we're up plus one in June, so it's not that buoyant yet."

Maybe I'll start with sort of some absolute comments about our own Municipal portfolio, and then I'll make some relative comments related to the part of your question as it relates to risks selection. Clearly, we are in an interesting period of time, and there's significant headline risk as it relates to governments and municipal securities. We think that our particular portfolio is very high quality and very well-diversified. And I think that's part of, when we think about risks selection, we make these risk decisions ourselves. We choose our own investments, and we do all the work and all the credit works. So we feel very good about our individual portfolio. We have an average credit rating of AA2. More importantly, though, the way we structured the portfolio in terms of the securities, we think, gives us even more comfort that we're very comfortable with our portfolio. That 62% of the portfolio is invested in essential service revenue bonds that are supported by stable high-quality income streams and less susceptible, we believe, to some of the economic conditions we're seeing. About 25% of the portfolio is invested in state and local government general obligation bonds. And there, we tend to favor larger, more liquid issuers who we believe have greater financial flexibility. And the remaining 13% of the portfolio is invested in pre-fund and annual government-backed securities, which we also think are somewhat lower risk. We tend to avoid land development and lower-rated healthcare and airline bonds as well as smaller local issuers. So on just an absolute basis, given the portfolio that we have constructed and the way it has conformed historically and then, frankly, the way it's performed even through the credit crisis, we feel good about our portfolio. On a relative basis, obviously, we are in an environment where every asset class is more risky today than it was five years or 10 years ago. But as we look at the opportunities in the marketplace, we continue to see attractive relative value plays in the municipal bond world. And so, we have not made any major change to our existing investment strategy. We continue to invest in high-quality munis. We continue to invest in any maturity corporates, where we see total returns and values that we think are attractive. Should our views change over time, we'll be able to change as well. But as we sit here today, we don't think we need to make any major adjustments in the way we're investing our new money."

We are very pleased to report excellent results for the second quarter and the first half, notwithstanding substantially higher-than-expected catastrophe losses in both quarters. 
Operating income per share for the second quarter was $1.41, despite $0.38 of cats [catastrophes]. That compares to $1.49 in last year's second quarter when the impact of cats was only $0.08. The second quarter combined ratio in 2010 was a very strong 90.4%, even including 6.9 points of cats, our highest second quarter cat impact ever. The x cat combined ratio for the quarter was 83.5%, nearly a point better than last year's second quarter. For the first six months, operating income per share was $2.54 and the combined ratio of 92%, which is exceptionally good considering it included 9.6 points of cats. The six-month x cat combined ratio of 82.4% was nearly 3.5 points better than the first half of last year.
In addition, our investment portfolio continued to perform extremely well. During the second quarter, it produced a net realized capital gain before tax of $90 million. At June 30, our net unrealized appreciation before tax stood at $1.9 billion, which is an increase of $88 million over March 31. The effect of these investment on operating results was a reported book value per share of $49.39 at June 30, 2010, a 19% increase compared to a year ago. 
Our excellent capital position enabled us to substantially increase our share repurchase program in order to take advantage of the attractive opportunity in the market to acquire our own shares. Ricky will talk more about the buyback program in his remarks. 
As you will recall, last January, we provided 2010 operating income guidance of $5.15 to $5.55 per share, based in part at an assumption of three points of cats for the year. Substantially higher-than-expected cats in the first half have led us to change that assumption to seven points of cats for the full year. Nonetheless, we are affirming our January earnings guidance based on our excellent x cat results year-to-date and our outlook for the second half of the year. I will elaborate on our updated guidance in my closing remarks. 
Let me turn it over now to John Degnan, who will talk about our operating results."

I'm going to begin with a review of the individual business units for the second quarter. Chubb Personal Insurance net written premiums increased 5%, led by strong growth outside the U.S. About half that growth was attributable to currency fluctuation, and CPI produced the combined ratio of 92.9% compared to 84.2% last year. Cat losses for CPI were 13.8 points in the second quarter of 2010 compared to only 3.2 points a year earlier. So excluding the cat impact, CPI's combined ratio improved nearly two points to 79.1% from 81%. 
Homeowners premiums were up 2%, and the combined ratio was 94.5%, including 20.3 points of cats. Our Personal Auto premiums were up 14% with a combined ratio of 90.2%. In Other Personal lines, which includes the Accident business, premiums increased 9%, and the combined ratio was 90.5%. Premiums for both Personal Auto and Accident reflect strong growth outside the U.S. and the positive effect of currency.
At Chubb Commercial Insurance, premiums were flat. It was the first time since the first quarter of 2008 that CCI's reported premiums did not decline. The combined ratio was 92.9% compared to last year's 89.2%, but CCI's second quarter included a 5.6 point impact of cats compared with only 1.2 points in 2009. So excluding the cat impact, CCI's combined ratio for the quarter improved to 87.3% from 88% last year. CCI retained 86% of the U.S. premiums that came up for renewal, and the ratio of new-to-lost business was 1.3:1. Both the retention and that new-to-lost ratio improved compared to the year ago second quarter, as well as compared to this year's first quarter. Average U.S. renewal rates were flat. 
At Chubb Specialty, net written premiums were flat, and the combined ratio improved to 82.5% from 83.9% in the second quarter of 2009. Premiums for Professional Liability were also flat, and the combined ratio was 87.2% compared to 90.1% in last year's second quarter. Average U.S. renewal rates for Professional Liability were down 3%. Renewal retention in the U.S. improved to 86% and the ratio of new-to-lost business was 1:1. For Surety, net written premiums were down 2%. Profitability was strong with a combined ratio of 47.7% for the quarter. 
So now I'll move on to a few comments on the overall market environment. Based on our experience, the marketplace seems analogous to A Tale of Two Cities. On the one hand, there are indications that the impact of the economy on the market, as seen in exposures, endorsements and audit adjustments, may be improving from its low point. On the other hand, the marketplace also seems more competitive. We believe that our consistently solid execution is enabling Chubb to perform effectively in this challenging market, as evidenced by our overall financial results. 
In Commercial lines, our experience suggests a reason for optimism about the impact of the economy on the marketplace. For example, our Commercial renewal exposure bases, while still down slightly, are improving significantly. Common examples of those renewal exposure bases include payrolls for workers' comp policies, sales for general liability contracts and shipments from Marine policies. In the second quarter, CCI had only a slight renewal exposure decline of one point in the U.S. This is the smallest quarterly decrease we've experienced since the fourth quarter of 2008 and is an improvement over the 3% decline in the second quarter of 2009. Even more encouraging, CCI actually had a slightly positive renewal exposure change in the month of June, the first time since October 2008. 
Likewise, midterm policy endorsement activity, which is another measure of exposure change, picked up nicely in the quarter. Yielding nearly twice as much additional premium as in the second quarter of 2009. While endorsement activity hasn't yet reached historical levels, it's encouraging to see some customers, at least, adding new exposure units through activity such as acquiring machinery and equipment. As I mentioned, the new-to-lost business ratio in the U.S. was 1.3:1 in the second quarter for CCI. That was another bright spot and an improvement over past quarters. The uptick was aided by very strong renewal retention of 86% and by writing more targeted prospects in proven niches. 
We were particularly pleased last quarter to win back some customers who left us over the past few years for cheaper pricing. Not surprisingly, some of those win-backs had experienced poor service after leaving us. Others returned as they discovered their premiums were eventually increased back to levels comparable to what we had been charging. 
At CPI, we're also seeing positive trends and exposures. So endorsement activity was positive for the first time since the third quarter of 2008. While here, too, the level of endorsement activity isn't yet near its historical level, we are encouraged to see it adding to growth. The rate environment in CPI continue to be relatively stable.  Obviously, we have not yet seen whether most of our competitors are experiencing similar exposure on premium trends. To the extent they are, it would be encouraging about the overall marketplace. To the extent they're not, it would be encouraging about our relative performance. 
While there are indications that the negative impact of economic conditions on premium growth may be abating, we are being adversely affected by the negative movement of rates due to the highly competitive environment. For example, U.S. renewal rates for CCI were flat, versus up 1% in the previous quarter and up 2% in the second quarter of 2009. Increased competitive pressure is constraining our ability to maintain the rate increases that we were seeing in 2009.
Terms and conditions also came under pressure in certain lines of business such as large property accounts. For example, we saw several competitors offer double and even triple the limits for flood and earthquake risks without any increase in premium. Surprisingly, we saw this erosion in terms and conditions even for some customers with large exposures and known flood and quake zones. As our results confirm, we are navigating these issues successfully by adhering to our traditional underwriting diligence and discipline.
Turning to CSI. The good news is that second quarter renewal retention in Professional Liability increased in the U.S. by three points to 86%, helping to drive our new-to-lost business ratio to 1:1 from 0.9:1 in last year's second quarter. The CCI team is doing an excellent job of retaining its best customers and carefully pricing exposures. 
CSI's renewal exposure base and endorsement activity were steady with previous quarters. Unfortunately, as we have seen with respect to rates in CCI, Professional Liability renewal rates in the U.S., which had shown signs of improving last year, were down 3% versus down 1% in the previous quarter and up 4% in the second quarter of 2009. That rate decline was led by public D&O, which was our most challenging line in the second quarter. We suspect that the highly competitive public D&O market is being fueled by relatively new entrants and by their overreliance on some recent positive claim indications. We also believe that market participants now view the credit crisis as being over and expect significantly improved loss experience, especially in non-financial public D&O.
The fact is, as I will explain in a minute, the first half of 2010 has been a very favorable period, particularly in terms of the level of new securities class action. However, we do not believe that these developments fully support the very aggressive price quotes we continue to see in the public D&O market. The bottom line is that we suspect some competitors are pricing these long-tail lines too aggressively. While recent loss experience maybe good, Professional Liability losses are not linear, and systemic events can arise quickly and unexpectedly. Some of the pricing we see in the market today suggest the illusion that the more favorable loss environment will last forever and seems to make no provision for the risks inherent in this business. 
In the face of these pressures, Chubb is using our decades of experience in data to carefully choose which customers we write and where best to position ourselves on their programs. Fortunately, our CSI book is very diversified and the private and not-for-profit D&O segments, E&O, EPL, fiduciary crime and financial fidelity lines did not experience the same level of price pressure as public D&O. 
So developments in the marketplace during the second quarter have been decidedly a mixed bag. While we are seeing some movements in exposure trends, premium growth and retention, which may indicate the downward pressure of economic conditions could be abating, we still see a very competitive marketplace in which the mildly positive rate trends we saw for several quarters have deteriorated, and the soft market continues. 
Now let me offer just a few thoughts in credit crisis claims. The evidence continues to mount that insofar as credit crisis losses are concerned, we are appropriately reserved in the accident years in which the claims have been made. Across all impacted lines, new credit crisis claim activity has dwindled since the beginning of the year, and those few claims we have received typically involve insureds who have reported earlier claims, and as a result, do not even implicate fresh limits. 
Given what we've seen over the past few quarters, we're nearing the point where we believe that the credit crisis as a source of new claims exposure is coming to an end. In addition, dismissal rates of credit crisis D&O cases continue to run in excess of 50%, and they're beginning to be upheld by the circuit courts of appeal. Those decisions reflect the heightened pleading standards I referred to in previous calls under cases like Tellabs and Dura. And the fact that the losses behind much of the credit crisis activity were driven by extraordinary market events rather than distinct corporate conduct appears to have made it more difficult for plaintiffs' attorneys to meet the threshold for pleading securities fraud in those cases. Many cases remain to be decided, of course, and a number of dismissals are still on appeal. But overall, these developments give us added comfort in the approach we've taken to these claims from the outset of the crisis. 
Similarly, on the E&O side, the factors that I've discussed previously as mitigating our credit crisis exposures still apply. In particular, the rating agencies, which have been a major target of the more recent E&O claims activity, continue to have considerable success in obtaining dismissals of the claims asserted against them, particularly in those cases in which plaintiffs have attempted to hold them liable as underwriters of the securities that they were involved in rating or structuring. 
And finally in the fiduciary lines. Once again, we saw no new credit crisis claims this past quarter. We are managing those claims we have, and we continue to believe that such fiduciary claims present less exposure than either D&O or E&O claims. 
Before I conclude, let me comment on our cat losses this quarter. They were driven by a series of storms throughout the United States. The largest of which for us was a May hailstorm in Oklahoma, which accounted for about half of our second quarter cat losses. About 35% of those losses were in Commercial Lines, attributable mostly to a few large losses and about 65% in Personal Lines. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Ricky."
261037,108523683,68775,"The Chubb Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-22-2010",2010-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Chubb Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. As usual, I will review our financial results for the quarter. I will also provide commentary on our international investment portfolio and our capital management efforts. Overall, as you've heard, we are very pleased with our performance",936,"Thanks, John. As usual, I will review our financial results for the quarter. I will also provide commentary on our international investment portfolio and our capital management efforts. 
Overall, as you've heard, we are very pleased with our performance in the second quarter, and we continue to have excellent capital and liquidity positions. Looking first at our second quarter operating results, we had solid underwriting income of $263 million despite another relatively heavy cat quarter for the industry and for Chubb. 
Property and casualty investment income after tax was essentially flat at $311 million. Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter, due to net realized investment gains before tax of $90 million or $0.18 per share after tax, including $86 million in net gains before tax on our alternative investments portfolio. 
As a reminder, we account for our alternative investments on a one quarter lag, and we include the changes in the net equity of our alternative investments and net realized gains and losses. Accordingly, the net realized gains that we reported in the second quarter reflected the strong performance of equity markets in the first quarter. Conversely, the impact on our alternative investment of the subsequent decline in the equity markets during the second quarter will be reflected in our results in the third quarter. 
Unrealized depreciation before tax at June 30, 2010, increased to $1.9 billion from $1.8 billion at the end of the first quarter and $1.6 billion at year end 2009. 
Turning to our investment portfolio. The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $42 billion as of June 30, 2010, compared to $42.3 billion at the end of the first quarter. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is four years, and the average credit rating is Aa2.
In light of the continued volatility in global financial markets, we thought that you would appreciate some details about our international investment portfolio, which represented 22% of our total invested assets as of June 30. Our international investment portfolio totaled $9.2 billion, of which $9.1 billion was invested in high-quality fixed maturity securities and short-term investments. The international fixed maturity portfolio has an average credit rating of Aa1 and is heavily concentrated in AAA-rated sovereigns and supranationals. Our five largest sovereign exposures, which account for 45% of our total international investment portfolio, are Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany and France. We have no direct exposure to Greece, minimal exposure to Portugal and our total exposure to the so-called PIGS [Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain] is approximately 5% of our international investment portfolio and 1% of our total invested assets. 
We also continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At June 30, 2010, our holding company portfolio had $2.3 billion of investments, including $760 million of short-term investments. Book value per share under GAAP at June 30 was $49.39 compared to $47.09 at year-end 2009 and $41.45 a year ago. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized costs was $45.61, compared to $44.37 at 2009 year end and $40.41 a year ago. 
As for reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the second quarter of 2010 on prior-year reserves by SBU [strategic business units] as follows: In CPI, we had about $55 million; CCI also had about $55 million; CSI had about $70 million; and Reinsurance Assumed had essentially none. That brings our total favorable development to about $180 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the second quarter combined ratio of about 6.5 points overall. 
For comparison, in the second quarter of 2009, we had about $210 million of favorable development for the company overall, including about $20 million in CPI, $90 million in CCI, $85 million in CSI and $15 million in Reinsurance Assumed. The favorable impact on a combined ratio in the second quarter of '09 was about 7.5 points. 
During the second quarter of 2010, our loss reserves decreased by $176 million to $20.9 billion. Reserves on our Reinsurance Assumed business, which is now in runoff, declined by $27 million. Reserves in the Insurance business decreased by $149 million during the quarter, and the impact of currency fluctuation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in a decrease in reserves of $150 million.
Turning to capital management. We continue to be very active buying back our shares. During the second quarter, we repurchased 12.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $636 million or an average cost of $51.14 per share. For the first six months, our repurchases totaled about $980 million with an average cost of $50.54 per share. In June, our board authorized an increase of 14 million shares to our existing share repurchase program. Including these new shares, we had 16.8 million shares remaining under our current repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter. 
As we have said previously, we are in a very strong capital position, and we also believe that this is an opportune time to acquire our shares at a very attractive valuation. The pace of the buyback will depend on overall market conditions and the potential opportunities for profitable growth in the P&C insurance market. However, should conditions remain relatively stable, we would expect to complete the increased program by year-end 2010. This increased size and pace of our share repurchase program would add approximately $0.08 to our 2010 operating income per share and is incorporated in our updated earnings guidance. 
And now I'll turn it back to John Finnegan."

Some of the highlights were: Six-month operating income per share of $2.54; excellent performance in the sixth year of a soft market, especially in the face of almost 10 points of catastrophe losses; terrific x cat combined ratios of 83.5% for the second quarter and 82.4% for the first half, this was one point better than the second quarter of last year and about 3.5 points better than the first half of 2009; excellent renewal retention in the second quarter for all SPUs; an increase in book value per share to $49.39, which is 19% higher than a year ago; and a strong capital position, which we expect will enable us to complete our increased share repurchase program by year end, while still leaving us sufficient capital to take advantage of any significant upturn in the insurance market. 
Based on our results for the first half and our outlook for the rest of the year, we are affirming our guidance for operating income per share in the range of $5.15 to $5.55 for the full year. This includes a four-point increase in our cat assumption from three points to seven points, which results in a negative impact of $0.90 per share versus our initial guidance for the calendar year. 
The fact that we're able to affirm our January earnings guidance despite such a substantial increase in the cat assumption highlights the strength of our underlying performance. Although our operating income per share guidance for 2010 has not changed, some of the underlying assumptions have. We expect net written premiums that are approximately flat for the full year, including the benefit from currency of about one point. The January 2010 guidance assume net written premiums that will be flat to down 2%, including a two-point positive impact of currency. 
Based on our actual catastrophe losses of 9.6 points in the first half, we have revised our cat assumption for the full year to seven points, which implies about four to 4.5 points of cat losses in the second half. For those who would like to make a higher or lower cat assumption, the impact of each percentage point of catastrophe losses on operating from per share for the full year is approximately $0.22. 
For our 2010 combined ratio, we expect a range of 90% to 92%, unchanged from the January guidance assumption. The assumption is based on revised combined ratio ranges of 94% to 96% for CPI, 93% to 95% for CCI and 82% to 84% for CSI. We expect property and casualty investment income after tax to decline approximately 1% compared to an assumption of flat in the January guidance. Finally, our operating income per share guidance is based on an assumption of 321 million average diluted shares outstanding for the full year compared to the 328 million shares assumed in our earlier guidance. 
In closing, as I've said in other occasions, we continue to manage the company for our shareholders and the way we achieve shareholder value by underwriting prudently, investing conservatively, actively managing our capital and providing products and services to our customers and producers that are unmatched in the marketplace. We've demonstrated that we can execute on the both favorable and unfavorable market conditions, and we're confident in our continued ability to produce superior results by adapting to economic and industry developments. And with that, we'll open it to your questions."

As far as Property, I suspect that, that will -- listen, I think all the lines have tempered a little bit by frequency. Frequency is down. Claims are down. But over time, you won't get around margin compression if you don't raise rates. Property, though, is a little bit different case because it's a lumpy line, it's more like to the experience we have on -- our performance we have in the third and fourth quarter on Property will relate a little bit more to the losses we experienced during that period, the fire losses we get and any sort of ongoing trend line. In the Specialty lines, obviously, the issue is in more systematic losses. What we're seeing is significant decline in claims, especially in the credit crisis in [indiscernible] area. The credit crisis appears to have tapered off, so that's obviously a positive on the accident year. And the accident year is much better on Specialty this year than it was last year."

And I would say that in Professional Liability, we're running 99 this year versus 102 last year. Last year was a third year of major credit crisis claims, so we had a big load in our accident year for potential credit crisis claims. We're not seeing anything like that this year. We're seeing really an abatement of credit crisis claim, so we don't have as big a cap load in Specialty. In the Property classes and the Short Tail lines, those lines tend to be more influenced by claims activity and losses, actual experience not so much as a pick, and we've just had a much better experience in the first two quarters of this year than last. But to put this in some perspective, let me close this out, in our guidance, we are assuming about a three-point to four-point deterioration in our accident year x cat performance during the second half of the year, because we think we've been unduly lucky perhaps in the first half, and the numbers have just been great. So we expect a little bit more reversion to the 2009 x cat level. So we're not expecting extrapolating a continued performance at this very, very high level, still expecting a very good performance but somewhat worse in the second half than we've got in the first half."

This is -- what we see all the time here are measurements of the quarters year back and a year here. When we say exposures picking up -- the fact is, exposure was down one in the second quarter this year, so we're not talking about buoyant exposure. It's just that it was negative three or so in the second quarter of last year. So exposure in the second quarter of 2009 was effectively defined by what happened between the second quarter of 2008 and 2009, which was very negative. Between 2009 and 2010, things have stabilized somewhat. So unemployment has stayed pretty much the same. It hasn't improved, and I think that's just generally true. Same with premium adjustments. I mean, you're measuring against the change that occurred a year ago, so the improvement is an improvement, but it doesn't mean that things are actually going up.

Maybe I'll start with sort of some absolute comments about our own Municipal portfolio, and then I'll make some relative comments related to the part of your question as it relates to risks selection. Clearly, we are in an interesting period of time, and there's significant headline risk as it relates to governments and municipal securities. We think that our particular portfolio is very high quality and very well-diversified. And I think that's part of, when we think about risks selection, we make these risk decisions ourselves. We choose our own investments, and we do all the work and all the credit works. So we feel very good about our individual portfolio. We have an average credit rating of AA2. More importantly, though, the way we structured the portfolio in terms of the securities, we think, gives us even more comfort that we're very comfortable with our portfolio. That 62% of the portfolio is invested in essential service revenue bonds that are supported by stable high-quality income streams and less susceptible, we believe, to some of the economic conditions we're seeing. About 25% of the portfolio is invested in state and local government general obligation bonds. And there, we tend to favor larger, more liquid issuers who we believe have greater financial flexibility. And the remaining 13% of the portfolio is invested in pre-fund and annual government-backed securities, which we also think are somewhat lower risk. We tend to avoid land development and lower-rated healthcare and airline bonds as well as smaller local issuers. So on just an absolute basis, given the portfolio that we have constructed and the way it has conformed historically and then, frankly, the way it's performed even through the credit crisis, we feel good about our portfolio. On a relative basis, obviously, we are in an environment where every asset class is more risky today than it was five years or 10 years ago. But as we look at the opportunities in the marketplace, we continue to see attractive relative value plays in the municipal bond world. And so, we have not made any major change to our existing investment strategy. We continue to invest in high-quality munis. We continue to invest in any maturity corporates, where we see total returns and values that we think are attractive. Should our views change over time, we'll be able to change as well. But as we sit here today, we don't think we need to make any major adjustments in the way we're investing our new money."

Chubb had an excellent third quarter across the board. Our combined ratio was outstanding. We continued to produce significant growth in book value and a strong return on equity. In addition, aided largely by historically high retention rates,",769,"Thank you. Chubb had an excellent third quarter across the board. Our combined ratio was outstanding. We continued to produce significant growth in book value and a strong return on equity. In addition, aided largely by historically high retention rates, we had a modest increase in premiums in a very competitive market. And we continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and an active share repurchase program. 
Operating income per share for the third quarter was up 8% to $1.69. Annualized operating ROE for the quarter was 15%. The combined ratio was an excellent 86.2%. And the combined ratio, excluding caps, improved to 84.1% from 84.6%. For the first nine months, operating income per share was $4.22. x cats [catastrophes], our nine-month combined ratio was 83%, an improvement of 2.4 points over the same period last year. 
We produced an attractive annualized operating ROE in the first nine months of 12.7% even with a relatively high 7.1 points of cats. In addition, our investment portfolio continued to perform extremely well. Property and Casualty investment income after taxes for the third quarter of 2010 was $317 million, which was flat compared to last year in a lower yield environment. We also had net realized investment gains of $54 million before tax. At September 30, our net unrealized depreciation before tax stood at $2.6 billion, an increase of $700 million over June 30. These operating and investment results produced a GAAP book value per share of $52.41 at September 30. That's a 6% increase since June 30 and 11% increase since year end 2009 and a 15% increase compared to a year ago. Our capital position is excellent and Ricky will talk about the progress we have made in our share buyback program.
As you recall in July, we affirmed 2010 operating income per share guidance in the range of $5.15 to $5.55 per share. Based on third quarter results and a positive outlook for the fourth quarter, we are increasing guidance for 2010 to a range of $5.75 to $5.85 per share. I will elaborate on the revised guidance in my closing remarks. We continue to underwrite in a balanced fashion, seeking growth where we can get it but insisting on pricing terms and conditions that are designed to achieve at acceptable level of underwriting profitability. We continue to invest conservatively and we continue to actively manage our capital as evidenced by our share buybacks and dividends. This combination of underwriting discipline, conservative investing and active capital management is the formula that continues to define Chubb and produces superior results for shareholders. 
This afternoon, we also announced some important management changes at Chubb. As previously indicated, John Degnan will be retiring on December 31 after a distinguished 20-year career at Chubb, most recently as Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer. This is John's last conference call and he leaves big shoes to fill. We have a great team in place but I know we will all miss John's insightful observations on the market place, claims and public affairs. The good news is that our quarterly conference calls will now be much shorter. Fortunately, John has agreed to continue at Chubb as a senior adviser to me on a part-time basis. Although all of the details have not been finalized, I expect that John will be involved in areas such as special situation claims in government affairs in which he has amassed much expertise. 
As we announced this afternoon, upon John's retirement at the end of the year, Paul Krump will become President of Commercial and Specialty Lines reporting to me. In addition, the Accident business will report directly to Paul. Dino Robusto will become President of Personal Lines and Claims and will continue to oversee IT, Communications, Corporate Development and Innovation. He will also report to me. 
Harold Morrison will continue as Chief Global Field Officer and additionally will become Chief Administrative Officer, overseeing human resources and administrative services. Howard will report to Paul and Dino. The executive committee will include Paul, Dino, Harold, Ricky Spiro and myself. Paul, Dino and Harold are all seasoned executives, having been with Chubb for more than 20 years each. They all earned their way up through the ranks and they've had a major role in Chubb's operational success over the past several years. While John will be tough to replace, I'm very confident that we have a terrific team in place that is well qualified to step in and lead Chubb to even greater success in the years ahead. And now, John Degnan will discuss our operating performance in more detail."

Since this is my last earnings call, I'm especially pleased that we had such a good quarter. Let me give you some of the key details about that. Chubb Personal Insurance net written premiums increased 4%, with about a 1% positive impact of currency fluctuation. CPI produced a combined ratio of 85.4% compared to 81.6% last year. But cats were 3.7 points in 2010 whereas the impact of catastrophes actually improved the combined ratio by about a point in the third quarter of 2009. So excluding cats, CPI's third quarter combined ratio was 81.7% this year, almost a point better than last year's 82.6%. Homeowners premiums were up 2% and the combined ratio was an 81%. Personal auto premiums increased 7%, driven by growth outside the U.S. and the combined ratio was 91.7%. In Other Personal lines, which include our Accident business, premiums were up 7% and the combined ratio was 94.2%.
At Chubb Commercial Insurance, premiums were flat or down about 1% x currency. The combined ratio was an 89.1% compared to last year's 90.5%. CCI's third quarter included cat losses of two points compared with 2.6 points in 2009. So excluding cats, CCI's third quarter combined ratio was 87.1% in 2010 and 87.9% in 2009.
In the U.S., CCI renewal rates were down 1% compared to flat in the second quarter. We have one of the highest quarterly U.S. retention rates we've had in many years, 87%, contributing to a new to lost business ratio of 1.2:1.
At Chubb Specialty Insurance, net written premiums were also flat and the combined ratio was 83.3% compared to 83.6% in the third quarter of 2009. Premiums for Professional Liability were down 1% and the combined ratio was 89.3% compared to the 90% in last year's third quarter. Average U.S. renewal rates for Professional Liability were down 2% compared to down 3% in the second quarter. Renewal retention in the U.S. was 88% and the ratio of new to lost business was 1.1:1. For surety, net written premiums were up 7%, driven largely by growth outside the U.S. and the combined ratio was 40%.
Overall, market conditions in the third quarter were largely unchanged from the first half. We continue to see competitive pressure on rates. But on the other hand, the repercussions of poor economic conditions continue to abate slightly, and we had some improvement in exposures and endorsement activity. Overall, the market environment continues to be very challenging.
Just one final word for me on credit crisis claims. Credit crisis losses continue to develop consistently with our prior observations about them. The number of new claims in this category continues to dwindle. And managing these losses now is a question of dealing with a known quantity of claims rather than speculating about the number we will actually receive. Nothing has changed our conviction that we are appropriately reserved for the accident years in which the claims have been made. 
In closing, I'll miss these earnings calls. Not so much the internal prep sessions. It's been a privilege to work for over 20 years for a company in whose values I believe and in whose successes, particularly over the last eight years, I have been able to participate. And finally, thanks to all of you for consistently keeping us on our toes over the years during these calls. With that, I'll turn it over to Ricky Spiro."

As you can probably tell by now, we are very happy with our financial performance in the third quarter. Looking first at our operating results, underwriting income was strong, amounting to $399 million in the quarter. Property and Casualty investment income after tax of $317 million in the quarter was flat compared to last year's third quarter in a challenging investment environment. Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $54 million or $0.11 per share after tax. Our net realized investment gains before tax included $18 million of gains on our alternative investments portfolio and $36 million of realized gains from the sale of securities. Unrealized depreciation before tax at September 30, 2010, was $2.6 billion, an increase of $700 million from the end of the second quarter. This substantial increase was due to the overall improvement in the global capital markets during the quarter, which led to strong performance across all of our asset classes.
Turning to our investment portfolio, the carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $43 billion as of September 30. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 3.9 years and the average credit rating is AA2. We also continued to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At September 30, our holding company portfolio included $2.3 billion of investments, including $900 million of short-term investments.
Book value per share under GAAP at September 30, 2010, was $52.41 compared to $47.09 at year end 2009 and $45.43 a year ago. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, was $47.25 compared to $44.37 at 2009 year end and $42.31 a year ago.
As for reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the third quarter of 2010 on prior year reserves by SBU as follows: In CPI, we had about $40 million, CCI had about $90 million, CSI had about $65 million and Reinsurance Assumed had about $5 million, bringing the total favorable development to about $200 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the third quarter combined ratio of about seven points overall. For comparison, in the third quarter of 2009, we had about $205 million of favorable development for the company overall, including about $65 million in CPI, $30 million in CCI, $100 million in CSI and $10 million in Reinsurance Assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the third quarter of 2009 was about seven points, the same as in this year's third quarter. 
During the third quarter, our loss reserves increased by $7 million. Reserves in our Reinsurance Assumed business, which is now in runoff, declined by $35 million. Reserves in the Insurance business increased by $42 million during the quarter. The impact of currency fluctuation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in an increase in reserves of about $65 million. The impact of catastrophes reduced reserves by $120 million, reflecting payments on prior events and lower levels of catastrophes in the third quarter. 
Finally, I want to give you an update on capital management. During the third quarter, we repurchased 10.2 million shares. The aggregate cost of our repurchases was $555 million or an average of $54.63 per share. For the first nine months, our average repurchased cost per share was $51.94. As of September 30, 2010, there were 6.6 million shares remaining under our current repurchase authorization. And as we said during our last earnings call, our intention is to complete the repurchase of all of these remaining shares by the end of the year. We will review our 2011 capital management plans with our Board of Directors in December. And now, I'll turn it back to John Finnegan."

Here are the highlights: For the third quarter, we had operating income per share of $1.69 and an annualized operating ROE of 15%. For the first nine months, we had operating income per share of $4.22 and an annual operating ROE of 12.7%, even with seven points of cats. Our x cat combined ratio for the first nine months is an impressive 83%, which was 2.4 points better than the same period last year. Book value per share increased 6% in the three months ended September 30 and was up 11% since year end 2009 and 15% since September 30, 2009. We're maintaining a strong capital position and are well on track to completing our current share repurchase program by year end. 
With the board's initial buyback authorization in December 2005, Chubb has repurchased shares representing 37% of its market capitalization at that time. 
Let me conclude with a few comments on the revised guidance we announced in today's press release. Based on our excellent third quarter results and our outlook for a strong fourth quarter, we are updating our 2010 calendar year operating income per share guidance to a new range of $5.75 to $5.85 from the previous guidance range of $5.15 to $5.55. This revised guidance is based on operating income per share of $4.22 in the first nine months and our forecast of a range of $1.53 to $1.63 for the fourth quarter. This revised guidance is also based on an assumption of 322 million average diluted shares outstanding for the full year. 
Finally, our revised guidance assumes two percentage points of cats for the fourth quarter, which would result in 5.8 points of cats for the calendar year. This compares to the full year cat assumption of seven points included in our previous guidance, the reduction being due to lower than expected cats in the third quarter. The impact on operating income per share of each point of cats in the fourth quarter is about $0.05. That concludes our prepared remarks. I realize that they were shorter than the past but that's a reflection of a quarter with excellent results and the fact that market conditions haven't changed much from three months ago. With that, we'll open it up to your questions. Operator?"

But I'm going to take a stab at it, then John will add anything he wants to talk about it. Let me talk a little bit first about our community bank book, Keith. We consider a community bank to be one that's no larger than $1 billion in total assets. We have D&O policies for about 10% of them. 94% of our book is private or closely held and only 6% is listed on the stock exchange. The average limits are $3.2 million for the private book and $5.9 million for the public book. Given the size of those banks, we're not particularly concerned whether they're private or public because we underwrite their financial condition in light of the fact that a failure of one of these institutions could trigger a regulatory claim against the directors and officers. We have not yet seen significant claims activity in the community bank arena to date. And we're not overly concerned about the developments that have been taking place over the last couple of weeks in so far as they pertain to community banks. Although the lender liability portion of the coverage for community banks does in fact include errors and omissions, which could be implicated in a claim against the community bank for mishandling of foreclosure documentation like Robo signing. But our exposure in that connection to the community banks is not thought at the moment by us to be significant. On the other hand, our exposure to the 10 largest mortgage services that might be implicated in claims like that is also from an E&O perspective, thanks to the underlying strategies we've had for the last couple of years, is minimal with the exception of one account, which has won $15 million exposure. And to date, we haven't seen a claim from that account. And then finally, it's a complicated set of issues here and it is early to be projecting what the outcome is but with respect to-- not to the foreclosure documentation problems but to the implication of the securitized loans, you should realize that purchasers have been putting back or attempting to put back defective mortgages for several years now and they're contractually able to do that if they can prove that there were defects. That by itself though does not cause a loss to either the purchaser or the originator depending on the quality of the underlying asset. And as far as we know, and certainly our experience has been that there has not been significant insurance related claims activity to that point. And then finally, while the securitization agreements can as people have pointed out contain recourse against the originator and others for fraud, there are a number of other intermediaries that would be potentially implicated, including investment banks and lawyers and accountants. And as such, this would be largely an E&O matter where we have little to no exposure to those entities due to the underwriting actions we've taken. That was a long answer but you invited me to give you a. . ."

At least for now, those strengths are stable and are offset to some degree in our experience by lower frequency, at least in some cases like auto. But other than the potential impact of healthcare reform, which is at best uncertain, we don't see current indications of the increased claim inflation in the future. And one thing to bear in mind with respect to Chubb is that some of the third cost pressure or the inflationary pressure on loss costs, principally relate to the potential for medical inflation and because we're not big in lines of business that are affected by that light comp or auto personal liability.

Virtually all of us, and certainly, we are cat constrained in some parts of the country and can't provide a total insurance solution for the demand there. The Southeast Florida is the best example of that but there are others as well. So there's room for competition in this market. They generally, in the past have been -- last few years, three principal players Fireman's Fund, Chubb and AIG, Ace has come into the market more recently with high expectations and investing some money and there are other carriers that are moving into the high net worth's Personal Lines area. We watch that closely but frankly, it's taken us a long time to build up the brand and franchise that we enjoy in this area and we think it's pretty unique in the business. Even Barron's pointed out not too long ago that Chubb is the leading choice of affluent Americans to protect their homes. We didn't do that overnight. We did it with inspecting 700,000 high net worth properties and we settled over 1 million claims or high net worth customers with unbelievably high satisfaction ratings. Our claims responses to catastrophes is always rated the best in the industry. And we have the best network of producers in the world selling high net worth Personal Lines. They understand the product, they understand the appetite of the underwriters, they understand the importance of bonding a relationship with the customer by producing a company that's going to be around to pay the claims and not just pay them but pay them empathetically and timely. So as I said in the last call, we're not -- we're fierce competitors. We'll do what we have to do to preserve our position in the marketplace and to grow it. But we're not afraid of new entrants."

In the third quarter, we did see continued reasons for optimism in our renewal exposure figures. Optimism is modest but it's -- we had only a slight exposure decline in the third quarter this year and CCI lines have been there, so it's minus one. But if you look at the second quarter this year, it was minus 1.5. The first quarter was minus 2.3. And so we're on the right trend line here. As we said last quarter, we think the overall economy is sort of bouncing along the bottom. So we're going to see modest increases in exposure opportunities in CCI lines of business. Typically, we look for them in payrolls or workers comp, sales levels for general liability contracts, the level of shipments for marine policies and the retention amounts of the limits for Professional Liability contracts. We've also seen a flattening out in Personal Lines of the decrease we had seen in exposure over the last several quarters. There is a little less need on the part of our insureds to reduce their premiums. So fewer increases in deductibles and a bit more jewelry being bought and added on. And also builder's risk is I should point out is probably going to be the last line of business in which we would expect to see a significant exposure change, given what's going on in the economy."

Simply staying at the same level year-over-year or increasing modestly increases exposure in workers comp. So it may not be dramatic but it does have an exposure growth impact. We perform pretty well in workers comp compared to the industry. AM Best pointed out recently that the industry combined ratio for comp had deteriorated from 104.6% in 2008 to 116% in 2010. Chubb's comparable numbers were 82.1% in 2008 and 92.1% in 2010. We generally performed 20 points better than the rest of the industry.

But also the effect of geographic and product mix on commissions. Our commissions are up some this quarter. We have more overseas growth than U.S. growth and our activities overseas have higher commissions. The product growth and business is such as A&H for reinvaluable articles grew faster than the company averaged. Some of these lines have higher commissions than places like workers compensation, for example, which is a low commission base and which we didn't grow.

We're still not a huge player in the workers comp line overall and much smaller portion of our premium base comes from workers comp and it's true in many of our competitors. We tend to shy away from the large manufacturing risks with high frequency and often high severity claims and tend to write in conjunction with our niche approach to GL and property, Specialty Lines of coverage and lawyers, and things of that nature where you just don't see the same frequency and severity. So for that reason, we haven't seen all that much change in the behavior of our claimants. We also, a couple of years initiated a very sophisticated predictive model for assessing our claims activity. So it used to take us six months to identify a claim, which had the potential for soft fraud. At which point, we put our best adjustor on it. It now takes us 17 days and it's coming down to lower than 17 days as the predictive model proves more successful. So we're managing our loss costs much more effectively, particularly in lost time but also in medical, than we have in the past. The 20 point difference has been a historical one between us and the industry since we began to draw the line. But principally, it has to do with the different underwriting appetite."

Frankly, the court cases were coming down against us. We were not, we were beginning to lose out to the competition by insisting on an exclusion that we knew the courts wouldn't enforce and that's not a position Chubb ever wants to be in with its insured.

It's a combination of the portfolio's getting a little bit bigger. We're not doing anything different so there are a few things that flow through the line items. So there's nothing I can point out that would suggest anything out of the ordinary. As we go forward and if interest rates continue to remain low, obviously, we'll have some issues on the reinvestment side. If you go to our 10-K, we have the maturity schedule for our investment portfolio. And what you'll see, if you look at that, is we've got about $13 billion of investments that are fixed maturity portfolio that mature over the next call it three years. About $3 billion of that comes in in 2011, about a little north of $4 billion in 2012 and 5 or plus billion in 2013. If you'll think about it, if rates stayed exactly where they are today and nothing else would've happened, the new money reinvestment rates compared to the maturing book yields, we're probably somewhere in the range of 125 to 150 basis points less. So you can do the math on what would happen to investment income over the next few years."

And then I think the following year, we've got another $225 million. Obviously, as we look at where interest rates are today, refinancing and putting on lower coupon debt makes a lot of sense. The problem is, when you have higher coupon debt sitting on your balance sheet, trying to get it off your balance sheet is not inexpensive and perhaps, two pieces of debt on the carrying double costs may not necessarily make sense either. So while we love to take advantage of the low interest rate environment that we see today, it's not that simple. We're comfortable with where our leverage is at where we sit today. Could we probably add a little bit more? Maybe. But we think we're fine where we are. And so we would love to be able to issue with these rates but we don't really have a use for the proceeds. In terms of the cost of capital, that's an interesting question. Clearly, the cost of debt is lower today given where interest rates are. And that accounts for less than 20% of our capital structure. I guess, I'm not yet convinced that the cost of equity though is meaningfully lower when we think about our overall cost of capital. There's continued uncertainty in the capital markets. There's concerns over the economy. There's unprecedented government stimulus, all of which have made what is a very difficult task in terms of calculating the cost of capital even more difficult. And while treasury rates are at historic low levels, betas are higher due to increased volatility and one could then argue that risk averse investors now require a higher market risk premium. So in the end, I'm not sure that the cost of equity capital for the industry is that much lower today than in the past. But we will see how markets progress."

We continued to produce significant growth in book value and a strong return on equity. In addition, aided largely by historically high retention rates, we had a modest increase in premiums in a very competitive market. And we continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and an active share repurchase program. 
Operating income per share for the third quarter was up 8% to $1.69. Annualized operating ROE for the quarter was 15%. The combined ratio was an excellent 86.2%. And the combined ratio, excluding caps, improved to 84.1% from 84.6%. For the first nine months, operating income per share was $4.22. x cats [catastrophes], our nine-month combined ratio was 83%, an improvement of 2.4 points over the same period last year. 
We produced an attractive annualized operating ROE in the first nine months of 12.7% even with a relatively high 7.1 points of cats. In addition, our investment portfolio continued to perform extremely well. Property and Casualty investment income after taxes for the third quarter of 2010 was $317 million, which was flat compared to last year in a lower yield environment. We also had net realized investment gains of $54 million before tax. At September 30, our net unrealized appreciation before tax stood at $2.6 billion, an increase of $700 million over June 30. These operating and investment results produced a GAAP book value per share of $52.41 at September 30. That's a 6% increase since June 30 and 11% increase since year end 2009 and a 15% increase compared to a year ago. Our capital position is excellent and Ricky will talk about the progress we have made in our share buyback program.
As you recall in July, we affirmed 2010 operating income per share guidance in the range of $5.15 to $5.55 per share. Based on third quarter results and a positive outlook for the fourth quarter, we are increasing guidance for 2010 to a range of $5.75 to $5.85 per share. I will elaborate on the revised guidance in my closing remarks. We continue to underwrite in a balanced fashion, seeking growth where we can get it but insisting on pricing terms and conditions that are designed to achieve an acceptable level of underwriting profitability. We continue to invest conservatively and we continue to actively manage our capital as evidenced by our share buybacks and dividends. This combination of underwriting discipline, conservative investing and active capital management is the formula that continues to define Chubb and produces superior results for shareholders. 
This afternoon, we also announced some important management changes at Chubb. As previously indicated, John Degnan will be retiring on December 31 after a distinguished 20-year career at Chubb, most recently as Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer. This is John's last conference call and he leaves big shoes to fill. We have a great team in place, but I know we will all miss John's insightful observations on the market place, claims and public affairs. The good news is that our quarterly conference calls will now be much shorter. Fortunately, John has agreed to continue at Chubb as a senior adviser to me on a part-time basis. Although all of the details have not been finalized, I expect that John will be involved in areas such as special situation claims in government affairs in which he has amassed much expertise. 
As we announced this afternoon, upon John's retirement at the end of the year, Paul Krump will become President of Commercial and Specialty Lines reporting to me. In addition, the Accident business will report directly to Paul. Dino Robusto will become President of Personal Lines and Claims and will continue to oversee IT, Communications, Corporate Development and Innovation. He will also report to me. 
Harold Morrison will continue as Chief Global Field Officer and additionally will become Chief Administrative Officer, overseeing human resources and administrative services. Howard will report to Paul and Dino. The executive committee will include Paul, Dino, Harold, Ricky Spiro and myself. Paul, Dino and Harold are all seasoned executives, having been with Chubb for more than 20 years each. They all earned their way up through the ranks and they've had a major role in Chubb's operational success over the past several years. While John will be tough to replace, I'm very confident that we have a terrific team in place that is well qualified to step in and lead Chubb to even greater success in the years ahead. And now, John Degnan will discuss our operating performance in more detail."

Since this is my last earnings call, I'm especially pleased that we had such a good quarter. Let me give you some of the key details about that. Chubb Personal Insurance net written premiums increased 4%, with about a 1% positive impact of currency fluctuation. CPI produced a combined ratio of 85.4% compared to 81.6% last year. But cats were 3.7 points in 2010 whereas the impact of catastrophes actually improved the combined ratio by about a point in the third quarter of 2009. So excluding cats, CPI's third quarter combined ratio was 81.7% this year, almost a point better than last year's 82.6%. Homeowners premiums were up 2% and the combined ratio was an 81%. Personal auto premiums increased 7%, driven by growth outside the U.S. and the combined ratio was 91.7%. In Other Personal lines, which include our Accident business, premiums were up 7% and the combined ratio was 94.2%.
At Chubb Commercial Insurance, premiums were flat or down about 1% x currency. The combined ratio was an 89.1% compared to last year's 90.5%. CCI's third quarter included cat losses of two points compared with 2.6 points in 2009. So excluding cats, CCI's third quarter combined ratio was 87.1% in 2010 and 87.9% in 2009.
In the U.S., CCI renewal rates were down 1% compared to flat in the second quarter. We have one of the highest quarterly U.S. retention rates we've had in many years, 87%, contributing to a new to lost business ratio of 1.2:1.
At Chubb Specialty Insurance, net written premiums were also flat and the combined ratio was 83.3% compared to 83.6% in the third quarter of 2009. Premiums for Professional Liability were down 1% and the combined ratio was 89.3% compared to the 90% in last year's third quarter. Average U.S. renewal rates for Professional Liability were down 2% compared to down 3% in the second quarter. Renewal retention in the U.S. was 88% and the ratio of new to lost business was 1.1:1. For surety, net written premiums were up 7%, driven largely by growth outside the U.S. and the combined ratio was 40%.
Overall, market conditions in the third quarter were largely unchanged from the first half. We continue to see competitive pressure on rates. But on the other hand, the repercussions of poor economic conditions continue to abate slightly, and we had some improvement in exposures and endorsement activity. Overall, the market environment continues to be very challenging.
Just one final word for me on credit crisis claims. Credit crisis losses continue to develop consistently with our prior observations about them. The number of new claims in this category continues to dwindle, and managing these losses now is a question of dealing with a known quantity of claims rather than speculating about the number we will actually receive. Nothing has changed our conviction that we are appropriately reserved for the accident years in which the claims have been made. 
In closing, I'll miss these earnings calls. Not so much the internal prep sessions. It's been a privilege to work for over 20 years for a company in whose values I believe and in whose successes, particularly over the last eight years, I have been able to participate. And finally, thanks to all of you for consistently keeping us on our toes over the years during these calls. With that, I'll turn it over to Ricky Spiro."

As you can probably tell by now, we are very happy with our financial performance in the third quarter. Looking first at our operating results, underwriting income was strong, amounting to $399 million in the quarter. Property and Casualty investment income after tax of $317 million in the quarter was flat compared to last year's third quarter in a challenging investment environment. Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $54 million or $0.11 per share after tax. Our net realized investment gains before tax included $18 million of gains on our alternative investments portfolio and $36 million of realized gains from the sale of securities. Unrealized appreciation before tax at September 30, 2010, was $2.6 billion, an increase of $700 million from the end of the second quarter. This substantial increase was due to the overall improvement in the global capital markets during the quarter, which led to strong performance across all of our asset classes.
Turning to our investment portfolio, the carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $43 billion as of September 30. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 3.9 years and the average credit rating is Aa2. We also continued to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At September 30, our holding company portfolio included $2.3 billion of investments, including $900 million of short-term investments.
Book value per share under GAAP at September 30, 2010, was $52.41 compared to $47.09 at year end 2009 and $45.43 a year ago. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, was $47.25 compared to $44.37 at 2009 year end and $42.31 a year ago.
As for reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the third quarter of 2010 on prior year reserves by SBU as follows: In CPI, we had about $40 million, CCI had about $90 million, CSI had about $65 million and Reinsurance Assumed had about $5 million, bringing the total favorable development to about $200 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the third quarter combined ratio of about seven points overall. For comparison, in the third quarter of 2009, we had about $205 million of favorable development for the company overall, including about $65 million in CPI, $30 million in CCI, $100 million in CSI and $10 million in Reinsurance Assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the third quarter of 2009 was about seven points, the same as in this year's third quarter. 
During the third quarter, our loss reserves increased by $7 million. Reserves in our Reinsurance Assumed business, which is now in runoff, declined by $35 million. Reserves in the Insurance business increased by $42 million during the quarter. The impact of currency fluctuation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in an increase in reserves of about $65 million. The impact of catastrophes reduced reserves by $120 million, reflecting payments on prior events and lower levels of catastrophes in the third quarter. 
Finally, I want to give you an update on capital management. During the third quarter, we repurchased 10.2 million shares. The aggregate cost of our repurchases was $555 million or an average of $54.63 per share. For the first nine months, our average repurchased cost per share was $51.94. As of September 30, 2010, there were 6.6 million shares remaining under our current repurchase authorization. And as we said during our last earnings call, our intention is to complete the repurchase of all of these remaining shares by the end of the year. We will review our 2011 capital management plans with our Board of Directors in December. And now, I'll turn it back to John Finnegan."

Here are the highlights: For the third quarter, we had operating income per share of $1.69 and an annualized operating ROE of 15%. For the first nine months, we had operating income per share of $4.22 and an annual operating ROE of 12.7%, even with seven points of cats. Our x cat combined ratio for the first nine months is an impressive 83%, which was 2.4 points better than the same period last year. Book value per share increased 6% in the three months ended September 30 and was up 11% since year end 2009 and 15% since September 30, 2009. We're maintaining a strong capital position and are well on track to completing our current share repurchase program by year end. 
With the board's initial buyback authorization in December 2005, Chubb has repurchased shares representing 37% of its market capitalization at that time. 
Let me conclude with a few comments on the revised guidance we announced in today's press release. Based on our excellent third quarter results and our outlook for a strong fourth quarter, we are updating our 2010 calendar year operating income per share guidance to a new range of $5.75 to $5.85 from the previous guidance range of $5.15 to $5.55. This revised guidance is based on operating income per share of $4.22 in the first nine months and our forecast of a range of $1.53 to $1.63 for the fourth quarter. This revised guidance is also based on an assumption of 322 million average diluted shares outstanding for the full year. 
Finally, our revised guidance assumes two percentage points of cats for the fourth quarter, which would result in 5.8 points of cats for the calendar year. This compares to the full year cat assumption of seven points included in our previous guidance, the reduction being due to lower than expected cats in the third quarter. The impact on operating income per share of each point of cats in the fourth quarter is about $0.05. That concludes our prepared remarks. I realize that they were shorter than the past, but that's a reflection of a quarter with excellent results and the fact that market conditions haven't changed much from three months ago. With that, we'll open it up to your questions. Operator?"

But I'm going to take a stab at it, then John will add anything he wants to talk about it. Let me talk a little bit first about our community bank book, Keith. We consider a community bank to be one that's no larger than $1 billion in total assets. We have D&O policies for about 10% of them. 94% of our book is private or closely held and only 6% are listed on the stock exchange. The average limits are $3.2 million for the private book and $5.9 million for the public book. Given the size of those banks, we're not particularly concerned whether they're private or public because we underwrite their financial condition in light of the fact that a failure of one of these institutions could trigger a regulatory claim against the directors and officers. We have not yet seen significant claims activity in the community bank arena to date. And we're not overly concerned about the developments that have been taking place over the last couple of weeks in so far as they pertain to community banks, although the lender liability portion of the coverage for community banks does in fact include errors and omissions, which could be implicated in a claim against the community bank for mishandling of foreclosure documentation like robo-signing. But our exposure in that connection to the community banks is not thought at the moment by us to be significant. On the other hand, our exposure to the 10 largest mortgage services that might be implicated in claims like that is also, from an E&O perspective, thanks to the underlying strategies we've had for the last couple of years, is minimal with the exception of one account, which has one $15 million exposure. And to date, we haven't seen a claim from that account. And then finally, it's a complicated set of issues here, and it is early to be projecting what the outcome is, but with respect to -- not to the foreclosure documentation problems but to the implication of the securitized loans, you should realize that purchasers have been putting back or attempting to put back defective mortgages for several years now and they're contractually able to do that if they can prove that there were defects. That by itself though does not cause a loss to either the purchaser or the originator depending on the quality of the underlying asset. And as far as we know, and certainly our experience has been that there has not been significant insurance related claims activity to that point. And then finally, while the securitization agreements can, as people have pointed out, contain recourse against the originator and others for fraud, there are a number of other intermediaries that would be potentially implicated, including investment banks and lawyers and accountants. And as such, this would be largely an E&O matter where we have little to no exposure to those entities due to the underwriting actions we've taken.

At least for now, those strengths are stable and they're offset to some degree in our experience by lower frequency, at least in some cases like auto. But other than the potential impact of healthcare reform, which is at best uncertain, we don't see current indications of the increased claim inflation in the future. And one thing to bear in mind with respect to Chubb is that some of the tort cost pressure, or the inflationary pressure on loss costs, principally relate to the potential for medical inflation. And because we're not big in lines of business that are affected by that, like comp or auto personal liability, they tend to have a more modest impact on us. But we watch them closely."

One is financial institutions D&O, which is falling off quicker than we anticipated, and there's also non-financial public D&O, which has taken a rather significant turn downwards. Now we have a strategy in place to deal with that. We, in May, introduced a new endorsement to our public D&O product, which has been extremely well received in the marketplace and has helped us, without an appreciable or significant increase in our risk or exposure, to either reduce prices less on renewal or on occasion to eke out a little bit of price for the increased exposure we're given.

We watch that closely,, but frankly, it's taken us a long time to build up the brand and franchise that we enjoy in this area and we think it's pretty unique in the business. Even Barron's pointed out not too long ago that Chubb is the leading choice of affluent Americans to protect their homes. We didn't do that overnight. We did it with inspecting 700,000 high net worth properties and we settled over a million claims or high net worth customers with unbelievably high satisfaction ratings. Our claims responses to catastrophes is always rated the best in the industry. And we have the best network of producers in the world selling high net worth Personal Lines. They understand the product. They understand the appetite of the underwriters. They understand the importance of bonding a relationship with the customer by producing a company that's going to be around to pay the claims and not just pay them but pay them empathetically and timely.

In the third quarter, we did see continued reasons for optimism in our renewal exposure figures. Optimism is modest but it's -- we had only a slight exposure decline in the third quarter this year and CCI lines have been there, so it's minus one. But if you look at the second quarter this year, it was minus 1.5. The first quarter was minus 2.3. And so we're on the right trend line here. As we said last quarter, we think the overall economy is sort of bouncing along the bottom. So we're going to see modest increases in exposure opportunities in CCI lines of business. Typically, we look for them in payrolls or workers comp, sales levels for general liability contracts, the level of shipments for marine policies and the retention amounts of the limits for Professional Liability contracts. We've also seen a flattening out in Personal Lines of the decrease we had seen in exposure over the last several quarters. There is a little less need on the part of our insureds to reduce their premiums. So fewer increases in deductibles and a bit more jewelry being bought and added on. And also builder's risk is, I should point out, is probably going to be the last line of business in which we would expect to see a significant exposure change, given what's going on in the economy."

Simply staying at the same level year-over-year or increasing modestly increases exposure in workers comp. So it may not be dramatic, but it does have an exposure growth impact. We perform pretty well in workers comp compared to the industry. AM Best pointed out recently that the industry combined ratio for comp had deteriorated from 104.6% in 2008 to 116% in 2010. Chubb's comparable numbers were 82.1% in 2008 and 92.1% in 2010. We generally performed 20 points better than the rest of the industry.

So in the third quarter this year, we're at 31.7%, 7.5 points from the third quarter of 2009. Obviously, to some extent, it reflects the impact of flat growth on our expenses, but also the effect of geographic and product mix on commissions. Our commissions are up some this quarter. We have more overseas growth than U.S. growth and our activities overseas have higher commissions. The product growth in businesses such as A&H, marine, valuable articles grew faster than the company averaged.

So as rates go up, well, obviously, our portfolio and everyone else's in the industry would be impacted by that from a valuation perspective of the portfolio.

We have always tended to be very selective in discipline. We were a very small player for a while and still not a huge player in the workers comp line overall, and a much smaller portion of our premium base comes from workers comp than is true in many of our competitors. We tend to shy away from the large manufacturing risks with high frequency and often high severity claims and tend to write in conjunction with our niche approach to GL and property, Specialty Lines of coverage and lawyers, and things of that nature where you just don't see the same frequency and severity. So for that reason, we haven't seen all that much change in the behavior of our claimants. We also, a couple of years initiated a very sophisticated predictive model for assessing our claims activities.  It used to take us six months to identify a claim, which had the potential for soft fraud, at which point we put our best adjustor on it. It now takes us 17 days and it's coming down to lower than 17 days as the predictive model proves more successful. So we're managing our loss costs much more effectively, particularly in lost time, but also in medical, than we have in the past. The 20 point difference has been a historical one between us and the industry since we began to grow the line. But principally, it has to do with a different underwriting appetite."

We were beginning to lose out to the competition by insisting on an exclusion that we knew the courts wouldn't enforce and that's not a position Chubb ever wants to be in with its insured.

About $3 billion of that comes in in 2011, about a little north of $4 billion in 2012 and 5 or plus billion in 2013.

And at this time, we do not see a need to change our target. When you look at our accident year returns, and you quoted certain numbers, I think our view is it's probably a little bit higher than the number you suggested. But we still think we're making attractive returns and with our x cat accident year combined ratio through nine months of 90.1% for the first nine months, which we think is going to be among the best of any of the other insurers, we like where we're sitting at the moment."

I mean, to be honest, some of your peers have made the argument that there's a low-cost to capital today and, therefore, that these lower returns are maybe more acceptable. And I guess I struggle with that answer because if you're all locked into your higher cost of debt because you can't refinance, and it's kind of a mythical thing, right? So do you have the ability to take advantage of these lower rates and either take up the debt to cap or prefund some of your coming maturities?"

And then I think the following year, we've got another $225 million. Obviously, as we look at where interest rates are today, refinancing and putting on lower coupon debt makes a lot of sense. The problem is, when you have higher coupon debt sitting on your balance sheet, trying to get it off your balance sheet is not inexpensive. And to have two pieces of debt and carrying double costs may not necessarily make sense either. So while we'd love to take advantage of the low interest rate environment that we see today, it's not that simple. We're comfortable with where our leverage is where we sit today. Could we probably add a little bit more? Maybe. But we think we're fine where we are. And so we would love to be able to issue at these rates, but we don't really have a use of the proceeds. In terms of the cost of capital, that's an interesting question. Clearly, the cost of debt is lower today given where interest rates are, and that accounts for less than 20% of our capital structure. I guess, I'm not yet convinced that the cost of equity though is meaningfully lower when we think about our overall cost of capital. There's continued uncertainty in the capital markets. There's concerns over the economy. There's unprecedented government stimulus, all of which have made what is a very difficult task in terms of calculating the cost of capital even more difficult. And while treasury rates are at historic low levels, betas are higher due to increased volatility, and one could then argue that risk averse investors now require a higher market risk premium. So in the end, I'm not sure that the cost of equity capital for the industry is that much lower today than in the past. But we will see how markets progress."

But I'm going to take a stab at it, then John will add anything he wants to talk about it. Let me talk a little bit first about our community bank book, Keith. We consider a community bank to be one that's no larger than $1 billion in total assets. We have D&O policies for about 10% of them. 94% of our book is private or closely held and only 6% are listed on the stock exchange. The average limits are $3.2 million for the private book and $5.9 million for the public book. Given the size of those banks, we're not particularly concerned whether they're private or public because we underwrite their financial condition in light of the fact that a failure of one of these institutions could trigger a regulatory claim against the directors and officers. We have not yet seen significant claims activity in the community bank arena to date. And we're not overly concerned about the developments that have been taking place over the last couple of weeks in so far as they pertain to community banks, although the lender liability portion of the coverage for community banks does in fact include errors and omissions, which could be implicated in a claim against the community bank for mishandling of foreclosure documentation like robo-signing. But our exposure in that connection to the community banks is not thought at the moment by us to be significant. On the other hand, our exposure to the 10 largest mortgage services that might be implicated in claims like that is also, from an E&O perspective, thanks to the underlying strategies we've had for the last couple of years, is minimal with the exception of one account, which has one $15 million exposure. And to date, we haven't seen a claim from that account. And then finally, it's a complicated set of issues here, and it is early to be projecting what the outcome is, but with respect to -- not to the foreclosure documentation problems but to the implication of the securitized loans, you should realize that purchasers have been putting back or attempting to put back defective mortgages for several years now and they're contractually able to do that if they can prove that there were defects. That by itself though does not cause a loss to either the purchaser or the originator depending on the quality of the underlying asset. And as far as we know, and certainly our experience has been that there has not been significant insurance related claims activity to that point. And then finally, while the securitization agreements can, as people have pointed out, contain recourse against the originator and others for fraud, there are a number of other intermediaries that would be potentially implicated, including investment banks and lawyers and accountants. And as such, this would be largely an E&O matter where we have little to no exposure to those entities due to the underwriting actions we've taken. And I know that was a long answer, but you invited me to give you a...

At least for now, those strengths are stable and they're offset to some degree in our experience by lower frequency, at least in some cases like auto. But other than the potential impact of healthcare reform, which is at best uncertain, we don't see current indications of the increased claim inflation in the future. And one thing to bear in mind with respect to Chubb is that some of the tort cost pressure, or the inflationary pressure on loss costs, principally relate to the potential for medical inflation. And because we're not big in lines of business that are affected by that, like comp or auto personal liability, they tend to have a more modest impact on us. But we watch them closely.

In the third quarter, we did see continued reasons for optimism in our renewal exposure figures. Optimism is modest but it's -- we had only a slight exposure decline in the third quarter this year and CCI lines have been there, so it's minus one. But if you look at the second quarter this year, it was minus 1.5. The first quarter was minus 2.3. And so we're on the right trend line here. As we said last quarter, we think the overall economy is sort of bouncing along the bottom. So we're going to see modest increases in exposure opportunities in CCI lines of business. Typically, we look for them in payrolls or workers comp, sales levels for general liability contracts, the level of shipments for marine policies and the retention amounts of the limits for Professional Liability contracts. We've also seen a flattening out in Personal Lines of the decrease we had seen in exposure over the last several quarters. There is a little less need on the part of our insureds to reduce their premiums. So fewer increases in deductibles and a bit more jewelry being bought and added on. And also builder's risk is, I should point out, is probably going to be the last line of business in which we would expect to see a significant exposure change, given what's going on in the economy.

We perform pretty well in workers comp compared to the industry. AM Best pointed out recently that the industry combined ratio for comp had deteriorated from 104.6% in 2008 to 116% in 2010. Chubb's comparable numbers were 82.1% in 2008 and 92.1% in 2010. We generally performed 20 points better than the rest of the industry.

Quarterly expenses aren't linear. They tend to move around a little bit. For example, if you go back to the third quarter of last year, we expect about a point jump from the second quarter and then the fourth quarter went down a point. So in the third quarter this year, we're at 31.7%, 7.5 points from the third quarter of 2009. Obviously, to some extent, it reflects the impact of flat growth on our expenses, but also the effect of geographic and product mix on commissions. Our commissions are up some this quarter. We have more overseas growth than U.S. growth and our activities overseas have higher commissions. The product growth in businesses such as A&H, marine, valuable articles grew faster than the company averaged. Some of these lines have higher commissions than places like workers compensation, for example, which is a low commission base and which we didn't grow. So it's largely a mix issue both geographic and product mix.

In a rising interest rate environment, I would not expect us to dramatically change our investment strategy. We tend to be intermediate maturity investors in both the taxable and tax-exempt marketplace. The way we've structured our portfolio is it has laddered maturities so we have cash flows and maturities that we can reinvest. So as rates go up, well, obviously, our portfolio and everyone else's in the industry would be impacted by that from a valuation perspective of the portfolio. We'd be reinvesting at higher interest rates. So the short answer is, we like our strategy.

We have always tended to be very selective in discipline. We were a very small player for a while and still not a huge player in the workers comp line overall, and a much smaller portion of our premium base comes from workers comp than is true in many of our competitors. We tend to shy away from the large manufacturing risks with high frequency and often high severity claims and tend to write in conjunction with our niche approach to GL and property, Specialty Lines of coverage and lawyers, and things of that nature where you just don't see the same frequency and severity. So for that reason, we haven't seen all that much change in the behavior of our claimants. We also, a couple of years initiated a very sophisticated predictive model for assessing our claims activities.  It used to take us six months to identify a claim, which had the potential for soft fraud, at which point we put our best adjustor on it. It now takes us 17 days and it's coming down to lower than 17 days as the predictive model proves more successful. So we're managing our loss costs much more effectively, particularly in lost time, but also in medical, than we have in the past. The 20 point difference has been a historical one between us and the industry since we began to grow the line. But principally, it has to do with a different underwriting appetite.

We were beginning to lose out to the competition by insisting on an exclusion that we knew the courts wouldn't enforce and that's not a position Chubb ever wants to be in with its insured. So we gave that up.

So there's nothing I can point out that would suggest anything out of the ordinary. As we go forward and if interest rates continue to remain low, obviously, we'll have some issues on the reinvestment side. If you go to our 10-K, we have the maturity schedule for our investment portfolio. And what you'll see, if you look at that, is we've got about $13 billion of investments in our fixed maturity portfolio that mature over the next call it three years. About $3 billion of that comes in in 2011, about a little north of $4 billion in 2012 and 5 or plus billion in 2013. If you'll think about it, if rates stayed exactly where they are today and nothing else were to happened, the new money reinvestment rates compared to the maturing book yields, we're probably somewhere in the range of 125 to 150 basis points less.

That's going to imply that we would expect to outperform that target in hard markets, possibly underperform it a little bit in soft markets, but our historical results have tracked very well with this objective throughout past cycles. And at this time, we do not see a need to change our target. When you look at our accident year returns, and you quoted certain numbers, I think our view is it's probably a little bit higher than the number you suggested. But we still think we're making attractive returns and with our x cat accident year combined ratio through nine months of 90.1% for the first nine months, which we think is going to be among the best of any of the other insurers, we like where we're sitting at the moment.

And I guess I struggle with that answer because if you're all locked into your higher cost of debt because you can't refinance, and it's kind of a mythical thing, right? So do you have the ability to take advantage of these lower rates and either take up the debt to cap or prefund some of your coming maturities?

And then I think the following year, we've got another $225 million. Obviously, as we look at where interest rates are today, refinancing and putting on lower coupon debt makes a lot of sense. The problem is, when you have higher coupon debt sitting on your balance sheet, trying to get it off your balance sheet is not inexpensive. And to have two pieces of debt and carrying double costs may not necessarily make sense either. So while we'd love to take advantage of the low interest rate environment that we see today, it's not that simple. We're comfortable with where our leverage is where we sit today. Could we probably add a little bit more? Maybe. But we think we're fine where we are. And so we would love to be able to issue at these rates, but we don't really have a use of the proceeds. In terms of the cost of capital, that's an interesting question. Clearly, the cost of debt is lower today given where interest rates are, and that accounts for less than 20% of our capital structure. I guess, I'm not yet convinced that the cost of equity though is meaningfully lower when we think about our overall cost of capital. There's continued uncertainty in the capital markets. There's concerns over the economy. There's unprecedented government stimulus, all of which have made what is a very difficult task in terms of calculating the cost of capital even more difficult. And while treasury rates are at historic low levels, betas are higher due to increased volatility, and one could then argue that risk averse investors now require a higher market risk premium. So in the end, I'm not sure that the cost of equity capital for the industry is that much lower today than in the past. But we will see how markets progress.

It is possible that actual results might differ from estimates and forecasts that Chubb's management team might make today. Additional information regarding factors that could cause such differences appears in Chubb's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the prepared remarks and responses to questions during today's presentation of Chubb's third quarter 2010 financial results, Chubb's management may refer to financial measures that are not derived from the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and related information is provided in the press release and the financial supplement for the third quarter 2010, which are available on the Investors section of Chubb's website at www.chubb.com.

We continued to produce significant growth in book value and a strong return on equity. In addition, aided largely by historically high retention rates, we had a modest increase in premiums in a very competitive market. And we continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and an active share repurchase program. 
Operating income per share for the third quarter was up 8% to $1.69. Annualized operating ROE for the quarter was 15%. The combined ratio was an excellent 86.2%. And the combined ratio, excluding caps, improved to 84.1% from 84.6%. For the first nine months, operating income per share was $4.22. x cats [catastrophes], our nine-month combined ratio was 83%, an improvement of 2.4 points over the same period last year. 
We produced an attractive annualized operating ROE in the first nine months of 12.7% even with a relatively high 7.1 points of cats. In addition, our investment portfolio continued to perform extremely well. Property and Casualty investment income after taxes for the third quarter of 2010 was $317 million, which was flat compared to last year in a lower yield environment. We also had net realized investment gains of $54 million before tax. At September 30, our net unrealized appreciation before tax stood at $2.6 billion, an increase of $700 million over June 30. These operating and investment results produced a GAAP book value per share of $52.41 at September 30. That's a 6% increase since June 30 and 11% increase since year end 2009 and a 15% increase compared to a year ago. Our capital position is excellent and Ricky will talk about the progress we have made in our share buyback program.
As you recall in July, we affirmed 2010 operating income per share guidance in the range of $5.15 to $5.55 per share. Based on third quarter results and a positive outlook for the fourth quarter, we are increasing guidance for 2010 to a range of $5.75 to $5.85 per share. I will elaborate on the revised guidance in my closing remarks. We continue to underwrite in a balanced fashion, seeking growth where we can get it but insisting on pricing terms and conditions that are designed to achieve an acceptable level of underwriting profitability. We continue to invest conservatively and we continue to actively manage our capital as evidenced by our share buybacks and dividends. This combination of underwriting discipline, conservative investing and active capital management is the formula that continues to define Chubb and produces superior results for shareholders. 
This afternoon, we also announced some important management changes at Chubb. As previously indicated, John Degnan will be retiring on December 31 after a distinguished 20-year career at Chubb, most recently as Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer. This is John's last conference call and he leaves big shoes to fill. We have a great team in place, but I know we will all miss John's insightful observations on the market place, claims and public affairs. The good news is that our quarterly conference calls will now be much shorter. Fortunately, John has agreed to continue at Chubb as a senior adviser to me on a part-time basis. Although all of the details have not been finalized, I expect that John will be involved in areas such as special situation claims in government affairs in which he has amassed much expertise. 
As we announced this afternoon, upon John's retirement at the end of the year, Paul Krump will become President of Commercial and Specialty Lines reporting to me. In addition, the Accident business will report directly to Paul. Dino Robusto will become President of Personal Lines and Claims and will continue to oversee IT, Communications, Corporate Development and Innovation. He will also report to me. 
Harold Morrison will continue as Chief Global Field Officer and additionally will become Chief Administrative Officer, overseeing human resources and administrative services. Howard will report to Paul and Dino. The executive committee will include Paul, Dino, Harold, Ricky Spiro and myself. Paul, Dino and Harold are all seasoned executives, having been with Chubb for more than 20 years each. They all earned their way up through the ranks and they've had a major role in Chubb's operational success over the past several years. While John will be tough to replace, I'm very confident that we have a terrific team in place that is well qualified to step in and lead Chubb to even greater success in the years ahead. And now, John Degnan will discuss our operating performance in more detail.

Since this is my last earnings call, I'm especially pleased that we had such a good quarter. Let me give you some of the key details about that. Chubb Personal Insurance net written premiums increased 4%, with about a 1% positive impact of currency fluctuation. CPI produced a combined ratio of 85.4% compared to 81.6% last year. But cats were 3.7 points in 2010 whereas the impact of catastrophes actually improved the combined ratio by about a point in the third quarter of 2009. So excluding cats, CPI's third quarter combined ratio was 81.7% this year, almost a point better than last year's 82.6%. Homeowners premiums were up 2% and the combined ratio was an 81%. Personal auto premiums increased 7%, driven by growth outside the U.S. and the combined ratio was 91.7%. In Other Personal lines, which include our Accident business, premiums were up 7% and the combined ratio was 94.2%.
At Chubb Commercial Insurance, premiums were flat or down about 1% x currency. The combined ratio was an 89.1% compared to last year's 90.5%. CCI's third quarter included cat losses of two points compared with 2.6 points in 2009. So excluding cats, CCI's third quarter combined ratio was 87.1% in 2010 and 87.9% in 2009.
In the U.S., CCI renewal rates were down 1% compared to flat in the second quarter. We have one of the highest quarterly U.S. retention rates we've had in many years, 87%, contributing to a new to lost business ratio of 1.2:1.
At Chubb Specialty Insurance, net written premiums were also flat and the combined ratio was 83.3% compared to 83.6% in the third quarter of 2009. Premiums for Professional Liability were down 1% and the combined ratio was 89.3% compared to the 90% in last year's third quarter. Average U.S. renewal rates for Professional Liability were down 2% compared to down 3% in the second quarter. Renewal retention in the U.S. was 88% and the ratio of new to lost business was 1.1:1. For surety, net written premiums were up 7%, driven largely by growth outside the U.S. and the combined ratio was 40%.
Overall, market conditions in the third quarter were largely unchanged from the first half. We continue to see competitive pressure on rates. But on the other hand, the repercussions of poor economic conditions continue to abate slightly, and we had some improvement in exposures and endorsement activity. Overall, the market environment continues to be very challenging.
Just one final word for me on credit crisis claims. Credit crisis losses continue to develop consistently with our prior observations about them. The number of new claims in this category continues to dwindle, and managing these losses now is a question of dealing with a known quantity of claims rather than speculating about the number we will actually receive. Nothing has changed our conviction that we are appropriately reserved for the accident years in which the claims have been made. 
In closing, I'll miss these earnings calls. Not so much the internal prep sessions. It's been a privilege to work for over 20 years for a company in whose values I believe and in whose successes, particularly over the last eight years, I have been able to participate. And finally, thanks to all of you for consistently keeping us on our toes over the years during these calls. With that, I'll turn it over to Ricky Spiro.

As you can probably tell by now, we are very happy with our financial performance in the third quarter. Looking first at our operating results, underwriting income was strong, amounting to $399 million in the quarter. Property and Casualty investment income after tax of $317 million in the quarter was flat compared to last year's third quarter in a challenging investment environment. Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $54 million or $0.11 per share after tax. Our net realized investment gains before tax included $18 million of gains on our alternative investments portfolio and $36 million of realized gains from the sale of securities. Unrealized appreciation before tax at September 30, 2010, was $2.6 billion, an increase of $700 million from the end of the second quarter. This substantial increase was due to the overall improvement in the global capital markets during the quarter, which led to strong performance across all of our asset classes.
Turning to our investment portfolio, the carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $43 billion as of September 30. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 3.9 years and the average credit rating is Aa2. We also continued to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At September 30, our holding company portfolio included $2.3 billion of investments, including $900 million of short-term investments.
Book value per share under GAAP at September 30, 2010, was $52.41 compared to $47.09 at year end 2009 and $45.43 a year ago. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, was $47.25 compared to $44.37 at 2009 year end and $42.31 a year ago.
As for reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the third quarter of 2010 on prior year reserves by SBU as follows: In CPI, we had about $40 million, CCI had about $90 million, CSI had about $65 million and Reinsurance Assumed had about $5 million, bringing the total favorable development to about $200 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the third quarter combined ratio of about seven points overall. For comparison, in the third quarter of 2009, we had about $205 million of favorable development for the company overall, including about $65 million in CPI, $30 million in CCI, $100 million in CSI and $10 million in Reinsurance Assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the third quarter of 2009 was about seven points, the same as in this year's third quarter. 
During the third quarter, our loss reserves increased by $7 million. Reserves in our Reinsurance Assumed business, which is now in runoff, declined by $35 million. Reserves in the Insurance business increased by $42 million during the quarter. The impact of currency fluctuation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in an increase in reserves of about $65 million. The impact of catastrophes reduced reserves by $120 million, reflecting payments on prior events and lower levels of catastrophes in the third quarter. 
Finally, I want to give you an update on capital management. During the third quarter, we repurchased 10.2 million shares. The aggregate cost of our repurchases was $555 million or an average of $54.63 per share. For the first nine months, our average repurchased cost per share was $51.94. As of September 30, 2010, there were 6.6 million shares remaining under our current repurchase authorization. And as we said during our last earnings call, our intention is to complete the repurchase of all of these remaining shares by the end of the year. We will review our 2011 capital management plans with our Board of Directors in December. And now, I'll turn it back to John Finnegan.

Our x cat combined ratio for the first nine months is an impressive 83%, which was 2.4 points better than the same period last year.

We're maintaining a strong capital position and are well on track to completing our current share repurchase program by year end. 
With the board's initial buyback authorization in December 2005, Chubb has repurchased shares representing 37% of its market capitalization at that time. 
Let me conclude with a few comments on the revised guidance we announced in today's press release. Based on our excellent third quarter results and our outlook for a strong fourth quarter, we are updating our 2010 calendar year operating income per share guidance to a new range of $5.75 to $5.85 from the previous guidance range of $5.15 to $5.55. This revised guidance is based on operating income per share of $4.22 in the first nine months and our forecast of a range of $1.53 to $1.63 for the fourth quarter. This revised guidance is also based on an assumption of 322 million average diluted shares outstanding for the full year. 
Finally, our revised guidance assumes two percentage points of cats for the fourth quarter, which would result in 5.8 points of cats for the calendar year. This compares to the full year cat assumption of seven points included in our previous guidance, the reduction being due to lower than expected cats in the third quarter. The impact on operating income per share of each point of cats in the fourth quarter is about $0.05. That concludes our prepared remarks. I realize that they were shorter than the past, but that's a reflection of a quarter with excellent results and the fact that market conditions haven't changed much from three months ago. With that, we'll open it up to your questions. Operator?

 Operating income per share for the third quarter was up 8% to $1.69.  Annualized operating ROE for the quarter was 15%. The combined ratio was  an excellent 86.2%. And the combined ratio, excluding caps, improved to  84.1% from 84.6%. For the first nine months, operating income per share  was $4.22. x cats [catastrophes], our nine-month combined ratio was  83%, an improvement of 2.4 points over the same period last year.
 We produced an attractive annualized operating ROE in the first nine  months of 12.7% even with a relatively high 7.1 points of cats. In  addition, our investment portfolio continued to perform extremely well.  Property and Casualty investment income after taxes for the third  quarter of 2010 was $317 million, which was flat compared to last year  in a lower yield environment. We also had net realized investment gains  of $54 million before tax. At September 30, our net unrealized  appreciation before tax stood at $2.6 billion, an increase of $700  million over June 30. These operating and investment results produced a  GAAP book value per share of $52.41 at September 30. That's a 6%  increase since June 30 and 11% increase since year end 2009 and a 15%  increase compared to a year ago. Our capital position is excellent and  Ricky will talk about the progress we have made in our share buyback  program.
 As you recall in July, we affirmed 2010 operating income per share  guidance in the range of $5.15 to $5.55 per share. Based on third  quarter results and a positive outlook for the fourth quarter, we are  increasing guidance for 2010 to a range of $5.75 to $5.85 per share. I  will elaborate on the revised guidance in my closing remarks. We  continue to underwrite in a balanced fashion, seeking growth where we  can get it but insisting on pricing terms and conditions that are  designed to achieve an acceptable level of underwriting profitability.  We continue to invest conservatively and we continue to actively manage  our capital as evidenced by our share buybacks and dividends. This  combination of underwriting discipline, conservative investing and  active capital management is the formula that continues to define Chubb  and produces superior results for shareholders.
 This afternoon, we also announced some important management changes  at Chubb. As previously indicated, John Degnan will be retiring on  December 31 after a distinguished 20-year career at Chubb, most recently  as Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer. This is John's last  conference call and he leaves big shoes to fill. We have a great team in  place, but I know we will all miss John's insightful observations on  the market place, claims and public affairs. The good news is that our  quarterly conference calls will now be much shorter. Fortunately, John  has agreed to continue at Chubb as a senior adviser to me on a part-time  basis. Although all of the details have not been finalized, I expect  that John will be involved in areas such as special situation claims in  government affairs in which he has amassed much expertise.
 As we announced this afternoon, upon John's retirement at the end of  the year, Paul Krump will become President of Commercial and Specialty  Lines reporting to me. In addition, the Accident business will report  directly to Paul. Dino Robusto will become President of Personal Lines  and Claims and will continue to oversee IT, Communications, Corporate  Development and Innovation. He will also report to me.
 Harold Morrison will continue as Chief Global Field Officer and  additionally will become Chief Administrative Officer, overseeing human  resources and administrative services. Howard will report to Paul and  Dino. The executive committee will include Paul, Dino, Harold, Ricky  Spiro and myself. Paul, Dino and Harold are all seasoned executives,  having been with Chubb for more than 20 years each. They all earned  their way up through the ranks and they've had a major role in Chubb's  operational success over the past several years. While John will be  tough to replace, I'm very confident that we have a terrific team in  place that is well qualified to step in and lead Chubb to even greater  success in the years ahead. And now, John Degnan will discuss our  operating performance in more detail.

Since this is my last earnings call, I'm especially  pleased that we had such a good quarter. Let me give you some of the key  details about that. Chubb Personal Insurance net written premiums  increased 4%, with about a 1% positive impact of currency fluctuation.  CPI produced a combined ratio of 85.4% compared to 81.6% last year. But  cats were 3.7 points in 2010 whereas the impact of catastrophes actually  improved the combined ratio by about a point in the third quarter of  2009. So excluding cats, CPI's third quarter combined ratio was 81.7%  this year, almost a point better than last year's 82.6%. Homeowners  premiums were up 2% and the combined ratio was an 81%. Personal auto  premiums increased 7%, driven by growth outside the U.S. and the  combined ratio was 91.7%. In Other Personal lines, which include our  Accident business, premiums were up 7% and the combined ratio was 94.2%.
 At Chubb Commercial Insurance, premiums were flat or down about 1% x  currency. The combined ratio was an 89.1% compared to last year's 90.5%.  CCI's third quarter included cat losses of two points compared with 2.6  points in 2009. So excluding cats, CCI's third quarter combined ratio  was 87.1% in 2010 and 87.9% in 2009.
 In the U.S., CCI renewal rates were down 1% compared to flat in the  second quarter. We have one of the highest quarterly U.S. retention  rates we've had in many years, 87%, contributing to a new to lost  business ratio of 1.2:1.
 At Chubb Specialty Insurance, net written premiums were also flat and  the combined ratio was 83.3% compared to 83.6% in the third quarter of  2009. Premiums for Professional Liability were down 1% and the combined  ratio was 89.3% compared to the 90% in last year's third quarter.  Average U.S. renewal rates for Professional Liability were down 2%  compared to down 3% in the second quarter. Renewal retention in the U.S.  was 88% and the ratio of new to lost business was 1.1:1. For surety,  net written premiums were up 7%, driven largely by growth outside the  U.S. and the combined ratio was 40%.
 Overall, market conditions in the third quarter were largely  unchanged from the first half. We continue to see competitive pressure  on rates. But on the other hand, the repercussions of poor economic  conditions continue to abate slightly, and we had some improvement in  exposures and endorsement activity. Overall, the market environment  continues to be very challenging.
 Just one final word for me on credit crisis claims. Credit crisis  losses continue to develop consistently with our prior observations  about them. The number of new claims in this category continues to  dwindle, and managing these losses now is a question of dealing with a  known quantity of claims rather than speculating about the number we  will actually receive. Nothing has changed our conviction that we are  appropriately reserved for the accident years in which the claims have  been made.
 In closing, I'll miss these earnings calls. Not so much the internal  prep sessions. It's been a privilege to work for over 20 years for a  company in whose values I believe and in whose successes, particularly  over the last eight years, I have been able to participate. And finally,  thanks to all of you for consistently keeping us on our toes over the  years during these calls. With that, I'll turn it over to Ricky Spiro.

As you can probably tell by now, we are very happy with  our financial performance in the third quarter. Looking first at our  operating results, underwriting income was strong, amounting to $399  million in the quarter. Property and Casual",642," Thanks, John. As you can probably tell by now, we are very happy with  our financial performance in the third quarter. Looking first at our  operating results, underwriting income was strong, amounting to $399  million in the quarter. Property and Casualty investment income after  tax of $317 million in the quarter was flat compared to last year's  third quarter in a challenging investment environment. Net income was  higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized  investment gains before tax of $54 million or $0.11 per share after tax.  Our net realized investment gains before tax included $18 million of  gains on our alternative investments portfolio and $36 million of  realized gains from the sale of securities. Unrealized appreciation  before tax at September 30, 2010, was $2.6 billion, an increase of $700  million from the end of the second quarter. This substantial increase  was due to the overall improvement in the global capital markets during  the quarter, which led to strong performance across all of our asset  classes.
 Turning to our investment portfolio, the carrying value of our  consolidated investment portfolio was $43 billion as of September 30.  The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the  prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is  3.9 years and the average credit rating is Aa2. We also continued to  have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At September 30, our  holding company portfolio included $2.3 billion of investments,  including $900 million of short-term investments.
 Book value per share under GAAP at September 30, 2010, was $52.41  compared to $47.09 at year end 2009 and $45.43 a year ago. Adjusted book  value per share, which we calculate with available-for-sale fixed  maturities at amortized cost, was $47.25 compared to $44.37 at 2009 year  end and $42.31 a year ago.
 As for reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the  third quarter of 2010 on prior year reserves by SBU as follows: In CPI,  we had about $40 million, CCI had about $90 million, CSI had about $65  million and Reinsurance Assumed had about $5 million, bringing the total  favorable development to about $200 million for the quarter. This  represents a favorable impact on the third quarter combined ratio of  about seven points overall. For comparison, in the third quarter of  2009, we had about $205 million of favorable development for the company  overall, including about $65 million in CPI, $30 million in CCI, $100  million in CSI and $10 million in Reinsurance Assumed. The favorable  impact on the combined ratio in the third quarter of 2009 was about  seven points, the same as in this year's third quarter.
 During the third quarter, our loss reserves increased by $7 million.  Reserves in our Reinsurance Assumed business, which is now in runoff,  declined by $35 million. Reserves in the Insurance business increased by  $42 million during the quarter. The impact of currency fluctuation on  loss reserves during the quarter resulted in an increase in reserves of  about $65 million. The impact of catastrophes reduced reserves by $120  million, reflecting payments on prior events and lower levels of  catastrophes in the third quarter.
 Finally, I want to give you an update on capital management. During  the third quarter, we repurchased 10.2 million shares. The aggregate  cost of our repurchases was $555 million or an average of $54.63 per  share. For the first nine months, our average repurchased cost per share  was $51.94. As of September 30, 2010, there were 6.6 million shares  remaining under our current repurchase authorization. And as we said  during our last earnings call, our intention is to complete the  repurchase of all of these remaining shares by the end of the year. We  will review our 2011 capital management plans with our Board of  Directors in December. And now, I'll turn it back to John Finnegan.

Here are the highlights: For the third  quarter, we had operating income per share of $1.69 and an annualized  operating ROE of 15%. For the first nine months, we had operating income  per share of $4.22 and an annual operating ROE of 12.7%, even with  seven points of cats. Our x cat combined ratio for the first nine months  is an impressive 83%, which was 2.4 points better than the same period  last year. Book value per share increased 6% in the three months ended  September 30 and was up 11% since year end 2009 and 15% since September  30, 2009. We're maintaining a strong capital position and are well on  track to completing our current share repurchase program by year end.
 With the board's initial buyback authorization in December 2005,  Chubb has repurchased shares representing 37% of its market  capitalization at that time.
 Let me conclude with a few comments on the revised guidance we  announced in today's press release. Based on our excellent third quarter  results and our outlook for a strong fourth quarter, we are updating  our 2010 calendar year operating income per share guidance to a new  range of $5.75 to $5.85 from the previous guidance range of $5.15 to  $5.55. This revised guidance is based on operating income per share of  $4.22 in the first nine months and our forecast of a range of $1.53 to  $1.63 for the fourth quarter. This revised guidance is also based on an  assumption of 322 million average diluted shares outstanding for the  full year.
 Finally, our revised guidance assumes two percentage points of cats  for the fourth quarter, which would result in 5.8 points of cats for the  calendar year. This compares to the full year cat assumption of seven  points included in our previous guidance, the reduction being due to  lower than expected cats in the third quarter. The impact on operating  income per share of each point of cats in the fourth quarter is about  $0.05. That concludes our prepared remarks. I realize that they were  shorter than the past, but that's a reflection of a quarter with  excellent results and the fact that market conditions haven't changed  much from three months ago. With that, we'll open it up to your  questions. Operator?

I know your question was directed to John Finnegan. But I'm going to take a stab at it, then John will add anything he wants to talk about it.

But I'm going to take a stab at it, then John will add anything he wants to talk about it. Let me talk a little bit first about our community bank book, Keith. We consider a community bank to be one that's no larger than $1 billion in total assets. We have D&O policies for about 10% of them. 94% of our book is private or closely held and only 6% are listed on the stock exchange. The average limits are $3.2 million for the private book and $5.9 million for the public book. Given the size of those banks, we're not particularly concerned whether they're private or public because we underwrite their financial condition in light of the fact that a failure of one of these institutions could trigger a regulatory claim against the directors and officers. We have not yet seen significant claims activity in the community bank arena to date. And we're not overly concerned about the developments that have been taking place over the last couple of weeks in so far as they pertain to community banks, although the lender liability portion of the coverage for community banks does in fact include errors and omissions, which could be implicated in a claim against the community bank for mishandling of foreclosure documentation like robo-signing. But our exposure in that connection to the community banks is not thought at the moment by us to be significant. On the other hand, our exposure to the 10 largest mortgage services that might be implicated in claims like that is also, from an E&O perspective, thanks to the underlying strategies we've had for the last couple of years, is minimal with the exception of one account, which has one $15 million exposure. And to date, we haven't seen a claim from that account. And then finally, it's a complicated set of issues here, and it is early to be projecting what the outcome is, but with respect to -- not to the foreclosure documentation problems but to the implication of the securitized loans, you should realize that purchasers have been putting back or attempting to put back defective mortgages for several years now and they're contractually able to do that if they can prove that there were defects. That by itself though does not cause a loss to either the purchaser or the originator depending on the quality of the underlying asset. And as far as we know, and certainly our experience has been that there has not been significant insurance related claims activity to that point. And then finally, while the securitization agreements can, as people have pointed out, contain recourse against the originator and others for fraud, there are a number of other intermediaries that would be potentially implicated, including investment banks and lawyers and accountants. And as such, this would be largely an E&O matter where we have little to no exposure to those entities due to the underwriting actions we've taken. And I know that was a long answer, but you invited me to give you a...

We're not yet seeing any alarming trends. But typically, we'd expect loss cost particularly in casualty classes to increase in the mid-single digits annually, driven principally by medical and judicial factors. At least for now, those strengths are stable and they're offset to some degree in our experience by lower frequency, at least in some cases like auto. But other than the potential impact of healthcare reform, which is at best uncertain, we don't see current indications of the increased claim inflation in the future. And one thing to bear in mind with respect to Chubb is that some of the tort cost pressure, or the inflationary pressure on loss costs, principally relate to the potential for medical inflation. And because we're not big in lines of business that are affected by that, like comp or auto personal liability, they tend to have a more modest impact on us. But we watch them closely.

Now we have a strategy in place to deal with that. We, in May, introduced a new endorsement to our public D&O product, which has been extremely well received in the marketplace and has helped us, without an appreciable or significant increase in our risk or exposure, to either reduce prices less on renewal or on occasion to eke out a little bit of price for the increased exposure we're given.

Virtually all of us, and certainly, we are cat constrained in some parts of the country and can't provide a total insurance solution for the demand there. Southeast Florida is the best example of that, but there are others as well. So there's room for competition in this market. There generally, in the past have been, last few years, three principal players Fireman's Fund, Chubb and AIG. Ace has come into the market more recently with high expectations and investing some money, and there are other carriers that are moving into the high net worth's Personal Lines area. We watch that closely,, but frankly, it's taken us a long time to build up the brand and franchise that we enjoy in this area and we think it's pretty unique in the business. Even Barron's pointed out not too long ago that Chubb is the leading choice of affluent Americans to protect their homes. We didn't do that overnight. We did it with inspecting 700,000 high net worth properties and we settled over a million claims or high net worth customers with unbelievably high satisfaction ratings. Our claims responses to catastrophes is always rated the best in the industry. And we have the best network of producers in the world selling high net worth Personal Lines. They understand the product. They understand the appetite of the underwriters. They understand the importance of bonding a relationship with the customer by producing a company that's going to be around to pay the claims and not just pay them but pay them empathetically and timely. So as I said in the last call, we're not -- we're fierce competitors. We'll do what we have to do to preserve our position in the marketplace and to grow it, but we're not afraid of new entrants.

In the third quarter, we did see continued reasons for optimism in our renewal exposure figures. Optimism is modest but it's -- we had only a slight exposure decline in the third quarter this year and CCI lines have been there, so it's minus one. But if you look at the second quarter this year, it was minus 1.5. The first quarter was minus 2.3. And so we're on the right trend line here. As we said last quarter, we think the overall economy is sort of bouncing along the bottom. So we're going to see modest increases in exposure opportunities in CCI lines of business. Typically, we look for them in payrolls or workers comp, sales levels for general liability contracts, the level of shipments for marine policies and the retention amounts of the limits for Professional Liability contracts. We've also seen a flattening out in Personal Lines of the decrease we had seen in exposure over the last several quarters. There is a little less need on the part of our insureds to reduce their premiums. So fewer increases in deductibles and a bit more jewelry being bought and added on. And also builder's risk is, I should point out, is probably going to be the last line of business in which we would expect to see a significant exposure change, given what's going on in the economy.

Simply staying at the same level year-over-year or increasing modestly increases exposure in workers comp. So it may not be dramatic, but it does have an exposure growth impact. We perform pretty well in workers comp compared to the industry. AM Best pointed out recently that the industry combined ratio for comp had deteriorated from 104.6% in 2008 to 116% in 2010. Chubb's comparable numbers were 82.1% in 2008 and 92.1% in 2010. We generally performed 20 points better than the rest of the industry. So if exposure improves here, I hope we're going to be disproportionately advantaged.

Quarterly expenses aren't linear. They tend to move around a little bit. For example, if you go back to the third quarter of last year, we expect about a point jump from the second quarter and then the fourth quarter went down a point. So in the third quarter this year, we're at 31.7%, 7.5 points from the third quarter of 2009. Obviously, to some extent, it reflects the impact of flat growth on our expenses, but also the effect of geographic and product mix on commissions. Our commissions are up some this quarter. We have more overseas growth than U.S. growth and our activities overseas have higher commissions. The product growth in businesses such as A&H, marine, valuable articles grew faster than the company averaged. Some of these lines have higher commissions than places like workers compensation, for example, which is a low commission base and which we didn't grow. So it's largely a mix issue both geographic and product mix.

We have always tended to be very selective in discipline. We were a very small player for a while and still not a huge player in the workers comp line overall, and a much smaller portion of our premium base comes from workers comp than is true in many of our competitors. We tend to shy away from the large manufacturing risks with high frequency and often high severity claims and tend to write in conjunction with our niche approach to GL and property, Specialty Lines of coverage and lawyers, and things of that nature where you just don't see the same frequency and severity. So for that reason, we haven't seen all that much change in the behavior of our claimants. We also, a couple of years initiated a very sophisticated predictive model for assessing our claims activities.  It used to take us six months to identify a claim, which had the potential for soft fraud, at which point we put our best adjustor on it. It now takes us 17 days and it's coming down to lower than 17 days as the predictive model proves more successful. So we're managing our loss costs much more effectively, particularly in lost time, but also in medical, than we have in the past. The 20 point difference has been a historical one between us and the industry since we began to grow the line. But principally, it has to do with a different underwriting appetite.

We were beginning to lose out to the competition by insisting on an exclusion that we knew the courts wouldn't enforce and that's not a position Chubb ever wants to be in with its insured. So we gave that up.

It's a combination of the portfolio's getting a little bit bigger. We're not doing anything different so there are a few things that flow through the line items. So there's nothing I can point out that would suggest anything out of the ordinary. As we go forward and if interest rates continue to remain low, obviously, we'll have some issues on the reinvestment side. If you go to our 10-K, we have the maturity schedule for our investment portfolio. And what you'll see, if you look at that, is we've got about $13 billion of investments in our fixed maturity portfolio that mature over the next call it three years. About $3 billion of that comes in in 2011, about a little north of $4 billion in 2012 and 5 or plus billion in 2013. If you'll think about it, if rates stayed exactly where they are today and nothing else were to happened, the new money reinvestment rates compared to the maturing book yields, we're probably somewhere in the range of 125 to 150 basis points less. So you can do the math on what would happen to investment income over the next few years.

It's driven essentially by economic conditions. The longer the economy stays bad and the unemployment rates stays in the neighborhood of 10%, the longer it takes somebody who has been terminated to find another job and then mitigate the damages. So we also have seen some tendency to increase the severity there. That said though, what we call the first notices losses are actually flat in 2010, which we see as an encouraging leading indicator for future new arise count trends. The EEOC, to your point, I think has gotten more liberal in signing off on authorizations to sue. So we're seeing -- I think that's also driving some of the increased activity.

And then I think the following year, we've got another $225 million. Obviously, as we look at where interest rates are today, refinancing and putting on lower coupon debt makes a lot of sense. The problem is, when you have higher coupon debt sitting on your balance sheet, trying to get it off your balance sheet is not inexpensive. And to have two pieces of debt and carrying double costs may not necessarily make sense either. So while we'd love to take advantage of the low interest rate environment that we see today, it's not that simple. We're comfortable with where our leverage is where we sit today. Could we probably add a little bit more? Maybe. But we think we're fine where we are. And so we would love to be able to issue at these rates, but we don't really have a use of the proceeds. In terms of the cost of capital, that's an interesting question. Clearly, the cost of debt is lower today given where interest rates are, and that accounts for less than 20% of our capital structure. I guess, I'm not yet convinced that the cost of equity though is meaningfully lower when we think about our overall cost of capital. There's continued uncertainty in the capital markets. There's concerns over the economy. There's unprecedented government stimulus, all of which have made what is a very difficult task in terms of calculating the cost of capital even more difficult. And while treasury rates are at historic low levels, betas are higher due to increased volatility, and one could then argue that risk averse investors now require a higher market risk premium. So in the end, I'm not sure that the cost of equity capital for the industry is that much lower today than in the past. But we will see how markets progress.

We continued to produce significant growth in book value and a strong return on equity. In addition, aided largely by historically high retention rates, we had a modest increase in premiums in a very competitive market. And we continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and an active share repurchase program. 
Operating income per share for the third quarter was up 8% to $1.69. Annualized operating ROE for the quarter was 15%. The combined ratio was an excellent 86.2%. And the combined ratio, excluding caps, improved to 84.1% from 84.6%. For the first nine months, operating income per share was $4.22. x cats [catastrophes], our nine-month combined ratio was 83%, an improvement of 2.4 points over the same period last year. 
We produced an attractive annualized operating ROE in the first nine months of 12.7% even with a relatively high 7.1 points of cats. In addition, our investment portfolio continued to perform extremely well. Property and Casualty investment income after taxes for the third quarter of 2010 was $317 million, which was flat compared to last year in a lower yield environment. We also had net realized investment gains of $54 million before tax. At September 30, our net unrealized depreciation before tax stood at $2.6 billion, an increase of $700 million over June 30. These operating and investment results produced a GAAP book value per share of $52.41 at September 30. That's a 6% increase since June 30 and 11% increase since year end 2009 and a 15% increase compared to a year ago. Our capital position is excellent and Ricky will talk about the progress we have made in our share buyback program.
As you recall in July, we affirmed 2010 operating income per share guidance in the range of $5.15 to $5.55 per share. Based on third quarter results and a positive outlook for the fourth quarter, we are increasing guidance for 2010 to a range of $5.75 to $5.85 per share. I will elaborate on the revised guidance in my closing remarks. We continue to underwrite in a balanced fashion, seeking growth where we can get it but insisting on pricing terms and conditions that are designed to achieve at acceptable level of underwriting profitability. We continue to invest conservatively and we continue to actively manage our capital as evidenced by our share buybacks and dividends. This combination of underwriting discipline, conservative investing and active capital management is the formula that continues to define Chubb and produces superior results for shareholders. 
This afternoon, we also announced some important management changes at Chubb. As previously indicated, John Degnan will be retiring on December 31 after a distinguished 20-year career at Chubb, most recently as Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer. This is John's last conference call and he leaves big shoes to fill. We have a great team in place but I know we will all miss John's insightful observations on the market place, claims and public affairs. The good news is that our quarterly conference calls will now be much shorter. Fortunately, John has agreed to continue at Chubb as a senior adviser to me on a part-time basis. Although all of the details have not been finalized, I expect that John will be involved in areas such as special situation claims in government affairs in which he has amassed much expertise. 
As we announced this afternoon, upon John's retirement at the end of the year, Paul Krump will become President of Commercial and Specialty Lines reporting to me. In addition, the Accident business will report directly to Paul. Dino Robusto will become President of Personal Lines and Claims and will continue to oversee IT, Communications, Corporate Development and Innovation. He will also report to me. 
Harold Morrison will continue as Chief Global Field Officer and additionally will become Chief Administrative Officer, overseeing human resources and administrative services. Howard will report to Paul and Dino. The executive committee will include Paul, Dino, Harold, Ricky Spiro and myself. Paul, Dino and Harold are all seasoned executives, having been with Chubb for more than 20 years each. They all earned their way up through the ranks and they've had a major role in Chubb's operational success over the past several years. While John will be tough to replace, I'm very confident that we have a terrific team in place that is well qualified to step in and lead Chubb to even greater success in the years ahead. And now, John Degnan will discuss our operating performance in more detail."

Since this is my last earnings call, I'm especially pleased that we had such a good quarter. Let me give you some of the key details about that. Chubb Personal Insurance net written premiums increased 4%, with about a 1% positive impact of currency fluctuation. CPI produced a combined ratio of 85.4% compared to 81.6% last year. But cats were 3.7 points in 2010 whereas the impact of catastrophes actually improved the combined ratio by about a point in the third quarter of 2009. So excluding cats, CPI's third quarter combined ratio was 81.7% this year, almost a point better than last year's 82.6%. Homeowners premiums were up 2% and the combined ratio was an 81%. Personal auto premiums increased 7%, driven by growth outside the U.S. and the combined ratio was 91.7%. In Other Personal lines, which include our Accident business, premiums were up 7% and the combined ratio was 94.2%.
At Chubb Commercial Insurance, premiums were flat or down about 1% x currency. The combined ratio was an 89.1% compared to last year's 90.5%. CCI's third quarter included cat losses of two points compared with 2.6 points in 2009. So excluding cats, CCI's third quarter combined ratio was 87.1% in 2010 and 87.9% in 2009.
In the U.S., CCI renewal rates were down 1% compared to flat in the second quarter. We have one of the highest quarterly U.S. retention rates we've had in many years, 87%, contributing to a new to lost business ratio of 1.2:1.
At Chubb Specialty Insurance, net written premiums were also flat and the combined ratio was 83.3% compared to 83.6% in the third quarter of 2009. Premiums for Professional Liability were down 1% and the combined ratio was 89.3% compared to the 90% in last year's third quarter. Average U.S. renewal rates for Professional Liability were down 2% compared to down 3% in the second quarter. Renewal retention in the U.S. was 88% and the ratio of new to lost business was 1.1:1. For surety, net written premiums were up 7%, driven largely by growth outside the U.S. and the combined ratio was 40%.
Overall, market conditions in the third quarter were largely unchanged from the first half. We continue to see competitive pressure on rates. But on the other hand, the repercussions of poor economic conditions continue to abate slightly, and we had some improvement in exposures and endorsement activity. Overall, the market environment continues to be very challenging.
Just one final word for me on credit crisis claims. Credit crisis losses continue to develop consistently with our prior observations about them. The number of new claims in this category continues to dwindle. And managing these losses now is a question of dealing with a known quantity of claims rather than speculating about the number we will actually receive. Nothing has changed our conviction that we are appropriately reserved for the accident years in which the claims have been made. 
In closing, I'll miss these earnings calls. Not so much the internal prep sessions. It's been a privilege to work for over 20 years for a company in whose values I believe and in whose successes, particularly over the last eight years, I have been able to participate. And finally, thanks to all of you for consistently keeping us on our toes over the years during these calls. With that, I'll turn it over to Ricky Spiro."

As you can probably tell by now, we are very happy with our financial performance in the third quarter. Looking first at our operating results, underwriting income was strong, amounting to $399 million in the quarter. Property and Casualty investment income after tax of $317 million in the quarter was flat compared to last year's third quarter in a challenging investment environment. Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $54 million or $0.11 per share after tax. Our net realized investment gains before tax included $18 million of gains on our alternative investments portfolio and $36 million of realized gains from the sale of securities. Unrealized depreciation before tax at September 30, 2010, was $2.6 billion, an increase of $700 million from the end of the second quarter. This substantial increase was due to the overall improvement in the global capital markets during the quarter, which led to strong performance across all of our asset classes.
Turning to our investment portfolio, the carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $43 billion as of September 30. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 3.9 years and the average credit rating is AA2. We also continued to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At September 30, our holding company portfolio included $2.3 billion of investments, including $900 million of short-term investments.
Book value per share under GAAP at September 30, 2010, was $52.41 compared to $47.09 at year end 2009 and $45.43 a year ago. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, was $47.25 compared to $44.37 at 2009 year end and $42.31 a year ago.
As for reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the third quarter of 2010 on prior year reserves by SBU as follows: In CPI, we had about $40 million, CCI had about $90 million, CSI had about $65 million and Reinsurance Assumed had about $5 million, bringing the total favorable development to about $200 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the third quarter combined ratio of about seven points overall. For comparison, in the third quarter of 2009, we had about $205 million of favorable development for the company overall, including about $65 million in CPI, $30 million in CCI, $100 million in CSI and $10 million in Reinsurance Assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the third quarter of 2009 was about seven points, the same as in this year's third quarter. 
During the third quarter, our loss reserves increased by $7 million. Reserves in our Reinsurance Assumed business, which is now in runoff, declined by $35 million. Reserves in the Insurance business increased by $42 million during the quarter. The impact of currency fluctuation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in an increase in reserves of about $65 million. The impact of catastrophes reduced reserves by $120 million, reflecting payments on prior events and lower levels of catastrophes in the third quarter. 
Finally, I want to give you an update on capital management. During the third quarter, we repurchased 10.2 million shares. The aggregate cost of our repurchases was $555 million or an average of $54.63 per share. For the first nine months, our average repurchased cost per share was $51.94. As of September 30, 2010, there were 6.6 million shares remaining under our current repurchase authorization. And as we said during our last earnings call, our intention is to complete the repurchase of all of these remaining shares by the end of the year. We will review our 2011 capital management plans with our Board of Directors in December. And now, I'll turn it back to John Finnegan."

Here are the highlights: For the third quarter, we had operating income per share of $1.69 and an annualized operating ROE of 15%. For the first nine months, we had operating income per share of $4.22 and an annual operating ROE of 12.7%, even with seven points of cats. Our x cat combined ratio for the first nine months is an impressive 83%, which was 2.4 points better than the same period last year. Book value per share increased 6% in the three months ended September 30 and was up 11% since year end 2009 and 15% since September 30, 2009. We're maintaining a strong capital position and are well on track to completing our current share repurchase program by year end. 
With the board's initial buyback authorization in December 2005, Chubb has repurchased shares representing 37% of its market capitalization at that time. 
Let me conclude with a few comments on the revised guidance we announced in today's press release. Based on our excellent third quarter results and our outlook for a strong fourth quarter, we are updating our 2010 calendar year operating income per share guidance to a new range of $5.75 to $5.85 from the previous guidance range of $5.15 to $5.55. This revised guidance is based on operating income per share of $4.22 in the first nine months and our forecast of a range of $1.53 to $1.63 for the fourth quarter. This revised guidance is also based on an assumption of 322 million average diluted shares outstanding for the full year. 
Finally, our revised guidance assumes two percentage points of cats for the fourth quarter, which would result in 5.8 points of cats for the calendar year. This compares to the full year cat assumption of seven points included in our previous guidance, the reduction being due to lower than expected cats in the third quarter. The impact on operating income per share of each point of cats in the fourth quarter is about $0.05. That concludes our prepared remarks. I realize that they were shorter than the past but that's a reflection of a quarter with excellent results and the fact that market conditions haven't changed much from three months ago. With that, we'll open it up to your questions. Operator?"

But I'm going to take a stab at it, then John will add anything he wants to talk about it. Let me talk a little bit first about our community bank book, Keith. We consider a community bank to be one that's no larger than $1 billion in total assets. We have D&O policies for about 10% of them. 94% of our book is private or closely held and only 6% is listed on the stock exchange. The average limits are $3.2 million for the private book and $5.9 million for the public book. Given the size of those banks, we're not particularly concerned whether they're private or public because we underwrite their financial condition in light of the fact that a failure of one of these institutions could trigger a regulatory claim against the directors and officers. We have not yet seen significant claims activity in the community bank arena to date. And we're not overly concerned about the developments that have been taking place over the last couple of weeks in so far as they pertain to community banks. Although the lender liability portion of the coverage for community banks does in fact include errors and omissions, which could be implicated in a claim against the community bank for mishandling of foreclosure documentation like Robo signing. But our exposure in that connection to the community banks is not thought at the moment by us to be significant. On the other hand, our exposure to the 10 largest mortgage services that might be implicated in claims like that is also from an E&O perspective, thanks to the underlying strategies we've had for the last couple of years, is minimal with the exception of one account, which has won $15 million exposure. And to date, we haven't seen a claim from that account. And then finally, it's a complicated set of issues here and it is early to be projecting what the outcome is but with respect to-- not to the foreclosure documentation problems but to the implication of the securitized loans, you should realize that purchasers have been putting back or attempting to put back defective mortgages for several years now and they're contractually able to do that if they can prove that there were defects. That by itself though does not cause a loss to either the purchaser or the originator depending on the quality of the underlying asset. And as far as we know, and certainly our experience has been that there has not been significant insurance related claims activity to that point. And then finally, while the securitization agreements can as people have pointed out contain recourse against the originator and others for fraud, there are a number of other intermediaries that would be potentially implicated, including investment banks and lawyers and accountants. And as such, this would be largely an E&O matter where we have little to no exposure to those entities due to the underwriting actions we've taken. That was a long answer but you invited me to give you a. . ."

At least for now, those strengths are stable and are offset to some degree in our experience by lower frequency, at least in some cases like auto. But other than the potential impact of healthcare reform, which is at best uncertain, we don't see current indications of the increased claim inflation in the future. And one thing to bear in mind with respect to Chubb is that some of the third cost pressure or the inflationary pressure on loss costs, principally relate to the potential for medical inflation and because we're not big in lines of business that are affected by that light comp or auto personal liability. They tend to have a more modest impact on us, but we watch them closely."

We have a strategy in place to deal with that. We, in May, introduced a new endorsement to our public D&O product, which has been extremely well received in the marketplace and has helped us -- without an appreciable or significant increase in our risk or exposure, we either reduce prices less on renewal or on occasion to eke out a little bit of price for the increased exposure we're given.

Even Barron's pointed out not too long ago that Chubb is the leading choice of affluent Americans to protect their homes. We didn't do that overnight. We did it with inspecting 700,000 high net worth properties and we settled over 1 million claims or high net worth customers with unbelievably high satisfaction ratings. Our claims responses to catastrophes is always rated the best in the industry. And we have the best network of producers in the world selling high net worth Personal Lines. They understand the product, they understand the appetite of the underwriters, they understand the importance of bonding a relationship with the customer by producing a company that's going to be around to pay the claims and not just pay them but pay them empathetically and timely.

In the third quarter, we did see continued reasons for optimism in our renewal exposure figures.

But if you look at the second quarter this year, it was minus 1.5. The first quarter was minus 2.3. And so we're on the right trend line here. As we said last quarter, we think the overall economy is sort of bouncing along the bottom. So we're going to see modest increases in exposure opportunities in CCI lines of business. Typically, we look for them in payrolls or workers comp, sales levels for general liability contracts, the level of shipments for marine policies and the retention amounts of the limits for Professional Liability contracts. We've also seen a flattening out in Personal Lines of the decrease we had seen in exposure over the last several quarters. There is a little less need on the part of our insureds to reduce their premiums. So fewer increases in deductibles and a bit more jewelry being bought and added on. And also builder's risk is I should point out is probably going to be the last line of business in which we would expect to see a significant exposure change, given what's going on in the economy."

We perform pretty well in workers comp compared to the industry. AM Best pointed out recently that the industry combined ratio for comp had deteriorated from 104.6% in 2008 to 116% in 2010. Chubb's comparable numbers were 82.1% in 2008 and 92.1% in 2010. We generally performed 20 points better than the rest of the industry.

We tend to be intermediate maturity investors in both the taxable and tax-exempt marketplace. The way we've structured our portfolio is it has laddered maturities so we have cash flows and maturities that we can reinvest. So as rates go up, well obviously, our portfolio and everyone else's in the industry would be impacted by that from a valuation perspective of the portfolio. We'd be reinvesting at higher interest rates. So the short answer is, we like our strategy.

We're still not a huge player in the workers comp line overall and much smaller portion of our premium base comes from workers comp and it's true in many of our competitors. We tend to shy away from the large manufacturing risks with high frequency and often high severity claims and tend to write in conjunction with our niche approach to GL and property, Specialty Lines of coverage and lawyers, and things of that nature where you just don't see the same frequency and severity. So for that reason, we haven't seen all that much change in the behavior of our claimants. We also, a couple of years initiated a very sophisticated predictive model for assessing our claims activity. So it used to take us six months to identify a claim, which had the potential for soft fraud. At which point, we put our best adjustor on it. It now takes us 17 days and it's coming down to lower than 17 days as the predictive model proves more successful. So we're managing our loss costs much more effectively, particularly in lost time but also in medical, than we have in the past. The 20 point difference has been a historical one between us and the industry since we began to draw the line. But principally, it has to do with the different underwriting appetite."

But they don't in our estimation significantly increase our risk or exposure to loss. They do provide responses to current day issues that are affecting our insured persons and they've been a very effective instrument in the marketplace. Some examples, the pollution exclusion, it used to exist in the D&O policy, is deleted and the insured versus insurer exclusion, which basically said we wouldn't cover a claim that was brought by one insured against another insured. Frankly, the court cases were coming down against us. We were not, we were beginning to lose out to the competition by insisting on an exclusion that we knew the courts wouldn't enforce and that's not a position Chubb ever wants to be in with its insured. So we gave that up and I guess, to look at by the market favorably but by us, in assessing our loss exposure, really there is no much impact because we weren't getting the benefit of the exclusion in the first place.

And what you'll see, if you look at that, is we've got about $13 billion of investments that are fixed maturity portfolio that mature over the next call it three years. About $3 billion of that comes in in 2011, about a little north of $4 billion in 2012 and 5 or plus billion in 2013.

But we still think we're making attractive returns and with our x cat accident year combined ratio through nine months of 90.1% for the first nine months, which we think is going to be among the best of any of the other insurers, we like where we're sitting at the moment."

I mean, to be honest, some of your peers have maybe the argument that there's a low-cost to capital today. And therefore, that these lower returns are making it more acceptable and I guess I struggle with that answer because if you're all locked into your higher cost of equity, you can't refinance and it's kind of a mythical thing, right? So do you have the ability to take advantage of these lower rates and either take up the debt to cap or prefund some of your coming maturities?"

And then I think the following year, we've got another $225 million. Obviously, as we look at where interest rates are today, refinancing and putting on lower coupon debt makes a lot of sense. The problem is, when you have higher coupon debt sitting on your balance sheet, trying to get it off your balance sheet is not inexpensive and perhaps, two pieces of debt on the carrying double costs may not necessarily make sense either. So while we love to take advantage of the low interest rate environment that we see today, it's not that simple. We're comfortable with where our leverage is at where we sit today. Could we probably add a little bit more? Maybe. But we think we're fine where we are. And so we would love to be able to issue with these rates but we don't really have a use for the proceeds. In terms of the cost of capital, that's an interesting question. Clearly, the cost of debt is lower today given where interest rates are. And that accounts for less than 20% of our capital structure. I guess, I'm not yet convinced that the cost of equity though is meaningfully lower when we think about our overall cost of capital. There's continued uncertainty in the capital markets. There's concerns over the economy. There's unprecedented government stimulus, all of which have made what is a very difficult task in terms of calculating the cost of capital even more difficult. And while treasury rates are at historic low levels, betas are higher due to increased volatility and one could then argue that risk averse investors now require a higher market risk premium. So in the end, I'm not sure that the cost of equity capital for the industry is that much lower today than in the past. But we will see how markets progress."
