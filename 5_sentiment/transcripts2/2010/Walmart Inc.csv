Thanks for joining us today for the Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Fourth Quarter Earnings Call for Fiscal 2010. A replay of this call and related materials about the quarter are available on our website. We will also post the full transcript of this call at approximately 7:00 a.m. Central Time today.Store counts, square footage updates, information on our financial metrics and all of our earnings release dates for fiscal 2011, which is now underway, are available also on our website at www.walmartstores.com\investors. A quick reminder for this call, after the adoption of a new accounting standard for fiscal year 2010, Wal-Mart made minor modifications to the financial statement presentation for minority interests, now referred to as noncontrolling interests. These changes are reflected in our quarterly financial statements. Because of these changes, during the call, all references to income from continuing operations or earnings per share from continuing operations refer to income from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart or diluted income per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart respectively. Also, diluted net income per share from continuing operations refers to diluted net income per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart.Our executive team is ready for our report on both the fourth quarter and the year-end results. Our President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Mike Duke, will kick it off. Charles Holley, Executive Vice President of Finance and Treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial results. Then we will get in to the details of each operating segment. Eduardo Castro-Wright, Vice Chairman responsible for Wal-Mart U.S., global sourcing and Global.com, will cover Wal-Mart U.S. and provide comments on our other new initiatives. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart International will follow Eduardo and cover results for the segment and our largest international countries by revenue. Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam's Club, has results for our Warehouse Club segment. And Tom Shelley, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will finish up the call with our financial report card as well as our earnings guidance. Our press release this morning has a fair amount of noise in the fourth quarter and the year. There are many details covered in our notes, which we advise you to review carefully. Charles is going to talk a lot about this in detail. But before I turn things over to Mike, let me share an overview of the key adjustments disclosed in the press release.First, we had $372 million or $0.10 per share in net tax benefits primarily from the repatriation of certain non-U.S. earnings that increased U.S. foreign tax credits. Second was a $216 million pretax or $162 million net of tax charge equal to $0.04 per share from several business restructurings, which we have announced recently. On a pretax basis, Sam's Club recorded a charge of $174 million for restructuring its operations including the closure of 10 clubs. Wal-Mart U.S. recorded a pretax charge of $73 million for restructuring its operations and unallocated corporate overhead included a pretax charge of $13 million for restructuring charges. Finally, please remember that in last year's fourth quarter, we had the settlement for the wage in our class action litigation. This was $382 million pretax or $255 million net of tax, approximately $0.07 per share. Now, Mike, let's get started with our great earnings news."
313055,6334604,50663,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb-18-2010",2010-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Carol, and good morning, everyone. I am really proud of the performance of our teams around the world and the results Wal-Mart has delivered for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. The strength of our earnings is exceptional, so let's",1205,"Thank you, Carol, and good morning, everyone. I am really proud of the performance of our teams around the world and the results Wal-Mart has delivered for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. The strength of our earnings is exceptional, so let's get right into the numbers.For the fourth quarter, Wal-Mart today is reporting earnings per share of $1.23 and adjusted EPS of $1.17, $0.05 above the top of our own guidance and $0.05 above First Call consensus. For the full year, we reported EPS of $3.72, which was above the top of our guidance of $3.57 to $3.61. Adjusted EPS for fiscal year 2010 was $3.66. Charles will cover much more detail on the adjustments for restructurings and the tax benefit. Net sales for fiscal 2010 were more than $405 billion, with International net sales exceeding $100 billion for the first time in Wal-Mart history.While I'm disappointed that Wal-Mart U.S. comparable store sales were below expectations for the fourth quarter, I am really proud of their underlying operating performance and the fact that Wal-Mart delivered record profits for the quarter. Consolidated operating income for the fourth quarter was up almost 14% to $7.3 billion, re-enforcing the strength of our business. Last fall, we committed that SG&A would grow less than sales. So how did we do? We successfully shifted the productivity loop into a higher gear. The diligent way we managed our businesses and tight control of our costs resulted in the company leveraging expenses for the fourth quarter, and we plan to grow expenses slower than the rate of sales growth in this new fiscal year.Our free cash flow performance continues to be very strong, and we closed the year with $14.1 billion in free cash flow, another record and an increase over last year of almost 21%. And finally, we posted a pretax return on investment of 19.3% for the year, equal to last year's ROI performance, and I'll let Tom cover the discussion on ROI. These results reflect the ongoing underlying strength of our business and of our strategies to improve shareholder value by delivering growth, leveraging expenses and improving returns.We remain a growth company. We added more than 34 million net square feet of retail space this year, which is equivalent to some retailers' total selling space. And more than half of that growth came from International, which added 21 million square feet this year. What's even more impressive is that this is organic growth since we had no acquisitions this fiscal year. We now have more than 8,400 units worldwide with 53 formats, and the investments we have made in systems are benefiting the bottom line. We are managing our working capital more efficiently. Throughout the organization, we choose to spend where we know there's real value.Now let me recognize some fourth quarter accomplishments of our three operating segments. I want to emphasize again the strong underlying performance of the Wal-Mart U.S. Operating income grew at a faster rate than sales. Inventory was down yet, again, almost 8% over this time last year. And continued investments in remodeling and productivity initiatives and our sourcing position us for better top-line sales growth. And Eduardo will cover this in more detail. So now let's move to International. But first, let me ask all of you a question. How many of you know a $100 billion business that grew top-line sales by 12% and grew profit by 19% in this very difficult economic environment during this fourth quarter? I know you're thinking about it, but let me go ahead and name one for you. The name, Wal-Mart International. In addition to their strong sales performance, International continues to make progress on reducing inventory and improving returns, and International rounded off the year by leveraging constant currency operating expenses for a fourth consecutive quarter and before the effects of the Chilean acquisition. We expect continued strong growth from International again this fiscal year, especially in Brazil in China. We're also really pleased with our start up in India, and we see a substantial opportunity there long term.Sam's continues to improve its club efficiency and the in-club experience, and I love what they're doing with merchandise. Sam's finished the year with solid comp sales. Sam's also reduced inventory through its productivity and efficiency initiatives. And for the fourth quarter, Sam's leveraged expenses after restructuring adjustments. Now let's look back at the total company again. In the last month, we made a number of significant changes to ensure that our strategy is driving Wal-Mart's structure for the future. The streamlined structure at Wal-Mart U.S. will enable us to grow in new markets, leverage scale for greater efficiency and offer new opportunities for some of our most talented associates.At Sam's Club, we closed 10 underperforming U.S. clubs, and we announced new initiatives to strengthen member loyalty and to drive growth. Our new global sourcing team will enable us to leverage the scale of our global merchandising organization, reduce costs and drive quality through our supply chain. Eduardo will reference some of these early successes from the global sourcing organization. There is also great potential for Wal-Mart in e-commerce. The integration of our dotcom organization with our stores around the world will broaden the reach of our brand to serve customers through multiple channels. Some of these changes will yield immediate results and others, like the repositioning of our global sourcing and global e-commerce strategy, are more long-term focused. We view these steps as building blocks for a stronger, more global Wal-Mart.The first quarter of fiscal year 2011 is well underway for all of our segments. The economy remains challenging for many of our customers around the world. Unemployment is forecasted to be higher this year than the last three years in many of our countries. We expect first quarter sales in the U.S. will be difficult as we cycle through strong year-over-year comparisons and deflation. We remain very focused on growing top-line sales, and we believe we will see more improvement as the year progresses.Since I have closed out my first year leading Wal-Mart, I have to say I am so proud of the quality of our team, from the senior leadership, to the store and club managers and associates at every level of our global business. The belief in our mission of saving people money so that they can live better is real and it's deep, and it's energizing our culture more than ever. We will continue to make a difference in communities around the world. We were proud to contribute to the relief efforts in Haiti as we have done for so many other natural disasters. We will also continue to take a leadership role in sustainability, and I am pleased with the progress we're making with suppliers and stakeholders.As I visit with customers, it's striking how much people trust us to provide more value and quality than any other retailer. Change has always been a part of our company and our culture. We're moving forward everyday to ensure Wal-Mart is a strong, relevant company for the future. What has not and will not change is that every part of our business is focused on being even more responsive to our customers."
313055,6334604,50663,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb-18-2010",2010-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. As Mike just said, we were pleased with our strong earnings performance and strong cash flow. There's a fair amount of noise in the fourth quarter results, both this year and last year. But the bottom line is we had a great performance. Reca",1515,"Thanks, Mike. As Mike just said, we were pleased with our strong earnings performance and strong cash flow. There's a fair amount of noise in the fourth quarter results, both this year and last year. But the bottom line is we had a great performance. Recall that in the fourth quarter last year, we had a $382 million settlement of wage-and-hour class action litigation or $255 million net of tax. Without this settlement, our earnings per share for the fourth quarter last year would have been approximately $0.07 per share higher or $1.03 per share. This year, we have two items impacting EPS for the fourth quarter. First, we incurred a $260 million or $162 million net of tax charge or $0.04 per share for several business restructurings that have been announced and will be referenced during today's call. As you know, these business restructurings were put in place to strengthen our operations, streamline our structures and allow our businesses to be more responsive to our customers and members. With respect to these restructuring charges, Sam's Club recorded a pretax charge of $174 million. Wal-Mart U.S., a pretax charge of $73 million and unallocated corporate overhead, included a pretax charge of $13 million. Second, we recorded $372 million of net tax benefits, primarily from the repatriation of certain non-U.S. earnings that increased U.S. foreign tax credits. This amounted to a benefit of $0.10 per share for our EPS for the fourth quarter. Given these two impacts, a $0.04 charge and a $0.10 benefit, adjusted earnings from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 were $4.5 billion or $1.17 per share.For the full year, adjusted earnings from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart were $14.2 billion or $3.66 per share. This compares to last year's adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $13.5 billion or $3.42 per share for last year or an increase of 7% per share. Despite the noise in the reported EPS, we still exceeded guidance of $1.08 to $1.12 per share for the quarter and $3.57 per share to $3.61 per share for the year, by $0.05 per share on our adjusted EPS.Now let's dive a little deeper into the fourth quarter details. Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter increased 4.6%, or almost $5 billion to $112.8 billion. Net sales for the fourth quarter included a currency exchange rate benefit of $1.9 billion. The 13-week U.S. comp store sales without fuel were negative 1.6%. You'll hear more details on the Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam's comp sales from Eduardo and Brian. Fourth quarter consolidated operating income was $7.3 billion, up 13.8% or $881 million from last year. On a constant currency basis, consolidated operating income would be $122 million less.Consolidated income from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart increased to $4.7 billion, up $3.8 billion or 23.7% from the fourth quarter last year. Our solid results were driven by our focus on expenses and inventory management. The U.S. operations continue outstanding success and inventory management, which contributed to consolidated inventories being down 3.9%, or $1.4 billion for the same time last year.These results, coupled with our transformation investments, which I will discuss in a moment, were two of the contributing factors for the consolidated gross margin increase of 35 basis points versus the fourth quarter of last year. Our excellent inventory management also helped our payables to inventory ratio. Payables, as a percentage of inventories for the company, were 91.8% at the end of the fourth quarter, which is up 820 basis points from last year. This ratio increased from the prior period due to exchange rate fluctuations and better inventory management across all of our operating segments.We continue to do a great job of managing working capital. We are still in the early phases of focusing on growth, leverage and returns but we have already made significant progress. These priorities will be continued focal points going forward. In the fourth quarter, expenses grew at 3.2% on a sales growth of 4.6%. Simply put, the company leveraged expenses for the fourth quarter. Excluding the pretax legal settlement charge of $382 million last year and the $13 million restructuring charge for this year, unallocated corporate overhead was up 8.8% for the quarter. The story here continues to be the same as in the recent quarters. We are continuing to invest in technology and systems, which includes the transformation projects. These expenses are running higher than last year, but the investments are yielding significant returns.Core corporate costs were up only 1% versus last year. A good example of how these transformation investments are paying off is the progress made in merchandise systems that have helped us better manage markdowns and improve space optimization, labor scheduling and other processes. Lastly, we continue the implementation of SAP throughout the organization. The United Kingdom implementation at ASDA went exceptionally well, and we are preparing for North America's go live in the first half of fiscal 2011. Your key takeaway here should be that we do not anticipate any significant year-over-year cost increases for these financial systems.On a consolidated basis, membership and other income was down 4.8% or $42 million this quarter compared to last year. For the full year, membership and other income was down 3.6% or $119 million. Wal-Mart U.S. was the main driver of the decrease. Net interest expense was down 4.7% or $23 million over last year's fourth quarter. This was driven by lower average commercial paper balances due to our great management of inventory along with favorable borrowing rates. Some of these savings were partially offset by lower interest rates on our cash balances. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 28.4% and our annual tax rate was 32.4%. This was due to the net tax benefits primarily from the repatriation of certain non-US earnings that increased the U.S. foreign tax credits. The net tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter will not affect the tax rate going forward. So for fiscal 2011, we expect it to be within the range of 34% to 35%, although we may see some quarterly fluctuations. Factors, which may affect our rate, include changes of our assessment of certain tax contingencies in the mix of international to domestic income. Now let me move on to a summary of our full-year results for fiscal 2010. Net sales increased 1% or about $4 billion to approximately $405 billion. On a constant currency basis, sales would have been $9.8 billion higher or 3.4% over last year. U.S. comp sales without fuel for the 52-week period ending on January 29, 2010 were flat. Consolidated operating income was $24 billion, which is up a little more than 5% from last year. On a constant currency basis, our consolidated operating income would've grown 7.4% to $24.5 billion. Consolidated operating income grew faster than sales for the year because we were able to grow gross profit by 3.5%. Consolidated expenses grew at 2.7% on the sales increase of 1%.Income from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart increased to $14.4 billion, up from $13.3 billion or 8.8% from the previous year. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, and we continue to have ample access to credit markets. Debt to total capitalization ratio was 36.9%, down from 39.3% last year. We will continue to target a debt to capitalization ratio of approximately 40%. Our strong balance sheet also allows us to spend capital and return income to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. CapEx spend in the fourth quarter was $3.3 billion, which brought our annual CapEx spend to $12.2 billion. This was lower than our most recent guidance of $12.5 billion to $13.1 billion because of the timing of CapEx outlays in some of our more international countries. We expect fiscal year 2011 CapEx to be in the range of $13 billion to $15 billion, which we shared at the October Meeting for the Investment Community. The company repurchased approximately $2.2 billion of our shares during the quarter and $7.4 billion for the year. This represents 40.3 million and 145.5 million shares respectively. We have approximately $9.2 billion remaining on our $15 billion share repurchase program.We remain committed to share repurchase this year. In addition, we paid $1 billion this quarter and $4.2 billion for the year in dividends. For the full fiscal year, Wal-Mart returned $11.5 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, 58% more than last year. This would not have been possible without our strong operating results and balance sheet. Last year, I was proud to announce free cash flow of $11.6 billion. This year, I'm even more excited to report free cash flows of $14.1 billion. Our exceptional earnings and working capital management, especially inventory, were the primary drivers of this great result. They were also the drivers of our return on investment, which was flat to last year's return on investment of 19.3%. Tom will further discuss our returns later in the call. Now let's move on to a discussion of our operating segments. We'll start with Wal-Mart U.S. Eduardo?"
313055,6334604,50663,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb-18-2010",2010-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Charles. Throughout the last year, we have repositioned our business to leverage expenses at a much lower growth rate than in the past, and I'm pleased to say that Wal-Mart U.S. profits are growing at a much faster rate than sales. Our results",2348,"Thank you, Charles. Throughout the last year, we have repositioned our business to leverage expenses at a much lower growth rate than in the past, and I'm pleased to say that Wal-Mart U.S. profits are growing at a much faster rate than sales. Our results are being driven by improved productivity across entire enterprise. Inventory levels, merchandise flow processes and lower cost of goods, reflecting improvements in our new sourcing initiatives, equally contributed to our results and were the primary drivers to the company's strong free cash flow performance.Comparable sales for the quarter were below our guidance although the trend improved consistently throughout the period. Net sales were down 0.5% for the fourth quarter but up 1.1% for the full year to more than $258 billion. On a 4-5-4 basis, Wal-Mart U.S. comp sales were down 2% and 0.2% for both the 13-week period and the 52-week period respectively. Most of this decline in comp for the fourth quarter was due to a drop in average ticket, which was driven by price deflation. We did experience, however, a slight decrease in traffic during the quarter. And as I will discuss later, we're accelerating the implementation of several project impact initiatives to drive traffic to our stores.For the full year, customer traffic was up 1.3% while average ticket declined due to price deflation. It is important to note that on a two-year stock basis, the business continue to outperform the market. Our comparable store sales for the past two years were 2.5% for the 52-week period and 0.4% for the 13 weeks ending January 29, 2010.As we shared with you earlier this fiscal year, deflation continue to have an especially onerous impact on our comps for the year, dropping by more than 300 basis points from the inflation experienced last year. We cycled peak inflation in November and the trends are now improving. As a matter of fact, in last year's fourth quarter, grocery inflation ran approximately 600 basis points. This year, we saw price decline by approximately 90 basis points, thus creating a negative year-over-year swing of approximately 690 basis points. In consumer electronics, we have had two consecutive years of near double-digit deflation. TV sales and units increased in the high double digits. However, average selling prices were significantly lower than the prior year, resulting in a negative impact to both sales and comps for the fourth quarter.The good news is that we did gain market share. We have expanded our high-end electronics assortment on both TVs and SLR cameras and these technologies are now available through Walmart.com. In approximately 400 stores, we have added high-end TVs and new LED technology, and this will roll out to all stores by April. On a positive note, we have already seen a slowing of deflation in all major electronics categories.Gross margin was up 53 basis points over last year's fourth quarter and up 73 basis points for the full year. We're seeing benefits from the investments we've made in systems for merchandising planning, price optimization, markdown planning and labor productivity. Because of our better sell-through, markdowns are down 6.3% from last year's fourth quarter. Favorable inventory shrink results and lower transportation costs also favorably impacted fourth quarter gross profit. We're touching inventory a fewer times and turning inventory much faster. Clearly, we're managing working capital more efficiently.Beyond disadvantages, we're seeing early benefits from our global sourcing initiatives. We believe that we're well-positioned to see the cost of goods sold come down, particularly where we have already completed the transition to the global merchandise centers and the recently announced Li & Fung partnership. Global sourcing will be the anchor for cost of goods sold reduction and margin enhancement, while giving us a competitive advantage to further reduce prices.For example, in home, supply rationalization and consolidation in bedding programs led to margin gains on items where we were already very competitive on price. Consolidating production with strategically aligned suppliers led to significant cost savings and margin improvement in several home programs. We achieved a combined cost of goods sold savings of 7.2% in bedding during the fourth quarter. Efficient inventory management continues to be part of our success story and is one of the contributors to our free cash flow performance. We reduced total inventory by $1.8 billion in our stores and distribution centers over the last 12 months.Wal-Mart U.S. reduced total inventory by 7.6% on a full-year sales increase of 1.1%. The project impact strategic framework has delivered improved planning, reduced inventory, higher customer satisfaction scores and better merchandise sell-through. Our customers are very happy with improved visibility throughout our stores because we improved for them the shopping environment. We're pleased with the sales increase in clean Action Alley stores versus comparable control stores, and that is why we have decided to accelerate its implementation. The rollout will be completed this first quarter.In addition, through our remodeling program, we expect to have more than 50% of the store base remodeled by the end of the third quarter, reflecting the new look and feel laid out in Project Impact. We achieved the highest customer satisfaction scores ever this quarter, which confirms to us that customers really like what they are seeing in our stores. Customers are rating us substantially higher on all of our key metrics. Faster, friendlier, cleaner stores, coupled with improved merchandise assortments and increased price value perception. We appreciate the hard work of our store associates across the country in helping drive this performance. Expense control continues to be a major focus throughout the Wal-Mart organization. We had shared with you previously that healthcare was a large expense headwind in fiscal 2010. Through changes implemented already, healthcare costs started to abate at the end of the fourth quarter, and we do not expect healthcare to be a headwind in this new fiscal year.For the first time this year in the fourth quarter, we achieved a 0.6% reduction in expenses, which is 10 basis points better than the 0.5% decline in sales. Our fourth quarter expenses as a percentage of sales were two basis points lower than last year. However, without the $73 million restructuring charge that Charles talked about earlier, expenses as a percentage of sales were 12 basis points lower than last year. Labor productivity continues to increase and fourth quarter payroll expense was down 10 basis points compared to last year. In addition, indirect expenses such as utilities and store supplies, were also down significantly. We also increased our advertising presence significantly this year through higher co-op advertising spending. Remember that the support we receive from suppliers related to co-op advertising is included in gross margin while the expenses are classified in our SG&A line.For the full year, SG&A expense grew by 2.9%, driven mostly by health insurance costs. Labor productivity increased for the full year and payroll expense for the stores was essentially flat as a percentage of sales with last year, in spite of significant increases in hourly wages. Utility costs and store supply expenses declined from the prior year. Excluding expenses related to co-op advertising that are substantially offset in gross margin, SG&A for the fourth quarter declined by 0.7%. Excluding expenses related to co-op advertising for the full year, SG&A increased by 2.6%.Including the restructuring charge, operating income for the fourth quarter was up 5.4% on a sales decrease of 0.5%. Without the restructuring impact, operating income for the quarter rose 6.8% on a sales decrease of 0.5%. For the full year, Wal-Mart U.S. delivered its highest profit ever. We have operating income of more than $19.5 billion, which was up 5.2% from the previous year. Again, excluding this year's restructuring charge, operating income would have been up 5.6% from a sales increase of 1.1%.Other income for the Wal-Mart segment was down from last year for both the fourth quarter and the year. Last year, other income was favorably impacted by a number of miscellaneous items, none of which was individually significant to the financial statements. Let's move now to highlights of our various merchandising units for the fourth quarter. As I pointed out earlier, grocery results continued to be heavily impacted by deflation. On a comparable basis to grocery retailers who report comps including Food, Consumables and Pharmacy businesses together, our sales were essentially flat year-over-year for the fourth quarter. We believe that food deflation pressures will abate by the beginning of the second quarter of this new fiscal year. By itself, comps in health and wellness were very solid. Our Pharmacy business remains strong and we continue to outperform the competition in this area. Maintenance and wellness categories, such as vitamins and adult nutrition are generating consistently strong comps. Unit growth in optical has been very positive, driven by new lower price points and our 1-800 CONTACTS initiative. Our great value program is fully rolled out across the Food and Consumables area and we're seeing solid mid-single-digit sales increases, which compared very favorably to the overall grocery flat comp. Our customers give us a lot of credit for having expanded the product offering. What the customer now sees is a single point of view across many aisles. Without a doubt, our customers now consider great value a brand, rather than a collection of items.Hard lines in seasonal sales were soft during the period, as we believe customers reduced discretionary spending on decorative items during the holiday season. Solid merchandise sell-through reduced the need for markdowns during the quarter. Cold and snowy weather in late December and January drove strong comp sales in automotive and seasonal hardware. In home, we saw continued strength in any product related to eating and entertaining at home, while sales of more discretionary items were softer than last year's fourth quarter. We're disappointed with our apparel performance for the quarter and for the year, and a full review of our apparel merchandising strategy has been underway now for a few months. We have refocused our efforts on the Basics business, which continues to perform well and we're pleased that our apparel inventory's clean throughout the chain.I spoke earlier about the deflation impact on electronics, which is the dominant category within entertainment. In toys, which also are in entertainment, sales of key items such as bicycles, ride-ons and licensed products were strong for the holidays. Prudent buying decisions also led to reduced end-of-season markdowns. Wal-Mart Financial Services experienced strong fourth quarter net income growth driven by check cashing and other money services. For the full year, Financial Services experienced strong double-digit income growth from check cashing, the $3 MoneyCard and the continued expansion of the Wal-Mart MoneyCenter.Walmart.com had an outstanding fourth quarter, delivering sales growth over 30% compared to last year. Site traffic and order growth both exceeded the market. It is no small accomplishment that fiscal 2010 traffic to the site exceeded 1 billion visits. Without a doubt, these results reflect the strength of the Wal-Mart brand across multiple channels. Now let me move on to talk about some of our important business initiatives. We're escalating the next phase of Project Impact to leverage our size and scale to drive greater efficiencies and lower the cost of goods to help accelerate growth. A series of changes within the Wal-Mart U.S. structure has moved us further along in our execution of this plan, while our recently announced global sourcing initiatives will further complement our efforts in this area. We have aligned the critical new store decision process by integrating Wal-Mart's Realty division with store operations and logistics under the leadership of Bill Simon, our Chief Operating Officer. Additionally, we have redefined responsibilities for our new merchandising execution group. This fiscal year, in spite of a challenging environment that led to softer sales, the Wal-Mart U.S. business significantly increased ROI. Gross margin improvements, solid expense management, continued strong inventory management and capital efficiency drove this increase and led to a very strong free cash flow performance. The first quarter of fiscal 2011 is now underway. Customers remain cautious especially in discretionary spending. Personal finances remain the top concern facing consumers in our latest monthly research report. Concern about unemployment remains much higher compared to last year, followed by concerns about the cost of living and the economy.I will close the Wal-Mart U.S. discussion with our comp guidance. Our 13-week comp without fuel for the first quarter last year was 3.6%. We're forecasting a comp without fuel to be flat plus or minus 1% for the 13-week period from January 30 through April 30, 2010. Now let me cover of two other areas: Global Sourcing and Global.com. I've mentioned earlier some efforts of our global sourcing teams. These are still in the early stages but we have kicked into high gear our efforts to leverage our size and global footprint to reduce the cost of goods that we import into retail markets around the world and to strengthen our responsible sourcing initiatives. The core of our strategy will be to increase direct sourcing for the company's private brands that represent more than $100 billion at cost. Our global merchandise centers will drive efficiencies in both general merchandise and food sourcing. In addition, we have signed an exclusive sourcing agreement with Li & Fung to have the company serve as a buying agent for Wal-Mart for general merchandise.I'm excited about the opportunities to lower the cost of goods sold, further improve the quality of products and accelerate the speed at which we can bring innovation to the market. Wal-Mart also remains committed to ensuring that all products are sourced in a responsible, ethical and sustainable manner.Before I pass things over to Doug for Wal-Mart International, let me cover our recent announcement on Global.com. Earlier, I shared that Walmart.com had a strong fourth quarter. We're redefining roles and responsibilities within our Global.com organization and we're excited about the opportunity to accelerate the growth of Wal-Mart's multichannel initiatives around the world. Customers will be able to experience the brand wherever and whenever they want. I will share more on this opportunity in the near future. Now, I will pass it to Doug."
313055,6334604,50663,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb-18-2010",2010-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Eduardo. As I end my first year leading the International division, I can't help but reflect back on the history of this great division. It is amazing how much we have accomplished since expanding the Wal-Mart business outside the United States in",2220,"Thanks, Eduardo. As I end my first year leading the International division, I can't help but reflect back on the history of this great division. It is amazing how much we have accomplished since expanding the Wal-Mart business outside the United States in the early 90s, and we have so much more to accomplish in front of us. During the past two decades, we've expanded our expertise to operate successfully in emerging markets, run smaller stores and tailor various formats to local needs. We have integrated our organization's culture to reinforce strong customer service in all our markets. We continue to move with even greater speed and we create freedom within a framework in the markets. In the future, we can strengthen our effectiveness in leveraging our size and expertise. It's exciting to know that we are successful outside the United States and that we have a lot of upside in future years.As Mike said earlier, all our countries are focused on delivering growth, leverage and returns. Our International business is a large part of global Wal-Mart. While acquisitions have played a big role, we have grown our business organically as well. In fact, organic growth has driven well over half of our international revenues. The growth prospects in markets like China and Brazil give us confidence that we can build on the momentum we've experienced during the last several years. We're really pleased with our startup operations in India and see substantial opportunity there as well. Along with our long-term growth story, it is encouraging to see that a business our size can grow sales 11.9% on a constant currency basis as we did in the fourth quarter versus last year. We delivered this performance on strong underlying comps, new store growth and the Chilean acquisition, and we grew fourth quarter operating income faster than sales. I'm excited about our effort in the area of leverage. Leverage means multiple things to our international operations. Of course, we are focused on leveraging operating expenses. In fact, before the effects of currency exchange rates and our acquisition in Chile, expenses only grew 5.2% in the fourth quarter and 6.3% for the full year. You'll hear more about that when we discuss our quarterly results.Leverage also means a dedication to using our collective knowledge and best practices around the globe. The marketing center of excellence we created in the U.K. last spring has improved our ability to communicate price in stores around the world. In addition, as some of you know, we reorganized our division in November to focus on leveraging our size and expertise. We can create additional leverage and process consistency for an area like backroom inventory receiving, for example. Our efforts in growth and leverage are geared toward increasing the returns on our invested capital. We know we can generate solid returns from our organic growth. This past fiscal year, we added more than 500 new stores. The more predictable returns from organic growth in our established operations like ASDA, Walmex and Wal-Mart Canada allow us to balance our risk profile. We are able to follow-through on our priorities because of the commitment of our associates around the world. They have helped us deliver another strong quarter in what we all know has been a challenging economic environment in most markets. I've attended store manager meetings in India and Central America these past two weeks and I wish you could have seen their energy. Our associates and our leaders in international continue to take market share and look for ways to improve. Now as we move to the specific results for the fourth quarter, I want to remind you of the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. As you know, we translate our financial results from various international currencies into U.S. dollars and the effects of this translation have been a negative factor in our financial results over the past four quarters. The trend in the U.S. dollar has changed and the translation has been a positive factor in our financial results for this quarter. Our results in the fourth quarter of last year through to the third quarter of fiscal 2010 were negatively impacted by the strengthening U.S. dollar in late 2008. International net sales for the fourth quarter were $29.6 billion, an increase of 19.5% from last year. This includes a $1.9 billion positive impact from currency exchange rate fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, without the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, sales were up $27.7 billion or 11.9% over last year's fourth quarter. Our constant currency sales increase for the fourth quarter is due primarily to strong performances in the United Kingdom and Mexico, new store growth in Brazil and China and the acquisition of D&S in Chile. International's operating income for the fourth quarter was up 26.9% from last year to $1.9 billion, including $122 million of positive effects from currency exchange rate fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, our operating income grew faster than sales at 18.7%. In the fourth quarter, we continued the trend of the first three quarters of fiscal 2010, leveraging our constant currency expenses over last year before the impact of our Chilean acquisition. We maintained our constant currency gross margin while other income was flat as a percentage of sales.We've also had a great full year performance in fiscal 2010. Net sales for the year were $100.1 billion, up 1.3% after the negative $9.8 billion impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our constant currency basis sales were up 11.2% and excluding our acquisition of D&S, they were up 7.7%. Operating income for international was $5 billion, up 1.9% over last year after the negative $540 million impact from currency. On a constant currency basis, full year operating income increased 12.8%. Before I move to the country details, let's discuss inventory. We continue to make the focus on inventory a priority and have seen improvement. Overall, we've reduced our days on hand since the end of fiscal 2009. The United Kingdom, Mexico and Canada are performing well. Now let's go into the results for several of our markets. Before we do, let me remind you that we hold country management accountable for their results on a local currency basis without the impact of potential swings in exchange rates. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency. My congratulations go out to the ASDA team on delivering great performance in fiscal 2010. ASDA had a strong year, ending with its highest ever market share according to TNS and operating income growth ahead of sales growth. ASDA's comp sales growth without fuel was 4.6% for the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year, primarily driven by increased customer count, but also by higher average ticket. There was inclement weather in the United Kingdom at Christmas and into the New Year, which forced people to shop closer to home and affected customer traffic.Food continued to provide strong sales growth for ASDA even in the wake of slight price deflation. Both George apparel and general merchandise outperformed their respective markets, with George seasonal merchandise benefiting from cold weather. General merchandise saw significant growth in music, video and games.ASDA's web-based food home shopping service now reaches more than 97% of the population. The non-food Internet platform also had strong performance and customers can now pick up their online purchases in many of our stores. Excluding fuel, ASDA's gross margin was relatively flat for the fourth quarter. ASDA's profit grew ahead of sales in every quarter in fiscal 2010 and expenses as a percentage of the sales declined as the ASDA we operate for less program continues to deliver efficiencies in stores, distribution centers and the home office.On the development front, ASDA opened 13 new stores in fiscal 2010 and relocated another two to larger locations. Of the new stores, three were ASDA Living stores. During the fourth quarter, three new stores were opened and one was relocated. As we enter the new year, ASDA has renewed its focus on EDLP with its largest ever rollback campaign. Given the uncertain economic outlook in the U.K., we remain confident that an EDLP strategy remains the best way to help our ASDA customers save money every day. In Mexico, Walmex continues to shine with sales growth gains in market share according to ANTAD and operational efficiency. In fact, Walmex continues to win on its plan to grow 50% faster than the market and gain market share from both formal and informal markets. At Walmex, fourth quarter sales increased 10.4% over last year, while comparable store sales grew 3.8%. Growth came from price campaigns, electronics and home lines. Traffic was up 3.8% with an average ticket essentially flat on price investment. Walmex same-store sales for self-service formats grew about 3.9% for the full year, while same-store sales for the industry, excluding Walmex, declined by 1.1%. Walmex reports separately its earnings under Mexican GAAP. We report our worldwide results using U.S. GAAP. Under U.S. GAAP, fourth quarter gross margin was relatively flat to last year, while operating expenses were leveraged down as a result of sustainable low-cost operating programs. Operating income growth at Walmex significantly outpaced sales growth. For the year, Walmex sales grew 10.4% and operating income grew even faster at 16.9%. Even with 275 new stores this fiscal year, expenses grew slower than sales at 8.1%.Wal-Mart Canada's fourth quarter sales grew 2.6% over last year, primarily due to the supercentre expansion program. We now operate 84 supercentres in Canada, exceeding our target of 83 for this fiscal year. Fourth quarter comparable store sales in Canada declined 1.1%, impacted by unseasonably mild winter weather, an H1N1 scare and an overall weak economy. Customer traffic was down 0.5% and average ticket was down 0.6% for the quarter. Overall, sales growth was led by food and consumables, partially offset by softer sales in apparel and general merchandise items.Canada's comparable store sales for the full year were essentially flat. Canada's fourth quarter gross margin increased slightly even with the shift in sales to lower margin items. This was a result of improved vendor terms. With well-managed expenses, operating income grew faster than sales. Moving south to Brazil, fourth quarter sales growth in Brazil was 14.6% with comparable store sales growth of 5.6%, both in real terms. Overall, customer traffic increased 6.3% and average ticket increased 7.8% in real terms. The best performances came from our cash-and-carry format, Maxxi, as well as Todo Dia, our soft-discount format. We opened 61 new Brazilian stores in the fourth quarter, bringing our total fiscal 2010 new store count to 91.Despite pressure from our new store growth program, expenses as a percentage of sales improved from last year. Operating income in Brazil grew slower than sales, due to margin pressure. Now moving on to Asia. In Japan, overall sales declined 1.7% in the fourth quarter over last year and comparable store sales declined 1.9%. Price investment and deflation had a negative effect on average ticket. Sales and comparable store sales in real terms for the fourth quarter both increased over last year. For the full year, comparable store sales increased 0.3%. We launched EDLP at Wal-Mart Japan when our customers needed it most in an economic slowdown. I'm proud to say that we're seeing a take hold as Wal-Mart Japan outperforms the market. As the year progresses, we will continue to expand EDLP across all categories. Food and apparel sales were down while general merchandise was up due to the EDLP shift, and gross margin was relatively flat. Expenses as a percentage of sales are down significantly from last year as EDLC focus generates cost savings from labor and productivity initiatives. I'm pleased to say that fourth quarter operating income at Wal-Mart Japan grew faster than sales. Rapid growth continued in China, with 14 new stores opened in the fourth quarter. This brings our total China store count to 279. Wal-Mart China's operations delivered a 4.8% positive comp sales growth over the fourth quarter of last year, driven by price leadership initiatives. Average ticket grew and traffic decreased slightly.Our combined China gross margin was down slightly from the fourth quarter of last year. However, operating income grew faster than sales, because of continued successes in controlling expenses with productivity and sustainability initiatives. Many of you are aware that our second close on the Trust-Mart acquisition was scheduled to occur this month. Due to the complex nature of the transaction, Wal-Mart and the selling shareholder of Trust-Mart have mutually agreed to delay the second closing until November 26, 2010, to allow the conclusion of several administrative conditions of the transaction. In the meantime, Wal-Mart and Trust-Mart continue to focus on their core mission, saving our Chinese customers money so they can live better. Whether we're talking about that first Sam's Club outside of Mexico City, or our 4,000th international store, Bompreco hyper which opened in Brazil during fiscal 2010, our international associates are committed to outperforming the market, focusing on price leadership and enhancing the productivity loop. Also, we can help our customers save money and live better. With this as our commitment, I'm confident that we can continue to strengthen our market presence and grow profitability in fiscal 2011. Now I'll turn it over to Brian for the update on Sam's Club. Brian?"

We continue to be pleased with the momentum at Sam's Club and I'm excited about sharing our results today. However, before I get started, it's important to note that the results I'm discussing today exclude charges related to the 10 club closures and the recently announced initiatives related to our demo and club membership rep programs. Now let's move to some highlights for the fourth quarter. We continue to see broad-based strong sales performance in fresh and health and wellness categories. More specifically, we had strong performance in numerous categories, including meat, produce, consumables, baby, pharmacy and OTC. I'm also pleased with the recent sales strength of our Apparel business, due in part to improved relevance and assortment driven by our merchandising team.Overall, comp traffic increased 40 basis points and comp ticket increased 30 basis points in the fourth quarter. The eValues program continues to drive strong plus membership income as upgrades to Plus continue to significantly outpace last year. I'm very pleased to report that Sam's Club leveraged operating expenses in Q4, with significant in-club efficiencies. At the same time, we continue to see improvement in our membership experience stores. Our focus on expense leverage is expected to continue as we move forward.Now let's turn to the overall financial results. For Q4, total sales for Sam's Club, excluding fuel, increased to $11.4 billion or an 80 basis point increase over last year. Including fuel, fourth quarter sales were $12.3 billion, which is a 3.8% increase, primarily due to cycling lower fuel prices from last year. Fuel prices in Q4 this year are approximately 44% higher than prices in Q4 last year. Club comp sales, excluding fuel for the 13-week period, increased 70 basis points. Including fuel, club comp sales increased 3.7%. Total Sam's Club sales for FY '10 excluding fuel, increased by 1.7% versus last year to $43.5 billion. Including fuel, sales for FY '10 were $46.7 billion, which is a decrease of 40 basis points versus last year, due primarily to lower fuel prices for the full year versus last year. For the fiscal year, comparable Club sales, excluding fuel, increased by 1.4%. For the fourth quarter, on an adjusted basis, operating income increased 9.4% versus last year to $479 million. However, we had a number of positive items in Q4 this year versus a number of negative items in Q4 last year, all that are individually insignificant. Collectively, if you exclude these items, operating income growth was only slightly positive for the quarter. Operating income for the full year was $1.7 billion, an increase of 2.4% versus $1.6 billion last year.In addition to the sales strength in fresh, health and wellness and apparel, we continue to see good mix and profit performance in other categories, such as grocery, seasonal and home. A few key categories including dairy, produce, meat and electronics continue to be impacted by deflation, which has been somewhat offset by strong unit growth. However, we expect that significant food deflation pressures will subside in the first half of the year. Additionally, tobacco continues to positively affect sales versus last year, primarily due to price increases. We're also pleased at the positive sell-through during the holidays on décor and seasonal foods. Big-ticket discretionary categories, such as furniture and jewelry, continue to face sales pressure, as members have tightened discretionary spending. Business members spending remained stressed during the quarter due to continued pressure on credit availability and the overall economic environment for many of our small business members.Inventory management continues to be very positive. We reduced inventory by 9.5% versus last year, although some of the reduction is due to deflation. We actively managed our seasonal transition and as mentioned, had excellent sell-through on apparel items. We are entering the new fiscal year in a strong inventory position. As mentioned earlier, overall comp traffic and ticket were up for the quarter. Advantage comp traffic, excluding fuel, was positive for the 13-week period, while Business comp traffic, excluding fuel, declined slightly. Business average ticket, excluding fuel, increased slightly for the 13-week period, while Advantage average ticket also excluding fuel was basically flat. Gross margin, excluding the impact of fuel, increased 19 basis points for the quarter, primarily driven by the continued shift in merchandise mix. Including fuel, gross margin for the fourth quarter declined 23 basis points, primarily due to cycling last year's lower fuel prices.As mentioned earlier, I'm very pleased with our progress on expense leverage and club efficiency. For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 4.1% and our club wages were roughly flat in dollar terms versus last year. I'm pleased that we continue to improve our in-club efficiencies. At the same time, we're improving our in-club experience. Because of our 5S program, which stands for sort, straighten, sanitize, standardize and sustain, we have more organization in our back rooms. This program is translating to less waste, higher associated engagement and higher productivity. I am very appreciative of the hard work of our club associates. Membership and other income for the fourth quarter increased slightly versus prior year. The increases continue to be primarily driven by Plus membership upgrades, due in part to eValue. For the full fiscal year, overall membership and other income decreased 1.5%. However, membership income for the year increased by 2.1% versus last year, with most of the improvement due to an accounting adjustment previously discussed in the third quarter.Other income other than membership income was down approximately 30% for the year. Other income last year was favorably impacted by a number of miscellaneous items, none of which was individually significant to the financial statements. The eValues program continued to drive strong Plus upgrades, while new sign-up performance was down versus last year. Renewal rates across the membership categories continue to be relatively flat, but with more renewals occurring in-club versus via mail. Add-on Business memberships continued to face headwinds given the challenges that many small business owners continue to face. We will continue to look for innovative ways to drive traffic renewals and upgrades of existing members.We have started the new fiscal year and we remain focused on providing value and quality to our members. The changes we recently announced in the fourth quarter, while difficult, are providing momentum for fiscal 2011. We continue to focus on quality merchandise, membership engagement, club efficiencies and member experience. Through valuable member insights, we continue to look to make the best choices, category by category for both our Advantage members and Business members. We are pleased with the early performance of project portfolio and we will continue to monitor and evaluate it to ensure we're improving the member experience and driving returns.We look to continue to leverage our existing member relationships, to grow our membership, as well as grow the basket with existing members. We will continue to increase our pace of remodels to better serve our members as we drive growth and returns. Despite the continuing challenging environment, we expect comp club sales without fuel for the current 13-week period from January 30, 2010, through April 30, 2010, to be flat plus or minus 1%. Our comp sales for this period last year were 4.2% without fuel. I will turn the program over to Tom for the report card and guidance discussion. Tom?"
313055,6334604,50663,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb-18-2010",2010-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Recall from our third quarter call in November, that our quarterly financial report card focuses on growth, leverage and returns. First, let's discuss growth. For the fourth quarter, we started cycling the exchange rate drops of last year a",861,"Thanks, Brian. Recall from our third quarter call in November, that our quarterly financial report card focuses on growth, leverage and returns. First, let's discuss growth. For the fourth quarter, we started cycling the exchange rate drops of last year and we actually saw a benefit from currency for the first time this year. However, this positive impact was small in comparison to the decrease we experienced for the full fiscal year. Let me point out that fiscal 2010 was an environment that was difficult to forecast and challenging in which to operate.Deflation across categories, such as food and electronics, as well as difficult comparisons, made top line growth tough. Net square footage grew by 3.7% since the end of last year to total square footage of more than 952 million square feet around the world. In fiscal year 2010, we continued our focus on capital efficiency, increasing capital outlays on remodels, building smaller supercentres and closing 10 underperforming Sam's Clubs. Although our square footage growth was just a touch shy of our forecast of 4%, we added 34 million net square feet of retail selling space this year. The additional square footage was done completely by organic growth since we did not have any acquisitions.Next topic is leverage. Leverage is, without a doubt, one of our strengths this quarter. We made a commitment in October to focus on expenses and in the fourth quarter, we made real progress. The company leveraged expenses in the fourth quarter, which directly reflects the underlying performance of all the segments. Each and every quarter going forward may not rival the results of this quarter but we have renewed commitment to the productivity loop in fiscal 2011 and beyond. Eduardo also shared with you that we're seeing early benefits of our global sourcing initiatives. We believe we are well-positioned to see the cost of goods sold come down, which will allow us to continue our price leadership and deliver healthy margins.Now let's move on to the final part of our report card. One of our goals is to provide consistency in pretax returns and strong free cash flow. Return on investment from continuing operations for the year ended January 31, 2010, was 19.3%. Let's pause the tape here and go back to what I discussed in October. I think my words were something like this. When you're in the zone of delivering 19% pretax returns and we do that consistently, we have a very compelling story. Again, a 19% return on invested capital is very, very attractive. I committed to you that we plan to keep our returns in the 19% zone and I'm proud to say we achieved this goal for the fiscal year. We actually went one step further than just achieving our goal, we managed to keep ROI flat from last year.I'm also extremely proud of our free cash flow generation for the year. We ended the fiscal year with free cash flow of more than $14 billion, an outstanding job in free cash flow. Integral to the free cash flow was strong inventory management across our segments. To demonstrate just how strong this performance was, I'll ask you to guess when the corporation actually reported an inventory level that was lower than fiscal 2010. The answer, fiscal 2006. Since then, the corporation has grown by nearly $100 billion in top line sales and operates today on basically the same inventory level. Inventory directly impacts free cash flow, ROI and it also allows our stores to continue to improve the customer experience they're delivering each and everyday. Our focus on growth, leverage and returns is in its early phases, but you can see these priorities are already starting to show results. Now let's move on to guidance. If you recall what Mike said earlier, our comparison to the first quarter of last year is tough for our U.S. businesses, and we still expect deflation in many categories and markets where we operate. However, we are expecting comparisons to get easier as the year progresses. Taking that into consideration, our guidance for earnings per share for the first quarter is $0.81 to $0.85, and our guidance for the full year is $3.90 to $4 a share, both of which are in line with current First Call estimates. Earnings guidance assumes that we will see currency exchange rates basically at the same levels we see today.You heard many strong results across our business today. We're confident that our strategies around the world will help further improve top line sales and comps as we continue to deliver on our mission to save people money, so they can live better. In closing, I'd like to summarize a few key points. We had strong underlying operating performance that allowed us to exceed earnings expectations. Free cash flow generation continues to be an incredibly positive story. In the fourth quarter, we delivered improvements in expense management. We will continue to make it a priority to leverage SG&A throughout the entire organization.Our focus on growth, leverage and returns to drive shareholder value has never been stronger. Thank you for listening today and we really appreciate your interest in Wal-Mart."

A full transcript of this call will be available on the website after 7 a.m. Central Time on May 18, 2010.
Our executive team is ready to report on our first quarter results of fiscal 2011. Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will cover the key highlights of our quarterly results; Charles Holley, Executive Vice President of Finance and Treasurer, has the details behind the consolidated financial results. Then we go to the operating segment leaders: Eduardo Castro-Wright, Vice Chairman, responsible for Wal-Mart U.S. global sourcing and global.com, will share the updates on our largest business segment and sourcing; Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart International, will cover results for the International segment and our six largest markets by revenue; Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam's Club, has results for our Warehouse Club segment; Tom Schoewe, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will round out the call with an update on SAP, our company's financial report card and, of course, Q2 earnings guidance.
But first, let me cover some important changes we have made to our internal management reporting that affects our segment reporting beginning February 1, 2010, the start of our fiscal year. These changes only impact our segment reporting and do not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we mentioned in our 2010 annual report, from time to time, we've revised the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations. These revisions generally are made because of alignment changes within the organization, or cost allocations designed to drive greater accountability. When we make these measurement changes, the segment operating income for each segment affected by the revision is restated for all periods presented to maintain comparability. 
During the first quarter, we made two significant changes. First, certain information systems expenses, or what we refer to as ISD [Information Systems Division], previously included in unallocated corporate overhead, are now being charged to the segment that is driving these costs. This cost allocation will drive greater accountability for our overall technology expenses, it will improve the utilization of our information systems resources and it will improve productivity. 
Second, as part of our operational realignment, our Puerto Rico operations moved from the International segment to the respective Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam's Club segments. The Wal-Mart U.S. segment now includes the company's mass merchant concept in the United States and Puerto Rico, operating primarily under the varying Wal-Mart brands, as well as walmart.com. The Sam's Club segment now includes the warehouse membership clubs in the United States and Puerto Rico, as well as samsclub.com. The International segment now includes the company's operations outside the United States and Puerto Rico.
As a result of these two changes, we have restated our segment reporting for all periods presented to reflect the comparability for the realignment and cost allocations. Additionally, Wal-Mart U.S. has moved the Outdoor Living and Seasonal portfolios into the Home SBU from Hardlines. This shift was made as of February 1, because the merchandise better aligns from the customer perspective to these SBUs. Effective with the second quarter, the Baby category is moving to the Grocery SBU from Apparel. 
One other item I want to mention is one that did not impact the first quarter, but you will see when we report our results for the second quarter on August 17. As we have previously mentioned, in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we began a staged implementation of our new financial system. The implementation's first stage was ASDA, our U.K. subsidiary. The second stage was in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada and was implemented starting May 1, 2010.
In connection with the second stage of that implementation and coinciding with the improvements available in our new financial systems, we revised our methodology for valuing inventory under the retail method of inventory accounting. Specifically, we've improved our ability to measure inventory at more granular levels. The systems change will better align the accounting for inventory components with how the merchants run their businesses. As a result, the aggregation of certain inventory groups now occurs at lower levels, which produces a different cost valuation for the affected inventory.
As I mentioned, this change became effective as of May 1, 2010, and will be reflected in the financial statements in the second quarter and for all prior periods presented. This change is not expected to have a significant impact on the results of operations on a going-forward basis. 
Now Mike, let's get started with our earnings news."
313055,79163617,61967,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May-18-2010",2010-05-18,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Wal-Mart kicked off fiscal year 2011 with record net sales and EPS for the first quarter. Across the business, our teams delivered on our commitment to the productivity loop, which drives ongoing value for custome",739,"Thank you, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Wal-Mart kicked off fiscal year 2011 with record net sales and EPS for the first quarter. Across the business, our teams delivered on our commitment to the productivity loop, which drives ongoing value for customers and shareholders. We are managing expenses tightly and investing those savings in our everyday price leadership to drive additional growth, leverage and returns.
Let me get right to the numbers for the total company. Today, we are reporting first quarter earnings per share of $0.88, $0.03 above our own guidance and First Call consensus. Net sales in the first quarter were just over $99 billion, a 6% increase over last year. Operating income for the company was up more than 10% this quarter, with strong relative contributions from each of our operating segments. For the second quarter in a row, we leveraged expenses as a company. Every operating segment and corporate leveraged the expenses, and we plan to continue delivering on our promise to grow operating expenses slower than sales. The quality of our balance sheet remains world-class and reflects the strength of our underlying businesses.
Now let me move to the highlights of the individual operating segments. First, Wal-Mart U.S. had a first quarter comp of negative 1.4%, which was below guidance. Strong management and the structural changes the Wal-Mart U.S. team put in place have enabled it to leverage expenses and deliver strong profitability and returns. Operating income was up 5.6%, growing faster than sales. 
Eduardo and his team have a good understanding of the various internal and external factors associated with our customer traffic. A number of economic pressures, including gas prices and ongoing concerns about unemployment, continue to affect key segments of retail, and this is especially true for Wal-Mart's core customer.
There are a number of steps Wal-Mart U.S. is taking to improve top line sales. As you will hear from Eduardo in a moment, Wal-Mart U.S. has already taken some actions, focused on price leadership and product assortment. It is important to strengthen Wal-Mart's position as the everyday price leader and to separate ourselves even more from competitors. We are in the process of adding back some merchandise that has been deleted from our assortment. These changes are on a fast track and the impact will become even more noticeable as we progress through this fiscal year.
Sam's Club delivered a 0.7% positive comp sales without fuel, and those results are on top of a very strong comp last year. Sam's also increased operating income more than 9%. The structural changes at Sam's made earlier this year, along with improved merchandise quality and enhanced membership initiatives, contributed to a very good quarter. I believe Sam's is well-positioned for the year ahead. 
International continues to be our fastest growing division and an increasingly important contributor to our business. Sales grew by more than 21%, almost 9% on a constant currency basis, exceeding $25 billion in the first quarter, and profit grew even faster than sales. This performance shows the strength of our EDLC [every day low cost]-EDLP [every day low price] model around the world. International leveraged operating expenses for the fifth consecutive quarter and most countries continue to improve their inventory management.
As we look to the future, we're pleased with the long-term opportunities in the emerging markets, especially as economies in those regions improve. We particularly see substantial growth ahead in Mexico, China and Brazil, and a large part of our capital expenditure budget is committed to those markets. We continue to grow. More than 60% of the additional square footage of retail selling space this quarter was within Wal-Mart International. We expect to have even more store openings throughout the company in the second and third quarters. 
A final thought before I close. Whether I visit with customers in our stores, or with other CEOs, or with leaders in Washington, people want to hear our views on the economy and how businesses can help solve the issues facing consumers today. Our associates appreciate the recognition that Wal-Mart receives for so many contributions around the world. Our mission of saving people money so that they can live better, gives us a unique ability to understand and truly care for the needs of people. We know this is what our customers expect of us, and it's what we will always expect of ourselves. 
Now Charles will cover the detailed financial results. Charles?"
313055,79163617,61967,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May-18-2010",2010-05-18,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. For the first quarter of fiscal 2011, our earnings from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart were $3.3 billion, or $0.88 per share. This is a 9.7% increase from the $3 billion reported in the first quarter last year. Earnings per s",910,"Thanks, Mike. For the first quarter of fiscal 2011, our earnings from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart were $3.3 billion, or $0.88 per share. This is a 9.7% increase from the $3 billion reported in the first quarter last year. Earnings per share this quarter included a $0.02 per share benefit from currency exchange rate translation. We are very pleased that our EPS of $0.88 per share exceeded both our guidance of $0.81 to $0.85 per share and the First Call estimate by $0.03. 
Overall, consolidated net sales increased by 6% to $99.1 billion for the quarter. This was driven by growth from Wal-Mart International and helped by a currency benefit of $2.5 billion. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales would have increased 3.3%. The 13-week total U.S. comparable store sales, without fuel, declined 1.1%. You'll hear more details on the Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam's comp sales from Eduardo and Brian. 
First quarter consolidated operating income was $5.8 billion, up 10.6% over last year and up 8.4% on a constant currency basis. Our strong results were driven by great expense management for the quarter. Expenses grew 3.9% on our 6% sales growth. As Mike mentioned earlier, the focus on the productivity loop resulted in the company, including our three operating segments in corporate, leveraging expenses. We now have leveraged operating expenses for two consecutive quarters.
Corporate, or unallocated corporate overhead, decreased to $390 million, a decline of 8% from last year. As Carol mentioned earlier, the unallocated corporate overhead now excludes the allocation of various systems cost to the business segments. 
Consolidated gross margin declined eight basis points due to a change in mix between the segments. Our gross margin of 24.6% at the end of the first quarter is still very healthy. Each of the operating segments will provide more gross margin details later in the call. 
Inventory grew 3.2% for the company compared to the end of the first quarter last year and on a 6% sales increase. Wal-Mart U.S. and Wal-Mart International contributed to the increase in inventory, primarily due to the comparisons versus last year's significant inventory reduction. You will hear more about this from Eduardo and Doug. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 34.6%. We expect the tax rate for fiscal 2011 to be between 34% and 35% and we will see some quarterly fluctuations. Factors, which may impact our rate, include changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. Consolidated membership and other income decreased 2.6% to $751 million. The decline was primarily driven by a decrease in other income from Wal-Mart U.S. 
The company ended the quarter with a negative free cash flow of $1.6 billion versus the positive free cash flow of nearly $1 billion at the same time last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was affected by the comparison to our significant inventory reduction program last year, especially in the Wal-Mart U.S. segment, which decreased inventory to fiscal 2006 levels. The inventory increase at the end of this quarter negatively impacted free cash flow by more than $2 billion. We believe our inventory is in line with our current business needs.
Our payables-to-inventory ratio was 88.4% this year, up from 83% at the end of the first quarter last year. This ratio increased due to segment mix and better payables management by the International segment. 
One additional item on the cash flow statement that I'd like to cover is the increased short-term borrowings. This is primarily due to the SAP implementation. We increased our short-term borrowing of commercial paper to ensure we had a buildup of cash in place for accounts payables due to the systems transition to SAP. We aggregated payments for the week of May 3 into the first day of the week, instead of our normal process of paying throughout the week.
Return on investment or ROI was 19.1%, up from 18.7% at the same time last year because of the improvement in adjusted operating income, the timing of our Chilean acquisition and the accrual for the settlement of the 63 wage-and-hour class-action lawsuits in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009. Tom will further discuss our returns as part of our financial report card later in the call. 
Our CapEx program this year includes both new stores and remodeling initiatives. Capital expenditures of $2.6 billion were about the same as the first quarter last year. Our balance sheet allows us to follow our strategic priorities and invest where needed. Its strength allows us to maintain a AA credit rating and have excellent access to credit markets. 
Our debt-to-total capitalization ratio at the end of the quarter was 41.4%, slightly up from the 41% last year. During the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we repurchased a record $3 billion of shares, representing 55.6 million shares. As of April 30, we have approximately $6.2 billion remaining on our $15 billion share repurchase program.
On March 4, we announced an increase in our dividend to $1.21, an 11% increase over last year. As a result, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends for the quarter. The combination of dividends and share repurchase, or what we return to shareholders, totaled $4.1 billion this quarter and compares to approximately $2 billion in the same quarter last year.
Now let's move on to a discussion of our operating segments. We'll start with Eduardo and Wal-Mart U.S. Eduardo?"
313055,79163617,61967,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May-18-2010",2010-05-18,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Charles. Our results for the quarter were mixed.

While operating profit gr",1685,"Thank you, Charles. Our results for the quarter were mixed. As Mike mentioned previously, the structural changes we've put in place earlier this year enabled us to leverage expenses and delivered strong profitability and returns. While operating profit grew significantly faster than sales, top line sales were lower than expected. 
Net sales were up 1.1% for the first quarter. Comp sales for the period were down 1.4% for the 13-week period. The entire comp decline this quarter was due to traffic, as average ticket was positive. There are a number of factors that we believe affected sales and traffic: the economy, deflation, competitive environment and merchandise assortments.
Rising gas prices and high unemployment levels continue to be the most pressing issues for our core customer. Gas prices are up 41% over this time last year. Our in-depth analysis reinforced the fact that there is a strong correlation between store comps and unemployment. Stores in areas with the highest increase in unemployment are running approximately 200 basis points lower comps than those with the lowest. 
We also have noticed changes in the spending patterns of our customer base. For example, the use of assistance-based funds like food stamps or EBT [electronic benefit transfers] for food purchases has increased significantly over last year's first quarter.
In our monthly survey of Wal-Mart moms, they acknowledged that they are spending less, especially on discretionary items, and have reduced their number of trips to our stores to offset gas prices. They also have made other changes to their household budgets. In fact, the growth in average ticket this quarter was up more than 200 basis points over the fourth quarter, so customers are stocking up when they are in our stores. 
As expected, deflation abated somewhat during the quarter primarily in food, but it is still a headwind. We expect this to turn around in the near future. In addition, we're seeing increased price competition, primarily in consumable categories. 
We launched a new rollback initiative with the objective of further increasing our price caps. This particular rollback campaign will remain in place for at least the next 90 days, as we vigorously defend our price leadership position in the market. We're driving price leadership even more by increasing basket separation. For instance, we announced last week that rollbacks on pantry essentials are 14% lower than the lowest advertised prices across the market. 
Let me share an example of the significance of this rollback program on a group of key pantry items in consumables and grocery. We selected 12 iconic branded products that consumers recognize. With regular pricing, the items are $44. The lowest advertised price across the market during the last 52 weeks was $34. Now, at Wal-Mart, those same items are $29, saving the Wal-Mart customer as much as $15.
As Mike mentioned earlier, we completed fine-tuning our merchandise assortment strategy to ensure we have the right products for our customers in every store. For example, we added back approximately 300 items in grocery. We continue to react to ongoing feedback from customers to ensure we have the products that they rely on from Wal-Mart. 
Now let me get back to the remainder of the first quarter financial results. Operating income grew at a faster rate than sales, up 5.6% for the quarter on a 1.1% sales increase. Our gross margin percentage remained flat year-over-year for the quarter. As I told you before, for the past three years, we have been adjusting our inventory levels and cleaned up our stores, which had a strong positive impact on the customer's shopping experience and on operating performance. 
Inventory grew approximately the same rate as sales in the most recent quarter. We feel that this rate of growth is appropriate for our business, and we will continue to manage our inventory growth as necessary to take care of our customers and drive shareholder value. 
I'm very pleased with the way we managed expenses during the quarter. In a period where sales increased 1.1%, we managed to decrease SG&A expense by 70 basis points. This was driven by a 5.9% increase in labor productivity in our stores. At the same time, we improved our customer experience scores. 
Group health expenses have moderated from last year and did not affect the quarter expense comparison. We also had an absolute dollar reduction in Wal-Mart U.S. overhead, driven by our organization structural changes. 
In conjunction with our rollback program, we stepped up advertising and marketing efforts. Additionally, we increased our in-store communications to reinforce our price leadership message. As a result, expenses for advertising were up significantly over last year's first quarter. 
Other income for the Wal-Mart segment was down. Last year, other income was positively impacted by a number of miscellaneous items, none of which was individually significant to the financial statements.
Now let me cover some trends from our business units. As I said before, full deflation began to moderate during the quarter in areas like dairy, meat and produce. Comp store sales results were solid compared to the market, and we maintained a double-digit price gap versus competition across multiple categories. Snacks, beverages, produce, seafood and dairy all had comp increases, while dry grocery and consumables were soft. 
Comps in Health and Wellness were solid. Our Pharmacy business remains strong, and we continue to outperform the competition in this area. Maintenance and wellness categories, such as vitamins and adult nutrition, are generating consistently strong comps. Let me remind you that in the second quarter, we're up against last year's headwind of strong sales from H1N1-related products.
Our Entertainment comp sales were negative as we experienced mixed results by category. We continue to see strong performance in large panel TVs with new LED technology, in laptops and in wireless. We also benefited from a favorable DVD release schedule compared to last year. In toys, which are also included in the Entertainment business unit, sales of bicycles and ride-on vehicles continued to do very well and exceeded plans. On the other hand, video games and game hardware were below expectations across all the gaming brands, due to fewer new releases and the lack of innovation in gaming systems. 
In Hardlines, we were disappointed with the performance of our seasonal categories and Stationery. Do-it-yourself automotive continues to do well as consumers work to extend the useful life of their vehicles. Our Stationery business, which includes books and magazines, was impacted by the anniversary of the Twilight series launch. 
In Home, results were mixed overall, with momentum in categories like outdoor living, bedding, home management and food preparation. Weather drove mixed results on sales, most notably around Valentine's Day. Seasonal sales continue to occur closer toward the actual event. 
Our Apparel performance remained below expectations and continues to be a work in progress for our team. However, some of the bright spots are activewear, licensed apparel and team sports. Our Men's business, which was relatively better than other categories, was driven by active, t-shirts and shorts. Our Apparel inventory remains in good shape.
Wal-Mart Financial Services continues to build on its momentum with strong results in check-cashing, primarily as a result of customers cashing tax refund checks. Sales of the $3 MoneyCard continue to increase. 
Walmart.com had another outstanding quarter, delivering comp growth of more than 50%, which outpaced industry averages by a wide margin.  Traffic, orders, average order size and conversion were all up. Our rollback program applies to our online business as well.
Now, I will briefly update you on some of our business initiatives. The new field organization that we discussed in February was fully operational by the end of this quarter. We expect additional productivity gains from this organization, as well as the benefits that will come from the newly established approach to talent development. We remain pleased with the progress of the project impact remodels. Merchandise categories including electronics, baby, home, fresh and seasonal are showing sales improvements with the new layouts. We have previously said that remodeling efforts this year are significantly above historical levels and that we will remodel more than 550 Wal-Mart stores this year. Remodels completed last year are running a positive 200 basis points relative comp sales improvement compared to the rest of the chain.
We expect the benefit from these remodels to grow in the coming months when the bulk of them will be completed. By the fourth quarter, when the remodel activity stops for the year, we expect this effect to provide noticeable benefits to our results, since half the remodeled stores will be in our comp base.
We also are pleased with the progress we are making on our global sourcing initiatives, and the savings goals we have set for this year are tracking well. Our global merchandising centers have already started to produce reductions in our cost of goods. All of the centers are now in place and are quickly building resources and addressing business needs. As expected, we are leveraging our global footprint to reduce costs. We also expect to see improvements in product timelines as the year progresses. 
We remain somewhat cautious about the second quarter. Gas prices and unemployment will continue to influence how our core customers shop with us. On the other hand, the recent changes we've made to our assortment, food inflation and our price leadership through rollbacks should result in a favorable reaction from customers.
Finally, I'm very proud of the announcement we made last week about our commitment to fight hunger in the United States. Our $2 billion of support through cash and in-kind donations for the Fighting Hunger Together program will help us reach our goal where no individual in this country should needlessly suffer from hunger.
I will close out the Wal-Mart U.S. discussion with our comp guidance. Our 13-week comp for the second quarter last year declined 1.5%. We expect a slight improvement from this level and are now forecasting a comp range of negative 2% to positive 1% for the 13-week period from May 1 through July 30, 2010. 
Now, we will switch to Doug to hear about our International business. Doug?"

As Mike pointed out, we continue our fast-paced growth, increasing both sales and square footage. Because we've revised our reporting structure for Puerto Rico, these numbers exclude Puerto Rico for both this year and last year. We met our goal to grow profit faster than sales and we continue to leverage expenses. 
I'm also proud of the strategic work and accomplishments of our management teams and our associates and colleagues throughout the organization. Our three-pronged strategy remains on track. First, growth by winning locally. The leaders in our markets have the freedom to ensure relevance for our customers and to move with speed. Second, leverage costs by enabling the productivity loop. We operate for less, buy for less and sell for less, and leverage the knowledge and expertise of our talent by sharing and implementing best practices across the entire organization. And finally, balancing returns with growth by managing our portfolio, including thoughtful capital allocation between our emerging and mature markets. 
Our commitment to our save money, live better mission has never been stronger throughout our worldwide team. Beyond our price leadership, we also have many initiatives in our markets to help our customers become more sustainable in their own lives, and I'll cover a few of these examples today. The commitment to the live better side of our mission is being executed in many ways, from how we build our stores and transport products to how we deliver more environmentally friendly products for our customers. But even more important, our commitment to sustainability also helps reduce our own costs across many areas of the business.
Let's move on to our financial results for the first quarter. International net sales for the first quarter were $25 billion, an increase of 21.4% from last year. Sales were positively impacted by $2.5 billion from the relative strengthening of many currencies against the dollar. Sales on a constant currency basis were $22.5 billion, an 8.9% increase over last year's first quarter. Our constant currency sales increase for the first quarter is due primarily to strong underlying performances in Mexico, Canada, Brazil and China. In addition, for reporting purposes, this first quarter includes three full months of our Chilean operations. Last year's first quarter included only two months. As a result, constant currency sales, excluding Chile, grew 7.5% over last year. 
International's operating income for the first quarter was $1.1 billion, up 27.8% from last year and an increase of 13.9% on a constant currency basis. So operating income grew faster than sales despite the headwind from a $26 million charge, net of insurance, related to the recent earthquake in Chile. Operating income excluding Chile's total results, grew 22.6% over last year on a constant currency basis when compared to the 13.9% growth including Chile. 
In the first quarter, we continued the trend of the recent four quarters and leveraged our constant currency expenses. Expense savings and leverage in Japan and China were partially offset by headwinds in other countries. On a constant currency basis, gross margin increased slightly in the first quarter while other income slightly declined as a percentage of sales. As for inventory, we continue to make good progress, with most of our markets reducing days on hand over last year.
Now let's get into the results for several of our markets. Before we do, let me remind you that we hold country management accountable for their results on a local currency basis, without the impact of potential swings in exchange rates. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency fluctuations. 
In the United Kingdom, I was proud to announce that Andy Clarke will be assuming the role of ASDA CEO. Andy will lead efforts to become an even better food retailer, a broader non-food retailer and a leader in e-commerce. Andy has had a long career at ASDA, working first as a store manager, followed by key roles in merchandising, as Retail Director and most recently, as Chief Operating Officer. Andy not only has depth of experience but he has strong leadership skills that will help take our business in the U.K. to another level. For the last five years, we've been for our very fortunate to have Andy Bond as ASDA CEO. Andy will now take his post as Chairman of ASDA's Executive Committee, helping ensure a smooth leadership transition at ASDA, and also working on business opportunities for Wal-Mart in the region.  
In the first quarter, ASDA sales grew in the low single digits while comp sales without fuel declined 0.3%. According to Kantar Worldpanel, retail food sales slowed significantly in the first quarter, and as ASDA's market share dropped slightly in the 12 weeks ending April 19. Operating income grew faster than sales. ASDA's gross margin increased in the first quarter on a mix shift towards higher margin George and general merchandise. Expenses as a percentage of sales were approximately flat to last year. The We Operate for Less cost-saving program continues to deliver efficiencies in stores, distribution centers and the home office. 
I know many of you traveled to the U.K. last month to see our ASDA stores and hear about our strategy for growth, leverage and returns in the U.K. I'm pleased to report we're beginning to see good progress on many of the strategic initiatives presented. On EDLP, ASDA has recently moved to a record price position, lower promotional content and launched the internet-based ASDA price guarantee. On George, the launch of the 100-day quality guarantee has helped drive outperformance to the market and a record conversion of ASDA shoppers. On e-commerce, online growth was 38% in the quarter, and we recently announced a second dedicated home shopping center and completed the nationwide rollout of the Order Online, Collect in Store service. On new formats, we opened three small-format supermarkets and one new ASDA Living in the quarter.
ASDA has recently made good progress towards their strategic goals. I'm confident that our strong leadership team, led by Andy Clarke, will continue this progress and deliver positive sales momentum for the remainder of the year.
Moving on to Mexico. In February, Wal-Mart de Mexico purchased 100% of Wal-Mart Central America, our majority-owned subsidiary with operations in five Central American countries. Through this transaction, we expect to better leverage the Walmex expertise and growth story into our operations in Central America. To be consistent with how Walmex presents comparable information, the discussion here on Mexico represents only the results from Walmex. 
As a reminder, Walmex reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP and we report our worldwide results using U.S. GAAP. Although consumer spending in Mexico continues to be cautious, our discretionary formats had a solid first quarter. Additionally, Walmex's improved inventory management has led to higher gross margins in our self-service formats, due to a better inventory mix and fewer markdowns. All of this contributed to fourth quarter sales growth of approximately 11% and comparable store sales growth of 4.4%.
All of Walmex's formats are performing well. Customer count was up 17.2% in total and 5.3% at comparable stores. Walmex same-store sales for self-service formats grew by 4%. ANTAD's same-store sales for the industry, excluding Walmex, grew by 1.2%. 
First quarter gross margin grew 89 basis points to last year, while operating expenses as a percentage of sales grew 37 basis points. Although not enough to stall the growth in operating income, expenses grew faster than sales at 14.3% as a result of last year's rapid expansion. With more stores, both depreciation and rent expenses have increased year-over-year. Operating income growth at Walmex significantly outpaced sales growth at 17.4%. 
Walmex was the country's only retailer recognized as a socially-responsible company by the Mexican Center for philanthropy and the Alliance for Social Responsibility. Our commitments to reducing energy consumption in our own operations have also been extended to Central America.
Moving north to Canada, Wal-Mart Canada's first quarter sales growth, excluding the impact of last year's closures of six Sam's Clubs, was 4.9%. This is twice that of the market and represents a record high in market share, according to Statistics Canada data. We attribute a good portion of our sales improvement to the Supercenter expansion. We have opened 32 more Supercenters in operation than at this quarter last year, and we're on track to add between 35 and 40 Supercenters this fiscal year. Additionally, our margins are benefiting from last year's initiatives aimed at improving customer experience and productivity. Now more than ever, we're able to offer Canadian customers more choices in merchandise at the right price. 
First quarter comparable store sales in Canada grew 1%, with customer traffic up 0.4% and average ticket up 0.6%. Overall sales growth was led by Hardlines, health and wellness, and food and consumables, partially offset by softer sales in entertainment items. 
Canada's first quarter gross margin increased to 101 basis points even with the shift in sales to lower-margin items. This was the result of improved private brand sales and improved supplier negotiations. Although expenses grew faster than sales at a rate of 6.2% due to timing of new store projects, operating income grew 18.8% much faster than sales on better sales volumes, mix and supplier terms. 
Our Canada team continues to incorporate sustainability initiatives into our supercenter expansion program, with a rooftop solar system in Ontario and our sustainable distribution center in Balzac, Alberta, which opens this fall. These kinds of initiatives reduce costs, which benefit customers, shareholders and the environment.
Now down to Brazil. Earlier, I mentioned our strategy of thoughtful allocation of capital in markets like Brazil. Since March of last year, we've opened 95 new stores in Brazil, including four in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Brazil's first quarter sales growth was 16.5% and comparable store sales grew 7.6%, both in real terms. Customer traffic at comparable stores declined 2% and average ticket increased 9.6% in real terms. The best performances came from our cash and carry format supermarkets, as well as our soft discount format. 
Gross margin as a percentage of sales declined slightly, and expenses as a percent of sales were relatively flat to last year, even after adding a significant number of new stores at the end of last year. 
Now moving onto Asia. In Japan, overall sales and comparable store sales both declined by about 1.4% in the first quarter over last year. Comparable store sales in real terms were essentially flat to last year. Price investment and deflation had a negative effect on average ticket, but EDLP continues to increase customer traffic. Food and apparel sales were down while general merchandise was up. Expenses as a percentage of sales are down significantly from last year due to our continued execution of EDLC in support of the EDLP initiative. 
We opened five more stores in China in this first quarter, for a total of 38 new stores in the last 12 months. This brings our total China store count to 284. Total China sales increased 19.6% over first quarter of last year with comparable store sales growth of 10.6% driven by our price leadership. Average ticket grew significantly, but traffic declined as our Chinese customers bought more each trip. Our combined China gross margin was down slightly from the first quarter of last year. However, operating income grew faster than sales because of investments we made into energy efficiency and labor productivity programs. Our store associates are operating much more efficiently, and we have reduced our logistics expenses as a percentage of sales. China remains a key focus of organic growth and continues to deliver impressive growth and operating income.
We continue to be very excited and optimistic about the future in India. We have an important business relationship supporting the 60-plus stores owned by Bharti Retail. We also have opened two Best Price Modern Wholesale cash and carry stores in India in the last year. Our associates are also making a difference in the community, educating farmers about improved agricultural prices and giving them incentives for producing a good quality farm product.
Before we move on to Sam's, let me mention Chile. As you know, on February 27, more than 1 million Chilean households were damaged in an 8.8 magnitude earthquake. The rapid response from our associates was amazing. Most of our stores were returned quickly to operational status. We announced a $1 million donation to relief efforts within 12 hours of the initial quake, and an additional $1.1 million in cash and in-kind donations have been provided from Wal-Mart operations around the world to nonprofits working on relief efforts. 
I'm proud of the efforts of our team in Chile. Their devotion to their community and our Chilean customers is remarkable. I'm also proud of our Wal-Mart teams around the world who have donated their time and money to the relief efforts there. Our people truly do make a difference. 
Now I'll turn it over to Brian for an update on Sam's Club. Brian?"

Before I discuss our detailed financial results, I'd like to start with some highlights of a solid first quarter, as we continue to make progress toward our corporate priorities of growth, leverage and returns. 
We posted positive comp sales for the 13-week period on top of a very strong 4.2% comp last year. We leveraged expenses for the second straight quarter. I'm very proud of what is being accomplished by our dedicated club managers and club associates, as well as our newly formed innovation team, which is leading our efforts in improving club productivity and expense control. 
Sales in many of our largest categories continue to be strong versus last year, including meat, produce, HBA and pharmacy. Our merchandising team continues to respond to our members' wishes by adding exciting new products in the club at a great value.
eValues continues to drive strong Plus membership penetration. Our new demo program, Taste and Tips, is now fully underway in our clubs, and both our members and we are pleased with these changes. 
During the quarter, we also began rolling out our new platform for samsclub.com, which gives members enhanced functionality and speed. We also announced a new field organizational structure, which will place our senior operations executives, along with our regional support teams, in key locations throughout the country. This will bring them even closer to our members, associates and local communities.
Now let's turn to the detailed financial results. For the first quarter, net sales for Sam's Club, excluding fuel, increased to $10.8 billion, which is a 1.3% increase over last year. Including fuel, first quarter sales were $11.7 billion, which is a 4.6% increase versus last year, primarily due to significantly higher fuel prices this year versus last year. Fuel prices in the first quarter this year are approximately 41% higher than prices in Q1 last year. Club comp sales, excluding fuel, for the 13-week period increased 70 basis points. Including fuel, club comp sales increased 3.9%. 
Overall comp ticket was up for the quarter. Advantage and business comp traffic, excluding fuel, declined for the 13-week period. Both business and advantage average ticket, excluding fuel, increased for the 13-week period. Operating income grew at a rate faster than sales this quarter, again as it did last quarter. Q1 operating income increased 9.2% versus last year to $429 million.
Gross margin, excluding the impact of fuel, increased five basis points for the first quarter, primarily driven by the continued shift in merchandising mix. Including fuel, gross margin for the quarter declined by 26 basis points, primarily due to higher fuel prices this year. 
Inventory management continues to be very positive. We reduced inventory by 6.1% versus last year. While I'm proud of our continuing strong performance, we continue to be mindful of maintaining the right balance between solid inventory management and ensuring we have the right products members want when they shop. In addition to the sales strength in many of our fresh and health and wellness categories, we continue to see healthy margin mix and profit performance in other categories such as apparel, home, seasonal and automotive. 
During my weekly club visits, I am seeing more and more of our members shopping our seasonal categories, including grills, patio and outdoor plants. We are seeing abatement in broad-based deflation and in fact, have experienced some inflation in a few categories like dairy and meat. Additionally, tobacco continues to positively affect sales versus last year, primarily due to industrywide price increases, although we have now cycled many of the larger price increases from last year.
On a positive note, we see strength in comp unit sales for items with price points greater than $150, such as jewelry and mattresses, where we offer great brands at exceptional values. While we continue to see good market demand for home electronics, our performance was not as strong as we would have liked in the first quarter. We were not positioned optimally from an inventory standpoint due to some industrywide shortages on flat panels, as well as due to inventory transition to newer technology like LED TVs. We are now in a better position, having the latest technology from LG, Samsung and Vizio, and we're experiencing improved performance at the start of the second quarter.
While the economic environment is improving somewhat, our business members continue to be pressured by high unemployment and reduced credit availability, and this is showing in some of our office product categories. 
We now have 14 Project Portfolio clubs complete and another 49 under construction. As you will recall, Project Portfolio is a test we have underway to increase the assortment of highly productive merchandise categories like fresh and health and wellness in our clubs. We're pleased with some of our early results and we'll continue to update you on our progress. 
As mentioned earlier, I'm very pleased with our progress on expense leverage and club efficiency. For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 1.4% and our club wages were down versus last year. We also are having excellent expense control in utilities, supplies and maintenance. We also continued to improve our in-club efficiencies at the same time we are improving our in-club experience. Units per labor hour have increased approximately 4% for the first quarter versus last year.
Beginning in April, in response to the continuing challenging credit environment, we began paying an interchange fee in conjunction with our rewards credit program. Despite this, we were still able to leverage expenses during the quarter. This will continue to be a headwind for us the rest of the fiscal year. 
Membership income, the largest portion of membership and other income, increased 2.5%, driven primarily by Plus membership upgrades. Renewal rates across membership categories are holding steady. Membership and other income for the first quarter decreased 3% versus the prior year due to a decline in other income. Add-on Business memberships still face headwinds given the challenges that many small-business owners are encountering. We will continue to look for innovative ways to drive traffic, renewals and upgrades of existing numbers. 
As we are now in the second quarter, we're focused on a number of efforts to drive value for our members and shareholders. We are very focused on maintaining our value perception with members in this very dynamic pricing environment. We continue to increase our reliance on valuable member insights as we make merchandising choices for our members. We will continue to focus on expense leverage, while balancing that with maintaining a positive shopping environment for our members. Finally, but most importantly, we are focused on driving comp club sales and increasing our sales productivity. While we maintain positive comps, we have much more we can and will do. 
Despite the challenging environment, we expect comp club sales without fuel, for the current 13-week period from May 1, 2010 through July 30, 2010, to be flat, plus or minus 1% versus positive 60 basis point comps last year for the comparable period. 
I will turn the program over to Tom for the report card and guidance discussion. Tom?"

Recall that for a number of quarters, we have been talking about finance transformation and the implementa",843,"Thanks, Brian. Before I get into our financial report card and report on growth leverage and returns, let me update you on our SAP implementation. 
Recall that for a number of quarters, we have been talking about finance transformation and the implementation of SAP. You know from our discussion last year that the implementation of SAP in the U.K. went smooth smoothly. On May 1, we began implementing SAP throughout North America, that's excluding Mexico and Central America. And so far, we have not encountered any major roadblocks. I'm proud of the team. In fact, by the end of this month, more than 8,000 associates in North America will be using our new system. Our success should be attributed to the time our associate teams have invested to make sure that we do it efficiently, as well as leveraging what we learned from ASDA in the UK.
As part of our global finance transformation, we have expanded the responsibilities within our existing U.S.-based Wal-Mart financial shared services organization to include Canada and Puerto Rico. Local transactional processes within core finance areas will transition in phases throughout the year. Additionally, we recently implemented a centralized contact center for all three countries providing suppliers and associates with an expanded scope of services for financial inquiries. These transformational changes allow us to: one, leverage knowledge and resources; two, increase efficiency; and finally, provide cost-effective financial processes.
Now let's move on to our financial report card to see how well we have done with growth, leverage and returns. First, let's discuss growth. We grew both sales and square footage for the quarter. We remain on track to grow sales by 4% to 6% and square footage by approximately 4% this year. Net square footage increased to $956 million at the end of the first quarter, which is up 3.6 million square feet from the end of fiscal 2010. Because of the large base, the increase is only 0.4%, but an additional 3.6 million square feet is still reasonably significant.
Recall that we are implementing many remodel initiatives here in the United States. These remodels account for a significant portion of our capital commitment this year. The company remains on track to spend between $13 billion and $15 billion in CapEx this year. That's consistent with what we announced last October. 
Next, leverage. Our renewed focus on the productivity loop mentioned at our investor conference last October has now produced two consecutive quarters of impressive results. Our expense management is a companywide goal, which reflects the contributions of all the segments. That's why I'm extremely proud of each one of our segments and the corporate office and the fact that they delivered leverage. It's a remarkable start to the year which we are planning to continue. 
Leveraging expenses is just one part of the productivity loop. We reduce expenses, lower prices and give more to our customers and ultimately, our shareholders. Our leverage story is amazing. And by combining that with other global initiatives like sourcing, we are becoming an even stronger company.
The last part of our financial report card relates to returns. First, our free cash flow at the end of this quarter was a negative $1.6 billion. Over the last couple of years, our strategic priorities in logistics and the stores have removed a significant amount of inventory. As I mentioned during the fourth quarter call, inventory management was integral to our free cash flow performance last year, and a relatively low inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2010. In fact, it's the lowest it's been since fiscal 2006. The year end balance was particularly low here in the United States. We saw that return to more normal levels here in the first quarter.
Our goal is to provide a consistently high pretax return on investment or ROI. ROI for the 12 months ended April 30 was 19.1%, and up from the 18.7% we reported last year. As I mentioned earlier, we increased square footage and continue to invest in the business. Average invested capital, the denominator used to calculate ROI, increased 5%. However, with our expense management and our focus on the productivity loop, our trailing 12-month adjusted operating income, or the numerator for ROI, has grown by 7.4%. Overall, we're very pleased with this performance.
Now let's move on to guidance. Based on our view of the business and the current U.S. sales environment, which Eduardo discussed in detail, we expect second quarter diluted earnings per share to be between $0.93 and $0.98. This guidance assumes that currency exchange rates remain at today's levels.
In closing, I'd like to summarize with a few key points. The company increased sales by 6% and added over 3 million square feet in the quarter. The corporation leveraged expenses for a second consecutive quarter, an accomplishment we are proud of here at Wal-Mart. All of this resulted in an exceptional pretax return or ROI, of over 19% at the end of the first quarter. 
Thank you for listening today. We really appreciate your interest in Wal-Mart."

A full transcript of this call will be available on the website after 7 a.m. Central Time on May 18, 2010.
Our executive team is ready to report on our first quarter results of fiscal 2011. Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will cover the key highlights of our quarterly results. Charles Holley, Executive Vice President of Finance and Treasurer, has the details behind the consolidated financial results. Then we go to the operating segment leaders: Eduardo Castro-Wright, Vice Chairman, responsible for Wal-Mart U.S. global sourcing and global.com, will share the updates on our largest business segment and sourcing; Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart International, will cover results for the International segment and our six largest markets by revenue; Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam's Club, has results for our Warehouse Club segment; Tom Schoewe, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will round out the call with an update on SAP, our company's financial report card and, of course, Q2 earnings guidance.
But first, let me cover some important changes we have made to our internal management reporting that affects our segment reporting beginning February 1, 2010, the start of our fiscal year. These changes only impact our segment reporting and do not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we mentioned in our 2010 annual report, from time to time, we've revised the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations. These revisions generally are made because of alignment changes within the organization, or cost allocations designed to drive greater accountability. When we make these measurement changes, the segment operating income for each segment affected by the revision is restated for all periods presented to maintain comparability. 
During the first quarter, we made two significant changes. First, certain information systems expenses, or what we refer to as ISD [Information Systems Division], previously included in unallocated corporate overhead, are now being charged to the segment that is driving these costs. This cost allocation will drive greater accountability for our overall technology expenses, it will improve the utilization of our information systems resources and it will improve productivity. 
Second, as part of our operational realignment, our Puerto Rico operations moved from the International segment to the respective Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam's Club segments. The Wal-Mart U.S. segment now includes the company's mass merchant concept in the United States and Puerto Rico, operating primarily under the varying Wal-Mart brands, as well as walmart.com. The Sam's Club segment now includes the warehouse membership clubs in the United States and Puerto Rico, as well as samsclub.com. The International segment now includes the company's operations outside the United States and Puerto Rico.
As a result of these two changes, we have restated our segment reporting for all periods presented to reflect the comparability for the realignment and cost allocations. Additionally, Wal-Mart U.S. has moved the Outdoor Living and Seasonal portfolios into the Home SBU from Hardlines. The shift was made as of February 1 because the merchandise better aligns from the customer perspective to these SBUs. Effective with the second quarter, the Baby category is moving to the Grocery SBU from Apparel. 
One other item I want to mention is one that did not impact the first quarter, but you will see when we report our results for the second quarter on August 17. As we have previously mentioned, in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we began a staged implementation of our new financial system. The implementation's first stage was ASDA, our U.K. subsidiary. The second stage was in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada and was implemented starting May 1, 2010.
In connection with the second stage of that implementation and coinciding with the improvements available in our new financial systems, we revised our methodology for valuing inventory under the retail method of inventory accounting. Specifically, we've improved our ability to measure inventory at more granular levels. The systems change will better align the accounting for inventory components with how the merchants run their businesses. As a result, the aggregation of certain inventory groups now occurs at lower levels, which produces a different cost valuation for the affected inventory.
As I mentioned, this change became effective as of May 1, 2010, and will be reflected in the financial statements in the second quarter and for all prior periods presented. This change is not expected to have a significant impact on the results of operations on a going-forward basis. 
Now Mike, let's get started with our earnings news."
313055,79163617,66457,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May-18-2010",2010-05-18,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Wal-Mart kicked off fiscal year 2011 with record net sales and EPS for the first quarter. Across the business, our teams delivered on our commitment to the productivity loop, which drives ongoing value for custome",739,"Thank you, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Wal-Mart kicked off fiscal year 2011 with record net sales and EPS for the first quarter. Across the business, our teams delivered on our commitment to the productivity loop, which drives ongoing value for customers and shareholders. We are managing expenses tightly and investing those savings in our everyday price leadership to drive additional growth, leverage and returns.
Let me get right to the numbers for the total company. Today, we are reporting first quarter earnings per share of $0.88, $0.03 above our own guidance and First Call consensus. Net sales in the first quarter were just over $99 billion, a 6% increase over last year. Operating income for the company was up more than 10% this quarter, with strong relative contributions from each of our operating segments. For the second quarter in a row, we leveraged expenses as a company. Every operating segment and corporate leveraged the expenses, and we plan to continue delivering on our promise to grow operating expenses slower than sales. The quality of our balance sheet remains world-class and reflects the strength of our underlying businesses.
Now let me move to the highlights of the individual operating segments. First, Wal-Mart U.S. had a first quarter comp of negative 1.4%, which was below guidance. Strong management and the structural changes the Wal-Mart U.S. team put in place have enabled it to leverage expenses and deliver strong profitability and returns. Operating income was up 5.6%, growing faster than sales. 
Eduardo and his team have a good understanding of the various internal and external factors associated with our customer traffic. A number of economic pressures, including gas prices and ongoing concerns about unemployment, continue to affect key segments of retail, and this is especially true for Wal-Mart's core customer.
There are a number of steps Wal-Mart U.S. is taking to improve top line sales. As you will hear from Eduardo in a moment, Wal-Mart U.S. has already taken some actions, focused on price leadership and product assortment. It is important to strengthen Wal-Mart's position as the everyday price leader and to separate ourselves even more from competitors. We are in the process of adding back some merchandise that has been deleted from our assortment. These changes are on a fast track and the impact will become even more noticeable as we progress through this fiscal year.
Sam's Club delivered a 0.7% positive comp sales without fuel, and those results are on top of a very strong comp last year. Sam's also increased operating income more than 9%. The structural changes at Sam's made earlier this year, along with improved merchandise quality and enhanced membership initiatives, contributed to a very good quarter. I believe Sam's is well-positioned for the year ahead. 
International continues to be our fastest growing division and an increasingly important contributor to our business. Sales grew by more than 21%, almost 9% on a constant currency basis, exceeding $25 billion in the first quarter, and profit grew even faster than sales. This performance shows the strength of our EDLC [every day low cost]-EDLP [every day low price] model around the world. International leveraged operating expenses for the fifth consecutive quarter and most countries continue to improve their inventory management.
As we look to the future, we're pleased with the long-term opportunities in the emerging markets, especially as economies in those regions improve. We particularly see substantial growth ahead in Mexico, China and Brazil, and a large part of our capital expenditure budget is committed to those markets. We continue to grow. More than 60% of the additional square footage of retail selling space this quarter was within Wal-Mart International. We expect to have even more store openings throughout the company in the second and third quarters. 
A final thought before I close. Whether I visit with customers in our stores, or with other CEOs, or with leaders in Washington, people want to hear our views on the economy and how businesses can help solve the issues facing consumers today. Our associates appreciate the recognition that Wal-Mart receives for so many contributions around the world. Our mission of saving people money so that they can live better, gives us a unique ability to understand and truly care for the needs of people. We know this is what our customers expect of us, and it's what we will always expect of ourselves. 
Now Charles will cover the detailed financial results. Charles?"
313055,79163617,66457,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May-18-2010",2010-05-18,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. For the first quarter of fiscal 2011, our earnings from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart were $3.3 billion, or $0.88 per share. This is a 9.7% increase from the $3 billion reported in the first quarter last year. Earnings per s",910,"Thanks, Mike. For the first quarter of fiscal 2011, our earnings from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart were $3.3 billion, or $0.88 per share. This is a 9.7% increase from the $3 billion reported in the first quarter last year. Earnings per share this quarter included a $0.02 per share benefit from currency exchange rate translation. We are very pleased that our EPS of $0.88 per share exceeded both our guidance of $0.81 to $0.85 per share and the First Call estimate by $0.03. 
Overall, consolidated net sales increased by 6% to $99.1 billion for the quarter. This was driven by growth from Wal-Mart International and helped by a currency benefit of $2.5 billion. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales would have increased 3.3%. The 13-week total U.S. comparable store sales, without fuel, declined 1.1%. You'll hear more details on the Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam's comp sales from Eduardo and Brian. 
First quarter consolidated operating income was $5.8 billion, up 10.6% over last year and up 8.4% on a constant currency basis. Our strong results were driven by great expense management for the quarter. Expenses grew 3.9% on our 6% sales growth. As Mike mentioned earlier, the focus on the productivity loop resulted in the company, including our three operating segments in corporate, leveraging expenses. We now have leveraged operating expenses for two consecutive quarters.
Corporate, or unallocated corporate overhead, decreased to $390 million, a decline of 8% from last year. As Carol mentioned earlier, the unallocated corporate overhead now excludes the allocation of various systems cost to the business segments. 
Consolidated gross margin declined eight basis points due to a change in mix between the segments. Our gross margin of 24.6% at the end of the first quarter is still very healthy. Each of the operating segments will provide more gross margin details later in the call. 
Inventory grew 3.2% for the company compared to the end of the first quarter last year and on a 6% sales increase. Wal-Mart U.S. and Wal-Mart International contributed to the increase in inventory, primarily due to the comparisons versus last year's significant inventory reduction. You will hear more about this from Eduardo and Doug. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 34.6%. We expect the tax rate for fiscal 2011 to be between 34% and 35% and we will see some quarterly fluctuations. Factors, which may impact our rate, include changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. Consolidated membership and other income decreased 2.6% to $751 million. The decline was primarily driven by a decrease in other income from Wal-Mart U.S. 
The company ended the quarter with a negative free cash flow of $1.6 billion versus the positive free cash flow of nearly $1 billion at the same time last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was affected by the comparison to our significant inventory reduction program last year, especially in the Wal-Mart U.S. segment, which decreased inventory to fiscal 2006 levels. The inventory increase at the end of this quarter negatively impacted free cash flow by more than $2 billion. We believe our inventory is in line with our current business needs.
Our payables-to-inventory ratio was 88.4% this year, up from 83% at the end of the first quarter last year. This ratio increased due to segment mix and better payables management by the International segment. 
One additional item on the cash flow statement that I'd like to cover is the increased short-term borrowings. This is primarily due to the SAP implementation. We increased our short-term borrowing of commercial paper to ensure we had a buildup of cash in place for accounts payables due to the systems transition to SAP. We aggregated payments for the week of May 3 into the first day of the week, instead of our normal process of paying throughout the week.
Return on investment or ROI was 19.1%, up from 18.7% at the same time last year because of the improvement in adjusted operating income, the timing of our Chilean acquisition and the accrual for the settlement of the 63 wage-and-hour class-action lawsuits in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009. Tom will further discuss our returns as part of our financial report card later in the call. 
Our CapEx program this year includes both new stores and remodeling initiatives. Capital expenditures of $2.6 billion were about the same as the first quarter last year. Our balance sheet allows us to follow our strategic priorities and invest where needed. Its strength allows us to maintain a AA credit rating and have excellent access to credit markets. 
Our debt-to-total capitalization ratio at the end of the quarter was 41.4%, slightly up from the 41% last year. During the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we repurchased a record $3 billion of shares, representing 55.6 million shares. As of April 30, we have approximately $6.2 billion remaining on our $15 billion share repurchase program.
On March 4, we announced an increase in our dividend to $1.21, an 11% increase over last year. As a result, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends for the quarter. The combination of dividends and share repurchase, or what we return to shareholders, totaled $4.1 billion this quarter and compares to approximately $2 billion in the same quarter last year.
Now let's move on to a discussion of our operating segments. We'll start with Eduardo and Wal-Mart U.S. Eduardo?"
313055,79163617,66457,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May-18-2010",2010-05-18,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Charles. Our results for the quarter were mixed.

While operating profit gr",1685,"Thank you, Charles. Our results for the quarter were mixed. As Mike mentioned previously, the structural changes we've put in place earlier this year enabled us to leverage expenses and delivered strong profitability and returns. While operating profit grew significantly faster than sales, top line sales were lower than expected. 
Net sales were up 1.1% for the first quarter. Comp sales for the period were down 1.4% for the 13-week period. The entire comp decline this quarter was due to traffic, as average ticket was positive. There are a number of factors that we believe affected sales and traffic: the economy, deflation, competitive environment and merchandise assortments.
Rising gas prices and high unemployment levels continue to be the most pressing issues for our core customer. Gas prices are up 41% over this time last year. Our in-depth analysis reinforced the fact that there is a strong correlation between store comps and unemployment. Stores in areas with the highest increase in unemployment are running approximately 200 basis points lower comps than those with the lowest. 
We also have noticed changes in the spending patterns of our customer base. For example, the use of assistance-based funds like food stamps or EBT [electronic benefit transfers] for food purchases has increased significantly over last year's first quarter.
In our monthly survey of Wal-Mart moms, they acknowledged that they are spending less, especially on discretionary items, and have reduced their number of trips to our stores to offset gas prices. They also have made other changes to their household budgets. In fact, the growth in average ticket this quarter was up more than 200 basis points over the fourth quarter, so customers are stocking up when they are in our stores. 
As expected, deflation abated somewhat during the quarter primarily in food, but it is still a headwind. We expect this to turn around in the near future. In addition, we're seeing increased price competition, primarily in consumable categories. 
We launched a new rollback initiative with the objective of further increasing our price caps. This particular rollback campaign will remain in place for at least the next 90 days, as we vigorously defend our price leadership position in the market. We're driving price leadership even more by increasing basket separation. For instance, we announced last week that rollbacks on pantry essentials are 14% lower than the lowest advertised prices across the market. 
Let me share an example of the significance of this rollback program on a group of key pantry items in consumables and grocery. We selected 12 iconic branded products that consumers recognize. With regular pricing, the items are $44. The lowest advertised price across the market during the last 52 weeks was $34. Now at Wal-Mart, those same items are $29, saving the Wal-Mart customer as much as $15.
As Mike mentioned earlier, we completed fine-tuning our merchandise assortment strategy to ensure we have the right products for our customers in every store. For example, we added back approximately 300 items in grocery. We continue to react to ongoing feedback from customers to ensure we have the products that they rely on from Wal-Mart. 
Now let me get back to the remainder of the first quarter financial results. Operating income grew at a faster rate than sales, up 5.6% for the quarter on a 1.1% sales increase. Our gross margin percentage remained flat year-over-year for the quarter. As I told you before, for the past three years, we have been adjusting our inventory levels and cleaned up our stores, which had a strong positive impact on the customer's shopping experience and on operating performance. 
Inventory grew approximately the same rate as sales in the most recent quarter. We feel that this rate of growth is appropriate for our business, and we will continue to manage our inventory growth as necessary to take care of our customers and drive shareholder value. 
I'm very pleased with the way we managed expenses during the quarter. In a period where sales increased 1.1%, we managed to decrease SG&A expense by 70 basis points. This was driven by a 5.9% increase in labor productivity in our stores. At the same time, we improved our customer experience scores. 
Group health expenses have moderated from last year and did not affect the quarter expense comparison. We also had an absolute dollar reduction in Wal-Mart U.S. overhead, driven by our organization structural changes. 
In conjunction with our rollback program, we stepped up advertising and marketing efforts. Additionally, we increased our in-store communications to reinforce our price leadership message. As a result, expenses for advertising were up significantly over last year's first quarter. 
Other income for the Wal-Mart segment was down. Last year, other income was positively impacted by a number of miscellaneous items, none of which was individually significant to the financial statements.
Now let me cover some trends from our business units. As I said before, food deflation began to moderate during the quarter in areas like dairy, meat and produce. Comp store sales results were solid compared to the market, and we maintained a double-digit price gap versus competition across multiple categories. Snacks, beverages, produce, seafood and dairy all had comp increases, while dry grocery and consumables were soft. 
Comps in Health and Wellness were solid. Our Pharmacy business remains strong, and we continue to outperform the competition in this area. Maintenance and wellness categories, such as vitamins and adult nutrition, are generating consistently strong comps. Let me remind you that in the second quarter, we're up against last year's headwind of strong sales from H1N1-related products.
Our Entertainment comp sales were negative as we experienced mixed results by category. We continue to see strong performance in large panel TVs with new LED technology, in laptops and in wireless. We also benefited from a favorable DVD release schedule compared to last year. In toys, which are also included in the Entertainment business unit, sales of bicycles and ride-on vehicles continued to do very well and exceeded plans. On the other hand, video games and game hardware were below expectations across all the gaming brands, due to fewer new releases and the lack of innovation in gaming systems. 
In Hardlines, we were disappointed with the performance of our seasonal categories and Stationery. Do-it-yourself automotive continues to do well as consumers work to extend the useful life of their vehicles. Our Stationery business, which includes books and magazines, was impacted by the anniversary of the Twilight series launch. 
In Home, results were mixed overall, with momentum in categories like outdoor living, bedding, home management and food preparation. Weather drove mixed results on sales, most notably around Valentine's Day. Seasonal sales continue to occur closer toward the actual event. 
Our Apparel performance remained below expectations and continues to be a work in progress for our team. However, some of the bright spots are activewear, licensed apparel and team sports. Our Men's business, which was relatively better than other categories, was driven by active, t-shirts and shorts. Our Apparel inventory remains in good shape.
Wal-Mart Financial Services continues to build on its momentum with strong results in check-cashing, primarily as a result of customers cashing tax refund checks. Sales of the $3 MoneyCard continue to increase. 
Walmart.com had another outstanding quarter, delivering comp growth of more than 50%, which outpaced industry averages by a wide margin.  Traffic, orders, average order size and conversion were all up. Our rollback program applies to our online business as well.
Now I will briefly update you on some of our business initiatives. The new field organization that we discussed in February was fully operational by the end of this quarter. We expect additional productivity gains from this organization, as well as the benefits that will come from the newly established approach to talent development. We remain pleased with the progress of the project impact remodels. Merchandise categories including electronics, baby, home, fresh and seasonal are showing sales improvements with the new layouts. We have previously said that remodeling efforts this year are significantly above historical levels and that we will remodel more than 550 Wal-Mart stores this year. Remodels completed last year are running a positive 200 basis points relative comp sales improvement compared to the rest of the chain.
We expect the benefit from these remodels to grow in the coming months when the bulk of them will be completed. By the fourth quarter, when the remodel activity stops for the year, we expect this effect to provide noticeable benefits to our results since half the remodeled stores will be in our comp base.
We also are pleased with the progress we are making on our global sourcing initiatives, and the savings goals we have set for this year are tracking well. Our global merchandising centers have already started to produce reductions in our cost of goods. All of the centers are now in place and are quickly building resources and addressing business needs. As expected, we are leveraging our global footprint to reduce costs. We also expect to see improvements in product timelines as the year progresses. 
We remain somewhat cautious about the second quarter. Gas prices and unemployment will continue to influence how our core customers shop with us. On the other hand, the recent changes we've made to our assortment, food inflation and our price leadership through rollbacks should result in a favorable reaction from customers.
Finally, I'm very proud of the announcement we made last week about our commitment to fight hunger in the United States. Our $2 billion of support through cash and in-kind donations for the Fighting Hunger Together program will help us reach our goal where no individual in this country should needlessly suffer from hunger.
I will close out the Wal-Mart U.S. discussion with our comp guidance. Our 13-week comp for the second quarter last year declined 1.5%. We expect a slight improvement from this level and are now forecasting a comp range of negative 2% to positive 1% for the 13-week period from May 1 through July 30, 2010. 
Now we will switch to Doug to hear about our International business. Doug?"

As Mike pointed out, we continue our fast-paced growth, increasing both sales and square footage. Because we've revised our reporting structure for Puerto Rico, these numbers exclude Puerto Rico for both this year and last year. We met our goal to grow profit faster than sales and we continue to leverage expenses. 
I'm also proud of the strategic work and accomplishments of our management teams and our associates and colleagues throughout the organization. Our three-pronged strategy remains on track. First, growth by winning locally. The leaders in our markets have the freedom to ensure relevance for our customers and to move with speed. Second, leverage costs by enabling the productivity loop. We operate for less, buy for less and sell for less, and leverage the knowledge and expertise of our talent by sharing and implementing best practices across the entire organization. And finally, balancing returns with growth by managing our portfolio, including thoughtful capital allocation between our emerging and mature markets. 
Our commitment to our save money, live better mission has never been stronger throughout our worldwide team. Beyond our price leadership, we also have many initiatives in our markets to help our customers become more sustainable in their own lives, and I'll cover a few of these examples today. The commitment to the live better side of our mission is being executed in many ways, from how we build our stores and transport products to how we deliver more environmentally friendly products for our customers. But even more important, our commitment to sustainability also helps reduce our own costs across many areas of the business.
Let's move on to our financial results for the first quarter. International net sales for the first quarter were $25 billion, an increase of 21.4% from last year. Sales were positively impacted by $2.5 billion from the relative strengthening of many currencies against the dollar. Sales on a constant currency basis were $22.5 billion, an 8.9% increase over last year's first quarter. Our constant currency sales increase for the first quarter is due primarily to strong underlying performances in Mexico, Canada, Brazil and China. In addition, for reporting purposes, this first quarter includes three full months of our Chilean operations. Last year's first quarter included only two months. As a result, constant currency sales, excluding Chile, grew 7.5% over last year. 
International's operating income for the first quarter was $1.1 billion, up 27.8% from last year and an increase of 13.9% on a constant currency basis. So operating income grew faster than sales despite the headwind from a $26 million charge, net of insurance, related to the recent earthquake in Chile. Operating income excluding Chile's total results, grew 22.6% over last year on a constant currency basis when compared to the 13.9% growth including Chile. 
In the first quarter, we continued the trend of the recent four quarters and leveraged our constant currency expenses. Expense savings and leverage in Japan and China were partially offset by headwinds in other countries. On a constant currency basis, gross margin increased slightly in the first quarter while other income slightly declined as a percentage of sales. As for inventory, we continue to make good progress, with most of our markets reducing days on hand over last year.
Now let's get into the results for several of our markets. Before we do, let me remind you that we hold country management accountable for their results on a local currency basis, without the impact of potential swings in exchange rates. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency fluctuations. 
In the United Kingdom, I was proud to announce that Andy Clarke will be assuming the role of ASDA CEO. Andy will lead efforts to become an even better food retailer, a broader non-food retailer and a leader in e-commerce. Andy has had a long career at ASDA, working first as a store manager, followed by key roles in merchandising, as Retail Director and most recently, as Chief Operating Officer. Andy not only has depth of experience but he has strong leadership skills that will help take our business in the U.K. to another level. For the last five years, we've been for our very fortunate to have Andy Bond as ASDA CEO. Andy will now take his post as Chairman of ASDA's Executive Committee, helping ensure a smooth leadership transition at ASDA, and also working on business opportunities for Wal-Mart in the region.  
In the first quarter, ASDA sales grew in the low single digits while comp sales without fuel declined 0.3%. According to Kantar Worldpanel, retail food sales slowed significantly in the first quarter, and as ASDA's market share dropped slightly in the 12 weeks ending April 19. Operating income grew faster than sales. ASDA's gross margin increased in the first quarter on a mix shift towards higher margin George and general merchandise. Expenses as a percentage of sales were approximately flat to last year. The We Operate for Less cost-saving program continues to deliver efficiencies in stores, distribution centers and the home office. 
I know many of you traveled to the U.K. last month to see our ASDA stores and hear about our strategy for growth, leverage and returns in the U.K. I'm pleased to report we're beginning to see good progress on many of the strategic initiatives presented. On EDLP, ASDA has recently moved to a record price position, lower promotional content and launched the internet-based ASDA price guarantee. On George, the launch of the 100-day quality guarantee has helped drive outperformance to the market and a record conversion of ASDA shoppers. On e-commerce, online growth was 38% in the quarter, and we recently announced a second dedicated home shopping center and completed the nationwide rollout of the Order Online, Collect in Store service. On new formats, we opened three small-format supermarkets and one new ASDA Living in the quarter.
ASDA has recently made good progress towards their strategic goals. I'm confident that our strong leadership team, led by Andy Clarke, will continue this progress and deliver positive sales momentum for the remainder of the year.
Moving on to Mexico. In February, Wal-Mart de Mexico purchased 100% of Wal-Mart Central America, our majority-owned subsidiary with operations in five Central American countries. Through this transaction, we expect to better leverage the Walmex expertise and growth story into our operations in Central America. To be consistent with how Walmex presents comparable information, the discussion here on Mexico represents only the results from Walmex. 
As a reminder, Walmex reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP and we report our worldwide results using U.S. GAAP. Although consumer spending in Mexico continues to be cautious, our discretionary formats had a solid first quarter. Additionally, Walmex's improved inventory management has led to higher gross margins in our self-service formats, due to a better inventory mix and fewer markdowns. All of this contributed to fourth quarter sales growth of approximately 11% and comparable store sales growth of 4.4%.
All of Walmex's formats are performing well. Customer count was up 17.2% in total and 5.3% at comparable stores. Walmex same-store sales for self-service formats grew by 4%. ANTAD's same-store sales for the industry, excluding Walmex, grew by 1.2%. 
First quarter gross margin grew 89 basis points to last year, while operating expenses as a percentage of sales grew 37 basis points. Although not enough to stall the growth in operating income, expenses grew faster than sales at 14.3% as a result of last year's rapid expansion. With more stores, both depreciation and rent expenses have increased year-over-year. Operating income growth at Walmex significantly outpaced sales growth at 17.4%. 
Walmex was the country's only retailer recognized as a socially-responsible company by the Mexican Center for philanthropy and the Alliance for Social Responsibility. Our commitments to reducing energy consumption in our own operations have also been extended to Central America.
Moving north to Canada, Wal-Mart Canada's first quarter sales growth, excluding the impact of last year's closures of six Sam's Clubs, was 4.9%. This is twice that of the market and represents a record high in market share, according to Statistics Canada data. We attribute a good portion of our sales improvement to the Supercenter expansion. We have opened 32 more Supercenters in operation than at this quarter last year, and we're on track to add between 35 and 40 Supercenters this fiscal year. Additionally, our margins are benefiting from last year's initiatives aimed at improving customer experience and productivity. Now more than ever, we're able to offer Canadian customers more choices in merchandise at the right price. 
First quarter comparable store sales in Canada grew 1%, with customer traffic up 0.4% and average ticket up 0.6%. Overall sales growth was led by Hardlines, health and wellness, and food and consumables, partially offset by softer sales in entertainment items. 
Canada's first quarter gross margin increased to 101 basis points even with the shift in sales to lower-margin items. This was the result of improved private brand sales and improved supplier negotiations. Although expenses grew faster than sales at a rate of 6.2% due to timing of new store projects, operating income grew 18.8% much faster than sales on better sales volumes, mix and supplier terms. 
Our Canada team continues to incorporate sustainability initiatives into our supercenter expansion program, with a rooftop solar system in Ontario and our sustainable distribution center in Balzac, Alberta, which opens this fall. These kinds of initiatives reduce costs, which benefit customers, shareholders and the environment.
Now down to Brazil. Earlier, I mentioned our strategy of thoughtful allocation of capital in markets like Brazil. Since March of last year, we've opened 95 new stores in Brazil, including four in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Brazil's first quarter sales growth was 16.5% and comparable store sales grew 7.6%, both in real terms. Customer traffic at comparable stores declined 2% and average ticket increased 9.6% in real terms. The best performances came from our cash and carry format supermarkets, as well as our soft discount format. 
Gross margin as a percentage of sales declined slightly, and expenses as a percent of sales were relatively flat to last year, even after adding a significant number of new stores at the end of last year. 
Now moving onto Asia. In Japan, overall sales and comparable store sales both declined by about 1.4% in the first quarter over last year. Comparable store sales in real terms were essentially flat to last year. Price investment and deflation had a negative effect on average ticket, but EDLP continues to increase customer traffic. Food and apparel sales were down while general merchandise was up. Expenses as a percentage of sales are down significantly from last year due to our continued execution of EDLC in support of the EDLP initiative. 
We opened five more stores in China in this first quarter, for a total of 38 new stores in the last 12 months. This brings our total China store count to 284. Total China sales increased 19.6% over first quarter of last year with comparable store sales growth of 10.6% driven by our price leadership. Average ticket grew significantly, but traffic declined as our Chinese customers bought more each trip. Our combined China gross margin was down slightly from the first quarter of last year. However, operating income grew faster than sales because of investments we made into energy efficiency and labor productivity programs. Our store associates are operating much more efficiently, and we have reduced our logistics expenses as a percentage of sales. China remains a key focus of organic growth and continues to deliver impressive growth and operating income.
We continue to be very excited and optimistic about the future in India. We have an important business relationship supporting the 60-plus stores owned by Bharti Retail. We also have opened two Best Price Modern Wholesale cash and carry stores in India in the last year. Our associates are also making a difference in the community, educating farmers about improved agricultural prices and giving them incentives for producing a good quality farm product.
Before we move on to Sam's, let me mention Chile. As you know, on February 27, more than 1 million Chilean households were damaged in an 8.8 magnitude earthquake. The rapid response from our associates was amazing. Most of our stores were returned quickly to operational status. We announced a $1 million donation to relief efforts within 12 hours of the initial quake, and an additional $1.1 million in cash and in-kind donations have been provided from Wal-Mart operations around the world to nonprofits working on relief efforts. 
I'm proud of the efforts of our team in Chile. Their devotion to their community and our Chilean customers is remarkable. I'm also proud of our Wal-Mart teams around the world who have donated their time and money to the relief efforts there. Our people truly do make a difference. 
Now I'll turn it over to Brian for an update on Sam's Club. Brian?"

Before I discuss our detailed financial results, I'd like to start with some highlights of a solid first quarter, as we continue to make progress toward our corporate priorities of growth, leverage and returns. 
We posted positive comp sales for the 13-week period on top of a very strong 4.2% comp last year. We leveraged expenses for the second straight quarter. I'm very proud of what is being accomplished by our dedicated club managers and club associates, as well as our newly formed innovation team, which is leading our efforts in improving club productivity and expense control. 
Sales in many of our largest categories continue to be strong versus last year, including meat, produce, HBA and pharmacy. Our merchandising team continues to respond to our members' wishes by adding exciting new products in the club at a great value.
eValues continues to drive strong Plus membership penetration. Our new demo program, Taste and Tips, is now fully underway in our clubs, and both our members and we are pleased with these changes. 
During the quarter, we also began rolling out our new platform for samsclub.com, which gives members enhanced functionality and speed. We also announced a new field organizational structure, which will place our senior operations executives, along with our regional support teams, in key locations throughout the country. This will bring them even closer to our members, associates and local communities.
Now let's turn to the detailed financial results. For the first quarter, net sales for Sam's Club, excluding fuel, increased to $10.8 billion, which is a 1.3% increase over last year. Including fuel, first quarter sales were $11.7 billion, which is a 4.6% increase versus last year, primarily due to significantly higher fuel prices this year versus last year. Fuel prices in the first quarter this year are approximately 41% higher than prices in Q1 last year. Club comp sales, excluding fuel, for the 13-week period increased 70 basis points. Including fuel, club comp sales increased 3.9%. 
Overall comp ticket was up for the quarter. Advantage and business comp traffic, excluding fuel, declined for the 13-week period. Both business and advantage average ticket, excluding fuel, increased for the 13-week period. Operating income grew at a rate faster than sales this quarter, again as it did last quarter. Q1 operating income increased 9.2% versus last year to $429 million.
Gross margin, excluding the impact of fuel, increased five basis points for the first quarter, primarily driven by the continued shift in merchandising mix. Including fuel, gross margin for the quarter declined by 26 basis points, primarily due to higher fuel prices this year. 
Inventory management continues to be very positive. We reduced inventory by 6.1% versus last year. While I'm proud of our continuing strong performance, we continue to be mindful of maintaining the right balance between solid inventory management and ensuring we have the right products members want when they shop. In addition to the sales strength in many of our fresh and health and wellness categories, we continue to see healthy margin mix and profit performance in other categories such as apparel, home, seasonal and automotive. 
During my weekly club visits, I am seeing more and more of our members shopping our seasonal categories, including grills, patio and outdoor plants. We are seeing abatement in broad-based deflation and in fact, have experienced some inflation in a few categories like dairy and meat. Additionally, tobacco continues to positively affect sales versus last year, primarily due to industrywide price increases, although we have now cycled many of the larger price increases from last year.
On a positive note, we see strength in comp unit sales for items with price points greater than $150, such as jewelry and mattresses, where we offer great brands at exceptional values. While we continue to see good market demand for home electronics, our performance was not as strong as we would have liked in the first quarter. We were not positioned optimally from an inventory standpoint due to some industrywide shortages on flat panels, as well as due to inventory transition to newer technology like LED TVs. We are now in a better position, having the latest technology from LG, Samsung and Vizio, and would experience improved performance at the start of the second quarter.
While the economic environment is improving somewhat, our business members continue to be pressured by high unemployment and reduced credit availability, and this is showing in some of our office product categories. 
We now have 14 Project Portfolio clubs complete and another 49 under construction. As you will recall, Project Portfolio is a test we have underway to increase the assortment of highly productive merchandise categories like fresh and health and wellness in our clubs. We're pleased with some of the early results, and we'll continue to update you on our progress. 
As mentioned earlier, I'm very pleased with our progress on expense leverage and club efficiency. For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 1.4% and our club wages were down versus last year. We also are having excellent expense control in utilities, supplies and maintenance. We also continued to improve our in-club efficiencies at the same time we are improving our in-club experience. Units per labor hour have increased approximately 4% for the first quarter versus last year.
Beginning in April, in response to the continuing challenging credit environment, we began paying an interchange fee in conjunction with our rewards credit program. Despite this, we were still able to leverage expenses during the quarter. This will continue to be a headwind for us the rest of the fiscal year. 
Membership income, the largest portion of membership and other income, increased 2.5%, driven primarily by Plus membership upgrades. Renewal rates across membership categories are holding steady. Membership and other income for the first quarter decreased 3% versus the prior year due to a decline in other income. Add-on Business memberships still face headwinds given the challenges that many small-business owners are encountering. We will continue to look for innovative ways to drive traffic, renewals and upgrades of existing numbers. 
As we are now in the second quarter, we're focused on a number of efforts to drive value for our members and shareholders. We are very focused on maintaining our value perception with members in this very dynamic pricing environment. We continue to increase our reliance on valuable member insights as we make merchandising choices for our members. We will continue to focus on expense leverage, while balancing that with maintaining a positive shopping environment for our members. Finally, but most importantly, we are focused on driving comp club sales and increasing our sales productivity. While we maintain positive comps, we have much more we can and will do. 
Despite the challenging environment, we expect comp club sales without fuel, for the current 13-week period from May 1, 2010 through July 30, 2010, to be flat, plus or minus 1% versus positive 60 basis point comps last year for the comparable period. 
I will turn the program over to Tom for the report card and guidance discussion. Tom?"

Recall that for a number of quarters, we have been talking about finance transformation and the implementa",843,"Thanks, Brian. Before I get into our financial report card and report on growth leverage and returns, let me update you on our SAP implementation. 
Recall that for a number of quarters, we have been talking about finance transformation and the implementation of SAP. You know from our discussion last year that the implementation of SAP in the U.K. went smooth smoothly. On May 1, we began implementing SAP throughout North America, that's excluding Mexico and Central America. And so far, we have not encountered any major roadblocks. I'm proud of the team. In fact, by the end of this month, more than 8,000 associates in North America will be using our new system. Our success should be attributed to the time our associate teams have invested to make sure that we do it efficiently, as well as leveraging what we learned from ASDA in the UK.
As part of our global finance transformation, we have expanded the responsibilities within our existing U.S.-based Wal-Mart financial shared services organization to include Canada and Puerto Rico. Local transactional processes within core finance areas will transition in phases throughout the year. Additionally, we recently implemented a centralized contact center for all three countries providing suppliers and associates with an expanded scope of services for financial inquiries. These transformational changes allow us to: one, leverage knowledge and resources; two, increase efficiency; and finally, provide cost-effective financial processes.
Now let's move on to our financial report card to see how well we have done with growth, leverage and returns. First, let's discuss growth. We grew both sales and square footage for the quarter. We remain on track to grow sales by 4% to 6% and square footage by approximately 4% this year. Net square footage increased to $956 million at the end of the first quarter, which is up 3.6 million square feet from the end of fiscal 2010. Because of the large base, the increase is only 0.4%, but an additional 3.6 million square feet is still reasonably significant.
Recall that we are implementing many remodel initiatives here in the United States. These remodels account for a significant portion of our capital commitment this year. The company remains on track to spend between $13 billion and $15 billion in CapEx this year. That's consistent with what we announced last October. 
Next, leverage. Our renewed focus on the productivity loop mentioned at our investor conference last October has now produced two consecutive quarters of impressive results. Our expense management is a companywide goal, which reflects the contributions of all the segments. That's why I'm extremely proud of each one of our segments and the corporate office and the fact that they delivered leverage. It's a remarkable start to the year which we are planning to continue. 
Leveraging expenses is just one part of the productivity loop. We reduce expenses, lower prices and give more to our customers and ultimately, our shareholders. Our leverage story is amazing. And by combining that with other global initiatives like sourcing, we are becoming an even stronger company.
The last part of our financial report card relates to returns. First, our free cash flow at the end of this quarter was a negative $1.6 billion. Over the last couple of years, our strategic priorities in logistics and the stores have removed a significant amount of inventory. As I mentioned during the fourth quarter call, inventory management was integral to our free cash flow performance last year, and a relatively low inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2010. In fact, it's the lowest it's been since fiscal 2006. The year end balance was particularly low here in the United States. We saw that return to more normal levels here in the first quarter.
Our goal is to provide a consistently high pretax return on investment or ROI. ROI for the 12 months ended April 30 was 19.1%, and up from the 18.7% we reported last year. As I mentioned earlier, we increased square footage and continue to invest in the business. Average invested capital, the denominator used to calculate ROI, increased 5%. However, with our expense management and our focus on the productivity loop, our trailing 12-month adjusted operating income, or the numerator for ROI, has grown by 7.4%. Overall, we're very pleased with this performance.
Now let's move on to guidance. Based on our view of the business and the current U.S. sales environment, which Eduardo discussed in detail, we expect second quarter diluted earnings per share to be between $0.93 and $0.98. This guidance assumes that currency exchange rates remain at today's levels.
In closing, I'd like to summarize with a few key points. The company increased sales by 6% and added over 3 million square feet in the quarter. The corporation leveraged expenses for a second consecutive quarter, an accomplishment we are proud of here at Wal-Mart. All of this resulted in an exceptional pretax return or ROI, of over 19% at the end of the first quarter. 
Thank you for listening today. We really appreciate your interest in Wal-Mart."

Thanks for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call for fiscal year 2011. All information for this quarter, including updated unit counts, square footage, and financial metrics is available on our Website at walmartstores.com/investors. A full transcript of this call will be available on the Website after 7 AM Central Time on August 17th, 2010. Our executive team is ready to report on our second quarter results of fiscal 2011.
Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will cover the key highlights of our quarterly results. Charles Holley, Executive Vice President of Finance and Treasurer, has the details behind our consolidated financials. Then we will go to the operating segments. Bill Simon, our new President and CEO of Walmart U.S., will be followed by Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart International, and then we will have Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam’s Club.
Tom Schoewe, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will round out the call with an update on our SAP implementation, our company’s financial report card, and earnings guidance. But first, let me cover some important changes we have made that affect our financials. During the second quarter, we had two changes. As you know, we have been implementing SAP through a staged timetable across our businesses. The implementation’s first stage was ASDA, our U.K. subsidiary. The second stage was in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada, and implementation started May 1, 2010. In connection with the second stage of that implementation, and coinciding with the improvements available in our new financial systems, the SAP implementation gave us the ability to improve our methodology for valuing inventory under the retail method of inventory accounting.
We have improved our ability to measure inventory at more granular levels. The systems change will better align the accounting for inventory components with how the merchants run their businesses. As a result, the aggregation of certain inventory groups now occurs at the lower levels, which produces a different cost valuation for the affected inventory. The retrospective application of this accounting change has impacted both segment and consolidated operating income, as well as consolidated net income.
Let me share the effect of this change. For fiscal year 2010, adjusted earnings per share are currently $3.73, up $0.01 from the reported $3.72. This change was driven by the impact to cost of sales from the described inventory accounting change. While fiscal 2010 changed by $0.01 of EPS, there are some quarterly fluctuations or volatility in merchandise shipments. For example, you will notice that last year’s second quarter, Walmart reported EPS of $0.88, but today, we are reporting $0.89 per share for the same quarter.
For the third and fourth quarters, we adjusted EPS by a negative $0.02 and a positive $0.03 respectively. These adjustments impact the operating income of both Walmart U.S. and Walmart International. Financial information for all periods discussed on this call and in our second quarter earnings release today is presented on a comparative basis for the retrospective application of this accounting change. Please note that we have provided detailed explanations in the notes of the press release.
The Website section titled “financial results” contains the comparable financial information for each quarterly reporting period in fiscal 2010 and the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Second, as of this quarter, we have started including Wakana units in our unit count for Walmart Japan. Wakanas are fully owned, stand-alone take-out restaurants generally less than 1,000 square feet. One last reminder, recall that effective with this fiscal year, the operations in Puerto Rico moved from Walmart International to their respective U.S. segments. Comp sales and all information today in Walmart U.S. and Sam’s Club reports do include results from Puerto Rico.
Now, Mike, let’s get started with our earnings news. Mike?

Despite a tough sales environment, we managed the business well, delivering on expense leverage through our commitment to the productivity loop. Today, we are reporting EPS of $0.97, within our guidance of $0.93 to $0.98. We consistently grow earnings and this quarter’s EPS grew 9%. More important, we are raising our EPS guidance for the full year to $3.95 to $4.05.
Net sales for the quarter were up almost 3% to more than $103 billion. Operating income for the company was more than $6 billion, up more than 4%. The company leveraged expenses for the third consecutive quarter. This remains a priority throughout the company. We surpassed 8,500 worldwide units in July, representing various formats. During the quarter, the company added almost 5 million square feet of retail space in our 15 countries. We had significant square footage growth in Mexico and China, and I am pleased that China is on track to reach the 300-store mark in September.
Our balance sheet remains world-class and reflects the underlying strength of our business. Now let me move on to the highlights of the individual operating segments.
In Walmart U.S., I am pleased with the speedy leadership transition, with Bill Simon taking the reins of our largest operating segment. Bill is a strong leader who transformed the customer experience in our stores and has continued to drive innovation and improvement throughout the business. As expected, Walmart U.S. had a challenging second quarter. Total sales and operating income were flat to the prior year, with comps declining 1.8%. The top priority for the business remains improving top line sales and customer traffic. I am fully aligned with Bill’s focus on assortment and pricing, and with strengthening our supplier relationships. I am also impressed with the urgency and the speed that he and his team are demonstrating in executing changes in strategy that are making sense for our customers and shareholders. They are moving rapidly to build on the initiatives that worked and adjusting those that have not worked.
Sam’s Club delivered 1% comp growth, which was at the top of their guidance. They also increased operating income and continue to maintain the right balance of inventory in the clubs. I am pleased with how Brian and the team are focused on membership and merchandise, and I look forward to consistently strong results ahead. Walmart International continues to be an impressive growth engine. Doug and his team grew net sales by 11%, and grew operating income faster than sales. They also leveraged expenses for the sixth quarter in a row.
We continue to see aggressive growth throughout International. I mentioned Mexico and China earlier, I need to call out Walmart Canada. It opened its 100th supercenter in July. We expect that International will continue to be a strong contributor to our company’s growth and our overall results. In his new role leading global e-commerce and global sourcing, Eduardo Castro-Wright is bringing an even greater intensity to positioning Walmart as the global leader in multi-channel retail. You can expect to hear more about both of these areas at our investor conference in October.
We will not stray from our EDLC-EDLP business model and we will keep listening to our customers and associates. The slow economic recovery will continue to affect our customers, and we expect they will remain cautious about spending. Walmart remains committed to our mission of saving people money so that they can live better. Our leadership team across the company has never been stronger, or more focused on our priorities of growth, leverage and returns. As we build the Next Generation Walmart, we are confident about the future of our business.
Now, I will turn it over to Charles for the detailed financial results. Charles?

For the second quarter of fiscal 2011, the company delivered earnings from continuing operations of $3.6 billion, an increase of 3.4% from last year.

For the second quarter of fiscal 2011, the company delivered earnings from continuing operations of $3.6 billion, an increase of 3.4% from last year. Walmart reported earnings of $0.97 per share, a 9% increase over last year’s earnings per share of $0.89. Earnings per share included a benefit of approximately $0.01 from currency exchange rate fluctuations and was within our guidance for the quarter of $0.93 to $0.98 per share.
In addition, we are pleased that we delivered earnings per share for the second quarter above First Call consensus of $0.96. Consolidated net sales increased 2.8% to $103 billion for the quarter. Walmart International was the main driver of growth and was helped by a currency benefit of $857 million. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales increased 2%.
The 13-week total U.S. comparable store sales without fuel declined 1.4%. You will hear more details on the Walmart U.S. and Sam’s Club comp sales from Bill and Brian. Expense management continues to be a positive story. Walmart leveraged expenses for the third consecutive quarter, with expenses growing only 0.6% on a sales growth of 2.8%. The CEOs for the three operating segments will give additional details on their leverage performance.
Unallocated corporate overhead, which includes corporate expenses, decreased to $416 million. That’s a decline of 15.3% from last year. Although unallocated corporate overhead can have some volatility from quarter to quarter, we continue to manage our core corporate overhead expenses well. The key takeaway is that we were able to leverage those expenses in the second quarter.
Consolidated gross margin decreased 32 basis points to 24.7%. The decrease was driven by Walmart U.S., which Bill will elaborate on, later in the call. With a gross margin decrease more than offset by expense leverage, the company was able to grow operating income at 4.4% over last year. This growth rate was slightly faster than sales. The company’s operating income of $6.2 billion included a $46 million benefit of currency exchange rate fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 3.6%.
Consolidated membership and other income increased 30 basis points to $710 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 34.3%. We expect the tax rate for fiscal 2011 to be between 34% and 35%, although we will see some quarterly fluctuations. Factors which may impact our rate include changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations.
Return on investment for the trailing 12 months was 19%, up from 18.4% at the same time last year. Inventory grew 4.3% for the total company, compared to the end of the second quarter last year, and on a 2.8% sales increase. Walmart U.S. and Walmart International contributed to the increase in inventory, primarily due to the comparisons versus last year’s significant inventory reduction and the new Walmart U.S. strategies.
While inventories were up at the end of the second quarter, payables were up even more. Payables grew at 17.9%, so our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 97.6%, up from 86.3% at the same time last year. The growth in payables is partially related to the growth in inventory, but was impacted to a greater extent by the timing of our payment cycles, pushing the payables balance to unusually high levels.
Although the increase in inventories over last year continues to pressure free cash flow, the growth in payables this quarter actually overcame that pressure. Walmart ended the first half of fiscal 2011 with free cash flow of $4.5 billion compared to $4.2 billion last year, which is very strong. We will continue to manage our inventory to be in line with our current business needs. However, we expect to see year-over-year pressure from higher inventories in the back half of this year.
The high payables to inventory ratio should moderate in the second half of the year. Our balance sheet remains strong. We continue to have excellent access to credit markets. Our debt-to-total-capitalization ratio at the end of the quarter was 43.2%, slightly up from the 40.4% last year at the same time. The 8.8% increase in our total debt levels, partially offset by lower average borrowing rates, resulted in a slight increase in net interest expense to $485 million.
Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $3 billion, slightly below last year’s CapEx of $3.1 billion. Year-to-date, Walmart has spent $5.6 billion in capital expenditures. As we shared with you last quarter, we expect a larger number of new store openings in the third quarter. This is the second quarter in a row that Walmart has set a record for share repurchase. In the first quarter, the company repurchased $3 billion or 55.6 million shares, and this quarter, we repurchased $4.1 billion or 81.3 million shares. As you remember, during our shareholders’ meeting on June 4th, we announced a new $15 billion share repurchase authorization, which replaced our previous $15 billion plan. Our new authorization has $12.4 billion remaining.
In the second quarter, Walmart also paid $1.1 billion in dividends. The dividends and share repurchase of $4.1 billion represent $5.2 billion that the company has returned to the shareholders this quarter. Year-to-date, Walmart has returned $9.4 billion to shareholders. We are proud of how we manage our business. The strength of our balance sheet serves as a foundation of our commitment to growth, leverage and returns.
Now, let’s move on to a discussion of our operating segments. We will start with Bill and Walmart U.S. Bill?

I am honored to lead the Walmart U.S. business and pleased to have the chance to talk to you for a minute about the many challenges and opportunities that we have. We have set out a clear direction for change in our business and believe this will put us on a track to see improvement by the fourth quarter.
In the second quarter, for the first two months of the quarter, Action Alleys were clear of merchandise and our stores featured many deep rollbacks on price. The deep rollbacks we featured in May and June did improve price impression, but they did not generate the level of top line sales we had hoped for. In July, we put the emphasis back on our core EDLP model. Our associates are helping our customers realize that we are the price leader.
We also engaged with suppliers to review our assortment to make sure that we had the breadth of inventory that Walmart customers have come to expect. In the coming weeks and months, our assortment will be more relevant to our customers, with the right mix of new and innovative products. We are leveraging our suppliers’ capabilities to help us drive impactful features. And we are restoring thousands of products to our assortment and adding new items. We plan to win in every category and let customers decide through their purchase decisions what to include in our assortment.
During the past six weeks, we have returned merchandise to Action Alley. Our store managers now have more autonomy to make decisions on what’s right for their customers. We believe it will take some time to see significant changes in comp sales, but we are beginning to see more encouraging traffic trends. Now, I would like to get to the details on the results for the second quarter.
Net sales were flat for the second quarter. Comp sales for the period declined 1.8% for the 13-week period. Comps did improve by the end of the quarter, and traffic trends improved sequentially during the period. Consistent with the most recent quarters, customers continue to spend cautiously, especially on discretionary products, and the paycheck cycle remains pronounced. Government assistance continues to increase as a form of payment, particularly in regions with higher unemployment and credit now only represents about 15% of our tender.
Investments in rollbacks in the first two months of the quarter caused a decrease in operating income of 22 basis points, as our gross margin rate was down year-over-year. Walmart U.S. inventory is up 4.4% compared to last year, represented by increased inventory now placed in Action Alley and increased assortment as we focus on solid in-stock levels. The quality of our inventory is increased, and turns are up. Inventory is still low when compared to historical levels. In fact, it’s well below the July 2007 and the July 2008 levels of inventory. And we will continue to monitor it closely in the coming months.
We continued our trends of expense leverage. In a period where sales were flat, we reduced SG&A expense by 159 basis points, the result of three key factors. First, the store management teams delivered a 2.8% increase in labor productivity, as our scheduling systems continue to match associate hours with customer traffic. Our scores overall in customer satisfaction remain in line with the strong scores we have been consistently reporting.
Second, our sales shortfall resulted in a decrease in the accrual for the management incentive plan for the first half of the year. And, third, we changed our advertising strategy and brought media expenditures back in line with historical trends. Recall that advertising expenses were up significantly last quarter versus previous periods. We will continue to broaden and accelerate key sustainability initiatives, as they help make us a better company and contribute to expense savings. We particularly focused on energy improvements this quarter.
Our logistics team continues to deliver more improved fleet efficiency. We are also expanding our use of fuel cell technology to power our stores. Currently, we operate two such fuel cells and we are planning to have as many as 10 by the end of the year. Each fuel cell can generate up to 60% of a typical supercenter’s power needs. Other income for the Walmart segment did not change significantly on a year-over-year basis.
Now, let me cover some trends affecting sales. In a mostly deflationary food environment, our grocery sales generated slightly positive comp sales. As I mentioned earlier, the more aggressive rollbacks did not generate the overall sales lift we expected, but we did see a sequential improvement in grocery traffic during the quarter. Fresh continues to drive growth. Events like Summer Fruit Fair presented the department with greater authority and helped drive double-digit comp growth for many items in produce, including strawberries. Fresh categories, including dairy and meat, for example, had modest inflation, that was offset by deflation in other areas. We gained significant share this quarter in the soft drinks and snack category, both during and after the rollbacks.
Health and wellness comp sales were slightly negative, due to higher generic utilization and a shift to 90-day prescriptions. Wellness categories continued to show positive results. Recalls in over-the-counter areas impacted the business negatively. Optical sales continue to show double-digit unit growth, driven by the strength of our low price points for a complete set of glasses. Initial back-to-school sales indicate that customers are shopping more closely to the event. We are driving price messages for school supplies, electronics, apparel and home or dorm items.
More than 1,000 stores have merchandise specific to college areas, and all stores carry merchandise with logos from local high schools. We are very focused on delivering basics in back-to-school apparel, such as socks, underwear, tees, and school uniforms. Overall apparel comps remain negative. We are focused on improvement in our apparel business and believe we will see better comps by the fourth quarter. Our team is re-emphasizing offerings for our core shopper and including more relevant size offerings in our core brands, Faded Glory, Danskin Now and Just My Size.
In home, comps were negative. Sales of grills, lawnmowers and patio sets were soft. Indoor categories were mixed, with strength in floor care, appliances and bedding, categories for many student dorm rooms. Sales in baking and decorating were strong, reflecting the ongoing trend of customers cooking and baking at home. Hardlines also had a negative comp. As people look to save on do-it-yourself items for homes and their cars, sales in categories like automotive and hardware did improve.
Our entertainment comp sales were negative, but we are seeing improvement in back-to-school related areas. We are up against last year’s converter box sales and are pleased with unit sales growth for our larger screen TVs. Comps remain challenged by a decline in average unit retail prices. Our wireless business remains strong behind the popularity of our Straight Talk offering and sales of iPhones.
Walmart Financial Services experienced double-digit growth, led by continued growth in check cashing and the Walmart Money Card. We are also benefitting from the extension of our Walmart MoneyCard agreements with Green Dot Corporation and GE Money Bank. Walmart.com continues to grow at a rapid pace. Average order size was essentially flat, but traffic increased significantly. Sales of many categories were strong, including health and beauty, home, and entertainment. We moved many large items such as playground equipment and pools to the online channel and saw significant upticks in sales of these products.
The final group of our 550 store remodels, scheduled for this year, are currently underway. We have improved our remodeling process by reducing the level of disruption for our customers and associates as merchandise is moved around the store. We are very pleased about the decision by the City Council to approve three stores in Chicago. This is part of our goal to build several dozen stores across Chicago during the next several years. With the news of Chicago, we have been contacted by numerous officials in some of the largest U.S. urban markets who want to discuss opportunities with us. This bodes well for our continued growth in the U.S. in the future.
Now, let’s look forward. As I mentioned earlier, we are confident that the changes we are making will improve the top line sales by the fourth quarter. We are focused on the right assortment, price leadership, driving traffic and delivering an unbeatable customer experience in our stores. We recognize that it will take time to see significant changes in our comps and that the U.S. economy remains challenging. Gas prices and unemployment continue to influence how our core customers shop.
The 13-week comp for the third quarter period last year was a negative 0.5%. We are forecasting a comp of minus 2% to plus 1% for the 13-week period from July 31st through October 29th, 2010. You may recall that last year, we reduced our inventory in the second quarter by 5.7%, or $1.4 billion, when compared to the prior year. In the third quarter, year-over-year inventory reduction grew to $1.8 billion. It’s clear that last year’s inventory was lean and we are now up against that very low base. As we bring merchandise back to meet the needs of our customers, we expect to see modest increases in inventory in our stores and distribution centers. We are comfortable with the level of inventory growing at or slightly above the same rate of sales. We expect the gross margin rate for the second half of this year to be essentially flat when compared to last year.
Now, I will pass things over to Doug to hear about our International business. Doug?

At our annual shareholders meeting in June, Mike talked about how Walmart’s culture appeals to every country, sets us apart from the competition, and builds trust with our customers. This culture allows our associates to continue driving growth and achieve great results through customer service. I see this first hand in every country I visit, and he couldn’t be more right. Thanks to our associates for another strong quarter.
I am very pleased with our double-digit sales growth and operating income growth this quarter. International net sales for the second quarter were $25.9 billion, an increase of 11% from last year. This sales increase includes $857 million from the relative strengthening of many currencies against the U.S. dollar. Sales on a constant currency basis were $25 billion, a 7.3% increase over the second quarter of last year.
On a constant currency basis, sales increased for the second quarter primarily due to a strong underlying performance in Mexico, as well as new store growth in Brazil and China. International’s operating income for the second quarter was $1.3 billion, up 16.8% from last year, and an increase of 12.7% on a constant currency basis. We are very pleased that in a tough environment, we grew operating income faster than sales.
Excluding the impact of acquisitions, for six consecutive quarters now, we have leveraged our constant currency expenses. With tight expense management, our teams leveraged expenses in almost all of our operating countries, with the exception of slight headwinds in Mexico and Canada.
On a constant currency basis, gross margin as a percentage of sales increased slightly in the second quarter, while membership and other income declined as a percentage of sales. As for inventory, we continue to make good progress reducing days on hand compared to last year, despite headwinds in China and Japan. Overall, International inventory grew slower than the rate of sales growth.
Now, let’s get into the results for several of our markets. As a reminder, we hold country management accountable for their results on a constant currency basis, without the impact of potential swings in exchange rates. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency fluctuations. Let’s change things up a bit for this quarter. Latin America has so much going on there, and we continue to see terrific growth opportunities there, so let’s start with Walmart Mexico and Central America.
As you know, in February, Wal-Mart Mexico purchased 100% of Walmart Central America, our majority-owned subsidiary with operations in five Central American countries. Until the Central America business has been a part of Walmex for a full year, the discussion here on Mexico will exclude the results of Central America. As a reminder, this discussion is under U.S. GAAP. Walmex separately reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP.
Walmex’s sales for this quarter were up 9.8%, and comparable store sales were up 2.7%, outperforming the industry. This sales increase is even more impressive when you consider the Easter calendar change and the comparison to higher sales during last year’s H1N1 outbreak. So far this year, Walmex has opened 60 new stores and restaurants. For the second quarter, all of Mexico’s formats have positive comp growth. Customer count was up 3.7% at comparable stores. Average ticket declined 90 basis points on EDLP price investments in the Bodega Aurrera format.
For the second quarter, Walmex same-store sales for self-service formats grew by 2.2 %, while ANTAD’s same-store sales report for the rest of the industry grew by 1.3%. Second quarter gross margin grew 85 basis points from last year and operating expenses as a percentage of sales grew 45 basis points. Higher utility rates were a large component of expense growth. Despite the expense headwinds, operating income grew at 19.4%, which was faster than sales.
Now to Brazil, another key market where we continue to grow. Since the second quarter of last year, we opened 93 new stores in Brazil. This includes 7 new stores in the second quarter of this year. Brazil has the greatest number of retail banners of our countries, and that enables us to have formats that meet the local and regional needs of our customers. Brazil’s second quarter sales growth was 13.3% and comparable store sales grew 3.1%, both in real terms.
Customer traffic at comparable stores declined 5.2% and average ticket increased 9.1% in real terms. Sales at our cash and carry, supermarkets and soft discount formats continue to perform well. A change in sales mix and soft sales in fresh resulted in a 1.1 percentage point decline in gross margin as a percentage of sales. Expenses as a percentage of sales improved even after adding a significant number of new stores at the end of last year.
Moving to Asia, in Japan, second quarter overall sales and comparable store sales both declined by approximately 0.8 %, the result of continued deflation in grocery and consumables. This performance is on top of a market that had comp declines in the low-single digits. The market data is sourced from the Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry or METI.
In real terms, comparable store sales in Japan increased by 1.6%, as traffic continues to increase because customers are responding well to EDLP. Food and consumables showed strong performance, while general merchandise and apparel sales were down. Expenses as a percentage of sales are down significantly from last year due to our continued focus on execution of EDLC in support of the EDLP initiative.
China continues to be a growth market for Walmart. In the second quarter, we opened 7 stores, for a total of 36 new stores in the last 12 months. This brings our total China store count to 291. Sales increased 15.4% over the second quarter of last year, and comparable store sales growth remained strong at 6.1%. Average ticket grew significantly, but traffic declined as customers continue to buy more each trip. Gross margin as a percentage of sales was down slightly from the second quarter of last year on continued price leadership. Operating income grew faster than sales, due to the continued expense savings from labor productivity programs and energy efficiency initiatives.
We continue to be pleased with our support of Bharti Retail and the progress in India. Bharti Retail continues to grow and now operates 72 supermarkets and 6 compact hypermarkets, with great sales growth. Our two cash and carry stores are performing well, and we have recently announced the opening of our third store. In the United Kingdom, ASDA continues to make good progress towards their strategic goals. In May, ADSA announced its intent to acquire the Netto Food stores located in the U.K. These stores will bring many great new locations and a platform for smaller store formats throughout the United Kingdom. Of course, the acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close later this year.
In the second quarter, ASDA’s sales grew in the low-single digits, while comp sales without fuel declined 40 basis points. According to Kantar Worldpanel, ASDA’s market share dropped slightly in the 12 weeks ending July 11th. ASDA’s gross margin as a percentage of sales increased in the second quarter on a mix shift towards higher margin George and general merchandise. George had a particularly strong quarter, with strong sales of World Cup related merchandise and our 100-day quality guarantee. Customers continue to respond well to our guarantee, and we continue to see this as a unique competitive advantage in the market. Expenses as a percentage of sales declined slightly as the ASDA ‘we operate for less’ program continues to deliver efficiencies. As a result, operating income grew faster than sales.
On e-commerce, ASDA’s second dedicated home shopping center will open next month and will provide enhanced coverage in an area of low market share for ASDA. ASDA’s customers are facing recently announced tax increases and cuts in government spending. These are likely to cause our U.K. customers to face a challenging 12 to 18 months. Recent price reductions on high volume staples such as milk and eggs and the guaranteed lowest basket price show ASDA’s commitment to provide the value our customers expect and trust us to deliver.
And finally Canada, Walmart Canada’s second quarter sales growth was 4.2%. The growth was largely due to the supercenter expansion program and a strong category performance in existing stores. As Mike said, we now have 100 supercenters in Canada, 40 more than this time last year. Comparable sales in Canada were flat to last year. Traffic was down 40 basis points and ticket up 40 basis points in the second quarter as customers continue to be cautious. Sales in Western Canada have been softer than both Ontario and Quebec. Growth was led by sales of food, consumables and health and wellness, partially offset by softer sales in entertainment and hardlines. Canada’s gross margin rate increased over last year, due to better inventory management, a reduction in shrinkage and improved purchasing.
Canada’s expenses grew faster than sales primarily due to our bank startup costs and an increase in utility rates. Despite the increase in expenses, Canada’s second quarter operating income grew faster than sales. In closing, our associates are merchants first. In more than 4,200 International stores, we remain focused on the customer and executing on the basics of price leadership, assortment and in-stock. Every day, our associates strive to provide a great customer experience and earn trust.
I am encouraged by the progress we are making at leveraging Walmart knowledge globally to improve our customer proposition and increase shareholder value. Now, I will turn it over to Brian for an update on Sam’s Club. Brian?

At Sam’s Club, our strategy remains focused on taking care of our members and staying true to our brand promise of ‘Savings Made Simple’. To fulfill that brand promise, we focus every day on making the right merchandise choices, enhancing the shopping experience and engaging our members in different ways.
Before getting into all of the financial details, I want to share some of the key highlights about our business. First, we are reporting a comp sales increase of 1%, excluding fuel, for the 13-week period, which I am pleased to say, was at the top of our guidance. We are proud to recognize the accomplishments of our dedicated managers and associates who lead our efforts in improving club productivity and expense control on a daily basis. Excluding the impact of the interchange fee related to the Sam’s rewards credit program, which we detailed in last quarter’s call, we leveraged expenses for the third straight quarter.
We are improving our shopping experience with innovation and technology. Early last week, we announced plans to upgrade all clubs to WiFi by the end of the year. Our members will benefit by having the use of their smart phones while shopping. And our associates will be able to demo new IPTVs and other networked devices on a real-time basis.
In addition, last week, we announced that we will carry the iPhone 4 in our clubs. We have stepped up our efforts to bring the most sought after brands into our clubs sooner and more often, relying on member insights to make the most relevant merchandising choices for Sam’s members. Growth continues to be a priority, and our team welcomed a new club that opened last month in Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, marking our tenth club on the island. We also have another grand opening next week in Nicholasville, Kentucky.
Now, let’s turn to the detailed financial results. For the second quarter, net sales for Sam’s Club, excluding fuel, increased to $11.4 billion, which is a 60 basis point increase over last year. Including fuel, second quarter sales were $12.5 billion, which is a 2.2% increase versus last year, primarily due to higher fuel prices this year compared to last year. Fuel prices in the second quarter this year were approximately 11.3% higher than last year.
Club comp sales, excluding fuel, for the 13-week period increased 1%. Including fuel, club comp sales increased 2.6%. Comp ticket increased for the 13-week period, with both Business and Advantage average ticket, excluding fuel, increasing. Comp traffic, excluding fuel, declined for the 13-week period. Sales in many of our largest fresh and health and wellness categories continue to be positive, including produce, meat, snacks, baby care and pharmacy. We also are seeing an uptick in discretionary spending via positive performance in categories such as mattresses, jewelry, domestics and house wares. The momentum in mattress sales is complemented by the rollout of our new delivery program.
Sales in apparel continue to improve, the result of adding several key brands that are resonating with our members. Seasonal categories such as grills, patio, seasonal decor were also successful during the quarter. Additionally, tobacco sales continue to be very positive. Overall, broad-based deflation appears to be abating, and we have even begun to experience some inflation in a few categories like meat and dairy. However, we continued to see pricing pressure in the second quarter in some laundry and paper categories.
In the second quarter, consistent with many key competitors, we continued to have negative trends in our entertainment and technology business. The industry has experienced reduced promotional activity; however, we have seen improvement in this business over the past few weeks.
Our second quarter operating income increased 2.4% versus last year to $428 million, including a $16 million contribution from fuel profit. Excluding fuel, operating income decreased by 1.7%. Gross margin rates, excluding fuel, increased by 15 basis points during the second quarter, primarily driven by the continued shift in merchandising mix towards higher margin fresh products. Including fuel, gross margin rate for the quarter increased by 8 basis points. Inventory increased slightly by 80 basis points versus last year.
We have been strategically aggressive in key events like ‘back-to-school’ and ‘back-to-college’ and we anticipate a solid season. We continue to be mindful of maintaining the right balance between solid inventory management and ensuring we have the right products members want when they shop our clubs.
We have completed work on 33 of what we call ‘pure Project Portfolio clubs’, with another 16 under construction. In addition, we have completed or are completing approximately another 70 scheduled remodels, in which we have added various aspects of Project Portfolio as part of the remodel. Stated another way, ‘pure Portfolio’ clubs or clubs in which no other material remodel activity was conducted. As a reminder, the main focus of Project Portfolio is to increase the assortment of highly productive merchandise categories like fresh and health and wellness. We continue to be pleased with the direction of the test and are making adjustments as we move forward. Overall, our members are pleased with the key changes.
Expenses grew 2.7% versus last year, driven by increases in credit card interchange fees, remodel and marketing expenses. For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 2.7% and our club wages were basically flat versus last year. Units per labor hour increased approximately 1.4% for the second quarter versus last year. I am very pleased with our progress on expense leverage and club efficiency.
Membership and other income for the second quarter increased by 1.2% versus the prior year. Membership income, the primary driver, increased 80 basis points versus last year, mainly due to Plus membership upgrades. In July, we hosted a ‘stock- up’ event to drive increases in membership and traffic, and we are pleased with the incremental sign-ups. Our Plus membership, with eValues and other new benefits, such as earlier shopping hours, continues to show good momentum.
Add-on Business memberships still face headwinds, given the challenges that many small business owners are encountering. We will continue to look for innovative ways to drive traffic, renewals and upgrades of existing members. In May, we launched a pilot program in an effort to help business members get access to the credit and capital they need to run and grow their businesses. I am pleased with the positive response from our small business members to these initiatives.
The third quarter is underway and we are focused on a number of efforts to drive even greater value for our members and shareholders in accordance with our corporate priorities of growth, leverage and returns. The Sam’s Club team is keenly focused on top line sales growth, driving comps and productivity.
From August 6th through the 8th, we hosted an ‘Open House’ which allowed non-members to shop our clubs without incurring a standard surcharge on their purchases. This event introduced prospective members to the value proposition behind Sam’s. We were very pleased with the results from both the sales and membership perspective.
On a final note, last week, Todd Harbaugh was appointed Executive Vice President of Operations upon the announcement of Nacho Perez’s [ph] retirement. Todd joined Walmart in October of 1990. During his 20-year career, he served in a variety of positions and most recently held the role of Senior Vice President of Integration, Planning and Communications at Sam’s Club. We wish Nacho well, and we are pleased to have great team depth, which is demonstrated by Todd’s appointment.
The current economy remains challenging for both Business and Advantage members. However, we have seen sales momentum over the past few weeks. We expect comp sales, without fuel, for the current 13-week period from July 31st, 2010 through October 29th, 2010, to range from flat to positive 2%.
I will turn the program over to Tom for the report card and guidance discussion. Tom?

Like last quarter, before I get into our financial report card and discuss growth, leverage and returns, I would like to give you a quick update on our SAP implementation.
We shared with you previously that on May 1st, we began implementing SAP throughout North America, that would exclude Mexico and its Central America subsidiary. This implementation has now been up and running for three months. As you would expect with any major system initiative, we have experienced some challenges along the way, but I am proud to say that nothing prevented us from successfully completing our monthly close processes during the quarter, so we really feel good about the numbers, the integrity of the numbers. Most of our challenges have been in the area of change management, which are being addressed, since the new system is performing as designed.
We will continue to leverage what we have learned as implementation in other countries continues. We plan to go live in Japan later this year and have also started work in Mexico. Now let’s move on to our financial report card to see how well we have done with growth, leverage and returns. First, let’s discuss growth. For the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we grew both our square footage and sales. Sales grew almost 3% for the quarter, mainly driven by Walmart International, which you heard about earlier in this call.
Net square footage of retail space increased by approximately 5 million square feet to 961 million square feet at the end of the second quarter. So far this year, we have added 8.6 million square feet, in an effort to reach more people, so that they can save money and live better. We continue to feel good about our growth prospects across the company. As always, we will update both CapEx forecasts and square footage goals for this year and next at the October meeting for the investment community.
Next is a discussion on leverage. Our commitment to the productivity loop and every day low costs has now resulted in three consecutive quarters of expense leverage, and obviously this has been a significant contributor to our bottom line results. We are really proud of our progress here.
Finally, let’s chat about returns. As I mentioned in the first quarter, inventories at the end of last fiscal year were relatively low for Walmart. This ‘starting point’ obviously will impact free cash flow all year, as it did for the second quarter. The difference here is that in the second quarter, the accounts payable increase positively affected free cash flow. Earlier in the call, Charles covered these details. Having said all that, our free cash flow through the first six months of this year was $4.5 billion, and compares to $4.2 billion we reported for the same period last year.
Our goal for return on investment is to provide a consistently high return. Return on investment for the 12 months ended July 31st was 19%, up from the 18.4% last year. The story behind ROI is really driven by strong operating performance. As I mentioned just a few minutes ago, we increased square footage and continue to invest in the business. Average invested capital or the denominator used to calculated ROI increased 5%. However, our continued focus on the productivity loop has produced strong operating results. The trailing 12-month adjusted operating income or the numerator for ROI has grown by almost 9%. Overall, we are very pleased with this performance in return on investment.
Now let’s move on to guidance. Based on our view of the business, and the current U.S. sales environment, we expect third quarter diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2011 to be between $0.87 and $0.91 per share. Please remember what we discussed earlier in the call and the fact that our new retail inventory valuation methodology will reduce last year’s third quarter reported earnings per share. In addition, there will be an offset to that reduction in Q3, with an improvement to the restated fourth quarter earnings from last year. You might want to keep this in mind as you refine your model.
With all that in mind, and based on the underlying strength of our business, we are raising our full-year EPS guidance to a range of $3.95 a share to $4.05. This guidance assumes that currency exchange rates remain at today’s levels. In closing, I would like to summarize with just a few key points. We delivered strong EPS this quarter, ahead of First Call consensus. Expense leverage was the main driver of the bottom line this quarter and will continue to be a strategic priority. ROI is extremely healthy and above the prior year as we continue to deliver solid operating performance. And finally, Walmart has produced strong and consistent earnings growth, and solid returns to shareholders, both in the form of share repurchase and dividends.
Thank you for listening today. We really appreciate your interest in Walmart.

Thanks for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call for fiscal year 2011. All information for this quarter, including updated unit counts,",644,"Good morning, this is Carol Schumacher, Vice President of Investor Relations for Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Thanks for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call for fiscal year 2011. 
All information for this quarter, including updated unit counts, square footage and financial metrics is available on our website at walmartstores.com/investors. A full transcript of this call will be available on the website after 7 a.m. Central Time on August 17, 2010. 
Our executive team is ready to report on our second quarter results of fiscal 2011. Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., will cover the key highlights of our quarterly results. Charles Holley, Executive Vice President of Finance and Treasurer, has the details behind our consolidated financials. Then we'll go to the operating segments. Bill Simon, our new President and CEO of Wal-Mart U.S., will be followed by Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart International. And then we'll have Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam's Club. Tom Schoewe, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will round out the call with an update on our SAP implementation, our company's financial report card and earnings guidance. 
But first, let me cover some important changes we have made that affect our financials. During the second quarter, we had two changes. As you know, we've been implementing SAP through a staged timetable across our businesses. The implementation's first stage was ASDA, our U.K. subsidiary. The second stage was in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada, and the implementation started May 1, 2010. 
In connection with the second stage of that implementation and coinciding with the improvements available in our new financial systems, the SAP implementation gave us the ability to improve our methodology for valuing inventory under the retail method of inventory accounting. 
We have improved our ability to measure inventory at more granular levels. The systems change will better align the accounting for inventory components, with how the merchants run their businesses. As a result, the aggregation of certain inventory groups now occurs at lower levels, which produces a different cost valuation for the affected inventory. The retrospective application of this accounting change has impacted both segment and consolidated operating income, as well as consolidated net income. 
Let me share the effect of this change. For fiscal year 2010, adjusted earnings per share are currently $3.73, up $0.01 from the reported $3.72. This change was driven by the impact to cost of sales from the described inventory accounting change. While fiscal 2010 changed by $0.01 of EPS, there are some quarterly fluctuations or volatility in merchandise shipments. For example, you will notice that last year's second quarter, Wal-Mart reported EPS of $0.88, but today, we're reporting $0.89 per share for the same quarter. For the third and fourth quarters, we adjusted EPS by a negative $0.02 and a positive $0.03, respectively. These adjustments impact the operating income of both Wal-Mart U.S. and Wal-Mart International. 
Financial information for all periods discussed on this call and in our second quarter earnings release today is presented on a comparative basis for the retrospective application of this accounting change. Please note that we have provided detailed explanations in the notes of the press release. The website section titled ""Financial Results"" contains the comparable financial information for each quarterly reporting period in fiscal 2010 and the first quarter of fiscal 2011. 
Second, as of this quarter, we have started including Wakana units in our unit count for Wal-Mart Japan. Wakanas are fully owned, stand-alone take-out restaurants generally less than 1,000 square feet. 
One last reminder. Recall that effective with this fiscal year, the operations in Puerto Rico moved from Wal-Mart International to their respective U.S. segments. Comp sales and all information today in Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam's Club reports do include results from Puerto Rico. 
Now Mike, let's get started with our earnings news. Mike?"
313055,79147925,75122,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug-17-2010",2010-08-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Carol. Welcome, everyone. I'm pleased with our second quarter EPS. Despite a tough sales environment, we managed the business well, delivering on expense leverage through our commitment to the productivity loop. Today, we are reporting EPS of",628,"Thank you, Carol. Welcome, everyone. I'm pleased with our second quarter EPS. Despite a tough sales environment, we managed the business well, delivering on expense leverage through our commitment to the productivity loop. 
Today, we are reporting EPS of $0.97, within our guidance of $0.93 to $0.98. We consistently grow earnings, and this quarter's EPS grew 9%. More important, we are raising our EPS guidance for the full year to $3.95 to $4.5. 
Net sales for the quarter were up almost 3% to more than $103 billion. Operating income for the company was more than $6 billion, up more than 4%. The company leverage expenses for the third consecutive quarter. This remains a priority throughout the company. 
We surpassed 8,500 worldwide units in July, representing various formats. During the quarter, the company added almost 5 million square feet of retail space in our 15 countries. We had significant square footage growth in Mexico and China, and I'm pleased that China is on track to reach the 300-store mark in September. Our balance sheet remains world class and reflects the underlying strength of our business. 
Now let me move on to the highlights of the individual operating segments. In Wal-Mart U.S., I'm pleased with speedy leadership transition, with Bill Simon, taking the reins of our largest operating segment. Bill is a strong leader who transformed the customer experience in our stores and has continued to drive innovation and improvement throughout the business. 
As expected, Wal-Mart U.S. had a challenging second quarter. Total sales and operating income were flat to the prior year, with comps declining 1.8%. The top priority for the business remains improving top line sales and customer traffic. 
I'm fully aligned with Bill's focus on the assortment and pricing and with strengthening our supplier relationships. I'm also impressed with urgency and the speed that he and his team are demonstrating in executing changes in strategy that are making sense for our customers and shareholders. They're moving rapidly to build on the initiatives that worked and adjusting those that have not worked. 
Sam's Club delivered 1% comp growth, which was at the top of their guidance. They also increased operating income and continue to maintain the right balance of inventory in the clubs. I'm pleased with how Brian and the team are focused on membership and merchandise. And I look forward to consistently strong results ahead. 
Wal-Mart International continues to be an impressive growth engine. Doug and his team grew net sales by 11%, and grew operating income faster than sales. They also leveraged expenses for the sixth quarter in a row. 
We continue to see aggressive growth throughout international. I mentioned Mexico and China earlier. I need to call out Wal-Mart Canada. It opened its 100th supercenter in July. We expect that International will continue to be a strong contributor to our company's growth and our overall results. 
In his new role in leading global e-commerce and global sourcing, Eduardo Castro-Wright is bringing an even greater intensity to positioning Wal-Mart as the global leader in multichannel retail. You can expect to hear more about both of these areas at our investor conference in October. 
We will not stray from our EDLC-EDLP business model, and we will keep listening to our customers and associates. The slow economic recovery will continue to affect our customers, and we expect they will remain cautious about spending. Wal-Mart remains committed to our mission of saving people money so that they can live better. 
Our leadership team across the company has never been stronger or more focused on our priorities of growth, leverage and returns. As we build the Next Generation Wal-Mart, we're confident about the future of our business. 
Now I'll turn it over to Charles for the detailed financial results. Charles?"
313055,79147925,75122,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug-17-2010",2010-08-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. For the second quarter of fiscal 2011, the company delivered earnings from continuing operations of $3.6 billion, an increase of 3.4% from last year. Wal-Mart reported earnings of $0.97 per share, a 9% increase over last year's earnings per",917,"Thanks, Mike. For the second quarter of fiscal 2011, the company delivered earnings from continuing operations of $3.6 billion, an increase of 3.4% from last year. Wal-Mart reported earnings of $0.97 per share, a 9% increase over last year's earnings per share of $0.89. Earnings per share included a benefit of approximately $0.01 from currency exchange rate fluctuations and was within our guidance for the quarter of $0.93 to $0.98 per share. In addition, we are pleased that we delivered earnings per share for the second quarter above First Call consensus of $0.96. 
Consolidated net sales increased 2.8% to $103 billion for the quarter. Wal-Mart International was the main driver of growth and was helped by a currency benefit of $857 million. On a constant-currency basis, consolidated net sales increased 2%.  The 13-week total U.S. comparable store sales without fuel declined 1.4%. You will hear more details on the Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam's Club comp sales from Bill and Brian. 
Expense management continues to be a positive story. Wal-Mart leveraged expenses for the third consecutive quarter, with expenses growing only 0.6% on a sales growth of 2.8%. The CEOs for the three operating segments will give additional details on their leverage performance. 
Unallocated corporate overhead, which includes corporate expenses, decreased to $416 million. That's a decline of 15.3% from last year. Although unallocated corporate overhead can have some volatility from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to manage our core corporate overhead expenses well. The key takeaway is that we were able to leverage those expenses in the second quarter. 
Consolidated gross margin decreased 32 basis points to 24.7%. The decrease was driven by Wal-Mart U.S., which Bill will elaborate on later in the call. 
With the gross margin decrease more than offset by expense leverage, the company was able to grow operating income at 4.4% over last year. This growth rate was slightly faster than sales. The company's operating income of $6.2 billion included a $46 million benefit of currency exchange rate fluctuations. On constant-currency basis, operating income grew 3.6%. Consolidated membership and other income increased 30 basis points to $710 million for the quarter. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 34.3%. We expect the tax rate for fiscal 2011 to be between 34% and 35%, although we will see some quarterly fluctuations. Factors which may impact our rate include changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. 
Return on investment for the trailing 12 months was 19%, up from 18.4% at the same time last year. Inventory grew 4.3% for the total company compared to the end of the second quarter last year and on a 2.8% sales increase. Wal-Mart U.S. and Wal-Mart International contributed to the increase in inventory, primarily due to the comparisons versus last year's significant inventory reduction and the new Wal-Mart U.S. strategies. 
While inventories were up at the end of the second quarter, payables were up even more. Payables grew at 17.9%, so our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 97.6%, up from 86.3% at the same time last year. The growth in payables is partially related to the growth in inventory but was impacted to a greater extent by the timing of our payment cycles, pushing the payables balance to unusually high levels. 
Although the increase in inventories over last year continues to pressure free cash flow, the growth in payables this quarter actually overcame that pressure. Wal-Mart ended the first half of fiscal 2011 with free cash flow of $4.5 billion compared to $4.2 billion last year, which is very strong. We will continue to manage our inventory to be in line with our current business needs. However, we expect to see year-over-year pressure from higher inventories in the back half of this year. The high payables to inventory ratio should moderate in the second half of the year. 
Our balance sheet remain strong. We continue to have excellent access to credit markets. Our debt-to-total-capitalization ratio at the end of the quarter was 43.2%, slightly up from the 40.4% last year at the same time. The 8.8% increase in our total debt levels, partially offset by lower average borrowing rates, resulted in a slight increase in net interest expense to $485 million. 
Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $3 billion, slightly below last year's CapEx of $3.1 billion. Year-to-date, Wal-Mart has spent $5.6 billion in capital expenditures. As we shared with you last quarter, we expect a larger number of new store openings in the third quarter. 
This is the second quarter in a row that Wal-Mart had set a record for share repurchase. In the first quarter, the company repurchased $3 billion or 55.6 million shares. In this quarter, we repurchased $4.1 billion or 81.3 million shares. As you remember, during our shareholders' meeting on June 4, we announced a new $15 billion share repurchase authorization, which replaced our previous $15 billion plan. Our new authorization has $12.4 billion remaining. 
In the second quarter, Wal-Mart also paid $1.1 billion in dividends. The dividends and share repurchase of $4.1 billion represent $5.2 billion that the company has returned to the shareholders this quarter. Year-to-date, Wal-Mart has returned $9.4 billion to shareholders. 
We are proud of how we manage our business. The strength of our balance sheet serves as a foundation of our commitment to growth, leverage and returns. 
Now let's move on to a discussion of our operating segments. We'll start with Bill and Wal-Mart U.S. Bill?"
313055,79147925,75122,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug-17-2010",2010-08-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Charles.

I'm honored to lead the Wal-Mart U.S. business, and I'm pleased to have the chance to talk to you for a minute about the many challenges and opportunities that we have. We've set out a clear direction for change in our business and believe this will put us on track to see improvement by the fourth quarter. 
In the second quarter, for the first two months of the quarter, Action Alleys were clear of merchandise, and our stores featured many deep rollbacks on price. The deep rollbacks we featured in May and June did improve price impression, but they did not generate that level of top line sales we hoped for. In July, we put the emphasis back on our core EDLP model. Our associates are helping our customers realize that we are the price leader. 
We also engaged with suppliers to review our assortments to make sure that we had the breadth of inventory that Wal-Mart customers have come to expect. In the coming weeks and months, our assortments will be more relevant to our customers, with the right mix of new and innovative products. We are leveraging our supplier's capability to help us drive impactful features. And we're resorting thousands of products to our assortment and adding new items. We plan to win in every category and let customers decide through their purchase decisions what to include in our assortment. 
During the past six weeks, we've returned merchandise Action Alley. Our store managers now have more autonomy to make decisions on what's right for their customers. We believe it will take some time to see significant changes in comp sales, but we are beginning to see more encouraging traffic trends. 
Now I'd like to get to the details on the results for the second quarter. Net sales were flat for the second quarter. Comp sales for the period declined 1.8% for the 13-week period. Comps did improve by the end of the quarter, and traffic trends improved sequentially during the period. 
Consistent with the most recent quarters, customers continue to spend cautiously, especially on discretionary products, and the paycheck cycle remains pronounced. Government assistance continues to increase as a form of payment, particularly in regions with higher unemployment and credit now only represent about 15% of our tender. Investments in rollbacks in the first two months of the quarter caused a decrease in operating income of 22 basis points, as our gross margin rate was down year-over-year. 
Wal-Mart U.S. inventory is up 4.4% compared to last year and represented by increased inventory now placed in Action Alley and increased assortment, as we focus on solid in-stock levels. The quality of our inventory has increased, and turns are up. Inventory is still low, when compared to historical levels. In fact, it's well below the July 2007 and July 2008 levels of inventory, and we'll continue to monitor closely in the coming months. 
We continued our trends of expense leverage. In a period where sales were flat, we reduced SG&A expense by 159 basis points, the result of three key factors. First, the store management teams delivered a 2.8% increase in labor productivity, as our scheduling systems continue to match associate hours with customer traffic. Our scores overall in customer satisfaction remain in line with the strong scores we've been consistently reporting. Second, our sales shortfall resulted in a decrease in the accrual for the management incentive plan for the first half of the year. And third, we changed our advertising strategy and brought media expenditures back in line with historical trends. Recall that advertising expenses were up significantly last quarter versus previous periods. 
We will continue to broaden and accelerate key sustainability initiatives, as they help us make us a better company and contribute to expense savings. We're particularly focused on energy improvements this quarter. Our logistics team continues to deliver more improved fleet efficiency. We're also expanding our use of fuel cell technology to power our stores. 
Currently, we operate two such fuel cells, and we're planning to have as many as 10 by the end of the year. Each fuel cell can generate up to 60% of a typical supercenter's power needs. Other income for the Wal-Mart segment did not change significantly on a year-over-year basis. 
Now let me cover some trends affecting sales. In a mostly deflationary food environment, our grocery sales generated slightly positive comp sales. As I mentioned earlier, the more aggressive rollbacks did not generate the overall sales lift we expected, but we did see a sequential improvement in grocery traffic during the quarter. 
Fresh continues to drive growth. Events like Summer Fruit Fair presented the department with a greater authority and helped drive double-digit comp growth for many items in produce, including strawberries. Fresh categories, including dairy and meat, for example, had modest inflation and was offset by deflation in other areas. We gained significant share this quarter in the soft drink and snack category, both during and after the rollbacks. 
Health and wellness comp sales were slightly negative due to higher generic utilization and a shift to 90-day prescriptions. Wellness categories continued to show positive results. Recalls in over-the-counter areas impacted the business negatively. Optical sales continue to show double-digit unit growth driven by the strength of our low price points for a complete set of glasses. 
Initial back-to-school sales indicate that customers are shopping more closely to the event. We're driving price messages for school supplies, electronics, apparel and home or dorm items. More than 1,000 stores have merchandise specific to college areas, and all stores carry merchandise with logos from local high schools. We are very focused on delivering basics and back-to-school apparel such as socks, underwear, tees and school uniforms. 
Overall Apparel comps remain negative. We're focused on improvement in our Apparel business and believe we'll see better comps by the fourth quarter. Our team is re-emphasizing offerings for our core shopper and including more relevant size offerings in our core brands: Faded Glory, Danskin Now and Just My Size. 
In Home, comps when negative. Sales of grills, lawnmowers and patios sets were soft. Indoor categories were mixed, with strength in floor care, appliances and bedding, categories for many student dorm rooms. Sales in baking and decorating were strong, reflecting the ongoing trend of customers cooking and baking at home. 
Hardlines also had a negative comp. As people look to save on do-it-yourself items for homes and their cars, sales in categories like automotive and hardware did improve. 
Our Entertainment comp sales were negative, but we're seeing improvement in back-to-school related areas. We're up against last year's converter box sales and are pleased with unit sales growth for our larger screen TVs. Comps remain challenged by a decline in average unit retail prices. Our Wireless business remains strong behind the popularity of our Straight Talk offering and sales of iPhones. 
Wal-Mart Financial Services experienced double-digit growth led by continued growth in check cashing and the Wal-Mart MoneyCard. We're also benefiting from the extension of our Wal-Mart MoneyCard agreements with Green Dot Corporation and GE Money Bank. 
walmart.com continues to grow at a rapid pace. Average order size was essentially flat, but traffic increased significantly. Sales of many categories were strong, including Health and Beauty, Home and Entertainment. We moved many large items such as playground equipment and pools to the online channels and saw significant upticks in sales of these products. 
The final group of our 550-store remodels scheduled for this year are currently underway. We have improved our remodeling process by reducing the level of disruption for our customers and associates as merchandise has been moved around the store. 
We're very pleased about the decision by the City Council to approve the stores in Chicago. This is part of our goal to build several dozen stores across Chicago during the next several years. With the news at Chicago, we've been contacted by numerous officials in some of the largest U.S. urban markets, who want to discuss opportunities with us. This bodes well for our continued growth in the U.S. in the future. 
Now let's look forward. As I mentioned earlier, we're confident that the changes we're making will improve the top line sales by the fourth quarter. We're focused on the right assortment, price leadership, driving traffic and delivering an unbeatable customer experience in our stores. We recognize that it will take time to see significant changes in our comps and that the U.S. economy remains challenging. Gas prices and unemployment continue to influence our core customer shop. 
The 13-week comp for the third quarter period last year was negative 0.5%. We're forecasting a comp of minus 2% to plus 1% for the 13-week period from July 31 through October 29, 2010. 
You may recall that last year, we reduced our inventory in the second quarter by 5.7% or $1.4 billion, when compared to the prior year. In the third quarter, year-over-year inventory reduction grew to $1.8 billion. It's clear that last year's inventory was lean, and we're now up against that very low base. As we're bringing merchandise back to meet the needs of our customers, we expect to see modest increases in inventory in our stores and distribution centers. 
We are comfortable with the level of inventory growing at or slightly above the same rate of sales. We expect the gross margin rate for the second half of this year to be essentially flat when compared to last year. 
Now I will pass things over to Doug to hear about our International business. Doug?"

At our Annual Shareholders' Meeting in June, Mike talked about how Wal-Mart's culture appeals to every country, sets us apart from the competition and builds trust with our customers. This culture allows our associates to continue driving growth and achieve great results for customer service. I've seen this firsthand at every country I visit, and it couldn't be more right. Thanks to our associates for another strong quarter. 
I'm very pleased with a double-digit sales growth and operating income growth this quarter. International net sales for the second quarter were $25.9 billion, an increase of 11% from last year. This sales increase includes $857 million from the relative strengthening of many currencies against the U.S. dollar. Sales on a constant-currency basis were $25 billion, a 7.3% increase over the second quarter of last year. 
On a constant-currency basis, sales increased for the second quarter primarily due to a strong underlying performance in Mexico, as well as new store growth in Brazil and China. International's operating income for the second quarter was $1.3 billion, up 16.8% from last year and an increase of 12.7% on a constant-currency basis.  We're very pleased that in a tough environment, we grew operating income faster than sales. 
Excluding the impact of acquisitions, for six consecutive quarters now, we've leveraged our constant-currency expenses. With tight expense management, our teams leveraged expenses in almost all of our operating company countries, with the exception of slight headwinds in Mexico and Canada. 
On a constant-currency basis, gross margin as a percentage of sales increased slightly in the second quarter, while memberships and other income declined as a percentage of sales.  As for inventory, we continue to make good progress reducing days on hand compared to last year despite headwinds in China and Japan. Overall, international inventory grew slower than the rate of sales growth. 
Now let's get into the results for several of our markets. As a reminder, we hold country management accountable for their results on a constant-currency basis without the impact of potential swings in exchange rates. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency fluctuations. 
Let's change things up a bit for this quarter.  Latin America has so much going on there and we continue to see terrific growth opportunities there, so let's start with Wal-Mart Mexico and Central America. As you know in February, Wal-Mart Mexico purchased 100% of Wal-Mart Central America, our majority-owned subsidiary with operations in five Central American countries. Until the Central America business has been a part of Walmex for a full year, the discussion here on Mexico will exclude the results of Central America. 
As a reminder, this discussion is under U.S. GAAP. Walmex separately reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP. Walmex's sales for this quarter were at 9.8% and comparable store sales were up 2.7%, outperforming industry. This sales increase is even more impressive when you consider the Easter calendar change and the comparison to higher sales during last year's H1N1 outbreak. So far this year, Walmex has opened 16 new stores and restaurants. For the second quarter, all of Mexico's formats have positive comp growth. Customer count was up 3.7% at comparable stores. Average ticket declines 90 basis points on EDLP price investments in the Bodega Aurrera format. 
For the second quarter, Walmex's same-store sales for self-service formats grew by 2.2% while ANTAD's same-store sales report for the rest of the industry grew by 1.3%. Second quarter gross margin grew 85 basis points from last year and operating expenses as a percentage of sales grew 45 basis points. Higher utility rates were a large component of expense growth. Despite the expense headwinds, operating income grew at 19.4%, which was faster than sales. 
Now to Brazil, another key market where we continue to grow. Since the second quarter of last year, we opened 93 new stores in Brazil. This includes seven new stores in the second quarter of this year. Brazil has the greatest number of retail banners of our countries, and that enables us to have formats that meet the local and regional needs of our customers. Brazil's second quarter sales growth was 13.3% and comparable store sales grew 3.1%, both in real terms. Customer traffic at comparable stores declined 5.2% and average ticket increased 9.1% in real terms. Sales at our cash-and-carry supermarkets and soft discount formats continue to perform well. A change in sales mix and soft sales in Fresh resulted in a 1.1 percentage point decline in gross margin as a percentage of sales. Expenses as a percentage of sales improved even after adding a significant number of new stores at the end of last year. 
Moving to Asia. In Japan, second quarter overall sales and comparable store sales both declined by approximately 0.8%, the result of continued deflation in grocery and consumables. This performance is on top of the market that had comp declines in the low-single digits. The market data is sourced from the Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry, or METI. In real terms, comparable store sales in Japan increased by 1.6%, as traffic continues to increase because customers are responding well to EDLP. 
Food and Consumables showed strong performance, while General Merchandise and Apparel sales were down. Expenses as a percentage of sales are down significantly from last year due to our continued focus on execution of EDLC and support of the EDLP initiative. 
China continues to be a growth market for Wal-Mart. In the second quarter, we opened seven stores for a total of 36 new stores in the last 12 months. This brings our total China store count to 291. Sales increased 15.4% over the second quarter of last year and comparable store sales growth remains strong at 6.1%. Average ticket grew significantly, but traffic declined as customers continue to buy more each trip. Gross margin as a percentage of sales was down slightly from the second quarter of last year on continued price leadership. Operating income grew faster than sales due to the continued expense savings from labor productivity programs and energy-efficiency initiatives. 
We continue to be pleased with our support of Bharti Retail and the progress in India. Bharti Retail continues to grow and now operates 72 supermarkets and six compact hypermarkets with great sales growth. Our two cash-and-carry stores are performing well, and we've recently announced the opening of our third store. 
In the United Kingdom, ASDA continues to make good progress towards their strategic goals. In May, ASDA announced its intent to acquire the Netto Foodstores located in the U.K. These stores will bring many great new locations and a platform for smaller store formats throughout the United Kingdom. Of course, the acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close later this year. 
In the second quarter, ASDA's sales grew in the low-single digits, while comp sales, without fuel, declined 40 basis points. According to Kantar Worldpanel, ASDA's market share dropped slightly in the 12 weeks ending July 11. ASDA's gross margin as a percentage of sales increased in the second quarter on a mix shift towards higher margin George and general merchandise. 
George had a particularly strong quarter with strong sales of World Cup-related merchandise and our 100-day quality guarantee. Customers continue to respond well to our guarantee, and we continue to see this as a unique competitive advantage in the market. 
Expenses as a percentage of sales declined slightly as the ASDA, We Operate for Less program continues to deliver efficiencies. As a result, operating income grew faster than sales. 
 
On eCommerce, ASDA's second dedicated home shopping center will open next month and will provide enhanced coverage in an area of low market share for ASDA. ASDA's customers are facing recently announced tax increases and cuts in government spending. These are likely to cause our U.K. customers to face a challenging 12 to 18 months. Recent price reductions on high-volume staples such as milk and eggs and the guarantee of lowest basket price show ASDA's commitment to provide the value our customers expect and trust us to deliver. 
And finally, Canada. Wal-Mart Canada's second quarter sales growth was 4.2%. The growth was largely due to the supercenter expansion program and a strong category performance in existing stores. As Mike said, we now have 100 supercenters in Canada, 40 more than this time last year. Comparable sales in Canada were flat to last year. Traffic was down 40 basis points and ticket, up 40 basis points in the second quarter, as customers continue to be cautious. Sales in Western Canada have been softer than both Ontario and Québec. Growth was led by sales of food, consumables and health and wellness, partially offset by softer sales in entertainment and hardlines. 
Canada's gross margin rate increased over last year due to better inventory management, a reduction in shrinkage and improved purchasing. Canada's expenses grew faster than sales primarily due to our bank startup costs and an increase in utility rates. Despite the increase in expenses, Canada's second quarter operating income grew faster than sales. 
In closing, our associates are merchants first. In more than 4,200 international stores, we remain focused on the customer and executing on the basics of price leadership, assortment and in-stock. Everyday, our associates strive to provide a great customer experience and earn trust. I'm encouraged by the progress we're making at leveraging Wal-Mart knowledge globally to improve our customer proposition and increase shareholder value. Now I'll turn it over to Brian for an update on Sam's Club. Brian?"

At Sam's Club, our strategy remains focused on taking care of our members and staying true to our brand promise of Savings Made Simple. To fulfill that brand promise, we focus everyday on making the right merchandise choices, enhancing the shopping experience and engaging our members in different ways. 
Before getting into all of the financial details, I want to share some of the key highlights about our business. First, we are reporting a comp sales increase of 1%, excluding fuel for the 13-week period, which I'm pleased to say was at the top of our guidance. We are proud to recognize the accomplishments of our dedicated managers and associates, the leader on efforts in improving club productivity and expense control on a daily basis. 
Excluding the impact of the interchange fee related to the Sam's rewards credit program, which we detailed in last quarter's call, we leveraged expenses for the third straight quarter. We are improving our shopping experience with innovation and technology. Early last week, we announced plans to upgrade all clubs to Wi-Fi by the end of the year. Our members will benefit by having the use of their smartphones while shopping. And our associates will be able to demo new IP TVs and other network devices on a realtime basis. 
In addition, last week, we announced that we will carry the iPhone 4 in our clubs. We expect our efforts to bring the most sought-after brands into our clubs sooner and more often, relying on member insights to make most relevant merchandising choices for Sam's members. 
Growth continued to be a priority and our team welcomed the new club that opened last month Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, marking our 10th club on the island. We also have another grand opening next week in Nicholasville, Kentucky. 
Now let's turn to the detailed financial results. For the second quarter, net sales for Sam's Club, excluding fuel, increased to $11.4 billion, which is a 60 basis point increase over last year. Including fuel, second quarter sales were $12.5 billion, which is a 2.2% increase versus last year, primarily due to higher fuel prices this year compared to last year. Fuel prices in the second quarter this year were approximately 11.3% higher than last year. 
Club comp sales, excluding fuel, for the 13-week period increased to 1%. Including fuel, club comp sales increased 2.6%. Comp ticket increased for the 13-week period with both Business and Advantage average ticket, excluding fuel, increased. Comp traffic, excluding fuel, declined for the 13-week period. 
Sales in many of our largest Fresh and Health and Wellness categories continue to be positive, including produce, meat, snacks, baby care and pharmacy. We also are seeing an uptick in discretionary spending via positive performance in categories such as mattresses, jewelry, domestics and housewares. The momentum in mattress sales is complemented by the rollout of our new delivery program. Sales in apparel continue to improve, the result of adding several key brands that are resonating with our members. 
Seasonal categories such as grills, patio, seasonal decor were also successful during the quarter. Additionally, tobacco sales continue to be very positive. Overall, broad-based deflation appears to be abating and we have even begun to experience some inflation in a few categories like Meat and Dairy. However, we continue to see pricing pressure in the second quarter in some Laundry and Paper categories. 
In the second quarter, consistent with many key competitors, we continue to have negative trends in our Entertainment and Technology business. The industry has experienced reduced promotional activity, we have seen improvement in this business over the past few weeks. 
Our second quarter operating income increased 2.4% versus last year to $428 million, including a $60 million contribution from fuel profit. Excluding fuel, operating income decreased by 1.7%. Gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased by 50 basis points during the second quarter, primarily driven by the continued shift in merchandising mix towards higher margin fresh products. Including fuel, gross margin rate for the quarter increased by 8 basis points. Inventory increased slightly by 80 basis points versus last year. 
We have been strategically aggressive in key events like back-to-school and back to college and we anticipate a solid season. We continue to be mindful of maintaining the right balance between solid inventory management and ensuring we have the right products members want when they shop our clubs. We have completed work on 33 of what we call Pure Project Portfolio clubs, with another 16 under construction. In addition, we have completed or are completing approximately another 17 scheduled remodels in which we have added various aspects of Project Portfolio as part of the remodel, stated in another way, pure portfolio clubs or clubs in which no other material remodel activity was conducted. As a reminder, the main focus of Project Portfolio is to increase the assortment of highly productive merchandise categories like Fresh and Health and Wellness. We continue to be pleased with the direction of the trends and are making adjustments as we move forward. 
Overall, our members are pleased with the key changes. Expenses grew 2.7% versus last year, driven by increases in credit card interchange fees, remodel and marketing expenses. For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 2.7% and our club wages were basically flat versus last year. Units per labor hour increased approximately 1.4% for the second quarter versus last year. I am very pleased with our progress on expense leverage and club efficiency. 
Membership and other income for the second quarter increased by 1.2% versus the prior year. Membership income, the primary driver, increased 80 basis points versus last year, mainly due to Plus membership upgrades. In July, we hosted a stock-up event to drive increases in membership and traffic and we are pleased with the incremental sign-ups. 
Our Plus membership with eValues and other new benefits, such as earlier shopping hours, continue to show good momentum. Add-on business memberships, still face headwinds, given the challenges that many small-business owners are encountering. We will continue to look for innovative ways to drive traffic, renewals and upgrades of existing members. 
In May, we launched a pilot program in an effort to help business members get access to the credit and capital they need to run and grow their businesses. I'm pleased with the positive response from our small business members to these initiatives. The third quarter is under way, and we are focused on a number of efforts to drive even greater value for our members and shareholders in accordance with our corporate priorities of growth, leverage and returns. 
The Sam's Club team is keenly focused on top line sales growth, driving comps and productivity. From August 6 through the 8, we hosted an open house, which allowed non-members to shop our clubs without incurring a standard surcharge on their purchases. This event introduced prospective members to the value proposition behind Sam's. We were very pleased with the results from both the sales and membership perspectives.
On a final note, last week, Todd Harbaugh was appointed Executive Vice President of Operations upon the announcement of Nacho Pérez's retirement. Todd joined Wal-Mart in October of 1990. During his 20-year career, he served in a variety of positions, and most recently held the role of Senior Vice President of Integration, Planning and Communications at Sam's Club. We wish Nacho well, and we are pleased to have great team depth, which is demonstrated by Todd's appointment. 
The current economy remains challenging for both Business and Advantage members. However, we have seen sales momentum over the past few weeks. We expect comp sales, without fuel, for the current 13-week period from July 31, 2010, through October 29, 2010, to range from flat to positive 2%. I will turn the program over to Tom for the report card and guidance discussion. Tom?"
313055,79147925,75122,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug-17-2010",2010-08-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Like last quarter, before I get into our financial report card and discuss growth, leverage and returns, I'd like to give you a quick update on our SAP implementation. We shared with you previously that on May 1, we began implementing SAP t",823,"Thanks, Brian. Like last quarter, before I get into our financial report card and discuss growth, leverage and returns, I'd like to give you a quick update on our SAP implementation. We shared with you previously that on May 1, we began implementing SAP throughout North America that would exclude Mexico and its Central America subsidiary. This implementation has now been up and running for three months. As you'd expect with any major system initiative, we have experienced some challenges along the way, but I'm proud to say that nothing prevented us from successfully completing our monthly close processes during the quarter, so we really feel good about the integrity of the numbers. 
Most of our challenges have been in the area of change management, which are being addressed since the new system is performing as designed. We will continue to leverage what we have learned as implementation in other countries continues. We plan to go live in Japan later this year and have also started work in Mexico. 
Now let's move on to our financial report card to see how well we have done with growth, leverage and returns. First, let's discuss growth. For the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we grew both our square footage and sales. 
Sales grew almost 3% for the quarter, mainly driven by Wal-Mart International, which you heard about earlier in this call. Net square footage of retail space increased by approximately 5 million square feet to 961 million square feet at the end of the second quarter. So far this year, we have added 8.6 million square feet in an effort to reach more people so that they can save money and live better. We continue to feel good about our growth prospects across the company. As always, we will update both CapEx forecasts and square footage goals for this year and next at the October meeting for the investment community. 
Next is a discussion on leverage. Our commitment to the productivity loop and Every Day Low Costs has now resulted in three consecutive quarters of expense leverage. And obviously, this has been a significant contributor to our bottom line results. We're really proud of our progress here. 
Finally, let's chat about returns. As I mentioned in the first quarter, inventories at the end of last fiscal year were relatively low for Wal-Mart. This ""starting point"" obviously will impact free cash flow all year as it did for the second quarter. The difference here is that in the second quarter, the accounts payable increase positively affected free cash flow. 
Earlier in the call, Charles covered these details. Having said all that, our free cash flow through the first six months of this year was $4.5 billion, and compares to the $4.2 billion we reported for the same period last year. Our goal for return on investment is to provide a consistently high return.  Return on investment for the 12 months ended July 31 was 19.0%, up from the 18.4% last year. The story behind ROI is really driven by strong operating performance. 
As I mentioned just a few minutes ago, we increased square footage and continue to invest in the business. Average invested capital, or the denominator used to calculate ROI increased by a percent. However, our continued focus on the productivity loop has produced strong operating results. The trailing 12-month adjusted operating income, or the numerator for ROI, has grown by almost 9%. Overall, we're very pleased with this performance in return on investment. 
Now let's move onto guidance. Based in our view of the business, and the current U.S. sales environment, we expect third quarter diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2011 to be between $0.87 and $0.91 per share. Please remember what we discussed earlier in the call, and the fact that our new retail inventory valuation methodology will reduce last year's third quarter reported earnings per share. In addition, there'll be an offset to that reduction in Q3 with an improvement to the restated fourth quarter earnings from last year. You might want to keep these in mind as you refine your model. 
With all that in mind and based on the underlying strength of our business, we are raising our full year EPS guidance to a range of $3.95 a share to $4.05. This guidance assumes that currency exchange rates remain at today's levels. 
In closing, I'd like to summarize with just a few key points. We delivered strong EPS this quarter ahead of First Call consensus. Expense leverage was the main driver of the bottom line this quarter and will continue to be a strategic priority. ROI is extremely healthy and above the prior year as we continue to deliver solid operating performance. 
And finally, Wal-Mart has produced strong and consistent earnings growth and solid returns to shareholders, both in the form of share repurchases and paper dividends. Thank you for listening today. We really appreciate your interest in Wal-Mart."

This call will contain statements that Wal-Mart believes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, and intended to enjoy the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements provided by that Act. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the use of the words or phrases anticipate, are anticipating, are expecting, assume, could be, expect, forecasting, goal, guidance, guided, is expected, is planning, may affect, plan, will accelerate, will add, will be, could save, will drive, will ring, will be growing, will come, will continue, will cost, will experience, will generate, will grow, will improve, will not continue, will remodel, will see, will spend, will take, would represent, or a variation of one of those words or phrases in those statements or by the use of words and phrases of similar import. Similarly, descriptions of our objectives, plans, goals, targets, or expectations are forward-looking statements. 
The forward-looking statements made in this call discuss, among other things, management's forecasts of our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 and for all of fiscal year 2011. The assumption underlying those forecasts, that currency exchange rates will remain at current levels, management's forecast for the comparable store sales for our Wal-Mart U.S. segment and comparable club sales without fuel for our Sam's Club segment, in each case, for the current 13-week period, management's expectation that the comparable store sales of our Wal-Mart U.S. segment will be positive for the holidays and the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 and that the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 will be another quarter of sequentially improving comparable store sales for our Wal-Mart U.S. segment, management's expectations as to our anticipated tax rate for fiscal 2011, quarterly fluctuations in that tax rate and factors that will affect that tax rate, management's forecasts for Wal-Mart's capital expenditures in fiscal year 2011 and fiscal year 2012, management's goal for return on investment being maintaining a stable return and management's expectations that Wal-Mart will continue to manage its inventory to be in line with its current business needs.
Although Wal-Mart will see year-over-year pressure from higher inventories in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, that our Wal-Mart U.S. segment will be the price leader throughout the holidays, that inventory levels at our Wal-Mart U.S. segment will stabilize and Wal-Mart will once again generate even more cash flow, that our operations in Brazil will improve, growth in Wal-Mart's operations in China and India will accelerate, growth in Wal-Mart's Mexican operations will continue and supercenters will be added in Canada and that the sales momentum of Wal-Mart's Sam's Club segment will continue into the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 and into fiscal year 2012 and the Sam's Club segment will leverage expenses in fiscal year 2012. 
Those forward-looking statements also discuss management's expectations for the Wal-Mart U.S. segment relating bake centers driving the segment's sales in November and December 2012, supplier recalls in the health and wellness category remaining a headwind in the near term for the segment, a new Medicare Part D prescription drug plan driving incremental pharmacy traffic for the segment, the sales of Straight Talk by the segment in fiscal year 2011 and how the sales of that item could affect comparable store sales of the segment if the full transaction value for those sales was includable in the calculation of comparable store sales. The sales of Straight Talk and third-party gift cards will ring through the company's registers more than $2 billion for the full fiscal year, continued strong online sales in the 2010 holiday season for the segment and the factors to drive those sales, the number of new supercenters and other formats, including new units, to be opened in fiscal year 2012 by the segment, the number of the segment's stores to be remodeled in fiscal year 2012 and changes in the cost and time of those remodels and the timing of Christmas spending in 2010.
Those forward-looking statements also address management's expectations that our Wal-Mart International segment will experience a very competitive fourth quarter in some of its markets, that such segment's sales will grow although the segment will experience pressure on its overall gross margin, that the sales of that segment's operation in Mexico will grow by certain means, that such segment's Brazilian operations will continue to see pressure on those operations' results from the operating structure in Brazil, changes thereto and the effects of a conversion to an everyday low price approach, and regarding product offerings by that segment's ASDA subsidiary and the addition of new stores in square footage to that segment through an acquisition by ASDA and the timing for conversion of those new stores to a different format.
Those forward-looking statements also discuss management's expectations that Wal-Mart's Sam's Club segment, will not continue to feel the effects of a credit card processing fee in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, that such segment's small business memberships will continue to pressure net membership income in that fiscal quarter and regarding the occurrence of promotional events in the segment's units relating to the holiday seasons. The forward-looking statements also discuss the anticipation and expectations of Wal-Mart and its management as to other future occurrences, objectives, goals, trends and results.

Our executive team is ready to report on our third quarter results of fiscal 2011. Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will cover the key highlights of our quarterly results. Charles Holley, our incoming CFO, but still Executive Vice President of Finance and Treasurer, has the details behind our consolidated financials. Then we'll go to the operating segments. First up will be Bill Simon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart U.S., our largest segment. Second will be Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart International. And then, rounding out our operating segment discussion will be Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam's Club, who will discuss the results for our Membership Warehouse segment. Finally, in his last earnings call as CFO,  Tom Schoewe will cover our corporate financial report card and our Q4 earnings guidance, as well as some insights into our updated full year guidance.
Before we start to discuss our performance for the quarter, let me cover some important financial information. First, I'd like to remind you of the inventory accounting change that we made in the second quarter. Due to the retrospective application of that accounting change, financial comparisons for this third quarter and going forward until the first quarter of FY '12 will be compared against the financials as adjusted for this change. For example, last year in Q3, we originally reported earnings per share of $0.84, which was adjusted to $0.82 per share, because of this accounting change. The income statements, balance sheets, ROI and segment P&L information with the adjustments for all quarters of fiscal year 2010 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 are available on our website on the Quarterly Financials page.
Second, for the past two and a half fiscal years, Wal-Mart U.S. has had six strategic merchandise units, or SBUs, and we've been reporting on them in these calls. Those units, or SBUs, were grocery, entertainment, hardlines, apparel, health and wellness and home. Wal-Mart U.S. also offers financial services and products outside of these SBUs. 
The new merchandising structure, which goes into effect with our third quarter report today, aligns similar categories and allows us to be even more competitive in each customer channel, improving how we target and how we localize our merchandise. 
Let me cover the makeup of each of these four merchandise units. First is general merchandise, or GM for short, which includes toys, seasonal, hardlines and entertainment. Seasonal includes merchandise for events, such as Halloween and Christmas, as well as greeting cards and celebrations. Hardlines includes hardware, do-it-yourself categories, fabrics and crafts, automotive and sporting goods. Entertainment includes electronics, music, computers, cameras, photo services and cellular.
Second is food, which includes all fresh products, snacks and beverages and dry foods. Next is softlines, which covers apparel, jewelry, accessories and shoes, as well as home, both indoor and outdoor living. And last is consumables and health and wellness. Consumables include personal care, beauty, paper, chemicals, baby and pets. Health and wellness covers Rx, over-the-counter medicines, or OTC, and optical. 
Our dotcom sales for each merchandise area are included in each respective category. So for example, toys sales from walmart.com are included in the general merchandise unit.
Last, this quarter we had a tax benefit of $191 million, which is approximately $0.05 per share, related to favorable adjustments to current transfer pricing policies after negotiations with a foreign tracks jurisdiction. Please bear this information in mind as you listen to the rest of the call. 
Now Mike, let's get started with our Q3 results. Mike?"

Third quarter earnings per share were $0.95 compared to an adjusted $0.82 last year. Our results included a tax benefit of $191 million or approximately $0.05 per share, which you will hear more about later. We are pleased with our EPS growth this quarter. 
Net sales for the third quarter increased 2.6% to $101.2 billion. The company leveraged the expenses for the fourth consecutive quarter. As I've said consistently, the productivity loop is here to stay. We will drive Every Day Low Cost to deliver on everyday low price. It's ingrained in our business, and it's how we operate around the world.
Consolidated operating income was $5.6 billion, up 3.1% from last year. We also added almost 10 million square feet of selling space through 117 new units this quarter. International remains a key to our future growth, and I continue to be impressed with their performance. Sales of Wal-Mart International were up 9.3%, and operating income grew faster than sales. We continued to deliver stable return on investment.
And we have an important takeaway for the fourth quarter. We are increasing our full year earnings per share guidance to reflect the tax benefit from the third quarter and the ongoing underlying strength of our business. Tom will cover it in more detail at the end of the call.
Now for the highlights of the individual operating segments. Our Wal-Mart U.S. business is on the right track. Comp sales were within guidance for the third quarter. Operating income grew faster than sales, and Bill and his team delivered expense leverage. 
The U.S. team is taking the right steps to position our stores for the fourth quarter and for next year. I'm happy to see the response from our customers when I walk stores. They like our progress on merchandise assortment. 
I might add, too, just last week, when I visited stores here in the U.S., I loved the positive energy from our associates. Our associates are really excited about the changes in recent months. Also, I really like our holiday preparations. We know this is a time of year when customers count on us more than ever. Our own surveys and the reports on the recent U.S. election cycle indicate that financial uncertainty still weighs heavily on everyday Americans, including many of our core customers. The paycheck cycle is still pronounced for these customers. Whether it's for everyday groceries or for discretionary items, Wal-Mart U.S. will be the price leader throughout the holidays, and I remain confident about improving comp trends in the fourth quarter.
Moving to Wal-Mart International. Doug and I recently had the opportunity to walk our stores and visit with customers, associates and government leaders on an extended trip throughout Asia. So let me share just a few takeaways from the trip. 
It's clear that our business model is well suited to this part of the world, just as it is in other markets around the world. We continue to see tremendous upside in China. In Japan, I'm really pleased with the progress we're making, and Doug will share more specifics on our success in Wal-Mart Japan.
In India, we opened our fourth Best Price Modern Wholesale cash and carry unit last week, and the country offers tremendous growth opportunities for Wal-Mart. We're optimistic about the response from the government of India about making changes on foreign direct investment in the country. 
We're seeing operating income strength in more established markets like Mexico, Canada and the U.K. More than ever, I believe Wal-Mart is positioned to deliver our unique benefits to consumers and to seize growth in all of our markets. 
Sam's Club just has great momentum with the positive comp growth Brian and his team posted for the third quarter. Sam's has really stepped up the quality of our merchandise and made our clubs more relevant to members. That focus has paid off, and it's delivered strong sales for the third quarter. I also like the creativity and the enthusiasm that Sam's Club is using to drive membership sales more aggressively and their commitment to improving productivity. 
Throughout the company, we are striking the right balance between managing the business for the short term and producing sustainable growth for our shareholders. Our focus on driving growth, leverage and returns is positioning us to succeed in the fourth quarter and for the long term.
Before I close, on behalf of our 2.1 million Wal-Mart associates around the world, we extend our heartfelt wishes for a happy holiday season and a wonderful start to the New Year in 2011. 
Now I'll turn it over to Charles for the detailed financial results. Charles?"
313055,79147927,88367,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2010",2010-11-16,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. For the third quarter of fiscal 2011, the company delivered earnings from continuing operations of $3.4 billion, an increase of 9% from last year. Earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.95 compared to last year's adjusted earnings",1020,"Thanks, Mike. For the third quarter of fiscal 2011, the company delivered earnings from continuing operations of $3.4 billion, an increase of 9% from last year. Earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.95 compared to last year's adjusted earnings per share of $0.82. Earnings per share included a tax benefit of $191 million, which is approximately $0.05 per share, due to the favorable adjustments from negotiation of transfer pricing policies with a foreign tax jurisdiction during the third quarter.
Currency exchange rate fluctuations were not a significant factor for earnings this quarter. Excluding the aforementioned tax benefit, earnings per share for our underlying business were within our guidance for the quarter of $0.87 to $0.91 per share. 
Consolidated net sales increased 2.6% to $101.2 billion for the quarter. Wal-Mart International was the main driver of the sales growth and was helped by a currency exchange rate benefit of $349 million compared to a negative impact of $2.6 billion last year. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales increased to 2.3%.
The 13-week total U.S. comparable store sales, without fuel, decreased 0.7%. You will hear more details on the Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam's Club comp sales from Bill and Brian. 
Expense management is once again a positive story. The company leveraged expenses for the fourth consecutive quarter, with expenses growing only 2.1% on a sales growth of 2.6%. The CEOs for the three operating segments will give additional details on their expense performance.
Unallocated corporate overhead, which includes corporate expenses, grew to $378 million. That's an increase of 8.3% from last year. While core corporate overhead expenses actually decreased 0.5% for the quarter, we did experience volatility in some unallocated foreign currency derivative mark-to-market positions quarter-over-quarter that is the primary driver of the increase. Although unallocated corporate overhead can have some volatility from quarter to quarter, we continue to closely watch our spending in this area.
Consolidated gross margin declined six basis points to 25%. A decline in International's gross margin was offset by a slight increase in Wal-Mart U.S. expense leverage. The company grew operating income at 3.1% over last year, meeting our goal of growing operating income faster than sales. The company's operating income of $5.6 billion included an $11 million benefit of currency exchange rate fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 2.9%.
Consolidated membership and other income increased 1% to $713 million for the quarter. Excluding last year's favorable adjustment in the Sam's Club segment, consolidated membership and other income would have been up 3.2%. 
The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 29.5%. Due to the favorable adjustment discussed earlier, we now expect the tax rate for fiscal year 2011 to be between 33% and 34%, although we will see some quarterly fluctuations. Factors which may affect our tax rate include changes in our assessment of certain tax matters, settlements of tax contingencies and the mix of income among our U.S. and international operations.
Year-over-year, consolidated inventory grew 7.7% on a 3.8% year-to-date sales increase. All three segments contributed to the growth in inventory, with the primary driver being Wal-Mart U.S. Bill will cover more details in the Wal-Mart discussion. 
Payables grew faster than inventories. Payables increased 17.1%, so our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 88.2%, up from 81.1% at the same time last year. A portion of this increase is driven by Wal-Mart U.S., as the segment had an earlier-than-normal seasonal buildup of inventories for the holidays. 
International was also a factor this quarter as new store growth and currency exchange rate factors contributed to the increase of both payables and inventory. Although the year-over-year growth in inventory continues to pressure free cash flow, the growth in payables, partially offset that pressure. 
Through the first nine months of the fiscal year, our capital spend was ahead of this time last year. Wal-Mart ended the third quarter of fiscal 2011 with free cash flow of $2.9 billion compared to $3.6 billion last year for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
We will continue to manage our inventory to be in line with our current business needs. However, we expect to see year-over-year pressure from higher inventories in the fourth quarter of this year when compared to the prior year.
Our balance sheet remains strong. We continue to have excellent access to credit markets. You will recall that in October, we went to the market with a $5 billion debt offering. At the time of issuance, two of the four tranches, the three-year and the five-year bonds, were issued at the lowest corporate rates on record. 
Our debt-to-total-capitalization ratio at the end of the quarter was 46.4%, up from the 41.3% last year at the same time. The increase in this ratio was due to the growth in the long-term debt. The 19.9% increase in our total debt levels, partially offset by lower average borrowing rates, were the primary factors in an 8.6% increase in net interest expense totaling $516 million.
Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $3.8 billion, bringing our year-to-date spend to $9.3 billion. We expect to spend between $13 billion and $14 billion in capital expenditures for the fiscal year, in line with our guidance outlined at the October 13 investor meeting. 
Our return on investment for the trailing 12 months was 18.6%, up from 18.4% at the same time last year, due to continued expense leverage. In this quarter, we repurchased 73.4 million shares for $3.9 billion. As you remember, on June 4, 2010, we announced a new $15 billion share repurchase authorization, which replaced our previous authorization of $15 billion. We now have $8.5 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization. Year-to-date, Wal-Mart has returned $14.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. 
We are extremely proud of how we've leveraged expenses and grown shareholder value in this tough environment. Our balance sheet and credit rating are strong and healthy. We remain focused on growth, leverage and returns.
Now let's move on to a discussion of our operating segments. As usual, we'll start with Bill and Wal-Mart U.S. Bill?"
313055,79147927,88367,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2010",2010-11-16,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Charles. Wal-Mart U.S. made very good progress during the third quarter on assortment, and we consistently drove promotional intensity. We had strong support throughout the quarter from our suppliers in adding to our assortment and in bringing",2361,"Thank you, Charles. Wal-Mart U.S. made very good progress during the third quarter on assortment, and we consistently drove promotional intensity. We had strong support throughout the quarter from our suppliers in adding to our assortment and in bringing innovation to our shelves. Our progress is not only reflected in improving sales trends, but also in customer experience scores. Our methodical approach to Wal-Mart's current initiatives is moving us in the right direction.
What's most important now is that we're in a position of strength for the busiest and most critical season of the year, and we're expecting a positive comp in the fourth quarter. We will lead on price, as we continue to save our customers' money every day. We're stepping up our strategic initiatives to help our core customers, as they struggle in the current economy. Remember, 68% of our business comes from customers with household incomes under $70,000 per year. These customers deliver to us about 22% of their share of wallet, so there remains a lot of opportunity to deliver even more on Wal-Mart's core promise. 
Comp store sales for the 13-week period, which ended October 29, declined 1.3%, which was within our guidance. Our comp sales performance is somewhat suppressed by reporting requirements that I'll get into shortly. 
For the third quarter, net sales were $62.2 billion, flat to last year. While we would have liked Q3 sales to have been higher, we're encouraged by the quarterly sequential improvement in comp sales and customer traffic. However, compared to last year, traffic decreased and the average ticket was down slightly. 
Inventory in Wal-Mart U.S. was up 6.5% compared to this time last year, driven primarily by the planned seasonal buildup in the distribution centers. We've also been staging merchandise for the holidays at our import DCs. In-store inventory was up approximately 3% in the third quarter compared to last year. We've managed our inventory well, even as we add to our assortment. In fact, inventory at the end of the third quarter is still below levels from two years ago.
Even while adding almost 10 million square feet of retail space since last year, we were still able to decrease our total operating expense by $61 million. This is indicative of our focus on expense management, since we also had flat sales growth. I'm pleased to report that Wal-Mart U.S. is now leveraged operating expenses for four consecutive quarters. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were down nine basis points. 
Store labor, of course, remains our biggest expense item. And sales per labor hour, or labor productivity, were up versus last year on relatively flat wage dollars. It's a credit to our store associates that our customer experience scores are at the highest level in three years. Customers are also happy with the action alley displays because of the price intensity and product availability that they deliver. In addition, because their pallet-driven, the action alley displays are very efficient from a labor standpoint.
Other contributing factors to the decrease in operating expenses were the following. As I mentioned last quarter, we changed our advertising strategy and brought media expenditures back in line with recent historical trends. Expenses were favorably impacted by lower estimated health expenses, and our flat net sales growth resulted in a decrease in our estimates for the incentive plan. 
National high levels of unemployment have also created headwind in operating expenses, with many states increasing unemployment insurance taxes per associate. In fact, unemployment insurance taxes are up 25% for the quarter versus last year. These types of changes are largely uncontrollable, but can be expected to impact our business from time to time.
Operating income for the quarter grew faster than sales to $4.4 billion, an increase of 1.9%. The growth, as we said, was driven by expense leverage and an increase in gross margin rate of five basis points. Gross margin improvements were driven by lower markdowns and increased supply chain efficiencies. Our logistics and transportation teams continue to drive lower costs, despite higher fuel costs for the quarter. Other income for the Wal-Mart segment decreased slightly to last year. 
Let me move on to merchandise. Carol covered the change in our merchandise categories earlier, and I'll go into detail on our four new units. We continue to make progress on our strategy of focusing on EDLP, broadening our relevant assortment, improving in-stock and driving promotional intensity throughout the store. This is achievable by partnering with our suppliers, driving innovation, leveraging best practices within the company and listening to our customers. But against this backdrop, let me remind you that the paycheck cycle remains pronounced, especially in our Grocery business.
Our food comp sales were a solid positive for the quarter, with strong sales performance in fresh, snacks and beverages. Produce and dairy were our strongest categories. In fact, our recent focus on apples was very successful in driving excitement and incremental sales. On several apple varieties, we were the clear price leader throughout the entire season because of the work of our global sourcing team. We were able to streamline the supply chain process, which increased our speed to market and improved our quality and freshness. 
Halloween sales were also strong in food and candy.  Customers appreciate the creativity we brought back to the bakery category this year, and we had excellent sell-through in baked goods. Categories in fresh, like meat and dairy continued to see some inflation, while some areas of dry grocery still experienced deflation.
Our assortment review progress is moving very well. We've added the most SKUs back in food and customers are responding. We're pleased with the progress we're making, with categories as varied as marshmallows, pie filling, jams and jellies. For example, eight weeks after modulars with additional SKUs were completed, on average, we saw a 39 basis point increase in sales in these categories. We're also expanding our assortment in many cases to achieve our store of the community relevance.
For the holidays from Thanksgiving through New Year's, we're focusing on turkeys and also full meal options at very competitive prices. Bake centers are back in all our stores and we expect these to help drive sales in November and December. 
Consumables and health and wellness had a negative comp for the quarter. Deflationary pressures continue to affect sales of key consumables. We're pleased with the continued growth of our Beauty business, where we also see a lot of new innovative products driving increased sales. 
In health and wellness, we're up against strong sales during last year's H1N1 season. The business has been impacted also by supplier recalls in the over-the-counter business, and we expect this to remain a headwind during the near term. In addition, like some of our drug retail competitors have cited, we've seen increased generic prescription utilization due to the economy. Overall scripts were up, indicating that we're gaining share. We're pleased with being able to provide preventative flu shots this year to our customers as well.
In October, Humana and Wal-Mart announced an innovative co-branded Medicare Part D prescription drug plan starting in 2011. The plan is nationwide with a premium of less than $15 a month, and in-store co-pays on generic medications starting as low as $2 when plan members use preferred pharmacies like Wal-Mart, Neighborhood Markets or Sam's Club. When you add up the savings based on the monthly premiums being less than 50% of the average plan, the low co-payment and costs shares, a typical Medicare Part D beneficiary could save more than $450 each year. We believe this will drive incremental traffic to our pharmacies.
Our general merchandise unit, which includes entertainment, toys, seasonal and hardlines, had a negative comp for the quarter. Clearly, the fastest growing item in the stores are wireless solution, Straight Talk. Straight Talk and prepaid wireless sales have been impressive during the quarter. Let me explain how we're reporting sales of these items. Reporting convention calls for sales of Straight Talk and third-party gift cards, such as iTunes and restaurant cards, to be included in sales, net of the product cost. In other words, we only account for commission on sales. 
As of these sales grow, they have more of an impact on our business. Had they been included in this quarter's comp sales at full transaction value, these items would have added almost 40 basis points to our comp sales for the period. Given the trend of Straight Talk and third-party gift cards, they would represent as much as 50 basis points to our anticipated fourth quarter comps, if they were included at the full transaction value. These categories will ring through our registers more than $2 billion for the full fiscal year.
Additionally, let me cover some other highlights in our general merchandise area. Entertainment comps were impacted by average selling price declines, particularly in LCD and plasma TVs, consistent with industry trends. However, despite this headwind, sales were up and we had solid increase in units in our TV category. Back-to-school sales were up in home office and laptops. Music sales, particularly CDs, continue to decline. Toy comparisons were impacted by the earlier timing of our promotional fall program last year, but we have bought up the toy category this year because we planned aggressively for the fourth quarter. Unseasonably warm weather in October hindered sales in cold weather categories, such as hunting and hardware, driving mixed results in hardlines for the quarter. We're very pleased with the results of our tire event in October. A strong comp in automotive was accompanied by slower sales in seasonal goods and heaters.
Overall, our softline comp, including apparel and home, was negative. In apparel, warmer weather put pressure on our Cold Weather business, particularly in ladies, men's and children's. As we cycle through the inventory, based on our previous apparel strategy, we're seeing improving sales trends. Our focus on the core customer has started to show areas of encouragement, as sales of socks and underwear, ladies' plus sizes and active wear outperformed the rest of apparel. We're very pleased with the expansion of our plus size offering across all of ladies. In fact, comp sales of plus size active wear increased double digit for the quarter. Jewelry continues to improve, driven by a renewed emphasis on costume jewelry.
In home, we extended the season in the garden center and were pleased with double-digit comps in multiple outdoor categories. There was some weakness in discretionary and décor categories, but customers responded well to back-to-college, cooking and dining merchandise, as well as floor care.
In financial services, check cashing remains our top performing category, and we're gaining share. We continue to benefit from the extension of our Wal-Mart MoneyCard agreements with the Green Dot Corporation. 
walmart.com grew at a faster rate than the overall online market again this quarter. Sales in many categories were strong, particularly electronics and home. We expect continued strong online sales this holiday season, driven by strong site-to-store demand, free shipping to home, an expanded FedEx metro pickup, now in five major metropolitan markets and our pick up today program, now available in over 800 stores.
Before I get into a discussion of the holidays, let me discuss our growth plans. As we outlined at our October meeting, next year, we expect to open between 155 and 165 supercenters, with 45 to 50 being new units, the remainder conversions. Wal-Mart is also planning on opening 30 to 40 medium to small format stores. In addition, we'll remodel more than 500 stores. The remodels going forward will cost less than what we've experienced in the last two years, and will take 40% less time, for fewer disruptions to both the customer and the associate. 
So far this year, we've remodeled more than 580 stores. These remodels have helped drive our highest ever customer experience scores and will deliver a great shopping experience this holiday season. We finished all remodel work at the end of the third quarter. Also, during Q3, we opened 98 new supercenters, including 71 relocations or expansions.
We've recently announced a few of our special deals for Christmas. We unveiled our top toys on November 1, started sending out our 52-page toy catalog on November 5, and created a dedicated section of our website to the top toys of the season. Last week, we also announced free shipping to your home through walmart.com for selective holiday items, including all electronics. We were very pleased with the initial response from our customers to this offer.
Our marketing efforts will be focused on bringing to life how our customers can rely on Wal-Mart to save them money so they can live better. Our holiday message is focused on basket savings. We believe that we have the right level of media buy for the fourth quarter. We also have increased our efficiencies through a strategic program of digital, print and electronic buys. We have a number of aggressive programs underway to reach the customers often and early for the holidays.
Last year, our fourth quarter comp sales declined 2% versus the previous year. Our Wal-Mart culture ensures that we have a correction of errors every season. We've built our 2010 plans on lessons learned from last year. 
Christmas is 39 days away from today. The holiday season is certainly here. We believe our core customers are focused on price, basics, toys for kids and practical gifts. Customers are also spending more time researching online and looking for multi-channel solutions. They will budget for new technology items, like eReaders and gaming systems. Like back-to-school and Halloween, we expect that a lot of the spending will come close to Christmas. Wal-Mart is well prepared to take care of our customers this holiday season.
We're expecting Q4 to be another quarter of sequentially improving comp sales. And as I pointed out earlier, we expect positive comps for the holidays. For the 13-week fourth quarter period from October 30, 2010, to January 28, 2011, we're forecasting our comp sales to range from a negative 1% to a positive 2%.
Now I'll pass the mic to Doug to tell you about Wal-Mart International. Doug?"
313055,79147927,88367,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2010",2010-11-16,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Wal-Mart International continues to deliver on our financial properties of growth, leverage and returns. Our growth this quarter has come from comparable store sales and our new store program, and we're meeting our goal of leveraging expense",2326,"Thanks, Bill. Wal-Mart International continues to deliver on our financial properties of growth, leverage and returns. Our growth this quarter has come from comparable store sales and our new store program, and we're meeting our goal of leveraging expenses. 
I'm pleased that our merchants' focus is on serving customers with quality merchandise, compelling assortments and price leadership. We're driving local customer relevance as we grow sales, and it's great to see the arrival of seasonal items heading into the holidays in many countries.
As Mike mentioned, we recently completed a visit to China, India and Japan. We visited customers in their homes, talked with them in stores, met with our associates and discussed things like merchandising, EDLP and the opportunity to build a career in the company. We left even more enthusiastic about Asia. Scott Price, Ed Chan, Raj Jain and Toru Noda are building a strong business in the region. 
Our business in China has a lot of momentum. This market is developing at a rapid pace and we're well positioned. India's potential is also enormous. Bharti Walmart is growing and learning how to better serve customers in India every day. Our results in the Best Price cash and carry units are promising. It was great to see Wal-Mart spirit and culture in New Delhi and Chandigarh. Wal-Mart Japan is making meaningful progress. Our items and prices, plus the in-store experience, are tangibly different since my last visit. The team is driving growth, building momentum and leveraging Wal-Mart's global ability in sourcing.
After returning from Asia, we left again to visit Johannesburg, South Africa. We continue to view Sub-Saharan Africa as an important market and are pleased with how the process is going so far. We can help add value for customers, future associates and all of the various stakeholders in that region.
Now let's discuss our third quarter results. International net sales for the third quarter were $26.9 billion, an increase of 9.3% from last year. This includes a $349 million benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Sales on a constant currency basis were $26.6 billion, a 7.9% increase over the third quarter of last year. 
As I mentioned during the investor meeting in October, we're driving comp store and new store growth. Our strategy of organic growth and local relevance delivered the increase in constant currency sales in the third quarter. This increase was primarily a result of a strong comp store sales performance in China, Japan and the U.K. and new store growth in Mexico, Brazil, China and Canada.
International's operating income for the third quarter, which included an $11 million benefit of currency exchange rate fluctuations, was $1.2 billion, up 13.5% from last year and an increase of 12.4% on a constant-currency basis. Constant currency operating income grew faster than sales. 
As a reminder, last year's third quarter results were adversely affected by currency exchange rates, as well as charges in our businesses in Chile and a sale-leaseback transaction in Japan. Without the impact of these prior-year charges, constant currency operating income grew slower than sales for the third quarter, primarily due to a low gross margin in Brazil. Membership and other income was flat as a percentage of sales. 
We once again leveraged our constant currency expenses. Our results this quarter benefited from significant expense reductions in Wal-Mart Japan through their EDLC implementation. We also grew expenses slower than sales in Brazil and Central America.
On a constant currency basis, gross margin as a percentage of sales declined by 22 basis points in the third quarter, primarily due to the changes we are making in Brazil, which I will get into further in a moment. 
International inventory grew 13.9%, which was faster than the rate of sales growth. We did not meet our objective of growing inventory at less than half the rate of sales and we're very focused on improving this metric.
Now we'll turn to the results for several of our markets. As a reminder, we hold country management accountable for their results on a constant currency basis, without the impact of potential swings in exchange rates. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency fluctuations.
As you know, in February, Wal-Mart Mexico purchased 100% of our majority-owned subsidiary with operations in Central America. Until the Central American business has been part of Walmex for a year, the discussion here on Mexico will exclude the results of Central America. This discussion is under U.S. GAAP. Walmex separately reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP.
Walmex's sales for the third quarter were up 10%,  and comparable store sales were up 2.8%. The sales growth at Walmex is driven by the 256 net new stores and restaurants that have opened since the third quarter of last year, as well as a positive comp growth in all Walmex formats. Customer traffic and average ticket both increased 1.4% at comparable stores.
For the third quarter, Walmex comp store sales for self-service formats grew by 2.4%, while ANTAD's comp store sales report for the rest of the industry come, excluding Walmex, showed 1.2% growth. 
Walmex's third quarter operating income grew 4%, which is slower than sales growth. Third quarter gross margin at Walmex declined slightly from last year and expenses as a percentage of sales grew faster than sales. Higher utility rates in the current year continue to pressure expenses in Mexico.
The fourth quarter is an important period for Walmex. We will be growing our sales by leveraging new imported merchandise in Sam's and Wal-Mart supercenters, as well as winning in electronics, entertainment and toys.
Now to Brazil. In the past 12 months, we have opened a net of 79 new stores in Brazil, bringing our total store count to 452. This includes seven new stores in the third quarter of this year. 
In real terms, Brazil's third quarter sales growth was 12.4% and comparable store sales grew 1.2%. Customer traffic at comparable stores declined 6.4%  and average ticket increased 7.6%, both in real terms. Comparable sales at our cash and carry and supermarket formats continue to perform well.
At the October analyst meeting, Eduardo Solórzano and I talked about how we are seeing the effects on our margins of converting to a net costing approach, and that we're moving forward with integration to simplify the business. In the third quarter, gross margin as a percentage of sales declined 1.7% from last year, and expenses as a percentage of sales improved slightly. 
Marcos Samaha returned to Wal-Mart Brazil to assume the role of CEO during the third quarter of this year. Our management team is very focused on improving how we will buy in Brazil in support of Brazil's conversion to EDLP. The integration challenges we have as a result of running what amounts to three separate businesses remain, and we continue to re-engineer our processes, so we're expecting to see continued pressure on Brazil's results.
Moving to Asia. In Japan, third quarter net sales, in real terms, increased 6.4% and comparable store sales performed very well, increasing by 6.1%. While EDLP, local relevance and positive customer perception are the key drivers of these results, we did see an uplift from having the right assortment for the warmer-than-average August. Wal-Mart Japan's traffic increased over last year as a result of our remodeled stores, but average ticket declined. Based on information from the Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry, or METI, our performance is ahead of other large-scale retailers in Japan and we continue to increase our market share. 
Wal-Mart Japan sales of food and consumables showed a strong performance, while apparel sales were down. Expenses as a percentage of sales are down due to EDLC, even after excluding last year's sale-leaseback charges. Overall, I'm pleased to report that operating income in Japan grew faster than sales.
China is clearly a significant market. In the past 12 months, we opened 32 new stores, bringing our total China store count to 298 at the end of this fiscal quarter. Sales increased 15.2% over the third quarter of last year on a comparable store sales increase of 6.9%.
Average ticket grew, but traffic declined. In addition, Trust-Mart stores had lower traffic during the third quarter as we converted stores to new formats. Gross margin as a percentage of sales was flat to last year. Operating income declined due to the merchandise conversion and integration programs for Trust-Mart.
Many of you are aware that our second close on the Trust-Mart acquisition was scheduled to occur this month. We continue to make good progress in Trust-Mart with our system and merchandise improvements. Wal-Mart and the selling shareholder have mutually agreed to extend the closing to May 26, 2011, while certain conditions of the contract are being completed. In the meantime, Wal-Mart and Trust-Mart continue to focus on their core mission, saving our Chinese customers money so they can live better.
As you know, we support Bharti Retail and their new store growth in India. Bharti Retail continued to grow, opening 24 stores in the third quarter of this year, and now operates 93 supermarkets and six compact hypermarkets. Under our joint venture with Bharti, we now have three cash and carry stores and are pleased with the continued sales growth in India.
Turning now to the United Kingdom. In the third quarter of this year, comparable store sales, excluding fuel, increased 1.3%. Overall, sales growth was in the low single digits, with the fastest-growing areas being George apparel, produce, baby and toys. While comparable store traffic and ticket were both up in the third quarter, according to Kantar Worldpanel, ASDA's market share dropped slightly in the 12 weeks ending October 31.
ASDA is improving its offering to customers,  specifically in the areas of assortment and quality. Andy Clarke and his team have made targeted price investments, including core food products. In September, ASDA committed to providing quality by relaunching its private brand under the Chosen By You label, and the products have been selected based on consumer blind taste tests. 1,000 items have already been launched and we expect an additional 2,500 by the first quarter of next year.
Operating income grew faster than sales in the third quarter. This was driven by an increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales from increased sales of George apparel. Expenses as a percentage of sales at ASDA were flat to last year. 
ASDA opened two new stores in the third quarter of this year, bringing the total store count to 379. Since the third quarter of last year, we have opened three superstores, five supermarkets and three ASDA Living stores. 
ASDA has recently added strength of its leadership team. Simon King was recently announced as our Chief Operating Officer. Simon brings a wealth of retail and supermarket experience and is a great addition to a strong team. In addition, Charles Redfield has been appointed Chief Merchandising Officer. Charles brings more than 20 years of Wal-Mart experience and was most recently in merchandising in our Sam's U.S. division.
The Netto acquisition we announced in May of this year continues to progress, and we've received formal approval from the OFT, or Office of Fair Trading, in the third quarter, with a requirement to sell 47 of the Netto stores. The remaining Netto stores will add 148 new stores and 1.1 million square feet. Full conversion of these Netto stores to the ASDA supermarket is expected to be complete by this time next year.
We are encouraged by the recent sales momentum in the U.K. We are well positioned for the holiday season. At a time where economists are forecasting very tough economic conditions, ASDA remains committed to saving customers' money every day.
And finally, Canada. Wal-Mart Canada's third quarter sales growth was 4.6%, due to a strong supercenter expansion program and sales of food. We have a total of 109 supercenters in Canada, 40 more than this time last year. 
Comparable sales in Canada were negative 0.4% on lower traffic, which was down 0.1%. Ticket was down 30 basis points. While Canada experienced record market share in food, consumables and baby, we experienced declines in sales of electronics and automotive. Despite the sales mix shift towards lower margin items, Canada's gross margin rate increased by 36 basis points over last year, due to better inventory management, including a reduction in shrinkage and improved purchasing.
Canada's expenses grew faster than sales, primarily due to incremental expenses on the launch of our banking operations and higher advertising investment. Canada's third quarter operating income grew faster than sales as the increase in margin offset the growth of expenses as a percentage of sales. In addition to Canada's 109 supercenters, we have 212 Wal-Mart stores, so our business in Canada is still largely general merchandise driven. 
As you know, with the exception of Canada, the fourth quarter ends on December 31 for our countries, so Wal-Mart International is halfway through the fourth quarter. In addition to the normal competitive pricing situation, we're currently working towards more of an EDLP approach in Brazil. As we make that conversion, we will experience some profit pressure and we're expecting that it will be more challenging than in previous quarters to grow profit faster than sales. We anticipate a very competitive fourth quarter in some of our countries. While we expect sales to grow, the competitive environment is pressuring overall gross margin.
One last item of note. We recently announced our non-binding offer to purchase an ownership interest in South Africa's Massmart, and we are currently exploring a variety of options relating to ownership structure with the ultimate objective being to maximize shareholder value. Massmart offers a compelling growth opportunity with a talented team that is also a good cultural fit with Wal-Mart. We see the opportunity to increase value for Massmart customers and reach even more customers together. We remain excited about this potential investment.
Now Brian will cover Sam's Club. Brian?"

During our recent investor meeting, we outlined how Sam's Club will continue to drive growth, leverage and returns through our Savings Made Simple framework. We are focused on listening to our members and effectively serving their needs.
Before we get into the financial details for the third quarter, I want to share some key highlights. Comp sales, excluding fuel, for the 13-week period ended October 29, increased by 2.4%. I'm excited to say, Sam's exceeded our original guidance of flat to 2%. We also were solidly within our updated guidance of 1% to 3%, which we provided on October 13 at our investor meeting. We maintained a strong margin rate, but due to expense pressures, couldn't translate that performance to operating margin.
Our sales momentum is evidence that our members are responding well to our improved merchandising offering. Sales during the quarter were particularly strong in fresh, jewelry, home and certain technology and entertainment categories. We also introduced more than 100 new items in fresh this fall, a historic high for Sam's Club.
Recently, an independent third-party annual survey ranked Sam's Club pharmacy second of all U.S. pharmacies. This was our highest rating ever. To build on this success, we're expanding health and wellness offerings. As of yesterday, our members can take advantage of the lowest Medicare Part D plan offered in the marketplace at Sam's Club's pharmacies. And let me remind you that our Sam's Club pharmacy is open to members and non-members.
Innovation and service drive success in technology and entertainment. So it's important to our members that we have the most up-to-date technology and top brands. We introduced LG and the Apple iPhone and iPad. We've also stepped up our associate training to provide more technology assistance to our members. We're also near completion of ""Wi-Fi-ing"" all of our clubs, which enhances the shopping experience.
Now let's turn to the detailed financial results. For the third quarter, net sales for Sam's Club, excluding fuel, increased to $11.1 billion, which is a 138 basis point increase over last year's third quarter. Including fuel, third quarter sales were $12.1 billion, which is a 2.7% increase versus last year, due in part to higher full fuel prices this year compared to last year. Fuel prices in the third quarter this year were approximately 8% higher than last year.
As I mentioned earlier, comp club sales, excluding fuel for the 13-week period increased 2.4%. Including fuel, club comp sales increased 3.8%. Comp ticket, excluding fuel, increased for the 13-week period, both for Business and Advantage members. Comp traffic, excluding fuel, increased for the 13-week period, among Advantage members, but declined slightly among Business members.
Our Food and Beverage business both had strong sales. We did experience inflation in dairy and meat. Back-to-school and back-to-college, as well as the fall tailgating season, drove sales in technology and entertainment. We were pleased to see we gained dollar share in computers and TVs during August and September. In home, we continue to see very strong comps in furniture, domestics and housewares. And jewelry comps were in the high single digits. Finally, tobacco and fuel sales continue to deliver strong comps.
Sam's gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased by 22 basis points during the third quarter, primarily driven by the continued shift in merchandising mix towards higher margin fresh products, apparel and jewelry, as well as an increased margin in technology and entertainment. Our merchants have done an excellent job managing seasonal buys and sell-through to mitigate margin impact of markdowns. Including fuel, the gross margin rate for the quarter increased eight basis points compared to last year.
Inventory increased by 4.2% versus last year, driven in part by the normal anticipation of the holiday season. Additionally, you may recall, last year's inventory levels were lower than our historic levels due to inventory management initiatives and an impact from a calendar shift on merchandise receipts. Our inventory turns were up in the third quarter. With conservative buys for Halloween, we were able to manage the sell-through for a successful Halloween season. We entered the fourth quarter in a strong inventory position and we are actively managing our seasonal transition through the holidays.
Operating expenses grew 4.8% versus last year, driven by increases in credit card interchange fees, remodeling and marketing expenses. As I explained in our first quarter call, beginning in April, in response to the continuing challenging credit program, we began paying on interchange fee in conjunction with our credit card program. We will not continue to feel this headwind in the fourth quarter. 
During the third quarter, 26 clubs were remodeled this year versus 23 last year. Additionally, during the quarter, we increased our marketing budget for key fall initiatives, including our back-to-school program, football season, 15 weeks for $15 membership and Labor Day eValues for all event.
For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 60 basis points. Units per labor hour decreased slightly for the third quarter versus last year. Although we did not leverage expenses for the quarter, I am pleased with our year-to-date performance on expense leverage. 
As a result of the increased expense level, third quarter operating income decreased 7.1% versus last year to $367 million. This represents a decrease in operating margin of 32 basis points from last year. Excluding fuel, operating income decreased by 8%.
Membership and other income decreased 5.1% from last year. You may recall that in last year's third quarter, we recognized a favorable accounting adjustment to membership income, as well as experienced strong comp results from the rollout of eValues for Plus memberships. Excluding the effects of the accounting adjustment last year, membership and other income for the third quarter increased 40 basis points compared to last year. Membership income, the primary driver, decreased 5.9% versus last year. Excluding the accounting adjustment, membership income was flat. 
We are pleased with the continued increases in Plus membership penetration and new member sign-up at the Plus level, reflecting our focus on this initiative. We are also pleased with the overall renewal rates. These strengths have been offset by two factors: first, the continued erosion in the number of business add-ons due to the economic pressure that so many small business members are experiencing; second, the net impact of the membership loss from the 10 clubs closed last fiscal year compared to new club openings this year.
In the third quarter, we began to overlap the successful launch of last year's eValues program, which kicked off August 17, 2009. To spur additional upgrades and acquisitions, we hosted a weekend Labor Day event, which delivered strong results. The Labor Day eValues Savings Celebration served as a trial and awareness vehicle for all members to experience the additional discounts afforded by eValues. As we enter into the second year of eValues, we continue to focus on providing relevant and meaningful values to our members through various events.
We expect the trend in small business membership to continue to pressure net membership income in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is underway and we are focused on driving even greater value to our members and shareholders. Our annual Taste of Sam's event kicks off this Friday and lasts through the weekend. We plan to demonstrate Sam's is your one-stop shop for the holiday season for both meals and entertaining. Each club will host at least 18 demos each day. We also will demo more than 50 different holiday foods and entertaining merchandise items. This event always drives traffic and new member sign-ups.
In non-food categories, we feel we are solidly positioned across the club to have a successful holiday season and we are focused on meeting all the gifting needs for our members with a fresh approach to merchandising the product. We are very pleased with the early sales results in holiday décor, holiday gifting and food categories. We're entering the fourth quarter with a lot of momentum in home, apparel, jewelry and new products from Apple, and we anticipate strong comps in these areas.
We continue to see our third quarter sales momentum carry over into the first two weeks of the fourth quarter. We expect comp sales, without fuel, for the current 13-week period from October 30, 2010, through January 28, 2011, to increase between 1% and 3%. Last year, Sam's comp without fuel for the comparable period rose 70 basis points.

Before I get into our financial report card to discuss growth, leverage and returns, let me provide an SAP update. North America continues to get better with each monthly close.

North America continues to get better with each monthly close. Mexico has now started the SAP conversion and Argentina is next in line. With each country that goes live, we get more efficient.
Now time for the financial report card. First, let's discuss growth. For the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we grew our square footage, net sales and operating income. Sales grew almost 3% for the quarter, mainly driven by International. 
Net retail square footage grew by approximately 10 million square feet to 971 million square feet at the end of the third quarter. So far this year, we have added 18.6 million square feet, as we introduce the Wal-Mart promise to more and more customers globally. We are still bullish on our growth prospects, both here in the United States and in our International markets. And we continue to grow operating income; as mentioned earlier, up more than 3% in the quarter. 
Now let's move on to leverage. We've now produced four consecutive quarters of expense leverage as we maintain our focus on the productivity loop and resulting Every Day Low Costs. Like last quarter, expense leverage was a significant factor in achieving our bottom line results. And as Mike indicated, we remain committed to expenses growing slower than sales.
Finally, let's talk about returns. As I mentioned in the second quarter, inventories at the end of last fiscal year were relatively low for Wal-Mart. This ""starting point"" continues to impact free cash flow. Accounts payable, as Charles indicated, benefited free cash flow. That said, our free cash flow through the previous nine months of the fiscal year was a healthy $2.9 billion, but below the $3.6 billion we reported for the same period last year. 
Remember, our goal for return on investment is to maintain a stable return. ROI for the 12 months ended October 31 was 18.6%. That's up from the 18.4% we reported last year. Like last quarter, the story behind ROI is strong operating performance. As I mentioned earlier, we are growing square footage and continue to invest in our business. Average ""invested capital"", or the denominator used to calculate ROI, grew by 7.9%.
However, our continued focus on productivity loop has produced strong operating results. That leads us to the numerator. The trailing 12-month adjusted operating income has grown by 8.4%, far better than the increase in the denominator. Overall, we're extremely satisfied with our ROI performance. Face it, at 18.6% pretax return, this is very impressive.
Now let's move on to guidance. Mike mentioned earlier that we are raising our EPS guidance for the fiscal year. Based on what we see today and our expectations for the U.S. sales environment, we expect full year diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2011 to be between $4.08 and $4.12 per share. That's up from our previous full year guidance of $3.95 a share to $4.05. Correspondingly, our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share guidance is between $1.29 and $1.33. Both of these ranges assume that currency exchange rates remain at today's levels.
Before I close, let me summarize some of the key points for our third quarter. At the end of the day, we posted another strong quarter. First, we reported more than $100 billion in net sales. As I indicated, we added approximately 10 million square feet of retail space. Once again, we leveraged operating expenses, which allowed us to grow operating income faster than sales. We had another quarter of great EPS growth. ROI is 18.6% and better than at this time last year. And finally, our free cash flow of $2.9 billion is the second highest third quarter performance on record. 
Having said that, we understand that we have an opportunity to improve even further across our businesses. First, we have an opportunity to improve Wal-Mart U.S. comp store sales. We believe the fourth quarter will be in positive territory. As we continue to make progress in our merchandise assortment, we will expect inventory in Wal-Mart U.S. will settle down and will all once again generate even more free cash flow.
In Wal-Mart International, we will improve operations in Brazil to increase profitability, and we will accelerate growth in China and in India. We will continue to grow in Mexico and add more supercenters in Canada. The international growth story is compelling. The sales momentum at Sam's Club will continue into the fourth quarter and into next fiscal year. We expect to see expense leverage from Sam's by next fiscal year as well. 
All of this kind of makes me think just how much has changed in the short time, a little bit more than a decade, that I have been proud to serve here at Wal-Mart. Our sales, our store count and our square footage have more than doubled since then. Sales rose from roughly $150 billion and EPS of $1.25 a share in fiscal 2000 to the kind of results we're talking about today, sales well north of $400 billion, and we shared our new guidance with you today that EPS should be in a range from $4.08 to $4.12. That compares to the $1.25 that I talked about for fiscal 2000. We are just shy of 8,700 units around the world, which enables us to do a great job of taking care of our customers and our members. And we're ready to help them to have a great holiday and a fourth quarter. We believe that there is no better retail model than Wal-Mart, and it means that we can continue to deliver strong shareholder value.
This is my last call as CFO. Charles will take over as CFO for Wal-Mart, effective December 1. You're in very capable hands, and I'm proud of the strong team that we've left behind that Charles will be leading in the future. 
Thank you for listening today. We really appreciate your continued interest in Wal-Mart, and have just a great holiday."

This call will contain statements that Wal-Mart believes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, and intended to enjoy the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements provided by that Act. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the use of the words or phrases anticipate, are anticipating, are expecting, assume, could be, expect, forecasting, goal, guidance, guided, is expected, is planning, may affect, plan, will accelerate, will add, will be, could save, will drive, will ring, will be growing, will come, will continue, will cost, will experience, will generate, will grow, will improve, will not continue, will remodel, will see, will spend, will take, would represent, or a variation of one of those words or phrases in those statements or by the use of words and phrases of similar import. Similarly, descriptions of our objectives, plans, goals, targets, or expectations are forward-looking statements. 
The forward-looking statements made in this call discuss, among other things, management's forecasts of our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 and for all of fiscal year 2011. The assumption underlying those forecasts, that currency exchange rates will remain at current levels, management's forecasts for the comparable store sales for our Wal-Mart U.S. segment and comparable club sales without fuel for our Sam's Club segment, in each case, for the current 13-week period, management's expectation that the comparable store sales of our Wal-Mart U.S. segment will be positive for the holidays and the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 and that the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 will be another quarter of sequentially improving comparable store sales for our Wal-Mart U.S. segment, management's expectations as to our anticipated tax rate for fiscal 2011, quarterly fluctuations in that tax rate and factors that will affect that tax rate, management's forecasts for Wal-Mart's capital expenditures in fiscal year 2011 and fiscal year 2012, management's goal for return on investment being maintaining a stable return and management's expectations that Wal-Mart will continue to manage its inventory to be in line with its current business needs.
Although Wal-Mart will see year-over-year pressure from higher inventories in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, that our Wal-Mart U.S. segment will be the price leader throughout the holidays, that inventory levels at our Wal-Mart U.S. segment will stabilize and Wal-Mart will once again generate even more cash flow, that our operations in Brazil will improve, growth in Wal-Mart's operations in China and India will accelerate, growth in Wal-Mart's Mexican operations will continue and supercenters will be added in Canada and that the sales momentum of Wal-Mart's Sam's Club segment will continue into the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 and into fiscal year 2012 and the Sam's Club segment will leverage expenses in fiscal year 2012. 
Those forward-looking statements also discuss management's expectations for the Wal-Mart U.S. segment relating bake centers driving the segment's sales in November and December 2012, supplier recalls in the health and wellness category remaining a headwind in the near term for the segment, a new Medicare Part D prescription drug plan driving incremental pharmacy traffic for the segment, the sales of Straight Talk by the segment in fiscal year 2011 and how the sales of that item could affect comparable store sales of the segment if the full transaction value for those sales was includable in the calculation of comparable store sales. The sales of Straight Talk and third-party gift cards will ring through the company's registers more than $2 billion for the full fiscal year, continued strong online sales in the 2010 holiday season for the segment and the factors to drive those sales, the number of new supercenters and other formats, including new units, to be opened in fiscal year 2012 by the segment, the number of the segment's stores to be remodeled in fiscal year 2012 and changes in the cost and time of those remodels and the timing of Christmas spending in 2010.
Those forward-looking statements also address management's expectations that our Wal-Mart International segment will experience a very competitive fourth quarter in some of its markets, that such segment's sales will grow although the segment will experience pressure on its overall gross margin, that the sales of that segment's operation in Mexico will grow by certain means, that such segment's Brazilian operations will continue to see pressure on those operations' results from the operating structure in Brazil, changes thereto and the effects of a conversion to an everyday low-price approach, and regarding product offerings by that segment's ASDA subsidiary and the addition of new stores in square footage to that segment through an acquisition by ASDA and the timing for conversion of those new stores to a different format.
Those forward-looking statements also discuss management's expectations that Wal-Mart's Sam's Club segment, will not continue to feel the effects of a credit card processing fee in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, that such segment's small business memberships will continue to pressure net membership income in that fiscal quarter and regarding the occurrence of promotional events in the segment's units relating to the holiday season. The forward-looking statements also discuss the anticipation and expectations of Wal-Mart and its management as to other future occurrences, objectives, goals, trends and results.

Our executive team is ready to report on our third quarter results of fiscal 2011. Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will cover the key highlights of our quarterly results. Charles Holley, our incoming CFO, but still Executive Vice President of Finance and Treasurer, has the details behind our consolidated financials. Then we'll go to the operating segments. First up will be Bill Simon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart U.S., our largest segment. Second will be Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart International. And then, rounding out our operating segment discussion will be Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam's Club, who will discuss the results for our Membership Warehouse segment. Finally, in his last earnings call as CFO, Tom Schoewe will cover our corporate financial report card and our Q4 earnings guidance, as well as some insights into our updated full year guidance.
Before we start to discuss our performance for the quarter, let me cover some important financial information. First, I'd like to remind you of the inventory accounting change that we made in the second quarter. Due to the retrospective application of that accounting change, financial comparisons for this third quarter and going forward until the first quarter of FY '12 will be compared against the financials as adjusted for this change. For example, last year in Q3, we originally reported earnings per share of $0.84, which was adjusted to $0.82 per share, because of this accounting change. The income statements, balance sheets, ROI and segment P&L information with the adjustments for all quarters of fiscal year 2010 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 are available on our website on the Quarterly Financials page.
Second, for the past two and a half fiscal years, Wal-Mart U.S. has had six strategic merchandise units, or SBUs, and we've been reporting on them in these calls. Those units, or SBUs, were grocery, entertainment, hardlines, apparel, health and wellness and home. Wal-Mart U.S. also offers financial services and products outside of these SBUs. 
The new merchandising structure, which goes into effect with our third quarter report today, aligns similar categories and allows us to be even more competitive in each customer channel, improving how we target and how we localize our merchandise. 
Let me cover the makeup of each of these four merchandise units. First is general merchandise, or GM for short, which includes toys, seasonal, hardlines and entertainment. Seasonal includes merchandise for events, such as Halloween and Christmas, as well as greeting cards and celebrations. Hardlines includes hardware, do-it-yourself categories, fabrics and crafts, automotive and sporting goods. Entertainment includes electronics, music, computers, cameras, photo services and cellular.
Second is food, which includes all fresh products, snacks and beverages and dry foods. Next is softlines, which covers apparel, jewelry, accessories and shoes, as well as home, both indoor and outdoor living. And last is consumables and health and wellness. Consumables include personal care, beauty, paper, chemicals, baby and pets. Health and wellness covers Rx, over-the-counter medicines, or OTC, and optical. 
Our dotcom sales for each merchandise area are included in each respective category. So for example, toys sales from walmart.com are included in the general merchandise unit.
Last, this quarter we had a tax benefit of $191 million, which is approximately $0.05 per share, related to favorable adjustments to current transfer pricing policies after negotiations with a foreign tax jurisdiction. Please bear this information in mind as you listen to the rest of the call. 
Now Mike, let's get started with our Q3 results. Mike?"

Net sales for the third quarter increased 2.6% to $101.2 billion. The company leveraged expenses for the fourth consecutive quarter. As I've said consistently, the productivity loop is here to stay. We will drive Every Day Low Cost to deliver on everyday low price. It's ingrained in our business, and it's how we operate around the world.
Consolidated operating income was $5.6 billion, up 3.1% from last year. We also added almost 10 million square feet of selling space through 117 new units this quarter. International remains a key to our future growth, and I continue to be impressed with their performance. Sales of Wal-Mart International were up 9.3%, and operating income grew faster than sales. We continued to deliver stable return on investment.
And we have an important takeaway for the fourth quarter. We are increasing our full year earnings per share guidance to reflect the tax benefit from the third quarter and the ongoing underlying strength of our business. Tom will cover it in more detail at the end of the call.
Now for the highlights of the individual operating segments. Our Wal-Mart U.S. business is on the right track. Comp sales were within guidance for the third quarter. Operating income grew faster than sales, and Bill and his team delivered expense leverage. 
The U.S. team is taking the right steps to position our stores for the fourth quarter and for next year. I'm happy to see the response from our customers when I walk stores. They like our progress on merchandise assortment. 
I might add, too, just last week, when I visited stores here in the U.S., I loved the positive energy from our associates. Our associates are really excited about the changes in recent months. Also, I really like our holiday preparations. We know this is a time of year when customers count on us more than ever. Our own surveys and the reports on the recent U.S. election cycle indicate that financial uncertainty still weighs heavily on everyday Americans, including many of our core customers. The paycheck cycle is still pronounced for these customers. Whether it's for everyday groceries or for discretionary items, Wal-Mart U.S. will be the price leader throughout the holidays, and I remain confident about improving comp trends in the fourth quarter.
Moving to Wal-Mart International. Doug and I recently had the opportunity to walk our stores and visit with customers, associates and government leaders on an extended trip throughout Asia. So let me share just a few takeaways from the trip. 
It's clear that our business model is well suited to this part of the world, just as it is in other markets around the world. We continue to see tremendous upside in China. In Japan, I'm really pleased with the progress we're making, and Doug will share more specifics on our success in Wal-Mart Japan.
In India, we opened our fourth Best Price Modern Wholesale cash and carry unit last week, and the country offers tremendous growth opportunities for Wal-Mart. We're optimistic about the response from the government of India about making changes on foreign direct investment in the country. 
We're seeing operating income strength in more established markets like Mexico, Canada and the U.K. More than ever, I believe Wal-Mart is positioned to deliver our unique benefits to consumers and to seize growth in all of our markets. 
Sam's Club just has great momentum with the positive comp growth Brian and his team posted for the third quarter. Sam's has really stepped up the quality of our merchandise and made our clubs more relevant to members. That focus has paid off, and it's delivered strong sales for the third quarter. I also like the creativity and the enthusiasm that Sam's Club is using to drive membership sales more aggressively and their commitment to improving productivity. 
Throughout the company, we are striking the right balance between managing the business for the short term and producing sustainable growth for our shareholders. Our focus on driving growth, leverage and returns is positioning us to succeed in the fourth quarter and for the long-term.
Before I close, on behalf of our 2.1 million Wal-Mart associates around the world, we extend our heartfelt wishes for a happy holiday season and a wonderful start to the New Year in 2011. 
Now I'll turn it over to Charles for the detailed financial results. Charles?"
313055,79147927,88387,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2010",2010-11-16,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. For the third quarter of fiscal 2011, the company delivered earnings from continuing operations of $3.4 billion, an increase of 9% from last year. Earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.95 compared to last year's adjusted earnings",1020,"Thanks, Mike. For the third quarter of fiscal 2011, the company delivered earnings from continuing operations of $3.4 billion, an increase of 9% from last year. Earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.95 compared to last year's adjusted earnings per share of $0.82. Earnings per share included a tax benefit of $191 million, which is approximately $0.05 per share, due to the favorable adjustments from negotiation of transfer pricing policies with a foreign tax jurisdiction during the third quarter.
Currency exchange rate fluctuations were not a significant factor for earnings this quarter. Excluding the aforementioned tax benefit, earnings per share for our underlying business were within our guidance for the quarter of $0.87 to $0.91 per share. 
Consolidated net sales increased 2.6% to $101.2 billion for the quarter. Wal-Mart International was the main driver of the sales growth and was helped by a currency exchange rate benefit of $349 million compared to a negative impact of $2.6 billion last year. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales increased to 2.3%.
The 13-week total U.S. comparable store sales, without fuel, decreased 0.7%. You will hear more details on the Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam's Club comp sales from Bill and Brian. 
Expense management is once again a positive story. The company leveraged expenses for the fourth consecutive quarter, with expenses growing only 2.1% on a sales growth of 2.6%. The CEOs for the three operating segments will give additional details on their expense performance.
Unallocated corporate overhead, which includes corporate expenses, grew to $378 million. That's an increase of 8.3% from last year. While core corporate overhead expenses actually decreased ½% for the quarter, we did experience volatility in some unallocated foreign currency derivative mark-to-market positions quarter-over-quarter that is the primary driver of the increase. Although unallocated corporate overhead can have some volatility from quarter to quarter, we continue to closely watch our spending in this area.
Consolidated gross margin declined six basis points to 25%. A decline in International's gross margin was offset by a slight increase in Wal-Mart U.S. expense leverage. The company grew operating income at 3.1% over last year, meeting our goal of growing operating income faster than sales. The company's operating income of $5.6 billion included an $11 million benefit of currency exchange rate fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 2.9%.
Consolidated membership and other income increased 1% to $713 million for the quarter. Excluding last year's favorable adjustment in the Sam's Club segment, consolidated membership and other income would have been up 3.2%. 
The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 29.5%. Due to the favorable adjustment discussed earlier, we now expect the tax rate for fiscal year 2011 to be between 33% and 34%, although we will see some quarterly fluctuation. Factors which may affect our tax rate include changes in our assessment of certain tax matters, settlements of tax contingencies and the mix of income among our U.S. and international operations.
Year-over-year, consolidated inventory grew 7.7% on a 3.8% year-to-date sales increase. All three segments contributed to the growth in inventory, with the primary driver being Wal-Mart U.S. Bill will cover more details in the Wal-Mart discussion. 
Payables grew faster than inventories. Payables increased 17.1%, so our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 88.2%, up from 81.1% at the same time last year. A portion of this increase is driven by Wal-Mart U.S., as the segment had an earlier-than-normal seasonal buildup of inventories for the holidays. 
International was also a factor this quarter as new store growth and currency exchange rate factors contributed to the increase in both payables and inventory. Although the year-over-year growth in inventory continues to pressure free cash flow, the growth in payables, partially offset that pressure. 
Through the first nine months of the fiscal year, our capital spend was ahead of this time last year. Wal-Mart ended the third quarter of fiscal 2011 with free cash flow of $2.9 billion compared to $3.6 billion last year for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
We will continue to manage our inventory to be in line with our current business needs. However, we expect to see year-over-year pressure from higher inventories in the fourth quarter of this year when compared to the prior year.
Our balance sheet remains strong. We continue to have excellent access to credit markets. You will recall that in October, we went to the market with a $5 billion debt offering. At the time of issuance, two of the four tranches, the three-year and the five-year bonds, were issued at the lowest corporate rates on record. 
Our debt-to-total-capitalization ratio at the end of the quarter was 46.4%, up from the 41.3% last year at the same time. The increase in this ratio was due to the growth in the long-term debt. The 19.9% increase in our total debt levels, partially offset by lower average borrowing rates, were the primary factors in an 8.6% increase in net interest expense totaling $516 million.
Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $3.8 billion, bringing our year-to-date spend to $9.3 billion. We expect to spend between $13 billion and $14 billion in capital expenditures for the fiscal year, in line with our guidance outlined at the October 13 investor meeting. 
Our return on investment for the trailing 12 months was 18.6%, up from 18.4% at the same time last year, due to continued expense leverage. In this quarter, we repurchased 73.4 million shares for $3.9 billion. As you remember, on June 4, 2010, we announced a new $15 billion share repurchase authorization, which replaced our previous authorization of $15 billion. We now have $8.5 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization. Year-to-date, Wal-Mart has returned $14.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. 
We are extremely proud of how we've leveraged expenses and grown shareholder value in this tough environment. Our balance sheet and credit rating are strong and healthy. We remain focused on growth, leverage and returns.
Now let's move on to a discussion of our operating segments. As usual, we'll start with Bill and Wal-Mart U.S. Bill?"
313055,79147927,88387,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2010",2010-11-16,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Charles. Wal-Mart U.S. made very good progress during the third quarter on assortment, and we consistently drove promotional intensity. We had strong support throughout the quarter from our suppliers in adding to our assortment and in bringing",2357,"Thank you, Charles. Wal-Mart U.S. made very good progress during the third quarter on assortment, and we consistently drove promotional intensity. We had strong support throughout the quarter from our suppliers in adding to our assortment and in bringing innovation to our shelves. Our progress is not only reflected in improving sales trends, but also in customer experience scores. Our methodical approach to Wal-Mart's current initiatives is moving us in the right direction.
What's most important now is that we're in a position of strength for the busiest and most critical season of the year, and we're expecting a positive comp in the fourth quarter. We will lead on price, as we continue to save our customers' money every day. We're stepping up our strategic initiatives to help our core customers, as they struggle in the current economy. Remember, 68% of our business comes from customers with household incomes under $70,000 per year. These customers deliver to us about 22% of their share of wallet, so there remains a lot of opportunity to deliver even more on Wal-Mart's core promise. 
Comp store sales for the 13-week period, which ended October 29, declined 1.3%, which was within our guidance. Our comp sales performance is somewhat suppressed by reporting requirements that I'll get into shortly. 
For the third quarter, net sales were $62.2 billion, flat to last year. While we would have liked Q3 sales to have been higher, we're encouraged by the quarterly sequential improvement in comp sales and customer traffic. However, compared to last year, traffic decreased and the average ticket was down slightly. 
Inventory in Wal-Mart U.S. was up 6.5% compared to this time last year, driven primarily by the planned seasonal buildup in the distribution centers. We've also been staging merchandise for the holidays at our import DCs. In-store inventory was up approximately 3% in the third quarter compared to last year. We've managed our inventory well, even as we add to our assortment. In fact, inventory at the end of the third quarter is still below levels from two years ago.
Even while adding almost 10 million square feet of retail space since last year, we were still able to decrease our total operating expense by $61 million. This is indicative of our focus on expense management, since we also had flat sales growth. I'm pleased to report that Wal-Mart U.S. has now leveraged operating expenses for four consecutive quarters. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were down nine basis points. 
Store labor, of course, remains our biggest expense item. And sales per labor hour, or labor productivity, were up versus last year on relatively flat wage dollars. It's a credit to our store associates that our customer experience scores are at the highest level in three years. Customers are also happy with the action alley displays because of the price intensity and product availability that they deliver. In addition, because they’re pallet-driven, the action alley displays are very efficient from a labor standpoint.
Other contributing factors to the decrease in operating expenses were the following. As I mentioned last quarter, we changed our advertising strategy and brought media expenditures back in line with recent historical trends. Expenses were favorably impacted by lower estimated health expenses, and our flat net sales growth resulted in a decrease in our estimates for the incentive plan. 
National high levels of unemployment have also created headwind in operating expenses, with many states increasing unemployment insurance taxes per associate. In fact, unemployment insurance taxes are up 25% for the quarter versus last year. These types of changes are largely uncontrollable, but can be expected to impact our business from time to time.
Operating income for the quarter grew faster than sales to $4.4 billion, an increase of 1.9%. The growth, as we said, was driven by expense leverage and an increase in gross margin rate of five basis points. Gross margin improvements were driven by lower markdowns and increased supply chain efficiencies. Our logistics and transportation teams continue to drive lower costs, despite higher fuel costs for the quarter. Other income for the Wal-Mart segment decreased slightly to last year. 
Let me move on to merchandise. Carol covered the change in our merchandise categories earlier, and I'll go into detail on our four new units. We continue to make progress on our strategy of focusing on EDLP, broadening our relevant assortment, improving in-stock and driving promotional intensity throughout the store. This is achievable by partnering with our suppliers, driving innovation, leveraging best practices within the company and listening to our customers. But against this backdrop, let me remind you that the paycheck cycle remains pronounced, especially in our Grocery business.
Our food comp sales were a solid positive for the quarter, with strong sales performance in fresh, snacks and beverages. Produce and dairy were our strongest categories. In fact, our recent focus on apples was very successful in driving excitement and incremental sales. On several apple varieties, we were the clear price leader throughout the entire season because of the work of our global sourcing team. We were able to streamline the supply chain process, which increased our speed to market and improved our quality and freshness. 
Halloween sales were also strong in food and candy. Customers appreciate the creativity we brought back to the bakery category this year, and we had excellent sell-through in baked goods. Categories in fresh, like meat and dairy, continued to see some inflation, while some areas of dry grocery still experienced deflation.
Our assortment review progress is moving very well. We've added the most SKUs back in food and customers are responding. We're pleased with the progress we're making, with categories as varied as marshmallows, pie filling, jams and jellies. For example, eight weeks after modulars with additional SKUs were completed, on average, we saw a 39-basis point increase in sales in these categories. We're also expanding our assortment in many cases to achieve a store the community relevance.
For the holidays from Thanksgiving through New Year's, we're focusing on turkeys and also full meal options at very competitive prices. Bake centers are back in all our stores and we expect these to help drive sales in November and December. 
Consumables and health and wellness had a negative comp for the quarter. Deflationary pressures continue to affect sales of key consumables. We're pleased with the continued growth of our Beauty business, where we also see a lot of new innovative products driving increased sales. 
In health and wellness, we're up against strong sales during last year's H1N1 season. The business has been impacted also by supplier recalls in the over-the-counter business, and we expect this to remain a headwind during the near-term. In addition, like some of our drug retail competitors have cited, we've seen increased generic prescription utilization due to the economy. Overall scripts were up, indicating that we're gaining share. We're pleased with being able to provide preventative flu shots this year to our customers as well.
In October, Humana and Wal-Mart announced an innovative co-branded Medicare Part D prescription drug plan starting in 2011. The plan is nationwide with a premium of less than $15 a month, and in-store co-pays on generic medications starting as low as $2 when plan members use preferred pharmacies like Wal-Mart, Neighborhood Markets or Sam's Club. When you add up the savings based on the monthly premiums being less than 50% of the average plan, the low co-payment and costs shares, a typical Medicare Part D beneficiary could save more than $450 each year. We believe this will drive incremental traffic to our pharmacies.
Our general merchandise unit, which includes entertainment, toys, seasonal and hardlines, had a negative comp for the quarter. Clearly, the fastest growing item in the stores are wireless solution, Straight Talk. Straight Talk and prepaid wireless sales have been impressive during the quarter. Let me explain how we're reporting sales of these items. Reporting convention calls for sales of Straight Talk and third-party gift cards, such as iTunes and restaurant cards, to be included in sales, net of the product cost. In other words, we only account for commission on sales. 
As these sales grow, they have more of an impact on our business. Had they been included in this quarter's comp sales at full transaction value, these items would have added almost 40 basis points to our comp sales for the period. Given the trend of Straight Talk and third-party gift cards, they would represent as much as 50 basis points to our anticipated fourth quarter comps, if they were included at the full transaction value. These categories will ring through our registers more than $2 billion for the full fiscal year.
Additionally, let me cover some other highlights in our general merchandise area. Entertainment comps were impacted by average selling price declines, particularly in LCD and plasma TVs, consistent with industry trends. However, despite this headwind, sales were up and we had solid increase in units in our TV category. Back-to-school sales were up in home office and laptops. Music sales, particularly CDs, continue to decline. Toy comparisons were impacted by the earlier timing of our promotional fall program last year, but we have bought up the toy category this year because we planned aggressively for the fourth quarter. Unseasonably warm weather in October hindered sales in cold weather categories, such as hunting and hardware, driving mixed results in hardlines for the quarter. We're very pleased with the result of our tire event in October. A strong comp in automotive was accompanied by slower sales in seasonal goods and heaters.
Overall, our softline comp, including apparel and home, was negative. In apparel, warmer weather put pressure on our Cold Weather business, particularly in ladies, men's and children's. As we cycle through the inventory, based on our previous apparel strategy, we're seeing improving sales trends. Our focus on the core customer has started to show areas of encouragement, as sales of socks and underwear, ladies' plus sizes and active wear outperformed the rest of apparel. We're very pleased with the expansion of our plus size offering across all of ladies. In fact, comp sales of plus size active wear increased double digit for the quarter. Jewelry continues to improve, driven by a renewed emphasis on costume jewelry.
In home, we extended the season in the garden center and were pleased with double-digit comps in multiple outdoor categories. There was some weakness in discretionary and décor categories, but customers responded well to back-to-college, cooking and dining merchandise, as well as floor care.
In financial services, check cashing remains our top performing category, and we're gaining share. We continue to benefit from the extension of our Wal-Mart MoneyCard agreements with the Green Dot Corporation. 
walmart.com grew at a faster rate than the overall online market again this quarter. Sales in many categories were strong, particularly electronics and home. We expect continued strong online sales this holiday season, driven by strong site-to-store demand, free shipping to home, an expanded FedEx metro pickup, now in five major metropolitan markets and our pick up today program, now available in over 800 stores.
Before I get into a discussion of the holidays, let me discuss our growth plans. As we outlined at our October meeting, next year, we expect to open between 155 and 165 supercenters, with 45 to 50 being new units, the remainder conversions. Wal-Mart is also planning on opening 30 to 40 medium to small format stores. In addition, we'll remodel more than 500 stores. The remodels going forward will cost less than what we've experienced in the last two years, and will take 40% less time, for fewer disruptions to both the customer and the associate. 
So far this year, we've remodeled more than 580 stores. These remodels have helped drive our highest ever customer experience scores and will deliver a great shopping experience this holiday season. We finished all remodel work at the end of the third quarter. Also, during Q3, we opened 98 new supercenters, including 71 relocations or expansions.
We've recently announced a few of our special deals for Christmas. We unveiled our top toys on November 1, started sending out our 52-page toy catalog on November 5, and created a dedicated section of our website to the top toys of the season. Last week, we also announced free shipping to your home through walmart.com for selective holiday items, including all electronics. We were very pleased with the initial response from our customers to this offer.
Our marketing efforts will be focused on bringing to life how our customers can rely on Wal-Mart to save them money so they can live better. Our holiday message is focused on basket savings. We believe that we have the right level of media buy for the fourth quarter. We also have increased our efficiencies through a strategic program of digital, print and electronic buys. We have a number of aggressive programs underway to reach the customers often and early for the holidays.
Last year, our fourth quarter comp sales declined 2% versus the previous year. Our Wal-Mart culture ensures that we have a correction of errors every season. We've built our 2010 plans on lessons learned from last year. 
Christmas is 39 days away from today. The holiday season is certainly here. We believe our core customers are focused on price, basics, toys for kids and practical gifts. Customers are also spending more time researching online and looking for multi-channel solutions. They will budget for new technology items, like eReaders and gaming systems. Like back-to-school and Halloween, we expect that a lot of the spending will come close to Christmas. Wal-Mart is well prepared to take care of our customers this holiday season.
We're expecting Q4 to be another quarter of sequentially improving comp sales. And as I pointed out earlier, we expect positive comps for the holidays. For the 13-week fourth quarter period from October 30, 2010, to January 28, 2011, we're forecasting our comp sales to range from a negative 1% to a positive 2%.
Now I'll pass the mic to Doug to tell you about Wal-Mart International. Doug?"
313055,79147927,88387,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2010",2010-11-16,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Wal-Mart International continues to deliver on our financial priorities of growth, leverage and returns. Our growth this quarter has come from comparable store sales and our new store program, and we're meeting our goal of leveraging expense",2326,"Thanks, Bill. Wal-Mart International continues to deliver on our financial priorities of growth, leverage and returns. Our growth this quarter has come from comparable store sales and our new store program, and we're meeting our goal of leveraging expenses. 
I'm pleased that our merchants' focus is on serving customers with quality merchandise, compelling assortments and price leadership. We're driving local customer relevance as we grow sales, and it's great to see the arrival of seasonal items heading into the holidays in many countries.
As Mike mentioned, we recently completed a visit to China, India and Japan. We visited customers in their homes, talked with them in stores, met with our associates and discussed things like merchandising, EDLP and the opportunity to build a career in the company. We left even more enthusiastic about Asia. Scott Price, Ed Chan, Raj Jain and Toru Noda are building a strong business in the region. 
Our business in China has a lot of momentum. This market is developing at a rapid pace and we're well positioned. India's potential is also enormous. Bharti Walmart is growing and learning how to better serve customers in India every day. Our results in the Best Price cash and carry units are promising. It was great to see Wal-Mart spirit and culture in New Delhi and Chandigarh. Wal-Mart Japan is making meaningful progress. Our items and prices, plus the in-store experience, are tangibly different since my last visit. The team is driving growth, building momentum and leveraging Wal-Mart's global ability in sourcing.
After returning from Asia, we left again to visit Johannesburg, South Africa. We continue to view Sub-Saharan Africa as an important market and are pleased with how the process is going so far. We can help add value for customers, future associates and all of the various stakeholders in that region.
Now let's discuss our third quarter results. International net sales for the third quarter were $26.9 billion, an increase of 9.3% from last year. This includes a $349 million benefit from the changes in currency exchange rates. Sales on a constant currency basis were $26.6 billion, a 7.9% increase over the third quarter of last year. 
As I mentioned during the investor meeting in October, we're driving comp store and new store growth. Our strategy of organic growth and local relevance delivered the increase in constant currency sales in the third quarter. This increase was primarily a result of a strong comp store sales performance in China, Japan and the U.K. and new store growth in Mexico, Brazil, China and Canada.
International's operating income for the third quarter, which included an $11 million benefit of currency exchange rate fluctuations, was $1.2 billion, up 13.5% from last year and an increase of 12.4% on a constant-currency basis. Constant currency operating income grew faster than sales. 
As a reminder, last year's third quarter results were adversely affected by currency exchange rates, as well as charges in our businesses in Chile and a sale-leaseback transaction in Japan. Without the impact of these prior-year charges, constant currency operating income grew slower than sales for the third quarter, primarily due to a low gross margin in Brazil. Membership and other income was flat as a percentage of sales. 
We once again leveraged our constant currency expenses. Our results this quarter benefited from significant expense reductions in Wal-Mart Japan through their EDLC implementation. We also grew expenses slower than sales in Brazil and Central America.
On a constant currency basis, gross margin as a percentage of sales declined by 22 basis points in the third quarter, primarily due to the changes we are making in Brazil, which I will get into further in a moment. 
International inventory grew 13.9%, which was faster than the rate of sales growth. We did not meet our objective of growing inventory at less than half the rate of sales and we're very focused on improving this metric.
Now we'll turn to the results for several of our markets. As a reminder, we hold country management accountable for their results on a constant currency basis, without the impact of potential swings in exchange rates. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency fluctuations.
As you know, in February, Wal-Mart Mexico purchased 100% of our majority-owned subsidiary with operations in Central America. Until the Central American business has been part of Walmex for a year, the discussion here on Mexico will exclude the results of Central America. This discussion is under U.S. GAAP. Walmex separately reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP.
Walmex's sales for the third quarter were up 10%, and comparable store sales were up 2.8%. The sales growth at Walmex is driven by the 256 net new stores and restaurants that have opened since the third quarter of last year, as well as a positive comp growth in all Walmex formats. Customer traffic and average ticket both increased 1.4% at comparable stores.
For the third quarter, Walmex comp store sales for self-service formats grew by 2.4%, while ANTAD's comp store sales report for the rest of the industry, excluding Walmex, showed 1.2% growth. 
Walmex's third quarter operating income grew 4%, which is slower than sales growth. Third quarter gross margin at Walmex declined slightly from last year and expenses as a percentage of sales grew faster than sales. Higher utility rates in the current year continue to pressure expenses in Mexico.
The fourth quarter is an important period for Walmex. We will be growing our sales by leveraging new imported merchandise in Sam's and Wal-Mart supercenters, as well as winning in electronics, entertainment and toys.
Now to Brazil. In the past 12 months, we have opened a net of 79 new stores in Brazil, bringing our total store count to 452. This includes seven new stores in the third quarter of this year. 
In real terms, Brazil's third quarter sales growth was 12.4% and comparable store sales grew 1.2%. Customer traffic at comparable stores declined 6.4% and average ticket increased 7.6%, both in real terms. Comparable sales at our cash and carry and supermarket formats continue to perform well.
At the October analyst meeting, Eduardo Solórzano and I talked about how we are seeing the effects on our margins of converting to a net costing approach and that we're moving forward with integration to simplify the business. In the third quarter, gross margin as a percentage of sales declined 1.7% from last year, and expenses as a percentage of sales improved slightly. 
Marcos Samaha returned to Wal-Mart Brazil to assume the role of CEO during the third quarter of this year. Our management team is very focused on improving how we will buy in Brazil in support of Brazil's conversion to EDLP. The integration challenges we have as a result of running what amounts to three separate businesses remain, and we continue to re-engineer our processes, so we're expecting to see continued pressure on Brazil's results.
Moving to Asia. In Japan, third quarter net sales, in real terms, increased 6.4% and comparable store sales performed very well, increasing by 6.1%. While EDLP, local relevance and positive customer perception are the key drivers of these results, we did see an uplift from having the right assortment for the warmer-than-average August. Wal-Mart Japan's traffic increased over last year as a result of our remodeled stores, but average ticket declined. Based on information from the Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry, or METI, our performance is ahead of other large-scale retailers in Japan and we continue to increase our market share. 
Wal-Mart Japan sales of food and consumables showed a strong performance, while apparel sales were down. Expenses as a percentage of sales are down due to EDLC, even after excluding last year's sale-leaseback charges. Overall, I'm pleased to report that operating income in Japan grew faster than sales.
China is clearly a significant market. In the past 12 months, we opened 32 new stores, bringing our total China store count to 298 at the end of this fiscal quarter. Sales increased 15.2% over the third quarter of last year on a comparable store sales increase of 6.9%.
Average ticket grew, but traffic declined. In addition, Trust-Mart stores had lower traffic during the third quarter as we converted stores to new formats. Gross margin as a percentage of sales was flat to last year. Operating income declined due to the merchandise conversion and integration programs for Trust-Mart.
Many of you are aware that our second close on the Trust-Mart acquisition was scheduled to occur this month. We continue to make good progress in Trust-Mart with our system and merchandise improvements. Wal-Mart and the selling shareholder have mutually agreed to extend the closing to May 26, 2011, while certain conditions of the contract are being completed. In the meantime, Wal-Mart and Trust-Mart continue to focus on their core mission, saving our Chinese customers money so they can live better.
As you know, we support Bharti Retail and their new store growth in India. Bharti Retail continued to grow, opening 24 stores in the third quarter of this year, and now operates 93 supermarkets and six compact hypermarkets. Under our joint venture with Bharti, we now have three cash and carry stores and are pleased with the continued sales growth in India.
Turning now to the United Kingdom. In the third quarter of this year, comparable store sales, excluding fuel, increased 1.3%. Overall, sales growth was in the low-single digits, with the fastest-growing areas being George apparel, produce, baby and toys. While comparable store traffic and ticket were both up in the third quarter, according to Kantar Worldpanel, ASDA's market share dropped slightly in the 12 weeks ending October 31.
ASDA is improving its offering to customers, specifically in the areas of assortment and quality. Andy Clarke and his team have made targeted price investments, including core food products. In September, ASDA committed to providing quality by relaunching its private brand under the Chosen By You label, and the products have been selected based on consumer blind taste tests. 1,000 items have already been launched and we expect an additional 2,500 by the first quarter of next year.
Operating income grew faster than sales in the third quarter. This was driven by an increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales from increased sales of George apparel. Expenses as a percentage of sales at ASDA were flat to last year. 
ASDA opened two new stores in the third quarter of this year, bringing the total store count to 379. Since the third quarter of last year, we have opened three superstores, five supermarkets and three ASDA Living stores. 
ASDA has recently added strength to its leadership team. Simon King was recently announced as our Chief Operating Officer. Simon brings a wealth of retail and supermarket experience and is a great addition to a strong team. In addition, Charles Redfield has been appointed Chief Merchandising Officer. Charles brings more than 20 years of Wal-Mart experience and was most recently in merchandising in our Sam's U.S. division.
The Netto acquisition we announced in May of this year continues to progress, and we've received formal approval from the OFT, or Office of Fair Trading, in the third quarter, with a requirement to sell 47 of the Netto stores. The remaining Netto stores will add 148 new stores and 1.1 million square feet. Full conversion of these Netto stores to the ASDA supermarket format is expected to be complete by this time next year.
We are encouraged by the recent sales momentum in the U.K. We are well positioned for the holiday season. At a time where economists are forecasting very tough economic conditions, ASDA remains committed to saving customers' money every day.
And finally, Canada. Walmart Canada's third quarter sales growth was 4.6%, due to a strong supercenter expansion program and sales of food. We have a total of 109 supercenters in Canada, 40 more than this time last year. 
Comparable sales in Canada were negative 0.4% on lower traffic, which was down 0.1%. Ticket was down 30 basis points. While Canada experienced record market share in food, consumables and baby, we experienced declines in sales of electronics and automotive. Despite the sales mix shift towards lower margin items, Canada's gross margin rate increased by 36 basis points over last year, due to better inventory management, including a reduction in shrinkage and improved purchasing.
Canada's expenses grew faster than sales, primarily due to incremental expenses on the launch of our banking operations and higher advertising investment. Canada's third quarter operating income grew faster than sales as the increase in margin offset the growth of expenses as a percentage of sales. In addition to Canada's 109 supercenters, we have 212 Walmart stores, so our business in Canada is still largely general merchandise driven. 
As you know, with the exception of Canada, the fourth quarter ends on December 31 for our countries, so Wal-Mart International is halfway through the fourth quarter. In addition to the normal competitive pricing situation, we're currently working towards more of an EDLP approach in Brazil. As we make that conversion, we will experience some profit pressure and we're expecting that it will be more challenging than in previous quarters to grow profit faster than sales. We anticipate a very competitive fourth quarter in some of our countries. While we expect sales to grow, the competitive environment is pressuring overall gross margin.
One last item of note. We recently announced our non-binding offer to purchase an ownership interest in South Africa's Massmart, and we are currently exploring a variety of options relating to ownership structure with the ultimate objective being to maximize shareholder value. Massmart offers a compelling growth opportunity with a talented team that is also a good cultural fit with Wal-Mart. We see the opportunity to increase value for Massmart customers and reach even more customers together. We remain excited about this potential investment.

During our recent investor meeting, we outlined how Sam's Club will continue to drive growth, leverage and returns through our Savings Made Simple framework. We are focused on listening to our members and effectively serving their needs.
Before we get into the financial details for the third quarter, I want to share some key highlights. Comp sales, excluding fuel, for the 13-week period ended October 29, increased by 2.4%. I'm excited to say, Sam's exceeded our original guidance of flat to 2%. We also were solidly within our updated guidance of 1% to 3%, which we provided on October 13 at our investor meeting. We maintained a strong margin rate, but due to expense pressures, couldn't translate that performance to operating margin.
Our sales momentum is evidence that our members are responding well to our improved merchandising offering. Sales during the quarter were particularly strong in fresh, jewelry, home and certain technology and entertainment categories. We also introduced more than 100 new items in fresh this fall, a historic high for Sam's Club.
Recently, an independent third-party annual survey ranked Sam's Club pharmacy second of all U.S. pharmacies. This was our highest rating ever. To build on this success, we're expanding health and wellness offerings. As of yesterday, our members can take advantage of the lowest Medicare Part D plan offered in the marketplace at Sam's Club's pharmacies. And let me remind you that our Sam's Club pharmacy is open to members and non-members.
Innovation and service drive success in technology and entertainment. So it's important to our members that we have the most up-to-date technology and top brands. We introduced LG and the Apple iPhone and iPad. We've also stepped up our associate training to provide more technology assistance to our members. We're also near completion of ""Wi-Fi-ing"" all of our clubs, which enhances the shopping experience.
Now let's turn to the detailed financial results. For the third quarter, net sales for Sam's Club, excluding fuel, increased to $11.1 billion, which is a 138-basis point increase over last year's third quarter. Including fuel, third quarter sales were $12.1 billion, which is a 2.7% increase versus last year, due in part to higher fuel prices this year compared to last year. Fuel prices in the third quarter this year were approximately 8% higher than last year.
As I mentioned earlier, comp club sales, excluding fuel for the 13-week period increased 2.4%. Including fuel, club comp sales increased 3.8%. Comp ticket, excluding fuel, increased for the 13-week period, both for Business and Advantage members. Comp traffic, excluding fuel, increased for the 13-week period among Advantage members, but declined slightly among Business members.
Our Food and Beverage business both had strong sales. We did experience inflation in dairy and meat. Back-to-school and back-to-college, as well as the fall tailgating season, drove sales in technology and entertainment. We were pleased to see we gained dollar share in computers and TVs during August and September. In home, we continue to see very strong comps in furniture, domestics and housewares. And jewelry comps were in the high-single digits. Finally, tobacco and fuel sales continue to deliver strong comps.
Sam's gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased by 22 basis points during the third quarter, primarily driven by the continued shift in merchandising mix towards higher margin fresh products, apparel and jewelry, as well as an increased margin in technology and entertainment. Our merchants have done an excellent job managing seasonal buys and sell-through to mitigate margin impact of markdowns. Including fuel, the gross margin rate for the quarter increased eight basis points compared to last year.
Inventory increased by 4.2% versus last year, driven in part by the normal anticipation of the holiday season. Additionally, you may recall, last year's inventory levels were lower than our historic levels due to inventory management initiatives and an impact from a calendar shift on merchandise receipts. Our inventory turns were up in the third quarter. With conservative buys for Halloween, we were able to manage sell-through for a successful Halloween season. We entered the fourth quarter in a strong inventory position and we are actively managing our seasonal transition through the holidays.
Operating expenses grew 4.8% versus last year, driven by increases in credit card interchange fees, remodeling and marketing expenses. As I explained in our first quarter call, beginning in April, in response to the continuing challenging credit program, we began paying an interchange fee in conjunction with our credit card program. We will not continue to feel this headwind in the fourth quarter. 
During the third quarter, 26 clubs were remodeled this year versus 23 last year. Additionally, during the quarter, we increased our marketing budget for key fall initiatives, including our back-to-school program, football season, 15 weeks for $15 membership and Labor Day eValues for all event.
For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 60 basis points. Units per labor hour decreased slightly for the third quarter versus last year. Although we did not leverage expenses for the quarter, I am pleased with our year-to-date performance on expense leverage. 
As a result of the increased expense level, third quarter operating income decreased 7.1% versus last year to $367 million. This represents a decrease in operating margin of 32 basis points from last year. Excluding fuel, operating income decreased by 8%.
Membership and other income decreased 5.1% from last year. You may recall that in last year's third quarter, we recognized a favorable accounting adjustment to membership income, as well as experienced strong comp results from the rollout of eValues for Plus membership. Excluding the effects of the accounting adjustment last year, membership and other income for the third quarter increased 40 basis points compared to last year. Membership income, the primary driver, decreased 5.9% versus last year. Excluding the accounting adjustment, membership income was flat. 
We are pleased with the continued increases in Plus membership penetration and new member sign-up at the Plus level, reflecting our focus on this initiative. We are also pleased with the overall renewal rates. These strengths have been offset by two factors: first, the continued erosion in the number of business add-ons due to the economic pressure that so many small business members are experiencing; second, the net impact of the membership loss from the 10 clubs closed last fiscal year compared to new club openings this year.
In the third quarter, we began to overlap the successful launch of last year's eValues program, which kicked off August 17, 2009. To spur additional upgrades and acquisitions, we hosted a weekend Labor Day event, which delivered strong results. The Labor Day eValues Savings Celebration served as a trial and awareness vehicle for all members to experience the additional discounts afforded by eValues. As we enter into the second year of eValues, we continue to focus on providing relevant and meaningful values to our members through various events.
We expect the trend in small business membership to continue to pressure net membership income in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is underway and we are focused on driving even greater value to our members and shareholders. Our annual Taste of Sam's event kicks off this Friday and lasts through the weekend. We plan to demonstrate Sam's is your one-stop shop for the holiday season for both meals and entertaining. Each club will host at least 18 demos each day. We also will demo more than 50 different holiday foods and entertaining merchandise items. This event always drives traffic and new member sign-ups.
In non-food categories, we feel we are solidly positioned across the club to have a successful holiday season and we are focused on meeting all the gifting needs for our members with a fresh approach to merchandising the product. We are very pleased with the early sales results in holiday décor, holiday gifting and food categories. We're entering the fourth quarter with a lot of momentum in home, apparel, jewelry and new products from Apple, and we anticipate strong comps in these areas.
We continue to see our third quarter sales momentum carry over into the first two weeks of the fourth quarter. We expect comp sales, without fuel, for the current 13-week period from October 30, 2010, through January 28, 2011, to increase between 1% and 3%. Last year, Sam's comp without fuel for the comparable period rose 70 basis points.
Now I'll turn it over to Tom for the report card and guidance discussion. Tom?"
313055,79147927,88387,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2010",2010-11-16,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Before I get into our financial report card to discuss growth, leverage and returns, let me provide an SAP update. North America continues to get better with each monthly close.

North America continues to get better with each monthly close. Mexico has now started the SAP conversion and Argentina is next in line. With each country that goes live, we get more efficient.
Now time for the financial report card. First, let's discuss growth. For the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we grew our square footage, net sales and operating income. Sales grew almost 3% for the quarter, mainly driven by International. 
Net retail square footage grew by approximately 10 million square feet to 971 million square feet at the end of the third quarter. So far this year, we have added 18.6 million square feet, as we introduce the Wal-Mart promise to more and more customers globally. We are still bullish on our growth prospects, both here in the United States and in our International markets. And we continue to grow operating income; as mentioned earlier, up more than 3% in the quarter. 
Now let's move on to leverage. We've now produced four consecutive quarters of expense leverage as we maintain our focus on the productivity loop and resulting Every Day Low Costs. Like last quarter, expense leverage was a significant factor in achieving our bottom line results. And as Mike indicated, we remain committed to expenses growing slower than sales.
Finally, let's talk about returns. As I mentioned in the second quarter, inventories at the end of last fiscal year were relatively low for Wal-Mart. This ""starting point"" continues to impact free cash flow. Accounts payable, as Charles indicated, benefited free cash flow. That said, our free cash flow through the previous nine months of the fiscal year was a healthy $2.9 billion, but below the $3.6 billion we reported for the same period last year. 
Remember, our goal for return on investment is to maintain a stable return. ROI for the 12 months ended October 31 was 18.6%. That's up from the 18.4% we reported last year. Like last quarter, the story behind ROI is strong operating performance. As I mentioned earlier, we are growing square footage and continue to invest in our business. Average ""invested capital"", or the denominator used to calculate ROI, grew by 7.3%.
However, our continued focus on the productivity loop has produced strong operating results. That leads us to the numerator. The trailing 12-month adjusted operating income has grown by 8.4%, far better than the increase in the denominator. Overall, we're extremely satisfied with our ROI performance. Face it, at 18.6% pretax return, this is very impressive.
Now let's move on to guidance. Mike mentioned earlier that we are raising our EPS guidance for the fiscal year. Based on what we see today and our expectations for the U.S. sales environment, we expect full year diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2011 to be between $4.08 and $4.12 per share. That's up from our previous full year guidance of $3.95 a share to $4.05. Correspondingly, our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share guidance is between $1.29 and $1.33. Both of these ranges assume that currency exchange rates remain at today's levels.
Before I close, let me summarize some of the key points for our third quarter. At the end of the day, we posted another strong quarter. First, we reported more than $100 billion in net sales. As I indicated, we added approximately 10 million square feet of retail space. Once again, we leveraged operating expenses, which allowed us to grow operating income faster than sales. We had another quarter of great EPS growth. ROI is 18.6% and better than at this time last year. And finally, our free cash flow of $2.9 billion is the second highest third quarter performance on record. 
Having said that, we understand that we have an opportunity to improve even further across our businesses. First, we have an opportunity to improve Wal-Mart U.S. comp store sales. We believe the fourth quarter will be in positive territory. As we continue to make progress in our merchandise assortment, we will expect inventory in Wal-Mart U.S. will settle down and will once again generate even more free cash flow.
In Wal-Mart International, we will improve operations in Brazil to increase profitability, and we will accelerate growth in China and in India. We will continue to grow in Mexico and add more supercenters in Canada. The international growth story is compelling. The sales momentum at Sam's Club will continue into the fourth quarter and into next fiscal year. We expect to see expense leverage from Sam's by next fiscal year as well. 
All of this kind of makes me think just how much has changed in the short time, a little bit more than a decade, that I have been proud to serve here at Wal-Mart. Our sales, our store count and our square footage have more than doubled since then. Sales rose from roughly $150 billion and EPS of $1.25 a share in fiscal 2000 to the kind of results we're talking about today, sales well north of $400 billion, and we shared our new guidance with you today that EPS should be in a range from $4.08 to $4.12. That compares to the $1.25 that I talked about for fiscal 2000. We are just shy of 8,700 units around the world, which enables us to do a great job of taking care of our customers and our members. And we're ready to help them to have a great holiday and a fourth quarter. We believe that there is no better retail model than Wal-Mart, and it means that we can continue to deliver strong shareholder value.
This is my last call as CFO. Charles will take over as CFO for Wal-Mart, effective December 1. You're in very capable hands, and I'm proud of the strong team that we've left behind that Charles will be leading in the future. 
Thank you for listening today. We really appreciate your continued interest in Wal-Mart, and have just a great holiday."
