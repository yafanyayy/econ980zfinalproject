The second quarter of fiscal 2010, fiscal reported net earnings of $268 million and earnings per share of $0.45, which is up 12.5% compared to the prior year. Sales trend improved throughout the quarter with the year-over-year rate of decline slowing to only 3%, a result largely driven by deflation. Not withstanding the challenging economic conditions, operating margin improved due in part to the favorable impact of COLI as well as excellent cost control throughout the organization. Ken will discuss this in more detail in a [indiscernible].Despite these challenging times, we remain steadfast in our commitment to helping our customers achieve their objectives. We are executing well and reinvesting in our business. Challenging times that historically provided opportunities for Sysco to further differentiate ourselves in the marketplace. Because our customers increasingly look to us for support and business solutions. As the industry leader, we have an unsurpassed ability to leverage our size and scale to benefit our customers. Our financial results for the quarter reflect a disciplined operational execution and excellent customer service that operating companies deliver each and everyday. While encouraged by our financial and operating performance today, we remained committed to continuous improvement and consistently look for opportunities to gain additional efficiencies in this competitive industry. For example, our business transformation project remains on track with the objectives discussed at our Investor Day in December. We expect the improvements driven by this multi-year project will allow us to grow sales, reduce operating costs and more effectively utilize data in our decision making.Now I'll turn things over to Ken. So that he can provide further detail on this and other operational improvements and how we performed in the second quarter."

I'd like to start by thanking our operating companies for their hard work during the quarter. These results reflect their dedication to our customers and to helping our business succeed in challenging times. Our sales during the quarter were impacted by deflation of 3.5%, which is measured as the estimated change in the cost of products we buy. Deflation from dairy and beef products had the largest impact, with the balance spread across several categories. On a year-over-year basis, deflation pressures appear to be moderating from the highs we saw early in the quarter.Our operating margin improved to 5.2% in the second quarter while COLI contributed to this improvement, we also significantly reduced payroll expenses and improved productivity in all aspects of our business. We have continued to manage headcount in a manner consistent with the sales environment throughout the entire organization. Our headcount is down 4% year-over-year and 10% over two years. As we improve productivity throughout the company. Operationally, we continue to focus on productivity, which is evident in many of our key operating metrics on a year-over-year basis. But the progress our operating companies have made is even more clear on a two-year basis. For example, in our U.S. Broadline Companies, our diesel gallon usage is about flat with last year's second quarter, but is down more than 10% compared to the second quarter of 2008. Cases per trip increased 3% year-over-year and 4% versus two years ago. Warehouse cases per man hour improved 8% year-over-year and 15% versus two years ago. And we improved our error frequency per cases shipped from an error rate of one out of 1,229 in the second quarter of 2008 to an error rate of one out of 1,799 this quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $138 million. Looking ahead, we still expect capital spending for the full year to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million as we continue to invest in our business. This spending includes maintenance items, such as ongoing fleet replacement and facility repairs, as well as growth items such as expansions of our current facilities, potential fold outs and technology. Technology spend includes capital related to our business transformation project. Now I'll turn it over to Chris for a discussion of our finance results for the quarter."

As previously discussed for the second quarter of fiscal 2010, sales were down 3% and estimated deflation was 3.5%. As Ken just mentioned, deflation appears to be moderating from highs we saw earlier in the quarter. Sales were also impacted by foreign exchange rates which increased sales by 1.2% and the impact of acquisitions which increased sales by 0.6%. While case volume remains negative early in the quarter, it turned positive towards the end of the period. Operating margin in the second quarter improved to 5.2% from 4.6% last year, a 60 basis point improvement. In addition, operating costs were lower in second quarter by $96 million.Ken walked through the main drivers earlier, and I'd like to review the numbers in a little more detail now. The decline in operating cost is primarily due to a $37 million benefit from the year-over-year change in value related to the performance of COLI and a $25 million decline in payroll expense. Operating expenses also improved by $29 million due to lower fuel expenses. However, deal surcharges which are reflected in gross margins were also lower during the period offsetting most of the benefit from lower fuel expense.Net earnings for the second quarter increased 12.9% to $268 million. Similarly, EPS for the quarter increased 12.5% to $0.45 per share. The $0.45 per share includes a $0.01 favorable impact related to an increase in the cash surrender value of COLI compared to $0.40 in the prior year, which included a $0.05 negative impact from COLI.Turning to our brief update on our business transformation initiative, you'll recall that at our Investor Day in December, we shared with you our expectation that the incremental impact of this project would decrease diluted EPS in fiscal 2010 by an estimated $0.05 per share. The project remains on track and our expectations have not changed.Cash flow from operations for the first half of the fiscal year was $144 million compared to $562 million in the prior year period. Cash flow from operations was impacted by IRS settlement payments which totaled $422 million in the first of the year. Additionally, cash flow in the first of the last year was impacted by the timing of certain other tax payments. Last year in the second quarter, we were allowed to defer approximately $280 million in tax payments until the third quarter, which was the benefit allowed the Houston area companies in the wake of hurricane Ike. As you would expect this year, we were not afforded the same deferral and the net effect causes our tax payments this year to appear significantly greater than last.In closing, I'd like to thank all our Associates for their hard work during the second quarter and for your interest in Sysco.  With that, operator, we'll take some questions."

Sales trend improved throughout the quarter with the year-over-year rate of decline slowing to only 3%, a result largely driven by deflation. Not withstanding the challenging economic conditions, operating margin improved due in part to the favorable impact of COLI as well as excellent cost control throughout the organization. Ken will discuss this in more detail in a [indiscernible].Despite these challenging times, we remain steadfast in our commitment to helping our customers achieve their objectives. We are executing well and reinvesting in our business. Challenging times have historically provided opportunities for Sysco to further differentiate ourselves in the marketplace. Because our customers increasingly look to us for support and business solutions. As the industry leader, we have an unsurpassed ability to leverage our size and scale to benefit our customers. Our financial results for the quarter reflect a disciplined operational execution and excellent customer service that operating companies deliver each and everyday. While encouraged by our financial and operating performance today, we remained committed to continuous improvement and consistently look for opportunities to gain additional efficiencies in this competitive industry. For example, our business transformation project remains on track with the objectives discussed at our Investor Day in December. We expect the improvements driven by this multi-year project will allow us to grow sales, reduce operating costs and more effectively utilize data in our decision making. Now I'll turn things over to Ken, so that he can provide further detail on this and other operational improvements and how we performed in the second quarter."

I'd like to start by thanking our operating companies for their hard work during the quarter. These results reflect their dedication to our customers and to helping our business succeed in challenging times. Our sales during the quarter were impacted by deflation of 3.5%, which is measured as the estimated change in the cost of products we buy. Deflation from dairy and beef products had the largest impact, with the balance spread across several categories. On a year-over-year basis, deflation pressures appear to be moderating from the highs we saw early in the quarter.Our operating margin improved to 5.2% in the second quarter while COLI contributed to this improvement, we also significantly reduced payroll expenses and improved productivity in all aspects of our business. We have continued to manage headcount in a manner consistent with the sales environment throughout the entire organization. Our headcount is down 4% year-over-year and 10% over two years. As we improve productivity throughout the company. Operationally, we continue to focus on productivity, which is evident in many of our key operating metrics on a year-over-year basis. But the progress our operating companies have made is even more clear on a two-year basis. For example, in our U.S. Broadline Companies, our diesel gallon usage is about flat with last year's second quarter, but is down more than 10% compared to the second quarter of 2008. Cases per trip increased 3% year-over-year and 4% versus two years ago. Warehouse cases per man hour improved 8% year-over-year and 15% versus two years ago. And we improved our error frequency per cases shipped from an error rate of one out of 1,229 in the second quarter of 2008 to an error rate of one out of 1,799 this quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $138 million. Looking ahead, we still expect capital spending for the full year to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million as we continue to invest in our business. This spending includes maintenance items, such as ongoing fleet replacement and facility repairs, as well as growth items, such as expansions of our current facilities, potential fold outs and technology. Technology spend includes capital related to our business transformation project. Now I'll turn it over to Chris for a discussion of our finance results for the quarter."

As previously discussed for the second quarter of fiscal 2010, sales were down 3% and estimated deflation was 3.5%. As Ken just mentioned, deflation appears to be moderating from highs we saw earlier in the quarter. Sales were also impacted by foreign exchange rates which increased sales by 1.2% and the impact of acquisitions which increased sales by 0.6%. While case volume remains negative early in the quarter, it turned positive towards the end of the period. Operating margin in the second quarter improved to 5.2% from 4.6% last year, a 60 basis point improvement. In addition, operating costs were lower in second quarter by $96 million.Ken walked through the main drivers earlier, and I'd like to review the numbers in a little more detail now. The decline in operating cost is primarily due to a $37 million benefit from the year-over-year change in value related to the performance of COLI and a $25 million decline in payroll expense. Operating expenses also improved by $29 million due to lower fuel expenses. However, deal surcharges which are reflected in gross margins were also lower during the period offsetting most of the benefit from lower fuel expense.Net earnings for the second quarter increased 12.9% to $268 million. Similarly, EPS for the quarter increased 12.5% to $0.45 per share. The $0.45 per share includes a $0.01 favorable impact related to an increase in the cash surrender value of COLI compared to $0.40 in the prior year, which included a $0.05 negative impact from COLI.Turning to our brief update on our business transformation initiative, you'll recall that at our Investor Day in December, we shared with you our expectation that the incremental impact of this project would decrease diluted EPS in fiscal 2010 by an estimated $0.05 per share. The project remains on track and our expectations have not changed.Cash flow from operations for the first half of the fiscal year was $144 million compared to $562 million in the prior year period. Cash flow from operations was impacted by IRS settlement payments which totaled $422 million in the first of the year. Additionally, cash flow in the first of the last year was impacted by the timing of certain other tax payments. Last year in the second quarter, we were allowed to defer approximately $280 million in tax payments until the third quarter, which was the benefit allowed the Houston area companies in the wake of hurricane Ike. As you would expect this year, we were not afforded the same deferral and the net effect causes our tax payments this year to appear significantly greater than last.In closing, I'd like to thank all our Associates for their hard work during the second quarter and for your interest in Sysco.  With that, operator, we'll take some questions."

Hence, probably the rest of the question has how does it look in January. We're still seeing positive cases. But it's declined from the December numbers. So we're still optimistic because it generally does that anyway. So it's following kind of a standard pattern, if you will, but the good news is, it's still positive. As far as -- there's still closures going on in the Restaurant business, you're still seeing certain parts of the industry that you guys know about are declining in case sales. Part of our business to, is not related necessarily to the Restaurant business, which is Healthcare, is no pun intended, quite healthy and growing. And of course, our Institutional business in schools on those kind of things have maintained their sales. So the other part is, yes, I think we are taking share. It's still one of those difficult questions to answer for you because it's hard to know, it's hard to sort out declining cases and certain customer basis and where you're gaining shares in other cases. So it's really hard to sort out. It's just at the end of the day, the real measurement that we've got to use is are we increasing our cases? And the answer to that is yes. Did I get them all?"

To tell you that I have that exactly in mind, but I can tell you this that we will be a leaner organization as the sales start to grow because as we've been forced by this environment, we've gotten a lot more productive. When you have an error rate in our business of one in 1,800 and then just in the last some '08 to '09 to '10, we've gone from 695 cases to 701 to 722.

Because our customers increasingly look to us for support and business solutions. As the industry leader, we have an unsurpassed ability to leverage our size and scale to benefit our customers. Our financial results for the quarter reflect a disciplined operational execution and excellent customer service that operating companies deliver each and everyday. While encouraged by our financial and operating performance today, we remained committed to continuous improvement and consistently look for opportunities to gain additional efficiencies in this competitive industry. For example, our business transformation project remains on track with the objectives discussed at our Investor Day in December. We expect the improvements driven by this multi-year project will allow us to grow sales, reduce operating costs and more effectively utilize data in our decision making.

I'd like to start by thanking our operating companies for their hard work during the quarter. These results reflect their dedication to our customers and to helping our business succeed in challenging times. Our sales during the quarter were impacted by deflation of 3.5%, which is measured as the estimated change in the cost of products we buy. Deflation from dairy and beef products had the largest impact, with the balance spread across several categories. On a year-over-year basis, deflation pressures appear to be moderating from the highs we saw early in the quarter.Our operating margin improved to 5.2% in the second quarter while COLI contributed to this improvement, we also significantly reduced payroll expenses and improved productivity in all aspects of our business. We have continued to manage headcount in a manner consistent with the sales environment throughout the entire organization. Our headcount is down 4% year-over-year and 10% over two years. As we improve productivity throughout the company. Operationally, we continue to focus on productivity, which is evident in many of our key operating metrics on a year-over-year basis. But the progress our operating companies have made is even more clear on a two-year basis. For example, in our U.S. Broadline Companies, our diesel gallon usage is about flat with last year's second quarter, but is down more than 10% compared to the second quarter of 2008. Cases per trip increased 3% year-over-year and 4% versus two years ago. Warehouse cases per man hour improved 8% year-over-year and 15% versus two years ago. And we improved our error frequency per cases shipped from an error rate of one out of 1,229 in the second quarter of 2008 to an error rate of one out of 1,799 this quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $138 million. Looking ahead, we still expect capital spending for the full year to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million as we continue to invest in our business. This spending includes maintenance items, such as ongoing fleet replacement and facility repairs, as well as growth items, such as expansions of our current facilities, potential fold outs and technology. Technology spend includes capital related to our business transformation project. Now I'll turn it over to Chris for a discussion of our finance results for the quarter."

As previously discussed for the second quarter of fiscal 2010, sales were down 3% and estimated deflation was 3.5%. As Ken just mentioned, deflation appears to be moderating from highs we saw earlier in the quarter. Sales were also impacted by foreign exchange rates which increased sales by 1.2% and the impact of acquisitions which increased sales by 0.6%. While case volume remains negative early in the quarter, it turned positive towards the end of the period. Operating margin in the second quarter improved to 5.2% from 4.6% last year, a 60 basis point improvement. In addition, operating costs were lower in second quarter by $96 million.Ken walked through the main drivers earlier, and I'd like to review the numbers in a little more detail now. The decline in operating cost is primarily due to a $37 million benefit from the year-over-year change in value related to the performance of COLI and a $25 million decline in payroll expense. Operating expenses also improved by $29 million due to lower fuel expenses. However, deal surcharges which are reflected in gross margins were also lower during the period offsetting most of the benefit from lower fuel expense.Net earnings for the second quarter increased 12.9% to $268 million. Similarly, EPS for the quarter increased 12.5% to $0.45 per share. The $0.45 per share includes a $0.01 favorable impact related to an increase in the cash surrender value of COLI compared to $0.40 in the prior year, which included a $0.05 negative impact from COLI.Turning to our brief update on our business transformation initiative, you'll recall that at our Investor Day in December, we shared with you our expectation that the incremental impact of this project would decrease diluted EPS in fiscal 2010 by an estimated $0.05 per share. The project remains on track and our expectations have not changed.Cash flow from operations for the first half of the fiscal year was $144 million compared to $562 million in the prior year period. Cash flow from operations was impacted by IRS settlement payments which totaled $422 million in the first of the year. Additionally, cash flow in the first of the last year was impacted by the timing of certain other tax payments. Last year in the second quarter, we were allowed to defer approximately $280 million in tax payments until the third quarter, which was the benefit allowed the Houston area companies in the wake of hurricane Ike. As you would expect this year, we were not afforded the same deferral and the net effect causes our tax payments this year to appear significantly greater than last.In closing, I'd like to thank all our Associates for their hard work during the second quarter and for your interest in Sysco.  With that, operator, we'll take some questions."

For the third quarter of fiscal 2010, Sysco reported net earnings of $248 million. Earnings per share were $0.42, an increase of 10.5% compared to the prior year.

Earnings per share were $0.42, an increase of 10.5% compared to the prior year. Sales increased 2.4% for the quarter, the first year-over-year quarterly increase in sales since our September 2008 quarter. This increase was driven by improving case volume and benefits from foreign currency translation. 
Case volume grew year-over-year in the third quarter. The numbers week-to-week were a bit uneven but we saw a sequential improvement in each month throughout the quarter. As we have indicated in our last call on February, March trends typically drive third quarter results and our performance for the quarter was favorably impacted by stronger sales growth in March than we originally anticipated. 
Deflation was 0.8% for the third quarter, which is substantially less than the 3.4% deflation we experienced in the first half of the year. Deflation subsided sequentially each month as we move through the quarter, with March coming in essentially flat. These changes were driven by higher prices in dairy, meat and produce. 
Operating margin improved year-over-year to 4.8%. I'm particularly pleased with our associates' ability to leverage of the sales growth we saw during the quarter. All of our employees are dedicated to helping our customers succeed and remain focused on driving continued improvements in service and productivity throughout the organization. Our financial results reflect Sysco's ability to execute effectively in a dynamic and highly competitive market.
We currently have a number of initiatives underway which are intended to improve certain operating processes, which we described at our Investor Day last December. Many of these initiatives have contributed to our operating margin performance over the last several quarters in our Broadline Companies. These include efforts to standardize warehouse operating systems, utilize discrete engineered labor standards and implement activity-based compensation. 
While the implementation of some of these changes is nearing completion, we have a pipeline of various other initiatives in the early stages of rollout that we expect to complete over the next 12 to 15 months. This include initiatives to implement new systems to determine the most efficient product placement on our trailers, scan orders as they are taken off the trucks and better manage fuel consumption and fleet maintenance. In addition, we remain on track with our business transformation project. We have substantially completed the design phase, and we are currently building and testing the underlying ERP system and processes with extensive resources dedicated to this critical phase. 
We anticipate going live with the implementation of the ERP system at our first offering company in early calendar 2011. As a result, we're beginning to process for getting our shared services operation up and running to support the first location and the others that will follow. During the third quarter, we purchased a facility in Houston that will house this organization, which will be known as Sysco Business Services [ph](9:11). We expect to begin staffing this facility in the second half of this calendar year. 
It's important to understand that we are not simply waiting for our ERP system to go live to realize benefits from this project. We are making numerous changes along the way to prepare for the transformation, and many of these changes will provide modest benefits before we actually go live. An example is the standardization of warehouse operating systems that I've mentioned a few minutes ago. 
Along the same lines, we have been populating [ph](9:41) our new online Order Management System, which will replace our eSysco platform and are now in the early phases of rolling it out to some of our contract customers. We're excited about the progress we're making and will continue to keep you informed of further developments along the way. 
Now I'll turn things over to Chris, so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the third quarter."

As Bill mentioned, we reported net earnings this morning of $248 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2010, an increase of 9.5% compared to the prior year period and the highest third qua",1049,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As Bill mentioned, we reported net earnings this morning of $248 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2010, an increase of 9.5% compared to the prior year period and the highest third quarter on record. 
Sales increased 2.4% which was driven by year-over-year case volume growth; foreign exchange rates, which increased sales by 1.6%; and the impact of acquisitions, which increased sales by 0.6%. Offsetting these increases, estimated deflation was 0.8%, which is measured as the estimated change in the cost of products we purchased. 
Operating margin in the third quarter improved to 4.8% from 4.6% last year, a 19 basis point improvement. Operating costs were higher in the quarter by $20 million. While there are multiple line items variances, the increase was primarily due to payroll expense that was $35 million higher in the current period. Approximately half of the increase in payroll expense was driven by higher incentive compensation accruals year-over-year. 
Last year in the third quarter, we released our bonus accruals when it became clear that we would not meet our 2009 performance objectives. However, based on performance to the third quarter of this year, we believe that it's likely, we will meet our 2010 performance objectives and we continue to accrue them accordingly. The majority of the remaining year-over-year increase in payroll expense was due to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, assuming from the conversion of our Canadian results into U.S. dollars. It's important to note that while payroll expense was up for the reasons I just mentioned, headcount was actually down 2.6% year-over-year in the third quarter. 
There were a few other notable operating expense variances compared to last year's third quarter. First, company-sponsored pension expense was $9 million higher in the current quarter which is in line with the guidance we gave in our 10-K. Second, last year, we had a $9 million loss in the third quarter related to COLI. This year, we recorded a $5 million gain resulting in a $14 million favorable comparison year-over-year. 
Third, fuel expense was $13 million lower than last year. And fourth, the provision for bad debt we recorded in the current period was $12 million. This compares to $31 million in the prior year period, resulting in a $19 million favorable year-over-year comparison. The current provision is based on recent activity, and simply means that there are fewer customer accounts meeting our criteria for write-off. For the current quarter, our bad debt expense as a percentage of sales was 0.14%. 
Earnings per share for the quarter increased 10.5% to $0.42 per share. The $0.42 of earnings per share include the $0.01 favorable impact related to an increase in the cash surrender value of COLI compared to $0.38 of earnings per share in the prior year, which included a $0.01 negative impact from COLI.
Turning to a brief update on our business transformation initiative. Today, we are updating our fiscal 2010 estimate of the net impact of this project. The revised estimate I will provide you represents the net impact of the project on our financial results. This means that it includes estimated benefits from the project as we define them, and it excludes costs for those Sysco employees that we have redeployed and dedicated to this project. As we've discussed previously, we do not consider the cost of employees that were redeployed to the project to have an incremental impact on our financial result. And to be clear, this is the same basis underlying the estimates we provided at our Investor Day last December. We now expect the project will decrease diluted earnings per share this fiscal year by an estimated $0.03, which is lower than the $0.05 estimate we presented at our Investor Day. 
As Bill discussed earlier, the project work is on schedule and the change in estimate is not an indication that we're behind schedule. The change is primarily attributable to two reasons. First, the balance between expense and capital spend has been more weighted to the capital side than originally estimated. As a result, EPS has not been impacted as much. At the same time, our cash expenditures for the projects are on track with expectations and consequently, we have not changed the total estimated cash outlay of the project. 
Second, we're seeing slightly higher benefits than anticipated at this stage of the project. The benefits expected for this fiscal year are modest and come primarily from payroll savings. For example, when we redeployed people to the project, we anticipated that we would backfill certain positions. However, we've not yet done this to the degree originally projected, and this has resulted in a greater benefit.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the first 39 weeks of the fiscal year was $466 million compared to $985 million in the prior year period. Cash flow from operations in the current period is net of IRS settlement payments, which totaled $475 million. 
Working capital has slightly increased from the end of the prior fiscal year in June 2009. Receivables, payables and inventory have all increased due to the increase in sales in third quarter. In addition, receivables tend to trend upward at this point in the year. This is due to a seasonal shift in sales mix, with sales from multi-unit customers and full districts representing a larger percentage of our sales. 
The other significant category of changes would've been working capital relates to the decline in accrued and deferred taxes. These declines are driven by IRS settlement payments made during the year and correlate to declines in cash. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $190 million. Looking ahead, we now expect capital spending for the full year to be in the range of $575 million to $625 million as we continue to invest in our business. This spending includes maintenance items such as ongoing fleet replacement and facility repairs, as well as growth items such as acquisitions, expansions of current facilities, potential foldouts and technology. Technology spend includes capital related to our business transformation project.
In closing, I'd like to thank all of our associates for their hard work during the third quarter and for your interest in Sysco. 
With that, operator, we'll now take questions."

That generally drives our business and that seems to be picking up as well. And I would say, even on the high end, where over the last year and a half, maybe almost two years, some of the high-end steakhouses, those types of places, those numbers are beginning to improve as well.

What we've consistently said, and for those of us who have been around this business a long time, it does hold up. The preferred environment, we could pick an inflationary environment, it would be one of the modest inflation, one, two, maybe three points inflation, for a couple of reasons. One is it that's a level that typically, our customers have been able to handle over the years with their customers. And two, we can manage that fairly well. So that's the more favorable environment. The environment where we're in a year to two years ago, where we're looking at 6%, sometimes 8% inflation, that's not good for anyone. That's not good for the customer and certainly, not good for the industry. And then what we think we're coming out of the deflationary environment would be the least attractive, probably of the three. Although, I have to say we've been real pleased with how our folks have managed through that over the last 6 to 9 months or so, so it'll help us some. But I think the main thing, when you look at our business right now, where we're at right now is we need to see case growth, our customers need to see volume increases. So at relatively low levels of inflation, that shouldn't be a barrier."

So I think we've said here for the last few months any way that we've sort of continued productivity improvements, which we expect to continue to enjoy, like I talked about earlier. We've cut a lot, it's really, really hard to cut a whole lot more. And as we go forward, with the premise that we're expecting to see some modest growth, I think you'll see us, and we actually for the first time, I think here in several quarters, we are up year-over-year with our sales headcount, marketing associates and so on. And so we will add there, and we have been adding there over the last six months or so. But I think the other areas, assuming we see a relatively modest pickup in cases, we still have quite a bit of capacity in our facilities and in our trucks continue to leverage.

In conjunction with that, we are making some changes. All these changes are effective with the new fiscal year, so where in what I would characterize as a transition period right now. We're also in a period where -- over the last week or two, and in particular the next six to eight weeks, we're very, very focused on doing our profit plans with all of our operating companies, as well as here at corporate. But essentially, what you'll see going forward is Mike Green will take over responsibility for the U.S. Broadline operating companies. Larry Pulliam will continue to oversee contract sales, our distribution services corporate group, as well as SYGMA and our specialty company. So those two gentlemen will be overseeing the business. Reporting in to Mike will be Scott Sonnemaker and Chuck Staes, who currently report in to Mike; and we've added a third gentleman, Mike Headrick, who will oversee our companies in the South. Mike's a longtime Sysco veteran, a very astute business person, we're excited to have Mike step up here. And then in conjunction with that, we've also identified 11 other folks, as well as what we're doing up in Canada, which I would characterize as more market VPs, and this is all new for us, Jay. If you go back, I don't know, I guess 15 years, I think around the mid-'90s, we went to the senior VP of Ops Structure, which was a first for us. And at that time and for many years after that, most of those folks, generally, we have four regions, they might have 15 maybe as many as 20 companies, which was effective but probably not overly manageable in some ways. As you know, in recent years last year to, in particular, we've gone to a more of a pod structure, which I think has been the transition to get us to where we're headed today which is more what I would characterize as a market structure. We're trying to be very customer centric and so with this market structure, we're going to have 11-plus Canada folks overseeing markets, they will not be running operating companies. They'll be working very closely with the operating company presidents in their marketplace to drive out our go-to-market strategy, to effectively implement the 212 business transformation work, to enhance what we're doing on the talent management side of the company, to better develop customer relationships that might crossover local lines, as well as -- and hopefully bring even more effective focus to our acquisition work. So I'm excited about that. It's a new structure and we'll begin to transition into it here as we go into the new year. In addition to that, we've had Kent Humphries, who has done a great job running our Canadian business to pick up expanded responsibilities and Kent's going to report in to Larry, head of our contract sales effort across the country. And Kent brings, not just a lot of experience, but a lot of, frankly, enthusiasm; and energy to that position and tremendous relationships, both within Sysco and with the customer base. In addition to that, Alan Hasty, who currently runs our Cleveland company is going to come down to corporate and work with Bill Day and his group to -- Alan's primary responsibilities will be to work in our BSCC merchandising areas. So we have made several moves, there'll be some more that I'm sure you'll learn of, which will be more replacing some of the folks that we've promoted and those will come out as appropriate over the next couple of months. But essentially, to cut through it all, as we go through these changes, we transition through the retirement of Ken and Steve. I just thought it was appropriate to leverage the talent that we do have in a bigger way and we have a very deep bench in Sysco. We've got a lot of people that are more than capable and want to contribute more, and that's what's behind these changes."

I mean, it's good for our customers, it's certainly good for us, and I would expect it's good for our competitors now. I think going forward, we're extremely well-positioned to grow and to continue to invest in our business. The one interesting thing as we've talked before with the model for this business is when you're not growing, assuming you can manage your receivables relatively well, you actually don't need a lot of capital unless you're going to expand your business. So when you do grow, that does put some pressure on the working capital. So I think from that standpoint, if we have some competitors out there that are able to grow, then they'll be dealing with that, and I'm sure they'll be able to deal with that. But I don't see a whole lot of change on the competitive environment. On the acquisition angle on that, we keep hoping for angles here and perhaps, a better environment will help us all come to more realistic terms on valuation, some of these situations and people will be more motivated to strike some common ground and evaluation now that the business is beginning to improve.

So certainly that would be a metric that we would expect to improve. There's no way of knowing on these things, and if you go back and look at the psychology and over last year, two years, we've kind of struck, I think a reasonable middle ground. We've never said that we thought that the industry was going to just go totally south for an extended period of time. We certainly acknowledge that the last year to two years have been difficult and the industry has declined. I think the reasonable case is it continues to be what we talked about up in New York in December, which is a modest nominal growth for the industry over time, and that would translate to good things for us. There's some below the line things for next year that I think we've called out and that you would need to deal with. And I'll let Chris kind of transition to that conversation."

We roll those forward month to month, and that just means that we keep going out another month, another month, another month as we see the need to do that. So we're never completely hedged in terms of real financial hedges in the marketplace. 40% is roughly the number where we've been at. The guidance number comes from several things.

Earnings per share were $0.42, an increase of 10.5% compared to the prior year. Sales increased 2.4% for the quarter, the first year-over-year quarterly increase in sales since our September 2008 quarter. This increase was driven by improving case volume and benefits from foreign currency translation. 
Case volume grew year-over-year in the third quarter. The numbers week-to-week were a bit uneven but we saw a sequential improvement in each month throughout the quarter. As we have indicated in our last call on February, March trends typically drive third quarter results and our performance for the quarter was favorably impacted by stronger sales growth in March than we originally anticipated. 
Deflation was 0.8% for the third quarter, which is substantially less than the 3.4% deflation we experienced in the first half of the year. Deflation subsided sequentially each month as we move through the quarter, with March coming in essentially flat. These changes were driven by higher prices in dairy, meat and produce. 
Operating margin improved year-over-year to 4.8%. I'm particularly pleased with our associates' ability to leverage of the sales growth we saw during the quarter. All of our employees are dedicated to helping our customers succeed and remain focused on driving continued improvements in service and productivity throughout the organization. Our financial results reflect Sysco's ability to execute effectively in a dynamic and highly competitive market.
We currently have a number of initiatives underway which are intended to improve certain operating processes, which we described at our Investor Day last December. Many of these initiatives have contributed to our operating margin performance over the last several quarters in our Broadline Companies. These include efforts to standardize warehouse operating systems, utilize discrete engineered labor standards and implement activity-based compensation. 
While the implementation of some of these changes is nearing completion, we have a pipeline of various other initiatives in the early stages of rollout that we expect to complete over the next 12 to 15 months. This include initiatives to implement new systems to determine the most efficient product placement on our trailers, scan orders as they are taken off the trucks and better manage fuel consumption and fleet maintenance. In addition, we remain on track with our business transformation project. We have substantially completed the design phase, and we are currently building and testing the underlying ERP system and processes with extensive resources dedicated to this critical phase. 
We anticipate going live with the implementation of the ERP system at our first offering company in early calendar 2011. As a result, we're beginning to process for getting our shared services operation up and running to support the first location and the others that will follow. During the third quarter, we purchased a facility in Houston that will house this organization, which will be known as Sysco Business Services. We expect to begin staffing this facility in the second half of this calendar year. 
It's important to understand that we are not simply waiting for our ERP system to go live to realize benefits from this project. We are making numerous changes along the way to prepare for the transformation, and many of these changes will provide modest benefits before we actually go live. An example is the standardization of warehouse operating systems that I've mentioned a few minutes ago. Along the same lines, we have been populating [ph](9:41) our new online Order Management System, which will replace our eSysco platform, and are now in the early phases of rolling it out to some of our contract customers. We're excited about the progress we're making and will continue to keep you informed of further developments along the way. 
Now I'll turn things over to Chris, so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the third quarter."

As Bill mentioned, we reported net earnings this morning of $248 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2010, an increase of 9½% compared to the prior year period and the highest third qua",1050,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As Bill mentioned, we reported net earnings this morning of $248 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2010, an increase of 9½% compared to the prior year period and the highest third quarter on record. 
Sales increased 2.4%, which was driven by year-over-year case volume growth; foreign exchange rates, which increased sales by 1.6%; and the impact of acquisitions, which increased sales by 0.6%. Offsetting these increases, estimated deflation was 0.8%, which is measured as the estimated change in the cost of products we purchased. 
Operating margin in the third quarter improved to 4.8% from 4.6% last year, a 19 basis point improvement. Operating costs were higher in the quarter by $20 million. While there are multiple line items variances, the increase was primarily due to payroll expense that was $35 million higher in the current period. Approximately half of the increase in payroll expense was driven by higher incentive compensation accruals year-over-year. Last year in the third quarter, we released our bonus accruals when it became clear that we would not meet our 2009 performance objectives. However, based on performance through the third quarter of this year, we believe it is likely we will meet our 2010 performance objectives and we continue to accrue for them accordingly. The majority of the remaining year-over-year increase in payroll expense was due to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, stemming from the conversion of our Canadian results into U.S. dollars. It's important to note that while payroll expense was up for the reasons I just mentioned, headcount was actually down 2.6% year-over-year in the third quarter. 
There were a few other notable operating expense variances compared to last year's third quarter. First, company-sponsored pension expense was $9 million higher in the current quarter, which is in line with the guidance we gave in our 10-K. Second, last year, we had a $9 million loss in the third quarter related to COLI. This year, we recorded a $5 million gain resulting in a $14 million favorable comparison year-over-year. Third, fuel expense was $13 million lower than last year. And fourth, the provision for bad debt we recorded in the current period was $12 million. This compares to $31 million in the prior year period, resulting in a $19 million favorable year-over-year comparison. The current provision is based on recent activity, and simply means that there are fewer customer accounts meeting our criteria for write-off. For the current quarter, our bad debt expense as a percentage of sales was 0.14%. 
Earnings per share for the quarter increased 10½% to $0.42 per share. The $0.42 of earnings per share includes a $0.01 favorable impact related to an increase in the cash surrender value of COLI compared to $0.38 of earnings per share in the prior year, which included a $0.01 negative impact from COLI.
Turning to a brief update on our business transformation initiative. Today, we are updating our fiscal 2010 estimate of the net impact of this project. The revised estimate I will provide you represents the net impact of the project on our financial results. This means that it includes estimated benefits from the project as we define them, and it excludes costs for those Sysco employees that we have redeployed and dedicated to this project. As we've discussed previously, we do not consider the cost of employees that were redeployed to the project to have an incremental impact on our financial results. And to be clear, this is the same basis underlying the estimates we provided at our Investor Day last December. We now expect the project will decrease diluted earnings per share this fiscal year by an estimated $0.03, which is lower than the $0.05 estimate we presented at our Investor Day. 
As Bill discussed earlier, the project work is on schedule and the change in estimate is not an indication that we're behind schedule. The change is primarily attributable to two reasons. First, the balance between expense and capital spend has been more weighted to the capital side than originally estimated. As a result, EPS has not been impacted as much. At the same time, our cash expenditures for the projects are on track with expectations and consequently, we have not changed the total estimated cash outlay of the project. 
Second, we're seeing slightly higher benefits than anticipated at this stage of the project. The benefits expected for this fiscal year are modest and come primarily from payroll savings. For example, when we redeployed people to the project, we anticipated that we would backfill certain positions. However, we've not yet done this to the degree originally projected, and this has resulted in a greater benefit.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the first 39 weeks of the fiscal year was $466 million compared to $985 million in the prior year period. Cash flow from operations in the current period is net of IRS settlement payments, which totaled $475 million. Working capital has slightly increased from the end of the prior fiscal year in June 2009. Receivables, payables and inventory have all increased due to the increase in sales in third quarter. In addition, receivables tend to trend upward at this point in the year. This is due to a seasonal shift in sales mix, with sales from multi-unit customers and full districts representing a larger percentage of our sales. The other significant category of changes would've been working capital relates to the decline in accrued and deferred taxes. These declines are driven by IRS settlement payments made during the year and correlate to declines in cash. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $190 million. Looking ahead, we now expect capital spending for the full year to be in the range of $575 million to $625 million as we continue to invest in our business. This spending includes maintenance items such as ongoing fleet replacement and facility repairs, as well as growth items such as acquisitions, expansions of current facilities, potential foldouts and technology. Technology spend includes capital related to our business transformation project.
In closing, I'd like to thank all of our associates for their hard work during the third quarter and for your interest in Sysco. 
With that, operator, we'll now take questions."

And I would say that were seeing it across pretty much all the lines of restaurant segments for different reasons. And so I think the quick serve or QSR continues to be pretty strong on a relative basis, although the comparisons there are tougher because they held up pretty well a year ago. What we think we're beginning to see with the consumer spending picking up somewhat is that the family-style, which as you know, basically, a family restaurant with all different varieties. That generally drives our business and that seems to be picking up as well. And I would say, even on the high end, where over the last year and a half, maybe almost two years, some of the high-end steakhouses, those types of places, those numbers are beginning to improve as well. Partially, I think, just because the comparisons are relatively easy, we've had a really tough year and a half or two years. So again, it's good to see the growth, it's still somewhat modest, but I would say it's across all segments."

What we've consistently said, and for those of us who have been around this business a long time, it does hold up: The preferred environment, we could pick an inflationary environment, it would be one of modest inflation, one, two, maybe three points inflation, for a couple of reasons. One is, that's a level that typically, our customers have been able to handle over the years with their customers. And two, we can manage that fairly well. So that's the more favorable environment. The environment we were in a year to two years ago where we were looking at 6%, sometimes 8% inflation, that's not good for anyone. It's not good for the customer and it's certainly not good for the industry. And then what we think we're coming out of the deflationary environment would be the least attractive, probably of the three. Although, I have to say we've been real pleased with how our folks have managed through that over the last six to nine months or so, so it'll help us some.

But I think the other areas, assuming we see a relatively modest pickup in cases, we still have quite a bit of capacity in our facilities and on our trucks continue to leverage. So I think nothing really changes other than the environment here. So you could expect us to continue to try to drive the earnings faster than the top line."

As you had said, it's not really just -- Ken's retirement, that's a significant event for us here at Sysco. Steve Smith has also announced his retirement. In conjunction with that, we are making some changes. All these changes are effective with the new fiscal year, so where in what I would characterize as a transition period right now. We're also in a period where -- over the last week or two, and in particular the next six to eight weeks, we're very, very focused on doing our profit plans with all of our operating companies, as well as here at corporate. But essentially, what you'll see going forward is Mike Green will take over responsibility for the U.S. Broadline operating companies. Larry Pulliam will continue to oversee contract sales, our distribution services corporate group, as well as SYGMA and our specialty company. So those two gentlemen will be overseeing the business. Reporting in to Mike will be Scott Sonnemaker and Chuck Staes, who currently report in to Mike; and we've added a third gentleman, Mike Headrick, who will oversee our companies in the South. Mike's a longtime Sysco veteran, a very astute business person, we're excited to have Mike step up here. And then in conjunction with that, we've also identified 11 other folks, as well as what we're doing up in Canada, which I would characterize as more market VPs, and this is all new for us, Jay. If you go back, I don't know, I guess 15 years, I think around the mid-'90s, we went to the senior VP of Ops Structure, which was a first for us. And at that time and for many years after that, most of those folks, generally, we have four regions, they might have 15 maybe as many as 20 companies, which was effective but probably not overly manageable in some ways. As you know, in recent years last year to, in particular, we've gone to a more of a pod structure, which I think has been the transition to get us to where we're headed today which is more what I would characterize as a market structure. We're trying to be very customer centric and so with this market structure, we're going to have 11-plus Canada folks overseeing markets, they will not be running operating companies. They'll be working very closely with the operating company presidents in their marketplace to drive out our go-to-market strategy, to effectively implement the 212 business transformation work, to enhance what we're doing on the talent management side of the company, to better develop customer relationships that might crossover local lines, as well as -- and hopefully bring even more effective focus to our acquisition work. So I'm excited about that. It's a new structure and we'll begin to transition into it here as we go into the new year. In addition to that, we've had Kent Humphries, who has done a great job running our Canadian business to pick up expanded responsibilities and Kent's going to report in to Larry, head of our contract sales effort across the country. And Kent brings, not just a lot of experience, but a lot of, frankly, enthusiasm; and energy to that position and tremendous relationships, both within Sysco and with the customer base. In addition to that, Alan Hasty, who currently runs our Cleveland company is going to come down to corporate and work with Bill Day and his group to -- Alan's primary responsibilities will be to work in our BSCC merchandising areas. So we have made several moves, there'll be some more that I'm sure you'll learn of, which will be more replacing some of the folks that we've promoted and those will come out as appropriate over the next couple of months. But essentially, to cut through it all, as we go through these changes, we transition through the retirement of Ken and Steve. I just thought it was appropriate to leverage the talent that we do have in a bigger way and we have a very deep bench in Sysco. We've got a lot of people that are more than capable and want to contribute more, and that's what's behind these changes."

I mean, it's good for our customers, it's certainly good for us, and I would expect it's good for our competitors now. I think going forward, we're extremely well-positioned to grow and to continue to invest in our business. The one interesting thing as we've talked before with the model for this business is when you're not growing, assuming you can manage your receivables relatively well, you actually don't need a lot of capital unless you're going to expand your business. So when you do grow, that does put some pressure on the working capital. So I think from that standpoint, if we have some competitors out there that are able to grow, then they'll be dealing with that, and I'm sure they'll be able to deal with that. But I don't see a whole lot of change on the competitive environment. On the acquisition angle on that, we keep hoping for angles here and perhaps, a better environment will help us all come to more realistic terms on valuation, some of these situations and people will be more motivated to strike some common ground and evaluation now that the business is beginning to improve.

We've never said that we thought that the industry was going to just go totally south for an extended period of time. We certainly acknowledge that the last year to two years have been difficult and the industry has declined. I think the reasonable case is it continues to be what we talked about up in New York in December, which is a modest nominal growth for the industry over time, and that would translate to good things for us.

So we look at what effectively unhedged, and we go out and we put in place hedges on a substantial portion of that. I think the number is roughly 40% of our overall gallon per hedge. We roll those forward month to month, and that just means that we keep going out another month, another month, another month as we see the need to do that. So we're never completely hedged in terms of real financial hedges in the marketplace. 40% is roughly the number where we've been at. The guidance number comes from several things. One of which is we just don't know what fuel costs are going to do in the next couple of months and so the guidance is still reasonably wide."

For the third quarter of fiscal 2010, Sysco reported net earnings of $248 million. Earnings per share were $0.42, an increase of 10 1/2% compared to the prior year.

Earnings per share were $0.42, an increase of 10 1/2% compared to the prior year. Sales increased 2.4% for the quarter, the first year-over-year quarterly increase in sales since our September 2008 quarter. This increase was driven by improving case volume and benefits from foreign currency translation. 
Case volume grew year-over-year in the third quarter. The numbers week-to-week were a bit uneven but we saw sequential improvement in each month throughout the quarter. As we have indicated on our last call in February, March trends typically drive third quarter results, and our performance for the quarter was favorably impacted by stronger sales growth in March than we originally anticipated. 
Deflation was 0.8% for the third quarter, which is substantially less than the 3.4% deflation we experienced in the first half of the year. Deflation subsided sequentially each month as we move through the quarter, with March coming in essentially flat. These changes were driven by higher prices in dairy, meat and produce. 
Operating margin improved year-over-year to 4.8%. I'm particularly pleased with our associates' ability to leverage the sales growth we saw during the quarter. All of our employees are dedicated to helping our customers succeed and remain focused on driving continued improvements in service and productivity throughout the organization. Our financial results reflect Sysco's ability to execute effectively in a dynamic and highly competitive market.
We currently have a number of initiatives underway, which are intended to improve certain operating processes, which we described at our Investor Day last December. Many of these initiatives have contributed to our operating margin performance over the last several quarters in our Broadline Companies. These include efforts to standardize warehouse operating systems, utilize discrete engineered labor standards and implement activity-based compensation. 
While the implementation of some of these changes is nearing completion, we have a pipeline of various other initiatives in the early stages of rollout that we expect to complete over the next 12 to 15 months. These include initiatives to implement new systems to determine the most efficient product placement on our trailers, scan orders as they are taken off the trucks and better manage fuel consumption and fleet maintenance. In addition, we remain on track with our business transformation project. We have substantially completed the design phase, and we are currently building and testing the underlying ERP system and processes, with extensive resources dedicated to this critical phase. 
We anticipate going live with the implementation of the ERP system at our first operating company in early calendar 2011. As a result, we're beginning to process or getting our shared services operation up and running to support the first location and the others that will follow. During the third quarter, we purchased a facility in Houston that will house this organization, which will be known as Sysco Business Services. We expect to begin staffing this facility in the second half of this calendar year. 
It's important to understand that we are not simply waiting for our ERP system to go live to realize benefits from this project. We are making numerous changes along the way to prepare for the transformation, and many of these changes will provide modest benefits before we actually go live. An example is the standardization of warehouse operating systems that I've mentioned a few minutes ago. Along the same lines, we have been populating [ph] (9:41) our new online Order Management System, which will replace our eSysco platform, and are now in the early phases of rolling it out to some of our contract customers. We're excited about the progress we're making and will continue to keep you informed of further developments along the way. 
Now I'll turn things over to Chris, so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the third quarter."

As Bill mentioned, we reported net earnings this morning of $248 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2010, an increase of 9½% compared to the prior year period and the highest third qua",1052,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As Bill mentioned, we reported net earnings this morning of $248 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2010, an increase of 9½% compared to the prior year period and the highest third quarter on record. 
Sales increased 2.4%, which was driven by year-over-year case volume growth; foreign exchange rates, which increased sales by 1.6%; and the impact of acquisitions, which increased sales by 0.6%. Offsetting these increases, estimated deflation was 0.8%, which is measured as the estimated change in the cost of products we purchased. 
Operating margin in the third quarter improved to 4.8% from 4.6% last year, a 19 basis point improvement. Operating costs were higher in the quarter by $20 million. While there are multiple line items variances, the increase was primarily due to payroll expense that was $35 million higher in the current period. Approximately half of the increase in payroll expense was driven by higher incentive compensation accruals year-over-year. Last year in the third quarter, we released our bonus accruals when it became clear that we would not meet our 2009 performance objectives. However, based on performance through the third quarter of this year, we believe it is likely we will meet our 2010 performance objectives and we continue to accrue for them accordingly. The majority of the remaining year-over-year increase in payroll expense was due to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, stemming from the conversion of our Canadian results into U.S. dollars. It's important to note that while payroll expense was up for the reasons I just mentioned, headcount was actually down 2.6% year-over-year in the third quarter. 
There were a few other notable operating expense variances compared to last year's third quarter. First, company-sponsored pension expense was $9 million higher in the current quarter, which is in line with the guidance we gave in our 10-K. Second, last year, we had a $9 million loss in the third quarter related to COLI. This year, we recorded a $5 million gain resulting in a $14 million favorable comparison year-over-year. Third, fuel expense was $13 million lower than last year. And fourth, the provision for bad debt we recorded in the current period was $12 million. This compares to $31 million in the prior year period, resulting in a $19 million favorable year-over-year comparison. The current provision is based on recent activity, and simply means that there are fewer customer accounts meeting our criteria for write-off. For the current quarter, our bad debt expense as a percentage of sales was 0.14%. 
Earnings per share for the quarter increased 10½% to $0.42 per share. The $0.42 of earnings per share includes a $0.01 favorable impact related to an increase in the cash surrender value of COLI compared to $0.38 of earnings per share in the prior year, which included a $0.01 negative impact from COLI.
Turning to a brief update on our business transformation initiative. Today, we are updating our fiscal 2010 estimate of the net impact of this project. The revised estimate I will provide you represents the net impact of the project on our financial results. This means that it includes estimated benefits from the project as we define them, and it excludes costs for those Sysco employees that we have redeployed and dedicated to this project. As we've discussed previously, we do not consider the cost of employees that were redeployed to the project to have an incremental impact on our financial result. And to be clear, this is the same basis underlying the estimates we provided at our Investor Day last December. We now expect the project will decrease diluted earnings per share this fiscal year by an estimated $0.03, which is lower than the $0.05 estimate we presented at our Investor Day. 
As Bill discussed earlier, the project work is on schedule and the change in estimate is not an indication that we are behind schedule. The change is primarily attributable to two reasons. First, the balance between expense and capital spend has been more weighted to the capital side than originally estimated. As a result, EPS has not been impacted as much. At the same time, our cash expenditures for the project are on track with expectations, and consequently, we have not changed the total estimated cash outlay of the project. 
Second, we're seeing slightly higher benefits than anticipated at this stage of the project. The benefits expected for this fiscal year are modest and come primarily from payroll savings. For example, when we redeployed people to the project, we anticipated that we would backfill certain positions. However, we've not yet done this to the degree originally projected, and this has resulted in a greater benefit.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the first 39 weeks of the fiscal year was $466 million compared to $985 million in the prior-year period. Cash flow from operations in the current period is net of IRS settlement payments, which totaled $475 million. Working capital has slightly increased from the end of the prior fiscal year in June 2009. Receivables, payables and inventory have all increased due to the increase in sales in the third quarter. In addition, receivables tend to trend upward at this point in the year. This is due to a seasonal shift in sales mix, with sales from multi-unit customers and full districts representing a larger percentage of our sales. The other significant category of changes would've been working capital that relates to the decline in accrued and deferred taxes. These declines are driven by IRS settlement payments made during the year and correlate to declines in cash. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $190 million. Looking ahead, we now expect capital spending for the full year to be in the range of $575 million to $625 million, as we continue to invest in our business. This spending includes maintenance items such as ongoing fleet replacement and facility repairs, as well as growth items such as acquisitions, expansions of current facilities, potential foldouts and technology. Technology spend includes capital related to our business transformation project.
In closing, I'd like to thank all of our associates for their hard work during the third quarter and for your interest in Sysco. With that, operator, we'll now take questions."

What we've consistently said, and for those of us who have been around this business a long time, it does hold up: The preferred environment, we could pick an inflationary environment, it would be one of modest inflation, one, two, maybe three points inflation, for a couple of reasons. One is, that's a level that typically, our customers have been able to handle over the years with their customers. And two, we can manage that fairly well. So that's the more favorable environment. The environment we were in a year to two years ago where we were looking at 6%, sometimes 8% inflation, that's not good for anyone. It's not good for the customer and it's certainly not good for the industry. And then what we think we're coming out of the deflationary environment would be the least attractive, probably of the three. Although, I have to say we've been real pleased with how our folks have managed through that over the last six to nine months or so, so it'll help us some. But I think the main thing, when you look at our business right now, where we're at right now is we need to see case growth, our customers need to see volume increases. So at relatively low levels of inflation, that shouldn't be a barrier."

As you had said, it's not really just Ken's retirement, although that's a significant event for us here at Sysco. Steve Smith has also announced his retirement. In conjunction with that, we are making some changes. All these changes are effective with the new fiscal year. So we're in what I would characterize as a transition period right now. We're also in a period where over the last week or two, and in particular, the next six to eight weeks, we're very, very focused on doing our profit plans with all of our operating companies, as well as here at corporate. But essentially, what you'll see going forward is Mike Green will take over responsibility for the U.S. Broadline operating companies. Larry Pulliam will continue to oversee contract sales, our distribution services corporate group, as well as SYGMA and our specialty company. So those two gentlemen will be overseeing the business. Reporting in to Mike will be Scott Sonnemaker and Chuck Staes, who currently report in to Mike; and we've added a third gentleman, Mike Headrick, who will oversee our companies in the South. Mike is a longtime Sysco veteran, a very astute business person, we're excited to have Mike step up here. And then in conjunction with that, we've also identified 11 other folks, as well as what we're doing up in Canada, which I would characterize as more market VPs, and this is all new for us, Jay. If you go back, I don't know, I guess 15 years, I think around the mid-'90s, we went to the Senior VP of Ops structure, which was a first for us. And at that time and for many years after that, most of those folks, generally, we have four regions, they might have 15, maybe as many as 20 companies, which was effective but probably not overly manageable in some ways. As you know, in recent years, last year or two, in particular, we've gone to a more of a POD structure, which I think has been the transition to get us to where we're heading today, which is more what I'm going characterize as a market structure. We're trying to be very customer-centric. And so with this market structure, we're going to have 11-plus Canada folks overseeing markets. They will not be running operating companies. They'll be working very closely with the operating company presidents in their marketplace to drive out our go-to-market strategy, to effectively implement the 212 business transformation work, to enhance what we're doing on the talent management side of the company, to better develop customer relationships that might crossover local lines, as well as to hopefully bring even more effective focus to our acquisition work. So I'm excited about that. It's a new structure, and we'll begin to transition into it here as we go into the new year. In addition to that, we've asked Kent Humphries, who has done a great job running our Canadian business, to pick up expanded responsibilities. And Kent's going to report in to Larry and head up our contract sales effort across the country. And Kent brings, not just a lot of experience, but a lot of, frankly, enthusiasm and energy to that position and tremendous relationships, both within Sysco and with the customer base. In addition to that, Alan Hasty, who currently runs our Cleveland company is going to come down to corporate and work with Bill Day and his group to -- Alan's primary responsibilities will be to work in our BSCC merchandising area. So we have made several moves. There will be some more that I'm sure you'll learn of, which will be more replacing some of the folks that we've promoted, and those will come out as appropriate over the next couple of months. But essentially, to cut through it all, as we go through these changes, we transition through the retirement of Ken and Steve, I just thought it was appropriate to leverage the talent that we do have in a bigger way, and we have a very deep bench in Sysco. We've got a lot of people that are more than capable and want to contribute more, and that's what's behind these changes."

I mean, it's good for our customers, it's certainly good for us, and I would expect it's good for our competitors now. I think going forward, we're extremely well positioned to grow and to continue to invest in our business. The one interesting thing, as we've talked before with the model for this business is when you're not growing, assuming you can manage your receivables relatively well, you actually don't need a lot of capital unless you're going to expand your business. So when you do grow, that does put some pressure on the working capital. So I think from that standpoint, if we have some competitors out there that are able to grow, then they'll be dealing with that, and I'm sure they'll be able to deal with that. But I don't see a whole lot of change on the competitive environment. On the acquisition angle on that, we keep hoping for angles here. And perhaps, a better environment will help us all come to more realistic terms on valuation. Some of these situations and people will be more motivated to strike some common ground on valuation now that the business is beginning to improve. So I think it could be a good thing."

So certainly, that would be a metric that we would expect to improve. There's no way of knowing on these things. And if you go back and look at the psychology in over last year, two years, we've kind of struck, I think, a reasonable middle ground. We've never said that we thought that the industry was going to just go totally south for an extended period of time. We certainly acknowledge that the last year to two years have been difficult and the industry has declined. I think the reasonable case is it continues to be what we talked about up in New York in December, which is a modest nominal growth for the industry over time, and that would translate to good things for us. There's some below the line things for next year that I think we've called out and that you would need to deal with. And I'll let Chris kind of transition that conversation."

We roll those forward month-to-month. And that just means that we keep going out another month, another month and another month as we see the need to do that. So we're never completely hedged in terms of real financial hedges in the marketplace. 40% is roughly the number where we've been at. The guidance number comes from several things.

As disclosed in our earnings release this morning, our operating results this year included an extra week of operations due to the timing of the last day of our fiscal year. As a result, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 included 14 weeks of operations compared to the fourth quarter last year, which included 13 weeks. And fiscal year 2010 included 53 weeks of operations compared to the prior year, which included 52 weeks. On the call today, we will discuss year-over-year comparisons that include the impact of the extra week of operations. 
However, to provide financial results that are more comparable on a year-over-year basis, certain metrics will be provided, which removed the estimated impact of the extra week. These adjusted metrics are non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable GAAP measures on our Investor Relations website at sysco.com.

I'd like to begin this morning by recognizing our management team and all of our associates for both their commitment and hard work. They kept their full attention in servicing our customers and effectively managing expenses throughout a second consecutive challenging year. 
This morning, Sysco reported net earnings of $338 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. We are pleased to see case lines once again increase year-over-year. While we have seen no consistent pattern of improvement on a week-to-week basis, we are encouraged by the fact that we have now experienced positive line comparisons through the past several months. In addition, we experienced food cost inflation as measured by the estimated change in our cost of goods during the fourth quarter for the first time in a year. Specifically, inflation contributed approximately 2.2% of our overall sales growth for the quarter, driven mainly by higher prices in the dairy, meat and produce categories. 
I am particularly pleased with how well our operating companies continue to manage their expenses. Along with supporting the growth of our customers, improving our operational effectiveness remains a key area of focus throughout Sysco. While industry conditions are more favorable than they were a year ago, our marketplace remains highly competitive. This environment has increased pricing pressures, which we have and will continue to work through with our customers. Specifically, we focus our efforts on differentiating our product and service offerings, more effectively utilizing our scale to better integrate our enterprise-wide capabilities and reducing our cost structure over time. We believe that we've been able to take share as a result of these efforts. 
Reflecting on the entire fiscal year, we sold more than $37 billion of product, shipped more than 1.2 billion cases, generated $2 billion of operating income, recognized record earnings of $1.99 per diluted share, produced cash flow from operations of $885 million and distributed $580 million of dividends to our shareholders. 
Turning to our multi-year business transformation initiative for a moment, we currently have more than 300 people dedicated full time to the project. Over the past two years, we have completed much of the design and technology development work and are currently testing systems and processes. The project remains on track, and we currently expect our first operating company to go live early next calendar year. Subsequent rollouts will occur in ways of five to 10 operating companies through the end of 2013. This project is the single most important initiative we have undertaken since the formation of Sysco. As previously communicated, we are investing significant amounts of financial and human capital to better position Sysco for profitable sales growth for years to come. We will continue to provide periodic updates as we move forward with the work. 
On last quarter's call, we discussed the new operational leadership structure we were preparing to put in place. Mike Green is now leading the U.S. Broadline companies, and Larry Pulliam is overseeing contract sales, SYGMA, distribution services and the specialty companies. Additionally, we have recently realigned our U.S. Broadline leadership responsibilities into 11 geographic markets. These changes became effective with the beginning of our new fiscal year. This new structure enhances our go-to-market strategy, allows us to more effectively implement our business transformation project, helps us develop and strengthen customer relationships across over local lines and improves our approach to building a pipeline of acquisitions. In addition, the new organization structure provides a broader platform to further develop our most talented and experienced leaders now and in the future. 
I would like to close my prepared comments this morning in the same manner which I began by thanking our 46,000 associates for their efforts and engagement over the past year. While encouraged by volume trends that continue to be favorable, we recognize that the broader economic climate may remain tenuous for some time. Accordingly, we are committed to aggressively deploying all of Sysco's resources and capabilities moving forward to effectively support our customers and fully realize the opportunities available to us in the $200 billion foodservice industry. Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year."
189096,111541877,74823,"Sysco Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-16-2010",2010-08-16,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone.

That means these",1552,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. What I'd like to do first this morning is provide a brief summary of the formal GAAP results. These GAAP results include the impact of the extra week of operations that Neil mentioned earlier. That means these numbers compare 14 weeks of operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 to 13 weeks in the fourth quarter of 2009, and 53 weeks of operations in fiscal 2010 to 52 weeks in fiscal 2009. 
On a GAAP basis, for the fourth quarter, sales were $10.3 billion, an increase of 13.9% compared to the prior year. And operating income was $584 million, an increase of 8.1% compared to the prior year. Net earnings were $338 million, an increase of 7.1%, and earnings per share were $0.57 compared to $0.53 in the prior year or an increase of 7.5%.  
On a GAAP basis, for the year, sales were $37.2 billion, an increase of 1.1% compared to the prior year. And operating income was $2 billion, an increase of 5.5% compared to the prior year. Net earnings were $1.2 billion, an increase of 11.7%. Earnings per share were $1.99 compared with $1.77 in the prior year or an increase of 12.4%. 
As I mentioned, those year-over-year comparisons on a GAAP basis are not comparable because that extra week of operations in the fourth quarter impacts all the year-over-year comparisons. So what I'd like to do now is discuss our results for the quarter and the year, excluding the impact of that extra week. That means these adjusted numbers compare 13 weeks of operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 to 13 weeks in the fourth quarter of 2009, and 52 weeks of operations in fiscal 2010 to 52 weeks in fiscal 2009. This should give you a better sense for what's going on in our business, and it's the same basis that the management team has been using to analyze our financial results. 
On an adjusted basis for the quarter, sales increased 5.8% compared to the prior year, driven mainly by case volume growth and the impact of food cost inflation, which we estimated to be 2.2% for the period. In addition, changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by 1.3%. Adjusted operating income was essentially flat in the fourth quarter, increasing only 0.4%. Adjusted operating expenses were higher in the fourth quarter by $76 million. The increase was primarily due to a $30 million charge related to corporate-owned life insurance or COLI, and $29 million in higher incentive compensation expense. 
Bonus accruals were lower last year in the fourth quarter because we did not meet all our 2009 performance objectives. However, based on the financial results announced today, we met certain 2010 performance objectives and have accrued for bonuses accordingly. 
Additionally, gross margin was slightly lower, which we largely attribute to the pricing pressures Bill mentioned earlier. Adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter were $314 million and were essentially flat compared to the prior year, declining less than $2 million. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.53, including a $0.02 negative impact from COLI. In the prior year period, earnings per share were also $0.53, but included a $0.03 positive impact from COLI. 
Turning to the year-over-year comparison, while sales declined 0.9% for the year on an adjusted basis, it really was a year with two distinctly different halves. The first half of the year was marked by deflationary pressures across most food categories and case volumes that were negative year-over-year. Consequently, sales in the first half were down 5.7%. However, in the second half of the year, deflation moderated and turned inflationary, while case volumes began to increase year-over-year. As a result, sales in the second half of the year increased 4.1%. 
Throughout the year, we managed our cost very aggressively with particular focus on pay-related costs. At the end of the fiscal year, headcount was down 2.2%, demonstrating this progress. This is on top of the 6% reduction achieved in fiscal 2009. Our sales per employee has increased 1.3% this year and 5.7% over the last two years. We continue to implement key benefits from our various operating initiatives, which helped us leverage more of our sales to the bottom line. 
Adjusted operating expenses declined $132 million or 2.6% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily the result of more than $70 million reduction in fuel expense, a $65 million favorable change related to COLI and a $40 million decline in bad debt expense. These decreases were partially offset by a $37 million increase in company-sponsored pension expense. As a result, adjusted operating income increased $62 million or 3.3% to $1.9 billion for the fiscal year. Adjusted net earnings for fiscal 2010 were $1.2 billion, an increase of $100 million or 9.5% compared to the prior year. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.95 aided by a $0.05 tax benefit related to the company's IRS settlement announced in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and a $0.04 favorable impact from COLI. EPS in the prior year period was $1.77, which included a $0.07 negative impact from COLI. 
This is the end of our discussion of the results of operations on a non-GAAP basis. Comments from here forward in the call reflects GAAP amounts. 
Turning to a brief discussion or brief update on our business transformation initiative, the project decreased diluted EPS this fiscal year by approximately $0.02. This result is lower than the $0.03 estimate we provided on our third quarter call, due primarily to timing and our ability to capitalize more costs than anticipated. 
Turning to cash flow, cash flow from operations for the fiscal year was $885 million compared to $1.6 billion in the prior year period. Cash flow from operations in the current period was impacted by IRS settlement payments totaling $528 million and early pension contribution payments for fiscal 2011 totaling $140 million. We have now paid more than half of the total IRS settlement amount, and we'll pay approximately $212 million per year in fiscal 2011 and 2012 to the pave of our normal estimated tax payments. Due to the timing of those tax payments during our fiscal years, there is no cash impact in our first fiscal quarter of either year, $106 million cash outflow in each second quarter period and a $53 million cash flow in each of the third and fourth fiscal quarters. 
Capital expenditures totaled $157 million for the quarter and $595 million for the year, in line with our guidance. Spending for the year included investments in technology, including our business transformation project, fleet replacement, a purchase of a facility for our future shared services operations and the replacement or expansion of facilities in Vancouver, Toronto, Houston, Philadelphia and Plainfield, New Jersey. 
In July, we announced the acquisition of Lincoln Poultry & Egg Co. in an all-cash deal. Lincoln Poultry service more than 800 customers located mainly within the Central United States and generates approximately $200 million in annual revenues. We believe that their high-quality operations and strong customer relationships will be an excellent growth opportunity for Sysco. As discussed previously, we continue to be active in the acquisition market, working to identify opportunities that we believe may be a good fit for us. 
Looking ahead into next year, there are a couple of important items that we want you to keep in mind as you think about fiscal 2011. First, fiscal 2011 will be a 52-week year. The 53-week anomaly we had in fiscal 2010 occurs every six years. So the next year we have this issue again will be in fiscal year 2016. And second, we recognized certain gains during the year to be mindful of: a onetime tax benefit of $29 million in the first quarter of this year related to our IRS settlement, and $22 million in total gains related to COLI that impacted operating income throughout the year. 
In addition, we are also providing a few guidance metrics for the year ahead. We expect capital spending for fiscal 2011 to be in the range of $700 million to $750 million as we continue to invest in our business, including $160 million to $180 million of capital related to our business transformation project. We expect pension expense for the year to be approximately $60 million higher than fiscal 2010. This increase is primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to determine pension expense, which is, in turn, driven by the significant decline in long-term interest rates over the last year. Finally, we estimate the net impact of the business transformation project will reduce EPS by $0.06 to $0.09. This range is a bit lower than the projections we provided last December at our Investor Day and is primarily attributable to our ability to capitalize more of the cost of the project. 
In closing, while the business environment in fiscal 2010 was challenging, our Operating Companies did a great job of managing through those challenges with a strong focus on growing cases, reducing costs and improving productivity. That focus has continued into the new year, and we are confident that Sysco is well positioned to successfully address the new challenges and opportunities that we will experience in fiscal 2011. With that, operator, we will now take questions."

And what we're seeing out there is I think what you're seeing across all the spectrum of the economy right now is our customers are doing everything they can to improve their service to their customers, and at the same time, manage their bottom line more effectively. And part of the equation is to get more people in their restaurants, and part of it is managing costs. So we're regularly working with customers on how to do that. As I mentioned in my comments, we tend to focus largely on differentiating ourselves and giving them a lot of the value-added services that we've talked about in the past. From a pricing standpoint, I think probably about this time a year ago, it was when it really, I think, went to another level, and it continues to be quite competitive out there. So as you know and as we've talked before, the way we manage the business here is we obviously focus on the top line and we focus on the bottom line, and then we try to manage our expenses in a way that will leverage that, and at the same time, offset any gross margin pressures we may see."

This is going on three years now.  Hopefully, we're going to start seeing some improvement down there. But I can't really tell you geographically that there's a big trend or variability one way or another. As far as the customer mix, that's an interesting question because as with all numbers, whether you're talking about your earnings or your sales, your margins or your mix, you got to look at where you were last year and where you are now. So there's different views out there in terms of what the industry is seeing. I would say that we're seeing about the same performance both on the QSRs. We're seeing on, say, the meat companies is what we're seeing on the more family-oriented dining with our broadline, but for different reasons. QSR, I think, those numbers -- SYGMA's performing quite well right now. The top line comparisons are a little tougher than a year ago. On the meat company side, we've had two really, really hard years there. As you can appreciate, the bulk of that business is, at least the large percentage of it, is high end, and that's been very difficult segment of the market. Our numbers are actually starting to improve there, albeit off of two tough years. And then in the family dining, I'd say, pretty much mirrors the market. So at least from our perspective, we're not seeing a lot of changes, but part of that is the baseline."

So in fairness, is there more of that? What you described probably going on to date and there was a couple of years ago, probably. And are we dealing with it effectively, I think so.

Actual results could differ in a material manner.
Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ in a material manner from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company’s SEC filings including, but not limited to, risk factors contained in the company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 27, 2009, and in the company’s press release issued earlier this morning.
As disclosed in our earnings release this morning, our operating results this year included an extra week of operations due to the timing of the last day of our fiscal year. As a result, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 included 14 weeks of operations, compared to the fourth quarter last year, which included 13 weeks. And fiscal year 2010 included 53 weeks of operations, compared to the prior year, which included 52 weeks.
On the call today, we will discuss year-over-year comparisons that include the impact of the extra week of operations. However, to provide financial results that are more comparable on a year-over-year basis, certain metrics will be provided which remove the estimated impact of the extra week. These adjusted metrics are non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable GAAP measures on our Investor Relations website at sysco.com.
Also, all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. Lastly, we ask that you reserve December 2nd on your calendars for our Analyst Day in New York. Additional information will be provided in the next couple of weeks.

I’d like to begin this morning by recognizing our management team and all of our associates for both their commitment and hard work. They kept their full attention on servicing our customers and effectively managing expenses throughout a second consecutive challenging year.
This morning Sysco reported net earnings of $338 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. We were pleased to see case volumes once again increase year-over-year. While we have seen no consistent pattern of improvement on a week-to-week basis, we are encouraged by the fact that we have now experienced positive volume comparisons for the past several months.
In addition, we experienced food cost inflation as measured by the estimated change in our cost of goods during the fourth quarter for the first time in a year. Specifically, inflation contributed approximately 2.2% of our overall sales growth for the quarter, driven mainly by higher prices in the dairy, meat and produce categories.
I’m particularly pleased with how well our operating companies continue to manage their expenses. Along with supporting the growth of our customers, improving our operational effectiveness remains a key area of focus throughout Sysco. While industry conditions are more favorable than they were a year ago, our marketplace remains highly competitive. This environment has increased pricing pressures which we have and will continue to work through with our customers.
Specifically, we focus our efforts on differentiating our product and service offerings, more effectively utilizing our scale to better integrate our enterprise-wide capabilities and reducing our cost structure overtime. We believe that we’ve been able to take share as a result of these efforts.
Reflecting on the entire fiscal year, we sold more than $37 billion of product, shipped more than 1.2 billion cases, generated $2 billion of operating income, recognized record earnings of $1.99 per diluted share, produced cash flow from operations of $885 million and distributed $580 million of dividends to our shareholders.
Turning to our multi-year business transformation initiative for a moment, we currently have more than 300 people dedicated full-time to the project. Over the past two years, we have completed much of the design and technology development work and are currently testing systems and processes. The project that we track and we currently expect our first operating company to go live early next calendar year.
Subsequent rollouts will occur in waves of 5 to 10 operating companies through the end of 2013. This project is the single most important initiative we have undertaken since the formation of Sysco. As previously communicated, we are investing significant amounts of financial and human capital to better position Sysco for profitable sales growth for years to come. We will continue provide periodic updates as we move forward with the work.
On last quarter’s call, we discussed the new operational leadership structure we were preparing to put in place. Mike Green is now leading the U.S. Broadline companies and Larry Pulliam is overseeing Contract Sales, Sigma, Distribution Services and the Specialty companies. Additionally, we have recently realigned our U.S. Broadline leadership responsibilities into 11 geographic markets. These changes became effective with the beginning of our new fiscal year.
This new structure enhances our go-to-market strategy, allows us to more effectively implement our business transformation project, helps us develop and strengthen customer relationships across over local lines and improves our approach to building our pipeline of acquisitions. In addition, the new organization structure provides a broader platform to further develop our most talented and experienced leaders now and in future.
I would like to close my prepared comments this morning in the same manner in which I began, by thanking our 46,000 associates for their efforts and engagement over the past year. While encouraged by volume trends that continue to be favorable, we recognize that the broader economic climate may remain tenuous for some time.
Accordingly, we are committed to aggressively deploying all of Sysco’s resources and capabilities moving forward to effectively support our customers and fully realize the opportunities available to us in the $200 billion food service industry.
Now, I’ll turn things over to Chris, so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year.

189096,111541877,74844,"Sysco Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-16-2010",2010-08-16,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. What I’d like to do first this morning is provide a brief summary of the formal GAAP results. These GAAP results include the impact of the extra week of operations that Neil mentioned earlier. That means thes",1552,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. What I’d like to do first this morning is provide a brief summary of the formal GAAP results. These GAAP results include the impact of the extra week of operations that Neil mentioned earlier. That means these numbers compare 14 weeks of operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 to 13 weeks in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 53 weeks of operations in fiscal 2010 to 52 weeks in fiscal 2009.
On a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter, sales were $10.3 billion, an increase of 13.9% compared to the prior year and operating income was $584 million, an increase of 8.1% compared to the prior year. Net earnings were $338 million, an increase of 7.1% and earnings per share were $0.57, compared to $0.53 in the prior year or an increase of 7.5%.
On a GAAP basis for the year, sales were $37.2 billion, an increase of 1.1% compared to the prior year and operating income was $2 billion, an increase of 5.5% compared to the prior year. Net earnings were $1.2 billion, an increase of 11.7%. Earnings per share were $1.99 compared to $1.77 in the prior year or an increase of 12.4%.
As I mentioned, those year-over-year comparisons on a GAAP basis are not comparable because that extra week of operations in the fourth quarter impacts all the year-over-year comparison. So what I’d like to do now is discuss our results for the quarter and year excluding the impact of that extra week. That means these adjusted numbers compare 13 weeks of operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 to 13 weeks in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 52 weeks of operations in fiscal 2010 to 52 weeks in fiscal 2009. This should give you a better sense for what’s going on in our business and is the same basis the management team has been using to analyze our financial results.
On an adjusted basis for the quarter, sales increased 5.8% compared to the prior year, driven mainly by case volume growth and the impact of food cost inflation, which we estimated to be 2.2% for the period. In addition, changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by 1.3%.
Adjusted operating income was essentially flat in the fourth quarter, increasing only 0.4%. Adjusted operating expenses were higher in the fourth quarter by $76 million. The increase was primarily due to $30 million charge related to Corporate Owned Life Insurance or COLI and $29 million in higher incentive compensation expense.
Bonus accruals were lower last year in the fourth quarter because we did not meet all our 2009 performance objectives. However, based on the financial results announced today, we met certain 2010 performance objectives and have accrued for bonuses accordingly. Additionally, gross margin was slightly lower, which we largely attribute to the pricing pressure as Bill mentioned earlier.
Adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter were $314 million and were essentially flat compared to the prior year, declining less than $2 million. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.53, including a $0.02 negative impact from COLI. In the prior year period, earnings per share were also $0.53, but included a $0.03 positive impact from COLI.
Turning to the year-over-year comparisons, while sales declined 0.9% for the year on an adjusted basis, it really was a year with two distinctly different halves. The first half of the year was marked by deflationary pressures across most food categories and case volumes that were negative year-over-year. Consequently, sales in the first half were down 5.7%.
However, in the second half of the year, deflation moderated and turned inflationary while case volumes began to increase year-over-year. As a result, sales in the second half of the year increased 4.1%.
Throughout the year we managed our costs very aggressively with particular focus on pay related costs. At the end of the fiscal year, headcount was down 2.2%, demonstrating this progress. This is on top of the 6% reduction achieved in fiscal 2009.
Our sales per employee has increased 1.3% this year and 5.7% over the last two years. We continue to implement and see benefits from our various operating initiatives, which helped us leverage more of our sales to the bottom line.
Adjusted operating expenses declined $132 million or 2.6% in fiscal 2010, compared to fiscal 2009. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily the result of more than $70 million reduction in fuel expense, a $65 million favorable change related to COLI and a $40 million decline in bad debt expense.
These decreases were partially offset by a $37 million increase in company’s sponsored pension expense. As a result, adjusted operating income increased $62 million or 3.3% to $1.9 billion for the fiscal year.
Adjusted net earnings for fiscal 2010 were $1.2 billion, an increase of $100 million or 9.5% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EPS was $1.95, aided by a $0.05 tax benefit related to the company’s IRS settlement announced in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and a $0.04 favorable impact from COLI.
EPS in the prior year period was $1.77, which included a $0.07 negative impact from COLI. This is the end of our discussion of the results of operations on a non-GAAP basis. Comments from here forward in the call reflect GAAP amounts.
Turning to a brief discussion or brief update on our business transformation initiative, the project decreased diluted EPS this fiscal year by approximately $0.02. This resulted lower than the $0.03 estimate we provided on our third quarter call, due primarily to timing and our ability to capitalize more cost than anticipated.
Turning to cash flow, cash flow from operations for the fiscal year was $885 million, compared to $1.6 billion in the prior year period. Cash flow from operations in the current period was impacted by IRS settlement payment totaling $528 million and early pension contribution payment for fiscal 2011 totaling $140 million.
We now paid more than half of the total IRS settlement amount and will pay approximately $212 million per year in fiscal 2011 and 2012 to the pave of our normal estimated tax payments. Due to the timing of those tax payments during our fiscal years, there is no cash impact on our first quarter, fiscal quarter of either year, $106million cash outflow in each second quarter period and a $53 million cash flow in each of the third and fourth fiscal quarters.
Capital expenditures totaled $157 million for the quarter and $595 million for the year in line with our guidance. Spending for the year included investments in technology including our business transformation project, fleet replacement and purchase of a facility for our future shared services operation and replacement or expansion of facilities in Vancouver, Toronto, Houston, Philadelphia and Plainfield, New Jersey.
In July, we announced the acquisition of Lincoln Poultry & Egg Company in an all cash deal. Lincoln Poultry serves more than 800 customers located mainly within the central United States and generates approximately $200 million in annual revenues.
We believe that their high quality operations and strong customer relationships will be an excellent growth opportunity for Sysco. As discussed previously, we continue to be active in the acquisition market, working to identify opportunities that we believe may be a good fit for us.
Looking ahead into next year, there are a couple of important items that we want you to keep in mind as you think about fiscal 2011. First, fiscal 2011 will be a 52-week year. The 53-week anomaly we had in fiscal 2010 occurs every six years. The next year we have this issue again will be in fiscal year 2016. And second, we recognized certain gains during the year to be mindful of, a one-time tax benefit of $29 million in the first quarter of this year related to our IRS settlement and $22 million in total gains related to COLI that impacted operating income throughout the year.
In addition, we are also providing a few guidance metrics for the year ahead. We expect capital spending for fiscal 2011 to be in the range of $700 million to $750 million as we continue to invest in our business, including $160 million to $180 million of capital related to our business transformation project.
We expect pension expense for the year to be approximately $60 million higher than fiscal 2010. This increase is primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to determine pension expense, which is in turn driven by the significant decline in long-term interest rates over the last year.
Finally, we estimate the net impact of the business transformation project will reduce EPS by $0.06 to $0.09. This range is a bit lower than the projections we provided last December at our Investor Day and is primarily attributable to our ability to capitalize more of the cost of the project.
In closing, while the business environment in fiscal 2010 was challenging, our operating companies did a great job of managing through those challenges with a strong focus on growing cases, reducing costs and improving productivity. That focus has continued into the New Year and we are confident that Sysco is well positioned to successfully address the new challenges and opportunities that we will experience in fiscal 2011.
With that, operator, we will now take questions.

Yeah, it’s -- we’ve been talking about it really for the better part of a year, I guess. And what we’re seeing out there is I think what you’re seeing across all the spectrum of the economy right now. Our customers are doing everything they can to improve their service to their customers and at the same time manage their bottom line more effectively and part of the equation is to get more people in their restaurants and part of it is managing cost. So we’re regularly working with customers on how to do that.
As I mentioned in my comments, we tend to focus largely on differentiating ourselves and giving them a lot of the value added services that we talked about in the past. From a pricing standpoint, I think probably about this time a year ago was when it really I think went to another level and it continues to be quite competitive out there.
So as you know and as we’ve talked before, the way we manage the business here is we obviously focus on the top line and then we focus on the bottom line and then we try to manage our expenses in a way that will leverage that and at the same time offset any gross margin pressures we may see.

This is going on for years now. Hopefully, we’re going to start seeing some improvement down there.
But I can’t really tell you geographically that there’s a big trend or variability one way or another. As far as the customer mix, that’s an interesting question because as with all numbers, whether you’re talking about your earnings or your sales or your margins or your mix, you’ve got to look at where you were last year and where you are now. So there are different views out there in terms of what the industry is seeing. I would say that we’re seeing about the same performance both on the QSRs, we’re seeing on, say, the meat companies as what we’re seeing on the more family-oriented dining with our Broadliners but for different reasons.
QSR, I think those numbers seems to be performing quite well right now but the top line comparisons are a little tougher than a year ago. On the meat company side, we’ve had two really, really hard years there. As you can appreciate, the bulk of that business is, at least a large percentage of it is high end and that’s been very difficult segment of the market.
Our numbers are actually starting to improve there albeit off of two tough years. And then in the family dining, I’d say pretty much mirrors the market. So at least from our perspective, we’re not seeing a lot of changes but part of that is the baseline.

It’s still very tough environment out there for any business and so we spend a lot of time, invests a lot of resources both with our Street customers and our contract customers to stay close to them and understand what their needs are and try to be as proactive as we can.
So in fairness, is there more of that, what you described probably going on today than there was a couple years ago, probably, and are we dealing with it effectively? I think so. But the reality is, this business is always very competitive and the margins are relatively slim. So it’s a combination of us being proactive and then in certain situations reacting to the specific needs of our customers, which tend to be precipitated by the competition.

The point we’re trying to make there is what we haven’t seen is kind of a step-up in that rate of growth and we would like to see that but the reality is we haven’t seen that, from week to week, it will move around and that could be as simple as just how the calendar falls.
So the point we’re just trying to sensitize it to, it’s choppy but it’s definitely still positive. And to your point there are mixed messages that are coming out of the industry trade right now.

And now that sales are good and margins as face value look worse, so I’m hoping you can reconcile either the timing of all that or maybe more importantly, we’re trying to get our hands around as where this goes over the next six months, 12 months, within some of those core components, whether competitive or not but core components of your business, are there any real inflations to be watching here or is there something structurally building here before we even get to the SAP expense dollars.

I think, look, the margins are a little bit like momentum. They’re out there and so while the pressures have been out there for a year or so, it takes a while for some of that pressure to work its way through the system and even though -- let’s say half of our business is Street business and that tends to get priced on a daily or weekly basis, the other half is not. It’s contractual and those types of fluctuations tend to take a little longer to work their way through the system.
So I think part of it is a time lag that one would expect over a period of time. And then part of it is just how we manage our business. I mean, if you’re running a Sysco operating company or if you’re running Sysco, you look at your top line, you try to figure out how you’re going to grow your bottom line and we’re very focused on the fact that we know it’s competitive out there. We know we need to fight hard to continue to earn the business of our existing customers and to grow with them and hopefully attract new customers.
So I think a lot of it’s just more the environment. I can’t tell you that -- I don’t believe there’s a structural change. It’s still a relatively modest -- I think we’re off about a quarter of a point for the quarter. We’re flat for the year. But I would acknowledge, I think you could see some margin pressure here over the next couple quarters.

So I’ll echo Bill’s comment. I think the company did exactly what it needed to do, given where cases were going and where the economy was going. We cut very hard and appropriately. We started hiring MAs back because we do believe the market’s turning and we are starting to see case growth. At some point, we will have to give serious consideration to whether we start hiring back in some other areas as well to prepare ourselves for larger amounts of business and growth.

Before we begin, please note that statements made on the course of this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information concerning factors that could cause the actual results to differ in a material manner from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings including but not limited to risk factors contained in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 27, 2009, and in the company's press release issued earlier this morning. 
As disclosed in our earnings release this morning, our operating results this year included an extra week of operations due to the timing of the last day of our fiscal year. As a result, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 included 14 weeks of operations compared to the fourth quarter last year, which included 13 weeks. And fiscal year 2010 included 53 weeks of operations compared to the prior year, which included 52 weeks. On the call today, we will discuss year-over-year comparisons that include the impact of the extra week of operations. 
However, to provide financial results that are more comparable on a year-over-year basis, certain metrics will be provided, which removed the estimated impact of the extra week. These adjusted metrics are non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable GAAP measures on our Investor Relations website at sysco.com. Also, all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. Lastly, we ask that you reserve December 2 on your calendars for our Analyst Day in New York. Additional information will be provided in the next couple of weeks. 
With that out of the way, I'll turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney."

I'd like to begin this morning by recognizing our management team and all of our associates for both their commitment and hard work. They kept their full attention in servicing our customers and effectively managing expenses throughout a second consecutive challenging year. 
This morning, Sysco reported net earnings of $338 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. We are pleased to see case lines once again increase year-over-year. While we have seen no consistent pattern of improvement on a week-to-week basis, we are encouraged by the fact that we have now experienced positive line comparisons through the past several months. In addition, we experienced food cost inflation as measured by the estimated change in our cost of goods during the fourth quarter for the first time in a year. Specifically, inflation contributed approximately 2.2% of our overall sales growth for the quarter, driven mainly by higher prices in the dairy, meat and produce categories. 
I am particularly pleased with how well our operating companies continue to manage their expenses. Along with supporting the growth of our customers, improving our operational effectiveness remains a key area of focus throughout Sysco. While industry conditions are more favorable than they were a year ago, our marketplace remains highly competitive. This environment has increased pricing pressures, which we have and will continue to work through with our customers. Specifically, we focus our efforts on differentiating our product and service offerings, more effectively utilizing our scale to better integrate our enterprise-wide capabilities and reducing our cost structure over time. We believe that we've been able to take share as a result of these efforts. 
Reflecting on the entire fiscal year, we sold more than $37 billion of product, shipped more than 1.2 billion cases, generated $2 billion of operating income, recognized record earnings of $1.99 per diluted share, produced cash flow from operations of $885 million and distributed $580 million of dividends to our shareholders. 
Turning to our multi-year business transformation initiative for a moment, we currently have more than 300 people dedicated full time to the project. Over the past two years, we have completed much of the design and technology development work and are currently testing systems and processes. The project remains on track, and we currently expect our first operating company to go live early next calendar year. Subsequent rollouts will occur in ways of five to 10 operating companies through the end of 2013. This project is the single most important initiative we have undertaken since the formation of Sysco. As previously communicated, we are investing significant amounts of financial and human capital to better position Sysco for profitable sales growth for years to come. We will continue to provide periodic updates as we move forward with the work. 
On last quarter's call, we discussed the new operational leadership structure we were preparing to put in place. Mike Green is now leading the U.S. Broadline companies, and Larry Pulliam is overseeing contract sales, SYGMA, distribution services and the specialty companies. Additionally, we have recently realigned our U.S. Broadline leadership responsibilities into 11 geographic markets. These changes became effective with the beginning of our new fiscal year. This new structure enhances our go-to-market strategy, allows us to more effectively implement our business transformation project, helps us develop and strengthen customer relationships across over local lines and improves our approach to building a pipeline of acquisitions. In addition, the new organization structure provides a broader platform to further develop our most talented and experienced leaders now and in the future. 
I would like to close my prepared comments this morning in the same manner which I began by thanking our 46,000 associates for their efforts and engagement over the past year. While encouraged by volume trends that continue to be favorable, we recognize that the broader economic climate may remain tenuous for some time. Accordingly, we are committed to aggressively deploying all of Sysco's resources and capabilities moving forward to effectively support our customers and fully realize the opportunities available to us in the $200 billion foodservice industry. Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year."
189096,111541877,74849,"Sysco Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-16-2010",2010-08-16,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. What I'd like to do first this morning is provide a brief summary of the formal GAAP results. These GAAP results include the impact of the extra week of operations that Neil mentioned earlier. That means these",1552,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. What I'd like to do first this morning is provide a brief summary of the formal GAAP results. These GAAP results include the impact of the extra week of operations that Neil mentioned earlier. That means these numbers compare 14 weeks of operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 to 13 weeks in the fourth quarter of 2009, and 53 weeks of operations in fiscal 2010 to 52 weeks in fiscal 2009. 
On a GAAP basis, for the fourth quarter, sales were $10.3 billion, an increase of 13.9% compared to the prior year. And operating income was $584 million, an increase of 8.1% compared to the prior year. Net earnings were $338 million, an increase of 7.1%, and earnings per share were $0.57 compared to $0.53 in the prior year or an increase of 7.5%.  
On a GAAP basis, for the year, sales were $37.2 billion, an increase of 1.1% compared to the prior year. And operating income was $2 billion, an increase of 5.5% compared to the prior year. Net earnings were $1.2 billion, an increase of 11.7%. Earnings per share were $1.99 compared with $1.77 in the prior year or an increase of 12.4%. 
As I mentioned, those year-over-year comparisons on a GAAP basis are not comparable because that extra week of operations in the fourth quarter impacts all the year-over-year comparisons. So what I'd like to do now is discuss our results for the quarter and the year, excluding the impact of that extra week. That means these adjusted numbers compare 13 weeks of operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 to 13 weeks in the fourth quarter of 2009, and 52 weeks of operations in fiscal 2010 to 52 weeks in fiscal 2009. This should give you a better sense for what's going on in our business, and it's the same basis that the management team has been using to analyze our financial results. 
On an adjusted basis for the quarter, sales increased 5.8% compared to the prior year, driven mainly by case volume growth and the impact of food cost inflation, which we estimated to be 2.2% for the period. In addition, changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by 1.3%. 
Adjusted operating income was essentially flat in the fourth quarter, increasing only 0.4%. Adjusted operating expenses were higher in the fourth quarter by $76 million. The increase was primarily due to a $30-million charge related to corporate-owned life insurance, or COLI, and $29 million in higher incentive compensation expense. 
Bonus accruals were lower last year in the fourth quarter because we did not meet all our 2009 performance objectives. However, based on the financial results announced today, we met certain 2010 performance objectives and have accrued for bonuses accordingly. Additionally, gross margin was slightly lower, which we largely attribute to the pricing pressures Bill mentioned earlier. 
Adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter were $314 million and were essentially flat compared to the prior year, declining less than $2 million. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.53, including a $0.02 negative impact from COLI. In the prior year period, earnings per share were also $0.53, but included a $0.03 positive impact from COLI. 
Turning to the year-over-year comparison. While sales declined 0.9% for the year on an adjusted basis, it really was a year with two distinctly different halves. The first half of the year was marked by deflationary pressures across most food categories and case volumes that were negative year-over-year. Consequently, sales in the first half were down 5.7%. However, in the second half of the year, deflation moderated and turned inflationary, while case volumes began to increase year-over-year. As a result, sales in the second half of the year increased 4.1%. 
Throughout the year, we managed our cost very aggressively with particular focus on pay-related costs. At the end of the fiscal year, headcount was down 2.2%, demonstrating this progress. This is on top of the 6% reduction achieved in fiscal 2009. Our sales per employee has increased 1.3% this year and 5.7% over the last two years. We continue to implement and see benefits from our various operating initiatives, which helped us leverage more of our sales to the bottom line. 
Adjusted operating expenses declined $132 million or 2.6% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily the result of more than $70 million reduction in fuel expense, a $65 million favorable change related to COLI and a $40 million decline in bad debt expense. These decreases were partially offset by a $37 million increase in company-sponsored pension expense. As a result, adjusted operating income increased $62 million or 3.3% to $1.9 billion for the fiscal year. Adjusted net earnings for fiscal 2010 were $1.2 billion, an increase of $100 million or 9.5% compared to the prior year. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.95, aided by a $0.05 tax benefit related to the company's IRS settlement announced in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and a $0.04 favorable impact from COLI. EPS from the prior year period was $1.77, which included a $0.07 negative impact from COLI.  
This is the end of our discussion of the results of operations on a non-GAAP basis. Comments from here forward in the call reflects GAAP amounts. 
Turning to a brief discussion or brief update on our business transformation initiative, the project decreased diluted EPS this fiscal year by approximately $0.02. This result is lower than the $0.03 estimate we provided on our third quarter call, due primarily to timing and our ability to capitalize more costs than anticipated. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the fiscal year was $885 million compared to $1.6 billion in the prior year period. Cash flow from operations in the current period was impacted by IRS settlement payments totaling $528 million and early pension contribution payments for fiscal 2011 totaling $140 million. 
We have now paid more than half of the total IRS settlement amount, and we'll pay approximately $212 million per year in fiscal 2011 and 2012 to be paid with our normal estimated tax payments. Due to the timing of those tax payments during our fiscal years, there is no cash impact in our first fiscal quarter of either year, $106 million cash outflow in each second quarter period and a $53 million cash flow in each of the third and fourth fiscal quarters. 
Capital expenditures totaled $157 million for the quarter and $595 million for the year, in line with our guidance. Spending for the year included investments in technology, including our business transformation project, fleet replacement, a purchase of a facility for our future shared services operations and the replacement or expansion of facilities in Vancouver, Toronto, Houston, Philadelphia and Plainfield, New Jersey. 
In July, we announced the acquisition of Lincoln Poultry & Egg Co. in an all-cash deal. Lincoln Poultry service more than 800 customers located mainly within the Central United States and generates approximately $200 million in annual revenues. We believe that their high-quality operations and strong customer relationships will be an excellent growth opportunity for Sysco. As discussed previously, we continue to be active in the acquisition market, working to identify opportunities that we believe may be a good fit for us. 
Looking ahead into next year, there are a couple of important items that we want you to keep in mind as you think about fiscal 2011. First, fiscal 2011 will be a 52-week year. The 53-week anomaly we had in fiscal 2010 occurs every six years. So the next year we have this issue again will be in fiscal year 2016. And second, we recognized certain gains during the year to be mindful of: a onetime tax benefit of $29 million in the first quarter of this year related to our IRS settlement and $22 million in total gains related to COLI that impacted operating income throughout the year. 
In addition, we are also providing a few guidance metrics for the year ahead. We expect capital spending for fiscal 2011 to be in the range of $700 million to $750 million as we continue to invest in our business, including $160 million to $180 million of capital related to our business transformation project. 
We expect pension expense for the year to be approximately $60 million higher than fiscal 2010. This increase is primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to determine pension expense, which is, in turn, driven by the significant decline in long-term interest rates over the last year. 
Finally, we estimate the net impact of the business transformation project will reduce EPS by $0.06 to $0.09. This range is a bit lower than the projections we provided last December at our Investor Day and is primarily attributable to our ability to capitalize more of the cost of the project. 
In closing, while the business environment in fiscal 2010 was challenging, our operating companies did a great job of managing through those challenges with a strong focus on growing cases, reducing costs and improving productivity. That focus has continued into the new year, and we are confident that Sysco is well positioned to successfully address the new challenges and opportunities that we will experience in fiscal 2011. 
With that, operator, we will now take questions."

And what we're seeing out there is I think what you're seeing across all the spectrum of the economy right now is our customers are doing everything they can to improve their service to their customers, and at the same time, manage their bottom line more effectively. And part of the equation is to get more people in their restaurants, and part of it is managing costs. So we're regularly working with customers on how to do that. As I mentioned in my comments, we tend to focus largely on differentiating ourselves and giving them a lot of the value-added services that we've talked about in the past. From a pricing standpoint, I think probably about this time a year ago, it was when it really, I think, went to another level, and it continues to be quite competitive out there. So as you know and as we've talked before, the way we manage the business here is we obviously focus on the top line and we focus on the bottom line, and then we try to manage our expenses in a way that will leverage that, and at the same time, offset any gross margin pressures we may see."

This is going on three years now.  Hopefully, we're going to start seeing some improvement down there. But I can't really tell you geographically that there's a big trend or variability one way or another. As far as the customer mix, that's an interesting question because as with all numbers, whether you're talking about your earnings or your sales, your margins or your mix, you got to look at where you were last year and where you are now. So there's different views out there in terms of what the industry is seeing. I would say that we're seeing about the same performance both on the QSRs. We're seeing on, say, the meat companies is what we're seeing on the more family-oriented dining with our broadline, but for different reasons. QSR, I think, those numbers -- SYGMA's performing quite well right now. The top line comparisons are a little tougher than a year ago. On the meat company side, we've had two really, really hard years there. As you can appreciate, the bulk of that business is, at least the large percentage of it, is high end, and that's been very difficult segment of the market. Our numbers are actually starting to improve there, albeit off of two tough years. And then in the family dining, I'd say, pretty much mirrors the market. So at least from our perspective, we're not seeing a lot of changes, but part of that is the baseline."

So in fairness, is there more of that? What you described probably going on to date and there was a couple of years ago, probably. And are we dealing with it effectively, I think so.

I accept the question. I think what the margins are a little bit like momentum. I mean, they're out there and so while the pressures have been out there for a year or so, it takes a while for some of that pressure to work its way through the system. And even though, let's say, half of our business is Street business and that tends to get price on a daily or weekly basis. The other half is not, it's contractual and those types of fluctuations tend to take a little longer to work their way through the system. So I think part of it is just a time lag that one would expect over a period of time. And then Jay, part of it is just -- it's how we manage our business. I mean if you run a Sysco operating company, if you run Sysco, you look at your top line, you try to figure out how you're going to grow your bottom line. And we're very focused on the fact that we know it's competitive out there, we know we need to fight hard to continue to earn the business of our existing customers and to grow with them and, hopefully, attract new customers. So I think it's -- a lot of it is just more the environment. I can't tell you. I don't believe there's a structural change.

189096,115173876,86381,"Sysco Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2010",2010-11-08,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported net earnings of $299 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Our sales in the first quarter increased 7.4%, driven mainly by increased case volume and estimated food cost inflation o",759,"Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported net earnings of $299 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Our sales in the first quarter increased 7.4%, driven mainly by increased case volume and estimated food cost inflation of 3.3%.
Case volume was higher across all regions in our Broadline and SYGMA segments, and the year-over-year increase represented the strongest improvement since the second quarter of fiscal 2007. While the pace of the macroeconomic recovery remains sluggish and restaurant traffic patterns continue to be under pressure, recent data suggests the industry is slowly recovering. Sysco's gradual but consistent improvement in case volume confirms this trend and we believe we are continuing to grow our market share.
We are pleased with our sales growth for the quarter, and I should also note that we achieved record first quarter operating income. Nevertheless, operating income growth over the prior year was less than our sales increase as improved expense management was more than offset by a 46 basis point decline in gross margin percent.
Several factors contributed to the decline in gross margins. Approximately 10 points of the margin decline related to a change in business mix. While both our Broadline and SYGMA businesses grew this quarter, segment grew at a faster rate, and since SYGMA operates lower margin business, this mix shift impacted total margins. We do not view this as a negative outcome. As a matter fact, we see a great deal of opportunity on the contract side of the business, both in the Broadline and SYGMA segments. The key is to strike an appropriate balance between street and contract sales growths over time.
The remainder of the gross margin decline was split about evenly between two drivers. The first is a set of ongoing strategic pricing initiatives designed to drive volume increases in targeted categories. While these initiatives are putting near-term pressure on our margins, we are starting to see double-digit volume increases for these programs have been effectively implemented. We expect this specific pressure on gross margins will persist in the near term, but we also believe these initiatives will result in profitable market share gains over time.
The last component of the gross margin decline relates to the significant rates of inflation in the meat, dairy and seafood categories, which together, approached 10%. While we typically are able to pass through modest levels of price inflation on a timely basis, it is more difficult in the short term to pass through double digit price increases to our customers without negatively impacting their business. 
Our ongoing productivity initiatives help to mitigate a portion of the gross margin pressure with U.S. Broadline warehouse cases per man-hour and cases per trip increasing compared to last year's first quarter. In addition, total sales per employee also increased year-over-year.
All that said, while operating performance in the first quarter is acceptable, it is not up to our standards. We recently held our annual senior leadership meeting at which the importance of profitable sales growth was clearly discussed. Our management team understands that we must find ways to grow earnings faster than sales during these challenging times.
Turning to our multiyear business transformation initiative for a moment, the project remains on track. We are preparing to begin the last of our four cycles of testing prior to go live at our pilot facility early next year. We are also beginning to staff Sysco Business Services and have recently named Kirk Drummond to lead this strategically important part of our business. Kirk has been with Sysco for the last 24 years, working in various capacities at our local operating companies and the corporate, including five years as our Chief Information Officer and the last five years as our Senior Vice President and Treasurer. This organization will centralize back office administrative functions such as accounting, receivables, payables, billing and call center support. 
I'd like to close by thanking our associates and our management team for their ongoing contributions and commitment to Sysco's success. This is an exciting time in our company's history and our associates continue to deliver a high level of service and support to our customers. While our businesses face uncertain challenges, we remain dedicated to being our customers' most valued business partner and to invest in the future growth of Sysco. We know this focus strengthens our competitive position and provides a strong foundation for success over the long term. 
Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the quarter."
189096,115173876,86381,"Sysco Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2010",2010-11-08,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter, sales were $9.8 million or an increase of 7.4% compared to the prior year, driven mainly by case volume growth and the impact of food cost inflation, which we estimate to be 3.3% for the",651,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter, sales were $9.8 million or an increase of 7.4% compared to the prior year, driven mainly by case volume growth and the impact of food cost inflation, which we estimate to be 3.3% for the period. In addition, acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 0.6%, and changes in foreign exchange rate increased sales by 0.5%. 
Operating income increased $9 million or 1.8% to $506 million during the quarter. While sales increased 7.4%, gross margin increased only 4.8% and operating expense increased 6%. 
Operating expense increased $75 million for the quarter due to three main drivers. First, salaries and related expense increased approximately $40 million, primarily from increased case volume during the quarter, including increased commissions and incentives and delivery personnel cost. Total headcount was down very slightly compared to the prior year, meaning we held our headcount levels relatively steady despite increased case volume. While total headcount is down, we've increased MA headcount over the last year. It typically takes one to two years for an MA to be fully productive within the sales organization, but we consider this investment in the business to be an important one that will enhance our ability to grow sales as the industry recovers and continue to take market share.
Second, as we had discussed on last quarter's call, pension expense increased by $15 million year-over-year. Lastly, operating expense included a $14 million benefit from the impact of Corporate-Owned Life Insurance, or COLI, which is an unfavorable comparison to the $21 million benefit we recorded in the prior year.
Net earnings for the first quarter were $299 million, declining $27 million or 8.3% compared to the prior year. Net earnings reflected $39 million year-over-year increase in tax expense, primarily due to the IRS settlement gain and higher non-taxable COLI gains recorded in the prior year. Excluding the impact of COLI in both periods and the IRS settlement gain, net earnings for the quarter as adjusted would have increased 3.4%. In addition, the $15 million year-over-year increase in pension expense impacted net earnings by another 2.8 percentage points.
Earnings per share declined 7.3% to $0.51, which included a $0.02 benefit from COLI. In the prior year period, earnings per share were $0.55 and included a $0.05 gain related to the IRS settlement and a $0.04 benefit from COLI.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the fiscal year was $227 million compared to $42 million in the prior year. Cash flow from operations increased year-over-year due mainly to the timing of our IRS settlement payments. During the first quarter of this year, we had no settlement payments. However, in the prior year period, we paid $316 million. We expect to pay a total of $212 million in settlement payments during this fiscal year and again, next year. As a reminder, these scheduled payments included $106 million cash outflow in the second quarter period and a $53 million cash outflow in the third and fourth fiscal quarters.
Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted during the quarter by an increase in accounts receivable and a decline in accrued expense. Receivables increased due to the higher sales during the period, and the decline in accrued expenses this quarter was due mainly to the payment of incentive compensation related to the prior fiscal year. 
Capital expenditures totaled $143 million for the quarter, including facility expansion and replacement, fleet replacements and investments in technology, including our business transformation project.
In closing, while the business environment remains challenging, we are seeing improvements and our operating companies continue to have a strong focus on growing cases, controlling costs, improving productivity and successfully implementing our business transformation. As a result, we are confident that Sysco is well positioned to take advantage of the economic recovery as it takes hold. 
With that, operator, we will now take questions."

But as far as the strategic price investments that I think you cited in your press release, it seems, at least to me, a little bit unprecedented for Sysco to have to resort to discounting based on where you guys have typically gone to market. So can you just talk about how far reaching these price investments are going to be over the rest of the year? And if you had to quantify, how much of the 46 basis point decline was driven by a price investments in this last quarter? Is that something that you can qualify at all?"

So to repeat, of the 46 basis point decline, we think about 10 of that is a business mix of SYGMA versus the Broadline, so that leaves you over a third of a point of margin decline. And our best estimate is about half of that is we would attribute to pretty significant inflation in those three categories I mentioned: meat, dairy and seafood. And the other half, too, I don't know that I would call it discounting or pricing so much. What we would characterize it, as what we said, is strategic category initiatives where we see opportunities, Ajay, where we're somewhat under penetrated and we think it's appropriate for us to get a little more focused and give a little more finely priced in those categories. So we've been into this year for a few months and I will expect it to continue here over a good portion of the balance of the year. But it's not a random type of thing. It's distinct categories, and we're doing it in different parts of the country and over time throughout the country. And again, I would expect us to maybe not in 12 months but over a reasonable period of time see a payback there on the sales month."

We're fine with the quarter. As I said, it was acceptable. These are very interesting times, in addition to being exciting times. So you got a situation out here where a year ago, we had about three and a half points and deflation cases were going the wrong way. A year later, we're seeing just the opposite amount of inflation, and we're encouraged by the case growth. So if you look at it on a customer standpoint, our customer standpoint, if you go back three years, we've been through an environment of two years of pretty significant inflation, a third year of deflation and now we're into our fourth year here where inflation is picking up in these certain categories. So I'm not saying that we should have done better. I'm really just saying we need to do better going forward, and our folks understand that. In terms of how you manage that, essentially, you manage it territory by territory, account by account and you look at each situation, and you're always getting an eye on the operating company level. You're always trying to strike the right balance of between opportunities for growth and opportunities to more effectively, more productively serve these accounts with the reality that our customers are running the business as well, and we need to be sensitive to what their high-cost items are and what their key concerns are. So that's why we have 8,000 commissioned salespeople out there, that's why we have presidents in all these operating companies is to make those decisions on an account by account basis and overall, from an enterprise standpoint, we try to give them good guidance and feedback. And then the contract side of the business, the inflation, as we've talked before, impacts a little different. Most of the categories are contractually went to some type of pricing mechanism. And they're typically is up to a 30-day time lag from the time that the pie comes in to when the prices roll. So it depends on whether it's street business or contract business."

So while we've outlined all the cost and the way we've been doing that is incremental net of benefits, we really don't start seeing significant benefits until fiscal 2013. And in that year, our current estimates again, it'll be updated in December but what we showed you at December was the benefits would offset the cost in 2013, so it'd about breakeven that year and then thereafter, of course, we keep more benefits than costs."

Now we're finally starting to see some case growth and we think the industry's showing a little bit signs of recovery. But there's still a lot of sensitivity out there at the operators side, on the distributors side in terms of growth and how we continue to advance the ball in our respective businesses. So this favorable turn, albeit modest turn, let's be clear, we're talking about maybe 2% or 3% growth in our line of business. We're not talking 7% or 8% growth real growth.

So it's essentially what I was talking about earlier, which is looking at each customer, each territory, each operating company and just making good decisions on striking the right balance for in terms of what the customers acute needs are and where we need and how that translates into moving boxes versus price versus cost efficiency. So I'm going to just leave it at focused internally where we think we can do better than what we have, and I expect that we will over time."

This morning Sysco reported net earnings of $299 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Our sales in the first quarter increased 7.4%, driven mainly by increased case volume and estimated food cost inflation",759,"Thanks Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning Sysco reported net earnings of $299 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Our sales in the first quarter increased 7.4%, driven mainly by increased case volume and estimated food cost inflation of 3.3%.
Case volume was higher across all regions in our Broadline and SYGMA segments and the year-over-year increased represented the strongest improvement since the second quarter of fiscal 2007.
While the pace of the macroeconomic recovery remains sluggish and restaurant traffic patterns continue to be under pressure, recent data suggests the industry is slowly recovering. Sysco’s gradual but consistent improvement in case volume confirms this trend and we believe we are continuing to grow our market share.
We are pleased with our sales growth for the quarter and I should also note that we achieved record first quarter operating income. Nevertheless operating income growth over the prior year was less than our sales increase as improved expense management was more than offset by a 46 basis point decline in gross margin percent.
Several factors contributed to the decline in gross margins. Approximately 10 points of the margin decline related to a change in business mix. While both our Broadline and SYGMA businesses grew this quarter, SYGMA grew at a faster rate and since SYGMA operates a lower margin business, this mix shift impacted total margins.
We do not view this as a negative outcome. As a matter of fact, we see a great deal of opportunity on the contract side of the business, both from the Broadline and SYGMA segments. The key is to strike an appropriate balance between street and contract sales growth over time.
The remainder of the gross margin decline was split about evenly between two drivers. The first is a set of ongoing strategic pricing initiatives designed to drive volume increases in targeted categories.
While these initiatives are putting near-term pressure on our margins, we are starting to see double-digit volume increases where these programs have been effectively implemented. We expect this specific pressure on gross margins will persist in the near-term, but we also believe these initiatives will result in profitable market share gains over time.
The last component of the gross margin decline relates to the significant raise of inflation in the meat, dairy and sea food categories which together approached 10%. While we typically are able to pass through modest levels of price inflation on a timely basis, it is more difficult in the short-term to pass through double digit price increases to our customers without negatively impacting their business.
Our ongoing productivity initiatives helped to mitigate a portion of the gross margin pressure with U.S. Broadline warehouse cases per man hour and cases per trip increasing compared to last year’s first quarter. In addition, total sales per employee also increased year-over-year.
All that said, while operating performance in the first quarter is acceptable, it’s not up to our standards. We recently held our annual senior leadership meeting at which the importance of profitable sales growth was thoroughly discussed. Our management team understands that we must find ways to grow our earnings faster than sales during these challenging times.
Turning to our multi-year business transformation initiative for a moment, the project remains on track. We are preparing to begin the last of our four cycles of testing prior to go live with our pilot facility early next year.
We’re also beginning to staff Sysco business services and have recently named Kirk Drummond to lead this strategically important part of our business. Kirk has been with Sysco for the last 24 years working in various capacities at our local operating companies and at corporate including five years as our Chief Information Officer and the last five years as our Senior Vice President and Treasurer.
This organization will centralize back office administrative functions such accounting, receivables, payables, billing and call center support.
I’d like to close by thanking our associates and our management team for their ongoing contributions and commitment to Sysco’s success. This is an excitement time in our company’s history and our associates continue to deliver a high level service and support to our customers.
While our business is facing certain challenges, we remain dedicated to being our customers’ most valued business partner and to investing in the future growth of Sysco. We know this focus strengthens our competitive position and provides the strong foundation for success over the long-term.
Now, I’ll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the quarter.

For the first quarter, sales were $9.8 billion, or an increase of 7.4% compared to the prior year, driven mainly by case volume growth and the impact of food cost inflation which we estimate to be 3.3% for the period.
In addition, acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 0.6% and changes in foreign exchange rate increased sales by 0.5%.
Operating income increased $9 million or 1.8% to $506 million during the quarter. While sales increased 7.4%, gross margin increased only 4.8% and operating expense increased 6%.
Operating expense increased $75 million for the quarter due to three main drivers. First, salaries and related expense increased approximately $40 million, primarily from increased case volume during the quarter, including increased commissions and incentives and delivery personnel costs.
Total headcount was down very slightly compared to the prior year, meaning we held our headcount levels relatively steady despite increased case volume. While total headcount is down, we’ve increased MA headcount over the last year.
It typically takes one year to two years for an MA to be fully productive within the sales organization, but we consider this investment in the business to be an important one that will enhance our ability to grow sales as the industry recovers and continue to take market share.
Second, as we had discussed on last quarter’s call, pension expense increased by $15 million year-over-year. Lastly, operating expense included a $14 million benefit from the impact of Corporate Owned Life Insurance or COLI, which is an unfavorable comparison to the $21 million benefit we recorded in the prior year.
Net earnings for the first quarter were $299 million, declining $27 million or 8.3% compared to the prior year. Net earnings reflect a $39 million year-over-year increase in tax expense, primarily due to the IRS settlement gain and higher non-taxable COLI gains recorded in the prior year.
Excluding the impact of COLI in both periods and the IRS settlement gain, net earnings for the quarter as adjusted would have increased 3.4%. In addition the $15 million year-over-year increase in pension expense impacted net earnings by another 2.8 percentage points.
Earnings per share declined 7.3% to $0.51, which included a $0.02 benefit from COLI. In the prior year period, earnings per share were $0.55, and included a $0.05 gain related to the IRS settlement and a $0.04 benefit from COLI.
Turning to cash flow; cash flow from operations for the fiscal year was $227 million compared to $42 million in the prior year. Cash flow from operations increased year-over-year due mainly to the timing of our IRS settlement payments. During the first quarter of this year we had no settlement payments, however in the prior year period we paid $316 million.
We expect to pay a total of $212 million in settlement payments during this fiscal year and again next year. As a reminder, these scheduled payments include $106 million cash outflow in the second quarter period and a $53 million cash outflow in the third and fourth fiscal quarters.
Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted during the quarter by an increase in accounts receivable and a decline in accrued expense. Receivables increased due to higher sales during the period, and the decline in accrued expenses this quarter was due mainly to the payment of incentive compensation related to the prior fiscal year.
Capital expenditures totaled $143 million for the quarter including facility expansion and replacement, fleet replacements, and investments in technology including our business transformation project.
In closing, while the business environment remains challenging, we’re seeing improvements and our operating companies continue to have a strong focus on growing cases, controlling costs, improving productivity, and successfully implementing our business transformation. As a result, we are confident that Sysco is well positioned to take advantage of the economic recovery as it takes hold.
With that operator, we will now take questions.

So can you just talk about how far reaching these price investments are going to be over the rest of the year, and if you had to quantify how much of the 46 basis point decline was driven by price investments in this last quarter, is that something that you can quantify at all?

I mentioned meat, dairy and seafood, and the other half I don’t know I’d call discounting or pricing so much as what we would characterize is as what we said is strategic category initiatives.
Where we see opportunities, Ajay, where we are somewhat underpenetrated and we think it’s appropriate for us to get a little more focused and get a little more finely priced in those categories. So we’ve been into this year for a few months and I would expect that to continue here over a good portion of the balance of the year, but it’s not a random type of thing. Its distinct categories and we’re doing it in different parts of the country and over time throughout the country, and again, I would expect us to maybe not in 12 months, but over a reasonable period of time see it pay back there on the sales line.

If you look at it from our customer standpoint, if you go back three years we’ve been through an environment of two years of pretty significant inflation, a third year deflation, and now we’re into our fourth year here where inflation is picking up in these certain categories. So I’m not saying that we should have done better, I’m really just saying we need to do better going forward and our folks to understand that.
In terms of how you manage that, essentially you manage it territory by territory, account by account, and you look at each situation and you’re always getting an eye at the operating company level, you’re always trying to strike the right balance between opportunities for growth and opportunities to more effectively, more productively service these accounts with the reality that our customers are running a business as well and we need to be sensitive to what their higher cost items are and what their key concerns are. That’s why we have 8,000 commission sales people out there, that’s why we have Presidents in all these operating companies as to make those decisions on an account by account basis, and overall from an enterprise standpoint we try to give them good guidance and feedback.
And then on the contract side of the business, the inflation as we’ve talked before impacts a little different, most of the categories are contractually linked to some type of pricing mechanism, and there typically is up to a 30-day time lag from the time the products comes in to when the prices roll. So it depends on whether its street business or contract business.

It will definitely help us on the street side in terms of I think our sales people having better tools to work with, as well as our customers, and over time allowing our customers to participate I think more actively in what level of service the wanted, what types of price points, the whole channel opportunity there.
On the contract side, we are starting to see this already, but to your point, I think we’ll see it more as we have better data and more integrated systems. Our big opportunity on the contract side is to create a more consistent face to the customer of all Sysco’s capabilities. So when you hear us speak about more effectively integrating our capabilities we’re talking about both on the merchandising and the sales side as well as across all of our different businesses, SYGMA, FreshPoint, Meat Company, Guest Supply, all those types of things. So I think the biggest opportunity on the contract side is just from an enterprise standpoint being able to go after this business more cohesively and that’s what we are looking forward to there.

That’s the schedule of numbers that we put up back in December at the Investor Day meeting, which we’ll update for you this December at the same time.
So while we’ve outlined all the costs and the way we’ve been doing that is incremental net of benefits. You really don’t start seeing significant benefits until fiscal 2013, and in that year our current estimates again will be updated in December, but what we showed you last December was the benefits would offset the costs in 2013. So, it’d be about break even in that year, and then thereafter of course we’d see more benefits than costs.

We need to put this in some type of context, this industry has always been highly competitive, there is a lot of competitors out there, there is lot of different people with different business models and different agenda, there is always competition.
I think maybe to your point we’re in a inflection point now and the cycle I was trying to describe earlier is, if you look at it over three year period I am no food services story, but I don’t know that we’ve ever had a three year period like this, where we had two years of lot of inflation and put lot of pressure on our customers, then you have a year of deflation. Now we’re finally starting to see some case growth and we think the industry has shown a little good signs of recovery, but there’s still a lot of sensitivity out there at the operator side and the distributor side in terms of growth and how we continue to based upon our respective businesses.
So this favorable turn reminds us, let’s be clear we’re talking about may be 2% or 3% growth in our line of business. We’re not talking 7% or 8% real growth. So I think it’s still very, very competitive out there and I think people’s memories are a long right now and everyone is doing everything that he can to not just improve their business but to be prepared for any surprises that come down right here over the next six months to 12 months.

But we certainly think that we’ve taken, improved our share of wallet, and taken share for that matter in all segments. So I think what’s helped us a little bit in the overall numbers relative to the restaurant numbers is about 30% of our business or a little bit more than that, 35% I guess, is non-restaurant business.

Bob, we here just talked about productivity improvements, we’re pleased, and we continue to be pleased with what we’re seeing on the operational side of the business as well as on the admin side now.
But one thing we have done and we talked about this, and we’ll continue to do is we have more aggressively invested in our sales force here over the last six months or so and those numbers are beginning to populate themselves both in terms of the numbers of MAs on the street as well as trainee. So that does translate into higher commissions with the sales growth and into higher fixed investment on the selling payroll side as we try to get back on track in terms of our headcount in sales.
Without being real specific here, I am just trying to bifurcate that for you in terms of we’re pleased with what we’re seeing operationally on the admin side in terms of productivity, but we are investing in sales folks, and have been over the three to six months. Chris, do you wanted to?

189096,115173876,86423,"Sysco Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2010",2010-11-08,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported net earnings of $299 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Our sales in the first quarter increased 7.4%, driven mainly by increased case volume and estimated food cost inflation o",759,"Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported net earnings of $299 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Our sales in the first quarter increased 7.4%, driven mainly by increased case volume and estimated food cost inflation of 3.3%.
Case volume was higher across all regions in our Broadline and SYGMA segments, and the year-over-year increase represented the strongest improvement since the second quarter of fiscal 2007. While the pace of the macroeconomic recovery remains sluggish and restaurant traffic patterns continue to be under pressure, recent data suggests the industry is slowly recovering. Sysco's gradual but consistent improvement in case volume confirms this trend and we believe we are continuing to grow our market share.
We are pleased with our sales growth for the quarter, and I should also note that we achieved record first quarter operating income. Nevertheless, operating income growth over the prior year was less than our sales increase as improved expense management was more than offset by a 46 basis point decline in gross margin percent.
Several factors contributed to the decline in gross margins. Approximately 10 points of the margin decline related to a change in business mix. While both our Broadline and SYGMA businesses grew this quarter, segment grew at a faster rate, and since SYGMA operates lower margin business, this mix shift impacted total margins. We do not view this as a negative outcome. As a matter fact, we see a great deal of opportunity on the contract side of the business, both in the Broadline and SYGMA segments. The key is to strike an appropriate balance between street and contract sales growths over time.
The remainder of the gross margin decline was split about evenly between two drivers. The first is a set of ongoing strategic pricing initiatives designed to drive volume increases in targeted categories. While these initiatives are putting near-term pressure on our margins, we are starting to see double-digit volume increases for these programs have been effectively implemented. We expect this specific pressure on gross margins will persist in the near term, but we also believe these initiatives will result in profitable market share gains over time.
The last component of the gross margin decline relates to the significant rates of inflation in the meat, dairy and seafood categories, which together, approached 10%. While we typically are able to pass through modest levels of price inflation on a timely basis, it is more difficult in the short term to pass through double digit price increases to our customers without negatively impacting their business. 
Our ongoing productivity initiatives help to mitigate a portion of the gross margin pressure with U.S. Broadline warehouse cases per man-hour and cases per trip increasing compared to last year's first quarter. In addition, total sales per employee also increased year-over-year.
All that said, while operating performance in the first quarter is acceptable, it is not up to our standards. We recently held our annual senior leadership meeting at which the importance of profitable sales growth was clearly discussed. Our management team understands that we must find ways to grow earnings faster than sales during these challenging times.
Turning to our multiyear business transformation initiative for a moment, the project remains on track. We are preparing to begin the last of our four cycles of testing prior to go live at our pilot facility early next year. We are also beginning to staff Sysco Business Services and have recently named Kirk Drummond to lead this strategically important part of our business. Kirk has been with Sysco for the last 24 years, working in various capacities at our local operating companies and the corporate, including five years as our Chief Information Officer and the last five years as our Senior Vice President and Treasurer. This organization will centralize back office administrative functions such as accounting, receivables, payables, billing and call center support. 
I'd like to close by thanking our associates and our management team for their ongoing contributions and commitment to Sysco's success. This is an exciting time in our company's history and our associates continue to deliver a high level of service and support to our customers. While our businesses face uncertain challenges, we remain dedicated to being our customers' most valued business partner and to invest in the future growth of Sysco. We know this focus strengthens our competitive position and provides a strong foundation for success over the long term. 
Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the quarter."
189096,115173876,86423,"Sysco Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2010",2010-11-08,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter, sales were $9.8 million or an increase of 7.4% compared to the prior year, driven mainly by case volume growth and the impact of food cost inflation, which we estimate to be 3.3% for the",651,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter, sales were $9.8 million or an increase of 7.4% compared to the prior year, driven mainly by case volume growth and the impact of food cost inflation, which we estimate to be 3.3% for the period. In addition, acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 0.6%, and changes in foreign exchange rate increased sales by 0.5%. 
Operating income increased $9 million or 1.8% to $506 million during the quarter. While sales increased 7.4%, gross margin increased only 4.8% and operating expense increased 6%. 
Operating expense increased $75 million for the quarter due to three main drivers. First, salaries and related expense increased approximately $40 million, primarily from increased case volume during the quarter, including increased commissions and incentives and delivery personnel cost. Total headcount was down very slightly compared to the prior year, meaning we held our headcount levels relatively steady despite increased case volume. While total headcount is down, we've increased MA headcount over the last year. It typically takes one to two years for an MA to be fully productive within the sales organization, but we consider this investment in the business to be an important one that will enhance our ability to grow sales as the industry recovers and continue to take market share.
Second, as we had discussed on last quarter's call, pension expense increased by $15 million year-over-year. Lastly, operating expense included a $14 million benefit from the impact of Corporate-Owned Life Insurance, or COLI, which is an unfavorable comparison to the $21 million benefit we recorded in the prior year.
Net earnings for the first quarter were $299 million, declining $27 million or 8.3% compared to the prior year. Net earnings reflected $39 million year-over-year increase in tax expense, primarily due to the IRS settlement gain and higher non-taxable COLI gains recorded in the prior year. Excluding the impact of COLI in both periods and the IRS settlement gain, net earnings for the quarter as adjusted would have increased 3.4%. In addition, the $15 million year-over-year increase in pension expense impacted net earnings by another 2.8 percentage points.
Earnings per share declined 7.3% to $0.51, which included a $0.02 benefit from COLI. In the prior year period, earnings per share were $0.55 and included a $0.05 gain related to the IRS settlement and a $0.04 benefit from COLI.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the fiscal year was $227 million compared to $42 million in the prior year. Cash flow from operations increased year-over-year due mainly to the timing of our IRS settlement payments. During the first quarter of this year, we had no settlement payments. However, in the prior year period, we paid $316 million. We expect to pay a total of $212 million in settlement payments during this fiscal year and again, next year. As a reminder, these scheduled payments included $106 million cash outflow in the second quarter period and a $53 million cash outflow in the third and fourth fiscal quarters.
Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted during the quarter by an increase in accounts receivable and a decline in accrued expense. Receivables increased due to the higher sales during the period, and the decline in accrued expenses this quarter was due mainly to the payment of incentive compensation related to the prior fiscal year. 
Capital expenditures totaled $143 million for the quarter, including facility expansion and replacement, fleet replacements and investments in technology, including our business transformation project.
In closing, while the business environment remains challenging, we are seeing improvements and our operating companies continue to have a strong focus on growing cases, controlling costs, improving productivity and successfully implementing our business transformation. As a result, we are confident that Sysco is well positioned to take advantage of the economic recovery as it takes hold. 
With that, operator, we will now take questions."

I think some of that decline, I'm sure, is a little bit cosmetic because of the inflation impact. And Bill, I think you already talked about the mix shift between SYGMA and Broadline. But as far as the strategic price investments that I think you cited in your press release, it seems, at least to me, a little bit unprecedented for Sysco to have to resort to discounting based on where you guys have typically gone to market. So can you just talk about how far reaching these price investments are going to be over the rest of the year? And if you had to quantify, how much of the 46 basis point decline was driven by a price investments in this last quarter? Is that something that you can quantify at all?"

So to repeat, of the 46 basis point decline, we think about 10 of that is a business mix of SYGMA versus the Broadline, so that leaves you over a third of a point of margin decline. And our best estimate is about half of that is we would attribute to pretty significant inflation in those three categories I mentioned: meat, dairy and seafood. And the other half, too, I don't know that I would call it discounting or pricing so much. What we would characterize it, as what we said, is strategic category initiatives where we see opportunities, Ajay, where we're somewhat under penetrated and we think it's appropriate for us to get a little more focused and give a little more finely priced in those categories. So we've been into this year for a few months and I would expect it to continue here over a good portion of the balance of the year. But it's not a random type of thing. It's distinct categories, and we're doing it in different parts of the country and over time throughout the country. And again, I would expect us to maybe not in 12 months but over a reasonable period of time see a payback there on the sales month."

We're fine with the quarter. As I said, it was acceptable. These are very interesting times, in addition to being exciting times. So you got a situation out here where a year ago, we had about three and a half points and deflation cases were going the wrong way. A year later, we're seeing just the opposite amount of inflation, and we're encouraged by the case growth. So if you look at it on a customer standpoint, our customer standpoint, if you go back three years, we've been through an environment of two years of pretty significant inflation, a third year of deflation and now we're into our fourth year here where inflation is picking up in these certain categories. So I'm not saying that we should have done better. I'm really just saying we need to do better going forward, and our folks understand that. In terms of how you manage that, essentially, you manage it territory by territory, account by account and you look at each situation, and you're always getting an eye on the operating company level. You're always trying to strike the right balance of between opportunities for growth and opportunities to more effectively, more productively servicing these accounts with the reality that our customers are running the business as well, and we need to be sensitive to what their high-cost items are and what their key concerns are. So that's why we have 8,000 commissioned salespeople out there, that's why we have presidents in all these operating companies is to make those decisions on an account by account basis and overall, from an enterprise standpoint, we try to give them good guidance and feedback. And then the contract side of the business, the inflation, as we've talked before, impacts a little different. Most of the categories are contractually linked to some type of pricing mechanism. And they're typically is up to a 30-day time lag from the time that the pie comes in to when the prices roll. So it depends on whether it's street business or contract business."

On the contract side, we're starting to see this already but to your point, I think we'll see it more as we have better data and more integrated systems is -- our big opportunity on the contract side is to create a more consistent face to the customer of all Sysco's capabilities.

Larry Pulliam and Kent Humphries and their team. We've got a lot of momentum there. We've made some organization moves. We're much more focused on segments and that type of thing. We'll talk more about it in December. But you never want to lose business. That's something we're working very hard on throughout our company to minimize those situations.

Now that's hard to quantify and hard to sometimes say with a straight face when the industry has been in decline for a year to two years. But we certainly think that we've improved our share wallet and taken share for that matter in all segments. I think what's helped us a little bit in the overall numbers relative to the restaurant numbers is about 30% of our business or a little bit more than that 35%, I guess, is non-restaurant business. So we continue to do well in the institutional side of things and that's certainly been a buffer for us through these difficult times. But our approach in our model hasn't change. We want to grow with our current customers. We want to help them grow.
