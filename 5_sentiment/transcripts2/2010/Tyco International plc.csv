I'm pleased with our results this quarter and with the hard work of our team around the globe whose efforts helped us achieve better than expected earnings despite the challenging environment. Our results for the qua",848,"Thanks, Ed and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our results this quarter and with the hard work of our team around the globe whose efforts helped us achieve better than expected earnings despite the challenging environment. Our results for the quarter continued to be driven by our cost management and restructuring efforts as well as the continued strength of our service and recurring revenue business which represents over 40% of our total revenue. It is these actions coupled with the growth of our service business which have largely offset the impact of lower revenue and our product businesses and in our systems installation activities at ADT and Fire. While we have started to see the rate of revenue decline slow, this portion of our business continues to be soft.As a result, we continue to actively work both our restructuring activities and tighter cost management. And these efforts were reflected in our operating margin this quarter. Despite a $400 million organic revenue decline, we maintained our operating margin year-over-year.Now let me make a quick comment or two about each of our businesses and Chris will provide you with more detail in a few minutes.  Starting with ADT, our income performance in the quarter was strong. Similar to the last few quarters, growth in recurring revenue helped to partially offset declines in our systems installation and service revenue. We also saw continued improvement in our operating margin, both sequentially and year-over-year as growth in the higher-margin recurring revenue business combined with the benefits of cost containment initiatives and restructuring, more than offset the decline in volume.Additionally, a number of our key metrics, particularly growth in our account base and average revenue per user, continue their positive momentum. Next, we continue to see soft conditions in Flow Control, as we enter the low point of our cycle. While we have improved productivity and implemented cost containment initiatives, these actions can only partially offset the impact of volume deleveraging on the operating margin.We will continue to see pressure in Flow Control through the first half of the year but we expect that the improvements we have made in the business over the last few years, and a modest pickup in the second half of the year, should improve our performance.Additionally, the continued stabilization of our backlog is also encouraging. Turning to Fire, revenue was better than expected and the operating margin benefited from cost containment initiatives. We continue to focus on growing our service revenue and maintaining our strong position in key vertical markets.In Safety products, the sequential revenue decline was offset with product mix and cost savings resulting in operating margin performance similar to the fourth quarter. Our order activity has stabilized and we feel good about our ability to strengthen our margins when the revenue environment improves. And finally, Electrical and Metal products performed as expected. Although demand for steel and copper building products remain soft, both steel and copper prices are beginning to increase, which is expected to improve our operating performance in the second half of the year.Before I turn it over to Chris, I want to comment on our operational areas of focus for 2010. First, we're continuing to invest in our businesses to strengthen our long-term competitive capabilities and our initiatives are both product and service focused. As we indicated, our intention is to maintain our long-term investment plan despite the economic environment. Secondly, we are carefully managing our cost structure and continue to look for cost reduction opportunities. We have aggressively executed restructuring actions over the last year, which are expected to provide incremental savings of $175 million in 2010. And we will implement additional restructuring actions throughout the course of this year.Next, the last year and a half has shown the importance of maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our cost position is strong, and we will deploy our cash to fund our internal growth initiatives as well as productivity and restructuring plans. As we generate excess cash, we will invest in areas that generate the best return for our shareholders which will include bolt-on acquisitions in Security, Fire and Flow Control as well as share repurchase.In December, we announced the acquisition of two privately held Brazilian valve manufacturers which expands and complements the Flow Control product offerings in Brazil, and gives Tyco a leadership position in the Brazilian market, a market we have continued to target. As you all know, we announced last week that we have entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Brinks Home Security which operates as Broadview Security. These acquisitions are being funded in a balanced, tax efficient way that keeps our balance sheet strong and we expect them to contribute nicely to earnings and cash flow and generate solid returns on capital.Finally, we recently announced the proposed dividend increase that our shareholders will vote on at our annual general meeting in March. The proposed dividend represents a 5% increase over the $0.80 per share dividend approved by our shareholders in 2009. Now let me turn the call over to Chris to discuss our operating results in more detail."

Let me start with ADT Worldwide. Revenue of $1.8 billion declined 3% organically as the 5% growth in recurring revenue was more than offset by a 13% organic revenue decline in systems installation and service.Recurr",1379,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with ADT Worldwide. Revenue of $1.8 billion declined 3% organically as the 5% growth in recurring revenue was more than offset by a 13% organic revenue decline in systems installation and service.Recurring revenue, which represented over 55% of ADT's total revenue in the quarter continues to perform well. However, systems installation and service revenue continue to be impacted by the weak economy. Despite pressure on the top line, the operating margin before special items in the quarter of 14.4% improved 180 basis points over the prior year.Restructuring activities along with cost containment actions and growth in our higher-margin recurring revenue business, more than offset volume headwinds, resulting in year-over-year operating margin improvement. From a regional perspective within ADT, our North American residential and small business unit grew its recurring revenue 8% organically in the quarter due to strong account growth in the second half of 2009, which was partly attributable to opportunistic bulk account purchases.Additionally, the operating margin before special items improved a full percentage point over the prior year. Recurring revenue currently represents more than 85% of our residential and small-business revenue and continues to provide steady and consistent performance. On a year-over-year basis, we grew our residential account base by almost 5% while increasing our average revenue per user by 3%. Additionally, our Residential attrition rate improved by 10 basis points to 13.3% on a quarter sequential basis.Turning to our North American Commercial business, the revenue mix is quite different. While 40% of our revenue was recurring, the remaining 60% is related to systems installation and service. Although our Commercial end markets continue to be impacted by the economic downturn, the rate of organic revenue decline has slowed somewhat and was down 11% in the quarter.However, the operating margin before specialized improved 130 basis points year-over-year to 10.8% as a number of positives, including the benefits of restructuring and cost containment initiatives, offset the volume decline.The attrition rate increased 20 basis points to 14% while orders remained relatively flat on a quarter sequential basis. Moving onto the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, organic revenue declined 8%. However, the benefits of our restructuring actions are taking hold and helped contribute to an improvement in the operating margin before special items, which increased by more than two full percentage points over the prior year to 6.4%.In the Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions, which are predominately Commercial, organic revenue grew 2% on a combined basis. The operating margin before special items improved approximately 150 basis points year-over-year and remains in the low teens.Turning next to some of our key metrics, our Global Account base grew 3% year-over-year to almost 7.5 million accounts. And excluding the impact of foreign currency, our average revenue per user grew 1% to $46.32. Both our account base and average revenue per user have been steadily increasing throughout the global downturn.While the worldwide attrition rate increased 10 basis points to 13.5% on a quarter sequential basis, it has consistently stayed in the mid-13% range for the last four quarters. Now I'll turn it to Flow Control, which had revenue in the quarter of $923 million with an organic revenue decline of 14%. Balance declined 15%, Water declined 10% and Thermal Control declined 14% through the continued softness in capital spending in our end markets.Before special items, operating income was $118 million and the operating margin was 12.8%. The operating margin performance in the quarter was better than we had expected due to product mix, particularly the seasonal strength of Thermal Control during the winter months. However, the significant volume deleveraging resulted in 170 basis point decrease in the operating margin before special items year-over-year, as the benefits of cost containment actions and restructuring activities were more than offset by the $130  million organic revenue decline.Excluding currency, the year-over-year order rate decline slowed to 13% from 18% in the prior quarter. On a quarter sequential basis, orders remained relatively flat, excluding the large Pacific Water project we booked in the fourth quarter. Although we continue to see a pickup in cloning [ph] activities, we are not yet seeing this translate into a meaningful change in our order levels.  Backlog of $1.65 billion declined 2% on an organic basis, the second consecutive quarter with minimal backlog decline.Turning now to Fire Protection Services, revenue in the quarter was $833 million and the organic revenue declined 6%, as we continue to experience softness in systems installation revenue, and to a much lesser degree, in our service revenue. Service represents about half of Fire's revenue and declined 2% organically as growth in inspection and maintenance revenue was more than offset by customers delaying other service projects.Systems installation revenue declined 10% organically in the quarter due to weaker demand in our end markets. The backlog of $1.2 billion remain flat on an organic basis, which is encouraging. Before special items, operating income was $64 million and our operating margin was 7.7%. The benefits of cost containment initiatives and restructuring actions are helping to mitigate margin pressure from the lower revenue.Moving on to Safety Products revenue in the quarter was $358 million with an organic revenue decline of 14%. Organic revenue growth of 4% in Life Safety was more than offset by soft demand in our Fire Suppression and Electronic Security end markets. Organic revenues declined 22% in Fire Suppression and 10% in Electronic Security. Before special items, operating income was $53 million and the operating margin was 14.8%. Better-than-expected operating income in the quarter resulted from product mix, in particular higher-margin, Life Safety and Electronic Security products. On a quarter sequential basis, the benefits of our cost containment initiatives and restructuring actions essentially offset the continued revenue headwind as well as an increased investment in sales and marketing capabilities and research and development.Lastly, Electrical and Metal Products had revenue of $297 million in the quarter with an organic revenue decline of 30%. The revenue decline was primarily due to significantly lower selling prices for both steel and copper products. Decreased volume also contributed to the decline, although to a much lesser extent. Operating income before special items of $23 million was about what we had expected. On a year-over-year basis, lower revenue was almost fully offset by improved steel spreads. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect revenue and operating income before special items to be similar to the first quarter. Based on end market demand and pricing activity in the quarter, as well as the seasonal lift we get in the summer months, we continue to expect that operating income before special items for the full year should approximate $120 million in our Electrical and Metal products business. Before I turn the call back over to Ed, let me touch on a few other important items.  First, from a cash flow perspective, we had a good start to the year. Our free cash flow in the first quarter was $79 million and included $50 million of payments primarily for restructuring. This compares to a free cash outflow of $215 million in the prior year which included $25 million of payments primarily related to restructuring. The year-over-year increase in cash flow is primarily attributable to the management of working capital.Next, corporate expense in the quarter was $98 million, which included $2 million in special items. This is somewhat lower than our previous guidance of $110 million, mostly due to the timing of certain expenses. For the second quarter, we expect corporate expense to approximate $110 million and continue to expect our full year corporate expense will approximate $430 million.Next, other income in the quarter of $9 million related to an increase in receivables from Covidien and Tyco Electronics under the tax sharing agreement related to pre-separation taxes. This income was more than offset by a charge reflected in the tax line. Finally, our tax rate for the quarter was 14.9%. This was well below the annual guidance of 19% to 20% due to the accounting timing of certain items. Although the tax rate can move around quarter to quarter, we continue to expect both a second quarter annual tax rate of 19% to 20%. Now let me turn the call over back to Ed Breen to wrap up this morning's call."

Before we open up the line for questions, I want to spend a few minutes on our guidance for the second quarter and our expectations for the second half of the year. Based on our current order rates and backlog, we expect an organic revenue",592,"Thanks, Chris. Before we open up the line for questions, I want to spend a few minutes on our guidance for the second quarter and our expectations for the second half of the year. Based on our current order rates and backlog, we expect an organic revenue decline of approximately 6% to 8% in the second quarter. Additionally, we expect that foreign exchange rates will favorably impact revenue by approximately 6% year-over-year.Therefore, we expect total revenue in the second quarter, which is seasonally our lowest quarter, to be approximately $4.1 billion. From a business perspective, we see positive growth in ADT's recurring revenue in the 4% range offset by a revenue decline in systems installation and service, which should result in a flattish organic revenue growth rate year-over-year.  However, we expect a sequential decline in operating margin before special items to 14% due to the seasonal nature of our retail business, which traditionally benefits in the first quarter from higher revenue and operating income.Next, we expect continued revenue headwind in Flow Control. We think the second quarter is likely to be our trough quarter with the year-over-year revenue decline resulting in additional volume deleveraging.  In addition, the first quarter benefited from the high margin mix of our seasonally strong Thermal business. For the second quarter, we expect Flow Control revenue to approximate $900 million and the operating income before special items to approximate $100 million.Additionally, the seasonal decline in our Fire business is expected to result in revenue of approximately $800 million in the second quarter, despite the revenue decline. We expect the operating margin before special items to be similar to the first quarter.In Safety Products, we expect an organic revenue decline in the low teens and an operating margin before special items of approximately 14%.Lastly, as Chris mentioned, we expect sequential headwinds related to an increase in both corporate expense and the tax rate in the second quarter in comparison to the first quarter. These increases will cost us approximately $0.08 per share sequentially. From an earnings perspective, this is expected to result in earnings per share from continuing operations before special items in the range of $0.50 to $0.52 per share. As we look to the balance of the year, there are a few items that we expect to be tailwinds in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. First, as Chris mentioned, Electrical and Metal products should have a much better second half of the year due to more favorable volume and pricing for both steel and copper.  As a result, the earnings contribution from this business should be much higher and the second half of the year. Second, our other businesses, particularly ADT and Fire, also have seasonal increases in revenue and income in the third and fourth quarter. Despite the economic environment, we expect both of these businesses to earn at a higher rate in the second half of the year due to their customer base and when work is scheduled.Lastly, we expect Flow Control to exit the low part of the cycle in the second half of the year, which will increase its earnings contribution. Based on our current order activity, which is performing as we expected, and our specific business expectations for the remainder of the year, we continue to see our full year earnings per share before special items to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.50. Thanks for joining us on the conference call. And operator, with that, lets open it up for any questions."

A very little bit in the second half of the year, which would be kind of in the Flow area, but not anything significant. So our guidance is truly based on orders staying at these levels. So you're correct, we see pickup in order activity, that clearly will help the year out that we are not counting on in that guidance. Dean, if I go back, maybe I'll use 2008, which I think was a very typical trend year for the company. We definitely picked up in the second half of the year. If I remember the numbers correctly, our revenue in the second half of that year was $800 million higher than the first half of the year. I thought it was also interesting last year, although you didn't actually see it as much in numbers, but as business was trending down for everybody last year, we actually did have some seasonal lift that occurred. And our revenues were $90 million to $100 million higher in the second half of last year than in the first half despite the decline we were going through. So we clearly see seasonality. But the biggest pieces are, as I mentioned a minute ago, they're in Fire and they're in ADT and we do an awful lot of work in the spring and summer months when work is scheduled. Number one, because of warm weather. But number two, we have key verticals, like the education vertical that want us to cram all their work into the summer months when their campuses and schools are either closed or are less busy. So we clearly see that happen. And we normally do see some lift seasonality in our Flow Control business in the third and fourth quarter. So we're expecting all of that to occur, maybe to a lesser extent with the economy, but it will occur for us. And then as Chris and I both mentioned, Electrical and Metal, I think all the trends we're seeing here will clearly have a stronger second half of the year than first half of the year for us. So, I think we're teeing up nice. I would hope that would get us more towards the higher end of our guidance range. I think things would have to fall apart, we'll have to fault the economy a little bit at this point. I think for us to be down the low end of the guidance range that we have been clearly getting off to a very good start in the first quarter with the $0.65, that clearly builds my confidence that we're off to a good start to get there."

When we separated the company into three, our goal with Tyco International was to end up with these three global platforms, although we have Flow being one of those key platforms, Fire and then Security. We really like all three platforms. As I've mentioned before, one of the dynamics I like, is they are global, they are all emerging markets. So I think these businesses have nice growth rates in a decent economy. I also like the fact that we're in a very fragmented industries, in Fire, Security and Flow. And so I think there's real opportunity for us both, whether it's organic or both ones [ph] to really have a nice organic growth come true there and therefore, good returns to our shareholders, if we're smart about how we go about it. So I do all three platforms just as important as, each one is important as the next one, as far as our ability to grow and then get good returns for our shareholders. Flow Control, as you know, Danray [ph] is a nice steady business with very nice margins and if the economy hadn't turned out here, I think we wouldn't continue to see us make margin improvement in the business and I've been very impressed there last year that we've actually maintained our margins where we have despite the downturn, so a very important platform for us and we will continue to expand there and focus there just as much. Let me clarify though, you did see us announced these, the Brazilian deal and obviously, the Brinks Broadview deal the other week but as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, share repurchase will be a part of our future flip [ph] process here. We're not just turn the switch over. If there's something good we can bolt on, we'll put it on but we're not sitting around here as a management team, looking at doing a series of deals just for the sake of doing that. If there's something good with returns, we'll do it, that really makes sense for us in the global platform. But we're staying very focused on operating the company organically or as you could tell, I think by our results, our real intense focus on our operations and we're not going to lose that, that momentum."

We're seeing a little bit of pockets of pressure here and there, but not significant, that the place we've seen the pricing pressure, really for the last, I guess six months or so, build a little bit, was on the systems installation side of our business in some of our regions. And that doesn't surprise me because of business has been down, fairly significantly double-digit organically for the last year and we have seen a little bit of pricing pressure there.

Our results for the qua",851,"Thanks, Ed and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our results this quarter and with the hard work of our team around the globe whose efforts helped us achieve better than expected earnings despite the challenging environment. Our results for the quarter continued to be driven by our cost management and restructuring efforts as well as the continued strength of our service and recurring revenue business which represents over 40% of our total revenue. It is these actions coupled with the growth of our service business which have largely offset the impact of lower revenue and our product businesses and in our systems installation activities at ADT and Fire. While we have started to see the rate of revenue decline slow, this portion of our business continues to be soft. As a result, we continue to actively work both our restructuring activities and tighter cost management. And these efforts were reflected in our operating margin this quarter. Despite a $400 million organic revenue decline, we maintained our operating margin year-over-year.Now let me make a quick comment or two about each of our businesses and Chris will provide you with more detail in a few minutes.  Starting with ADT, our income performance in the quarter was strong. Similar to the last few quarters, growth in recurring revenue helped to partially offset declines in our systems installation and service revenue. We also saw continued improvement in our operating margin, both sequentially and year-over-year as growth in the higher-margin recurring revenue business combined with the benefits of cost containment initiatives and restructuring, more than offset the decline in volume. Additionally, a number of our key metrics, particularly growth in our account base and average revenue per user, continue their positive momentum. Next, we continue to see soft conditions in Flow Control, as we enter the low point of our cycle. While we have improved productivity and implemented cost containment initiatives, these actions can only partially offset the impact of volume deleveraging on the operating margin.We will continue to see pressure in Flow Control through the first half of the year but we expect that the improvements we have made in the business over the last few years, and a modest pickup in the second half of the year, should improve our performance. Additionally, the continued stabilization of our backlog is also encouraging. Turning to Fire, revenue was better than expected and the operating margin benefited from cost containment initiatives. We continue to focus on growing our service revenue and maintaining our strong position in key vertical markets.In Safety products, the sequential revenue decline was offset with product mix and cost savings resulting in operating margin performance similar to the fourth quarter. Our order activity has stabilized and we feel good about our ability to strengthen our margins when the revenue environment improves. And finally, Electrical and Metal products performed as expected. Although demand for steel and copper building products remain soft, both steel and copper prices are beginning to increase, which is expected to improve our operating performance in the second half of the year.Before I turn it over to Chris, I want to comment on our operational areas of focus for 2010. First, we're continuing to invest in our businesses to strengthen our long-term competitive capabilities and our initiatives are both product and service focused. As we indicated, our intention is to maintain our long-term investment plan despite the economic environment. Secondly, we are carefully managing our cost structure and continue to look for cost reduction opportunities. We have aggressively executed restructuring actions over the last year, which are expected to provide incremental savings of $175 million in 2010. And we will implement additional restructuring actions throughout the course of this year.Next, the last year and a half has shown the importance of maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our cost position is strong, and we will deploy our cash to fund our internal growth initiatives as well as productivity and restructuring plans. As we generate excess cash, we will invest in areas that generate the best return for our shareholders which will include bolt-on acquisitions in Security, Fire and Flow Control as well as share repurchase.In December, we announced the acquisition of two privately held Brazilian valve manufacturers which expands and complements the Flow Control product offerings in Brazil, and gives Tyco a leadership position in the Brazilian market, a market we have continued to target. As you all know, we announced last week that we have entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Brinks Home Security which operates as Broadview Security. These acquisitions are being funded in a balanced, tax efficient way that keeps our balance sheet strong and we expect them to contribute nicely to earnings and cash flow and generate solid returns on capital.Finally, we recently announced the proposed dividend increase that our shareholders will vote on at our annual general meeting in March. The proposed dividend represents a 5% increase over the $0.80 per share dividend approved by our shareholders in 2009. Now let me turn the call over to Chris to discuss our operating results in more detail."
107534,84102436,47696,"Tyco International Ltd., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2010",2010-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with ADT Worldwide. Revenue of $1.8 billion declined 3% organically as the 5% growth in recurring revenue was more than offset by a 13% organic revenue decline in systems installation and service.Recurr",1381,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with ADT Worldwide. Revenue of $1.8 billion declined 3% organically as the 5% growth in recurring revenue was more than offset by a 13% organic revenue decline in systems installation and service.Recurring revenue, which represented over 55% of ADT's total revenue in the quarter continues to perform well. However, systems installation and service revenue continue to be impacted by the weak economy. Despite pressure on the top line, the operating margin before special items in the quarter of 14.4% improved 180 basis points over the prior year.Restructuring activities along with cost containment actions and growth in our higher-margin recurring revenue business, more than offset volume headwinds, resulting in year-over-year operating margin improvement. From a regional perspective within ADT, our North American residential and small business unit grew its recurring revenue 8% organically in the quarter due to strong account growth in the second half of 2009, which was partly attributable to opportunistic bulk account purchases.Additionally, the operating margin before special items improved a full percentage point over the prior year. Recurring revenue currently represents more than 85% of our residential and small-business revenue and continues to provide steady and consistent performance. On a year-over-year basis, we grew our residential account base by almost 5% while increasing our average revenue per user by 3%. Additionally, our Residential attrition rate improved by 10 basis points to 13.3% on a quarter sequential basis.Turning to our North American Commercial business, the revenue mix is quite different. While 40% of our revenue was recurring, the remaining 60% is related to systems installation and service. Although our Commercial end markets continue to be impacted by the economic downturn, the rate of organic revenue decline has slowed somewhat and was down 11% in the quarter.However, the operating margin before specialized improved 130 basis points year-over-year to 10.8% as a number of positives, including the benefits of restructuring and cost containment initiatives, offset the volume decline.The attrition rate increased 20 basis points to 14% while orders remained relatively flat on a quarter sequential basis. Moving onto the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, organic revenue declined 8%. However, the benefits of our restructuring actions are taking hold and helped contribute to an improvement in the operating margin before special items, which increased by more than two full percentage points over the prior year to 6.4%.In the Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions, which are predominately Commercial, organic revenue grew 2% on a combined basis. The operating margin before special items improved approximately 150 basis points year-over-year and remains in the low teens.Turning next to some of our key metrics, our Global Account base grew 3% year-over-year to almost 7.5 million accounts. And excluding the impact of foreign currency, our average revenue per user grew 1% to $46.32. Both our account base and average revenue per user have been steadily increasing throughout the global downturn. While the worldwide attrition rate increased 10 basis points to 13.5% on a quarter sequential basis, it has consistently stayed in the mid-13% range for the last four quarters. Now I'll turn it to Flow Control, which had revenue in the quarter of $923 million with an organic revenue decline of 14%. Balance declined 15%, Water declined 10% and Thermal Control declined 14% through the continued softness in capital spending in our end markets.Before special items, operating income was $118 million and the operating margin was 12.8%. The operating margin performance in the quarter was better than we had expected due to product mix, particularly the seasonal strength of Thermal Control during the winter months. However, the significant volume deleveraging resulted in a 170 basis points decrease in the operating margin before special items year-over-year, as the benefits of cost containment actions and restructuring activities were more than offset by the $130 million organic revenue decline.Excluding currency, the year-over-year order rate decline slowed to 13% from 18% in the prior quarter. On a quarter sequential basis, orders remained relatively flat, excluding the large Pacific Water project we booked in the fourth quarter. Although we continue to see a pickup in quoting activities, we are not yet seeing this translate into a meaningful change in our order levels.  Backlog of $1.65 billion declined 2% on an organic basis, the second consecutive quarter with minimal backlog decline.Turning now to Fire Protection Services, revenue in the quarter was $833 million and the organic revenue declined 6%, as we continue to experience softness in systems installation revenue and, to a much lesser degree, in our service revenue. Service represents about half of Fire's revenue and declined 2% organically, as growth in inspection and maintenance revenue was more than offset by customers delaying other service projects.Systems installation revenue declined 10% organically in the quarter due to weaker demand in our end markets. The backlog of $1.2 billion remain flat on an organic basis, which is encouraging. Before special items, operating income was $64 million and our operating margin was 7.7%. The benefits of cost containment initiatives and restructuring actions are helping to mitigate margin pressure from the lower revenue.Moving on to Safety Products, revenue in the quarter was $358 million with an organic revenue decline of 14%. Organic revenue growth of 4% in Life Safety was more than offset by soft demand in our Fire Suppression and Electronic Security end markets. Organic revenues declined 22% in Fire Suppression and 10% in Electronic Security. Before special items, operating income was $53 million and the operating margin was 14.8%. Better-than-expected operating income in the quarter resulted from product mix, in particular, higher-margin Life Safety and Electronic Security products. On a quarter sequential basis, the benefits of our cost containment initiatives and restructuring actions essentially offset the continued revenue headwind, as well as an increased investment in sales and marketing capabilities and research and development.Lastly, Electrical and Metal Products had revenue of $297 million in the quarter, with an organic revenue decline of 30%. The revenue decline was primarily due to significantly lower selling prices for both steel and copper products. Decreased volume also contributed to the decline, although to a much lesser extent. Operating income before special items of $23 million was about what we had expected. On a year-over-year basis, lower revenue was almost fully offset by improved steel spreads. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect revenue and operating income before special items to be similar to the first quarter. Based on end market demand and pricing activity in the quarter, as well as the seasonal lift we get in the summer months, we continue to expect that operating income before special items for the full year should approximate $120 million in our Electrical and Metal products business. Before I turn the call back over to Ed, let me touch on a few other important items. First, from a cash flow perspective, we had a good start to the year. Our free cash flow in the first quarter was $79 million and included $50 million of payments primarily for restructuring. This compares to a free cash outflow of $215 million in the prior year, which included $25 million of payments primarily related to restructuring. The year-over-year increase in cash flow is primarily attributable to the management of working capital.Next, corporate expense in the quarter was $98 million, which included $2 million in special items. This is somewhat lower than our previous guidance of $110 million, mostly due to the timing of certain expenses. For the second quarter, we expect corporate expense to approximate $110 million and continue to expect our full year corporate expense will approximate $430 million.Next, other income in the quarter of $9 million related to an increase in receivables from Covidien and Tyco Electronics under the tax sharing agreement related to pre-separation taxes. This income was more than offset by a charge reflected in the tax line. Finally, our tax rate for the quarter was 14.9%. This was well below the annual guidance of 19% to 20% due to the accounting timing of certain items. Although the tax rate can move around quarter to quarter, we continue to expect both a second quarter and annual tax rate of 19% to 20%. Now let me turn the call over back to Ed Breen to wrap up this morning's call."

Before we open up the line for questions, I want to spend a few minutes on our guidance for the second quarter and our expectations for the second half of the year. Based on our current order rates and backlog, we expect an organic revenue",595,"Thanks, Chris. Before we open up the line for questions, I want to spend a few minutes on our guidance for the second quarter and our expectations for the second half of the year. Based on our current order rates and backlog, we expect an organic revenue decline of approximately 6% to 8% in the second quarter. Additionally, we expect that foreign exchange rates will favorably impact revenue by approximately 6% year-over-year. Therefore, we expect total revenue in the second quarter, which is seasonally our lowest quarter, to be approximately $4.1 billion. From a business perspective, we see positive growth in ADT's recurring revenue in the 4% range offset by a revenue decline in systems installation and service, which should result in a flattish organic revenue growth rate year-over-year.  However, we expect a sequential decline in operating margin before special items to 14% due to the seasonal nature of our retail business, which traditionally benefits in the first quarter from higher revenue and operating income.Next, we expect continued revenue headwind in Flow Control. We think the second quarter is likely to be our trough quarter with the year-over-year revenue decline resulting in additional volume deleveraging.  In addition, the first quarter benefited from the high margin mix of our seasonally strong Thermal business. For the second quarter, we expect Flow Control revenue to approximate $900 million and the operating income before special items to approximate $100 million. Additionally, the seasonal decline in our Fire business is expected to result in revenue of approximately $800 million in the second quarter, despite the revenue decline. We expect the operating margin before special items to be similar to the first quarter. In Safety Products, we expect an organic revenue decline in the low teens and an operating margin before special items of approximately 14%.Lastly, as Chris mentioned, we expect sequential headwinds related to an increase in both corporate expense and the tax rate in the second quarter in comparison to the first quarter. These increases will cost us approximately $0.08 per share sequentially. From an earnings perspective, this is expected to result in earnings per share from continuing operations before special items in the range of $0.50 to $0.52 per share. As we look to the balance of the year, there are a few items that we expect to be tailwinds in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. First, as Chris mentioned, Electrical and Metal products should have a much better second half of the year due to more favorable volume and pricing for both steel and copper.  As a result, the earnings contribution from this business should be much higher and the second half of the year. Second, our other businesses, particularly ADT and Fire, also have seasonal increases in revenue and income in the third and fourth quarter. Despite the economic environment, we expect both of these businesses to earn at a higher rate in the second half of the year due to their customer base and when work is scheduled.Lastly, we expect Flow Control to exit the low part of the cycle in the second half of the year, which will increase its earnings contribution. Based on our current order activity, which is performing as we expected, and our specific business expectations for the remainder of the year, we continue to see our full year earnings per share before special items to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.50. Thanks for joining us on the conference call. And operator, with that, lets open it up for any questions."

A very little bit in the second half of the year, which would be kind of in the Flow area, but not anything significant. So our guidance is truly based on orders staying at these levels. So you're correct, we see pickup in order activity, that clearly will help the year out that we are not counting on in that guidance. Dean, if I go back, maybe I'll use 2008, which I think was a very typical trend year for the company. We definitely picked up in the second half of the year. If I remember the numbers correctly, our revenue in the second half of that year was $800 million higher than the first half of the year. I thought it was also interesting last year, although you didn't actually see it as much in numbers, but as business was trending down for everybody last year, we actually did have some seasonal lift that occurred. And our revenues were $90 million to $100 million higher in the second half of last year than in the first half, despite the decline we were going through. So we clearly see seasonality. But the biggest pieces are, as I mentioned a minute ago, they're in Fire and they're in ADT and we do an awful lot of work in the spring and summer months when work is scheduled. Number one, because of warm weather. But number two, we have key verticals, like the education vertical that want us to cram all their work into the summer months when their campuses and schools are either closed or less busy. So we clearly see that happen. And we normally do see some lift seasonally in our Flow Control business in the third and fourth quarter. So we're expecting all of that to occur, maybe to a lesser extent with the economy, but it will occur for us. And then as Chris and I both mentioned, Electrical and Metal, I think all the trends we're seeing here will clearly have a stronger second half of the year than first half of the year for us. So I think we're teeing up nice. I would hope that would get us more towards the higher end of our guidance range. I think things would have to fall apart, we'll have to fault the economy a little bit at this point. I think for us to be down the low end of the guidance range that we have been clearly getting off to a very good start in the first quarter with the $0.65, that clearly builds my confidence that we're off to a good start to get there."

So what we're trying to do is sort of just operationalize those areas that can move and realize they can be a swing factor quarter-to-quarter. Again, I think operationally, if you look at our second quarter, the margins of most of our businesses are holding relatively steady. We do have, as we indicated, a decline in the Flow business with again, a fairly significant drop in our organic revenue forecast that will reduce the operating margin in Q2 in the Flow business.

When we separated the company into three, our goal with Tyco International was to end up with these three global platforms, so that we have Flow being one of those key platforms, Fire and then Security. We really like all three platforms. As I've mentioned before, one of the dynamics I like is, they are global, they are all emerging markets. So I think these businesses have nice growth rates in a decent economy. I also like the fact that we're in a very fragmented industries, in Fire, Security and Flow. And so I think there's real opportunity for us both, whether it's organic or bolt-on, to really have a nice organic growth come through there and therefore, good returns to our shareholders, if we're smart about how we go about it. So I do all three platforms just as important, each one is important as the next one, as far as our ability to grow and then get good returns for our shareholders. Flow Control, as you know, down rate,  is a nice steady business with very nice margins. And if the economy hadn't turned down here, I think you would have continued to see us make margin improvement in the business. And I've been pretty impressed over last year that we've actually maintained our margins where we have, despite the downturn. So a very important platform for us and we will continue to expand there and focus there just as much. Let me clarify though, you did see us announce the Brazilian deal and obviously, the Brinks Broadview deal the other week. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, share repurchase will be a part of our future flip process here. We're not just turning the switch over. If there's something good, we can bolt on, we'll put it on. But we're not sitting around here as a management team looking at doing a series of deals just for the sake of doing that. If there's something good with good returns, we'll do it, that really makes sense for us in the global platform. But we're staying very focused on operating the company organically, or as you could tell, I think, by our results, our real intense focus on our operations. And we're not going to lose that, that momentum."

But one of the things I like on the synergy side of this deal is we really do get a big piece of this synergy, literally on day one, which is very comforting. And then we'll work really hard to get the operation runs [ph] over the first year. But to be able to get the rebranding out, to be able to get the payment back to the old parent, out of the number right away, to be able to get day one, the tax synergy, because of the way we structured the deal are all very big swings on the synergy side for us.

The two things, Nigel, I feel better about now, I've been a little bit hesitant here watching this one, is clearly now for two quarters in a row, we've maintained our backlog level, which feels good. When we're reporting some of these numbers, we're taking a big project out we won in Pacific Water but by the way, if the Pacific Water is a big project, then it's all going to shift, kind of in the second half of this year. So maybe we do ourselves a little bit service by x-ing it from the numbers when we talk to you, but that happens to be part of our second year lift that we know we'll get. And I think, probably the more encouraging thing, although again, I'm still holding my breath a little bit on this, is we are really seeing across the globe from our sales teams, a pickup in bidding activity, projects that we're talking about, and that's pretty uniform across all of our markets. And with the economy now improving some, I've got to think this as [ph] a little bit longer cycle business.

This year, our forecast is that it will be around net income. Again, by the way, I would actually rather see a pickup in business than we actually build some working capital, and maybe get a little headwind there. But pending things kind of hanging where they are, we think we'll approximate net income. I will point out, as you saw, this was the best first quarter of cash performance the company has ever had. So I feel like that put that year off to a good start from a cash standpoint. And again, that was management of working capital that enabled that to happen.  On the pricing side, I think your question was specifically to Flow. We're seeing a little bit of pockets of pressure here and there, but not significant, that the place we've seen the pricing pressure, really for the last, I guess six months or so, build a little bit, was on the systems installation side of our business in some of our regions. And that doesn't surprise me because of business has been down, fairly significantly double-digit organically for the last year and we have seen a little bit of pricing pressure there. But to be honest with you, we're not seeing anything there that I don't feel we can offset with good cost containment actions on one the other side. So I think it won't be something that's a headwind that we can't take care of."

Our results for the qua",851,"Thanks, Ed and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our results this quarter and with the hard work of our team around the globe whose efforts helped us achieve better than expected earnings despite the challenging environment. Our results for the quarter continued to be driven by our cost management and restructuring efforts as well as the continued strength of our service and recurring revenue business which represents over 40% of our total revenue. It is these actions coupled with the growth of our service business which have largely offset the impact of lower revenue and our product businesses and in our systems installation activities at ADT and Fire. While we have started to see the rate of revenue decline slow, this portion of our business continues to be soft. As a result, we continue to actively work both our restructuring activities and tighter cost management. And these efforts were reflected in our operating margin this quarter. Despite a $400 million organic revenue decline, we maintained our operating margin year-over-year.Now let me make a quick comment or two about each of our businesses and Chris will provide you with more detail in a few minutes.  Starting with ADT, our income performance in the quarter was strong. Similar to the last few quarters, growth in recurring revenue helped to partially offset declines in our systems installation and service revenue. We also saw continued improvement in our operating margin, both sequentially and year-over-year as growth in the higher-margin recurring revenue business combined with the benefits of cost containment initiatives and restructuring, more than offset the decline in volume. Additionally, a number of our key metrics, particularly growth in our account base and average revenue per user, continue their positive momentum. Next, we continue to see soft conditions in Flow Control, as we enter the low point of our cycle. While we have improved productivity and implemented cost containment initiatives, these actions can only partially offset the impact of volume deleveraging on the operating margin.We will continue to see pressure in Flow Control through the first half of the year but we expect that the improvements we have made in the business over the last few years, and a modest pickup in the second half of the year, should improve our performance. Additionally, the continued stabilization of our backlog is also encouraging. Turning to Fire, revenue was better than expected and the operating margin benefited from cost containment initiatives. We continue to focus on growing our service revenue and maintaining our strong position in key vertical markets.In Safety products, the sequential revenue decline was offset with product mix and cost savings resulting in operating margin performance similar to the fourth quarter. Our order activity has stabilized and we feel good about our ability to strengthen our margins when the revenue environment improves. And finally, Electrical and Metal products performed as expected. Although demand for steel and copper building products remain soft, both steel and copper prices are beginning to increase, which is expected to improve our operating performance in the second half of the year.Before I turn it over to Chris, I want to comment on our operational areas of focus for 2010. First, we're continuing to invest in our businesses to strengthen our long-term competitive capabilities and our initiatives are both product and service focused. As we indicated, our intention is to maintain our long-term investment plan despite the economic environment. Secondly, we are carefully managing our cost structure and continue to look for cost reduction opportunities. We have aggressively executed restructuring actions over the last year, which are expected to provide incremental savings of $175 million in 2010. And we will implement additional restructuring actions throughout the course of this year.Next, the last year and a half has shown the importance of maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our cost position is strong, and we will deploy our cash to fund our internal growth initiatives as well as productivity and restructuring plans. As we generate excess cash, we will invest in areas that generate the best return for our shareholders which will include bolt-on acquisitions in Security, Fire and Flow Control as well as share repurchase.In December, we announced the acquisition of two privately held Brazilian valve manufacturers which expands and complements the Flow Control product offerings in Brazil, and gives Tyco a leadership position in the Brazilian market, a market we have continued to target. As you all know, we announced last week that we have entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Brinks Home Security which operates as Broadview Security. These acquisitions are being funded in a balanced, tax efficient way that keeps our balance sheet strong and we expect them to contribute nicely to earnings and cash flow and generate solid returns on capital.Finally, we recently announced the proposed dividend increase that our shareholders will vote on at our annual general meeting in March. The proposed dividend represents a 5% increase over the $0.80 per share dividend approved by our shareholders in 2009. Now let me turn the call over to Chris to discuss our operating results in more detail."

Let me start with ADT Worldwide. Revenue of $1.8 billion declined 3% organically as the 5% growth in recurring revenue was more than offset by a 13% organic revenue decline in systems installation and service.Recurr",1381,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with ADT Worldwide. Revenue of $1.8 billion declined 3% organically as the 5% growth in recurring revenue was more than offset by a 13% organic revenue decline in systems installation and service.Recurring revenue, which represented over 55% of ADT's total revenue in the quarter continues to perform well. However, systems installation and service revenue continue to be impacted by the weak economy. Despite pressure on the top line, the operating margin before special items in the quarter of 14.4% improved 180 basis points over the prior year.Restructuring activities along with cost containment actions and growth in our higher-margin recurring revenue business, more than offset volume headwinds, resulting in year-over-year operating margin improvement. From a regional perspective within ADT, our North American residential and small business unit grew its recurring revenue 8% organically in the quarter due to strong account growth in the second half of 2009, which was partly attributable to opportunistic bulk account purchases.Additionally, the operating margin before special items improved a full percentage point over the prior year. Recurring revenue currently represents more than 85% of our residential and small-business revenue and continues to provide steady and consistent performance. On a year-over-year basis, we grew our residential account base by almost 5% while increasing our average revenue per user by 3%. Additionally, our Residential attrition rate improved by 10 basis points to 13.3% on a quarter sequential basis.Turning to our North American Commercial business, the revenue mix is quite different. While 40% of our revenue was recurring, the remaining 60% is related to systems installation and service. Although our Commercial end markets continue to be impacted by the economic downturn, the rate of organic revenue decline has slowed somewhat and was down 11% in the quarter.However, the operating margin before specialized improved 130 basis points year-over-year to 10.8% as a number of positives, including the benefits of restructuring and cost containment initiatives, offset the volume decline.The attrition rate increased 20 basis points to 14% while orders remained relatively flat on a quarter sequential basis. Moving onto the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, organic revenue declined 8%. However, the benefits of our restructuring actions are taking hold and helped contribute to an improvement in the operating margin before special items, which increased by more than two full percentage points over the prior year to 6.4%.In the Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions, which are predominately Commercial, organic revenue grew 2% on a combined basis. The operating margin before special items improved approximately 150 basis points year-over-year and remains in the low teens.Turning next to some of our key metrics, our Global Account base grew 3% year-over-year to almost 7.5 million accounts. And excluding the impact of foreign currency, our average revenue per user grew 1% to $46.32. Both our account base and average revenue per user have been steadily increasing throughout the global downturn. While the worldwide attrition rate increased 10 basis points to 13.5% on a quarter sequential basis, it has consistently stayed in the mid-13% range for the last four quarters. Now I'll turn it to Flow Control, which had revenue in the quarter of $923 million with an organic revenue decline of 14%. Balance declined 15%, Water declined 10% and Thermal Control declined 14% through the continued softness in capital spending in our end markets.Before special items, operating income was $118 million and the operating margin was 12.8%. The operating margin performance in the quarter was better than we had expected due to product mix, particularly the seasonal strength of Thermal Control during the winter months. However, the significant volume deleveraging resulted in a 170 basis points decrease in the operating margin before special items year-over-year, as the benefits of cost containment actions and restructuring activities were more than offset by the $130 million organic revenue decline.Excluding currency, the year-over-year order rate decline slowed to 13% from 18% in the prior quarter. On a quarter sequential basis, orders remained relatively flat, excluding the large Pacific Water project we booked in the fourth quarter. Although we continue to see a pickup in quoting activities, we are not yet seeing this translate into a meaningful change in our order levels.  Backlog of $1.65 billion declined 2% on an organic basis, the second consecutive quarter with minimal backlog decline.Turning now to Fire Protection Services, revenue in the quarter was $833 million and the organic revenue declined 6%, as we continue to experience softness in systems installation revenue and, to a much lesser degree, in our service revenue. Service represents about half of Fire's revenue and declined 2% organically, as growth in inspection and maintenance revenue was more than offset by customers delaying other service projects.Systems installation revenue declined 10% organically in the quarter due to weaker demand in our end markets. The backlog of $1.2 billion remain flat on an organic basis, which is encouraging. Before special items, operating income was $64 million and our operating margin was 7.7%. The benefits of cost containment initiatives and restructuring actions are helping to mitigate margin pressure from the lower revenue.Moving on to Safety Products, revenue in the quarter was $358 million with an organic revenue decline of 14%. Organic revenue growth of 4% in Life Safety was more than offset by soft demand in our Fire Suppression and Electronic Security end markets. Organic revenues declined 22% in Fire Suppression and 10% in Electronic Security. Before special items, operating income was $53 million and the operating margin was 14.8%. Better-than-expected operating income in the quarter resulted from product mix, in particular, higher-margin Life Safety and Electronic Security products. On a quarter sequential basis, the benefits of our cost containment initiatives and restructuring actions essentially offset the continued revenue headwind, as well as an increased investment in sales and marketing capabilities and research and development.Lastly, Electrical and Metal Products had revenue of $297 million in the quarter, with an organic revenue decline of 30%. The revenue decline was primarily due to significantly lower selling prices for both steel and copper products. Decreased volume also contributed to the decline, although to a much lesser extent. Operating income before special items of $23 million was about what we had expected. On a year-over-year basis, lower revenue was almost fully offset by improved steel spreads. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect revenue and operating income before special items to be similar to the first quarter. Based on end market demand and pricing activity in the quarter, as well as the seasonal lift we get in the summer months, we continue to expect that operating income before special items for the full year should approximate $120 million in our Electrical and Metal products business. Before I turn the call back over to Ed, let me touch on a few other important items. First, from a cash flow perspective, we had a good start to the year. Our free cash flow in the first quarter was $79 million and included $50 million of payments primarily for restructuring. This compares to a free cash outflow of $215 million in the prior year, which included $25 million of payments primarily related to restructuring. The year-over-year increase in cash flow is primarily attributable to the management of working capital.Next, corporate expense in the quarter was $98 million, which included $2 million in special items. This is somewhat lower than our previous guidance of $110 million, mostly due to the timing of certain expenses. For the second quarter, we expect corporate expense to approximate $110 million and continue to expect our full year corporate expense will approximate $430 million.Next, other income in the quarter of $9 million related to an increase in receivables from Covidien and Tyco Electronics under the tax sharing agreement related to pre-separation taxes. This income was more than offset by a charge reflected in the tax line. Finally, our tax rate for the quarter was 14.9%. This was well below the annual guidance of 19% to 20% due to the accounting timing of certain items. Although the tax rate can move around quarter to quarter, we continue to expect both a second quarter and annual tax rate of 19% to 20%. Now let me turn the call over back to Ed Breen to wrap up this morning's call."

Before we open up the line for questions, I want to spend a few minutes on our guidance for the second quarter and our expectations for the second half of the year. Based on our current order rates and backlog, we expect an organic revenue",595,"Thanks, Chris. Before we open up the line for questions, I want to spend a few minutes on our guidance for the second quarter and our expectations for the second half of the year. Based on our current order rates and backlog, we expect an organic revenue decline of approximately 6% to 8% in the second quarter. Additionally, we expect that foreign exchange rates will favorably impact revenue by approximately 6% year-over-year. Therefore, we expect total revenue in the second quarter, which is seasonally our lowest quarter, to be approximately $4.1 billion. From a business perspective, we see positive growth in ADT's recurring revenue in the 4% range offset by a revenue decline in systems installation and service, which should result in a flattish organic revenue growth rate year-over-year.  However, we expect a sequential decline in operating margin before special items to 14% due to the seasonal nature of our retail business, which traditionally benefits in the first quarter from higher revenue and operating income.Next, we expect continued revenue headwind in Flow Control. We think the second quarter is likely to be our trough quarter with the year-over-year revenue decline resulting in additional volume deleveraging.  In addition, the first quarter benefited from the high margin mix of our seasonally strong Thermal business. For the second quarter, we expect Flow Control revenue to approximate $900 million and the operating income before special items to approximate $100 million. Additionally, the seasonal decline in our Fire business is expected to result in revenue of approximately $800 million in the second quarter, despite the revenue decline. We expect the operating margin before special items to be similar to the first quarter. In Safety Products, we expect an organic revenue decline in the low teens and an operating margin before special items of approximately 14%.Lastly, as Chris mentioned, we expect sequential headwinds related to an increase in both corporate expense and the tax rate in the second quarter in comparison to the first quarter. These increases will cost us approximately $0.08 per share sequentially. From an earnings perspective, this is expected to result in earnings per share from continuing operations before special items in the range of $0.50 to $0.52 per share. As we look to the balance of the year, there are a few items that we expect to be tailwinds in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. First, as Chris mentioned, Electrical and Metal products should have a much better second half of the year due to more favorable volume and pricing for both steel and copper.  As a result, the earnings contribution from this business should be much higher and the second half of the year. Second, our other businesses, particularly ADT and Fire, also have seasonal increases in revenue and income in the third and fourth quarter. Despite the economic environment, we expect both of these businesses to earn at a higher rate in the second half of the year due to their customer base and when work is scheduled.Lastly, we expect Flow Control to exit the low part of the cycle in the second half of the year, which will increase its earnings contribution. Based on our current order activity, which is performing as we expected, and our specific business expectations for the remainder of the year, we continue to see our full year earnings per share before special items to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.50. Thanks for joining us on the conference call. And operator, with that, lets open it up for any questions."

A very little bit in the second half of the year, which would be kind of in the Flow area, but not anything significant. So our guidance is truly based on orders staying at these levels. So you're correct, we see pickup in order activity, that clearly will help the year out that we are not counting on in that guidance. Dean, if I go back, maybe I'll use 2008, which I think was a very typical trend year for the company. We definitely picked up in the second half of the year. If I remember the numbers correctly, our revenue in the second half of that year was $800 million higher than the first half of the year. I thought it was also interesting last year, although you didn't actually see it as much in numbers, but as business was trending down for everybody last year, we actually did have some seasonal lift that occurred. And our revenues were $90 million to $100 million higher in the second half of last year than in the first half, despite the decline we were going through. So we clearly see seasonality. But the biggest pieces are, as I mentioned a minute ago, they're in Fire and they're in ADT and we do an awful lot of work in the spring and summer months when work is scheduled. Number one, because of warm weather. But number two, we have key verticals, like the education vertical that want us to cram all their work into the summer months when their campuses and schools are either closed or less busy. So we clearly see that happen. And we normally do see some lift seasonally in our Flow Control business in the third and fourth quarter. So we're expecting all of that to occur, maybe to a lesser extent with the economy, but it will occur for us. And then as Chris and I both mentioned, Electrical and Metal, I think all the trends we're seeing here will clearly have a stronger second half of the year than first half of the year for us. So I think we're teeing up nice. I would hope that would get us more towards the higher end of our guidance range. I think things would have to fall apart, we'll have to fault the economy a little bit at this point. I think for us to be down the low end of the guidance range that we have been clearly getting off to a very good start in the first quarter with the $0.65, that clearly builds my confidence that we're off to a good start to get there."

So what we're trying to do is sort of just operationalize those areas that can move and realize they can be a swing factor quarter-to-quarter. Again, I think operationally, if you look at our second quarter, the margins in most of our businesses are holding relatively steady. We do have, as we indicated, a decline in the Flow business with again, a fairly significant drop in our organic revenue forecast that will reduce the operating margin in Q2 in the Flow business.

When we separated the company into three, our goal with Tyco International was to end up with these three global platforms, so that we have Flow being one of those key platforms, Fire and then Security. We really like all three platforms. As I've mentioned before, one of the dynamics I like is, they are global, they are all emerging markets. So I think these businesses have nice growth rates in a decent economy. I also like the fact that we're in a very fragmented industries, in Fire, Security and Flow. And so I think there's real opportunity for us both, whether it's organic or bolt-on, to really have a nice organic growth come through there and therefore, good returns to our shareholders, if we're smart about how we go about it. So I do all three platforms just as important, each one is important as the next one, as far as our ability to grow and then get good returns for our shareholders. Flow Control, as you know, down rate,  is a nice steady business with very nice margins. And if the economy hadn't turned down here, I think you would have continued to see us make margin improvement in the business. And I've been pretty impressed over last year that we've actually maintained our margins where we have, despite the downturn. So a very important platform for us and we will continue to expand there and focus there just as much. Let me clarify though, you did see us announce the Brazilian deal and obviously, the Brinks Broadview deal the other week. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, share repurchase will be a part of our future flip process here. We're not just turning the switch over. If there's something good, we can bolt on, we'll put it on. But we're not sitting around here as a management team looking at doing a series of deals just for the sake of doing that. If there's something good with good returns, we'll do it, that really makes sense for us in the global platform. But we're staying very focused on operating the company organically, or as you could tell, I think, by our results, our real intense focus on our operations. And we're not going to lose that, that momentum."

But to be able to get the rebranding out, to be able to get the payment back to the old parent, out of the number right away, to be able to get day one, the tax synergy, because of the way we structured the deal, are all very big swings on the synergy side for us.

Again, it's sort of a low point, is always Q2, and now we'll see that start to rebound across the businesses as volumes starts to pick up and Pacific will not hurt the margins."

Good morning, and thanks to everybody for joining our conference call to discuss Tyco's second quarter results for fiscal year 2010 and the press release that we issued early this morning. With me on today's call are Tyco's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ed Breen; and our Chief Financial Officer, Chris Coughlin. 
Let me start by reminding you that during the course of the call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to look at today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there. 
In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask you to read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release issued this morning and all related tables, as well as the conference call slides can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tyco.com.
Also, with regard to the pending Broadview acquisition, the discussion during today's conference call do not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or solicitation of any vote or approval. The subject matter discussed today related to the Broadview acquisition is addressed in the registration statement on Form S-4, containing a proxy statement and prospectus, which is publicly available and has been filed by Tyco with the SEC. We urge you to read it.
Now let me quickly recap this quarter's results. Revenue in the quarter of $4.2 billion, was up slightly year-over-year, with an organic revenue decline of 5.8%. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco common shareholders was $0.65 per share and included income of $0.06 per share from special items. Before special items, earnings per share was $0.59, and this compared to our guidance of $0.50 to $0.52 per share. 
Before I turn the call over to Ed, let me quickly touch on the Broadview acquisition. We expect the transaction to close on May 14, pending the Brinks shareholder vote on May 12. We'll provide a detailed financial update on the acquisition in our next quarterly call. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Ed Breen."

The second quarter was a good quarter for Tyco on a number of fronts. And importantly, we exited the quarter, feeling encouraged by both our performance and an improving tone in some of our end markets. Our result",1364,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter was a good quarter for Tyco on a number of fronts. And importantly, we exited the quarter, feeling encouraged by both our performance and an improving tone in some of our end markets. 
Our results for the quarter continued to be driven by our cost-containment efforts, coupled with the continued growth of our recurring revenue and service activities. In addition to our operating performance, the quarter also saw a number of other positive developments including: first, our agreement to acquire Broadview Security and combine it with ADT; second, the sale of our French Security business, which was a meaningful step in repositioning our ADT business in Europe; third, an increase in our annual dividend; and lastly, an upgrade in our debt rating from Standard & Poor's to A-. 
Let me start off with a few overall operational comments and then a few thoughts on what we are seeing in each of our businesses. First, our teams continue to execute well on our cost-reduction and restructuring programs, and our restructuring actions will ramp up in the second half of the year. As you all know, we expect our organic revenue to be modestly negative in 2010, lower in the first half of the year, with improvement in the second half of the year. And managing our cost structure to match up with our revenue outlook has been a major focus for us. These efforts continue to pay off and are reflected in our operating margin performance, which was up nicely year-over-year. 
We are also doing a nice job from an asset-management perspective. Our working capital performance continues to be solid, and we are in a strong position with respect to both receivables and inventory. In addition, our free cash flow generation continues to be strong, and we are almost $200 million ahead of the last year's number through the first half of the fiscal year. On a full year basis, we continue to expect free cash flow to approximate net income.
We are also continuing to fully fund our organic growth investment activities in Security, Fire and Flow Control. Year-to-date, our capital spending levels have grown modestly on a year-over-year basis, with a high percentage of our capital going to growth investments. We also continued the fund increases in R&D, particularly in our emerging-market R&D centers, and our R&D expense increased about 4% year-over-year.
From a balance sheet perspective, our cash balance was about $2.7 billion at the end of the quarter, and we expect to use some of this to fund the Broadview acquisition. We are also contemplating bolt-on acquisitions that would use up to an additional $500 million. Even with these cash uses, we will still be in a strong cash position. So we expect to resume repurchasing shares soon after we close the Broadview acquisition. 
I also want to add that we continue to be pleased with everything we see in the Broadview integration planning process, and we have more than 10 functional teams who are actively working on integration planning. The acquisition will not have much impact on our fiscal 2010 EPS. We will only own Broadview for about 1½ quarters, but we continue to feel quite good about the $0.07 of EPS accretion for the first full year, going to $0.14 in year two, assuming a 70/30 equity cash split.
Broadview will increase the recurring revenue in ADT by approximately $500 million to nearly $4.4 billion, and increase the percentage of recurring revenue to about 60% of ADT's Worldwide revenue. The margin impact from the acquisition is also attractive and will ramp up, as we deliver on our cost synergies. We are estimating a 50 basis point margin increase to ADT Worldwide from the acquisition. And this is expected to increase to 150 basis points of impact by the second year. 
Finally, we put out a second press release this morning, announcing our intention to do a tax-free spin of our Electrical and Metal products business to our shareholders. We expect to file documents with the SEC over the next few months and conclude the transaction in the first half of fiscal 2011.
As most of you know, Electrical and Metal products is a high-quality business, but its results are often volatile. We believe it has a bright future as a separate public company, and we believe we are entering the right environment to execute this move. 
I want to now turn to each of our businesses and give you a bit of a feel for what we are seeing in our end markets. In ADT, our recurring revenue continues to perform well. Good account growth, good ARPU and improvement in the disconnect rate, all of which translated into 4% organic revenue growth. 
Revenue in the systems installation business in North America and Europe continue to be soft. But we have seen a nice pick-up in activity in Asia-Pacific, where revenue grew 10% organically in the quarter. Our worldwide order activity in systems installation business was flat sequentially, but we did see good order growth in Asia-Pacific. We are also beginning to see some signs of life in our retailer business, with an improvement in order activity in the quarter. But this business is still significantly below the peak levels of 2007.
Lastly in ADT, we continue to make margin progress in our European operations and exited the quarter with an operating margin of 6.5%, as the benefits of our restructuring actions are taking hold. We would expect our European operating margin to improve by 100 basis points going forward, due to the divestiture of our Security business in France.
Turning to Flow Control, our revenue was in line with our forecast. However, our second quarter results were impacted by a charge for a loss related to a project that we retained as part of the 2008 divestiture of our Earth Tech business. Absent this, our operating margin was better than expected. 
We think, the second quarter was the low point in the cycle, and we are seeing clear signs of improvement in some of our end markets. Backlog was flat on a sequential basis at $1.6 billion, and orders were up 3% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Importantly, our increased quoting activity has begun to translate into order activity, and our order outlook for the third quarter is for continued improvement. 
It is important to remember that we usually have a six-to-nine-month order-to-revenue conversion cycle in Flow Control, so the pick-up in order activity will be more meaningful to 2011 than to our 2010 results. That said, we look to the second half of the year in Flow Control, we expect to see an improvement in our revenue and our income due to a seasonal lift and also due to revenue from the Australian water desalination project that we announced a few quarters ago.
Next, the revenue on our Fire business was about what we expected, and we did a nice job on cost and margins. As we indicated in the press release, backlog grew 1%, which is an encouraging development. Also the second half of the year is typically a seasonally stronger period for this business. 
Next, Safety Products not only had a good quarter operationally, but also began to see an improvement in order activity. Orders grew 5% on a quarter-sequential basis and the tone of business has clearly improved. 
Finally, Electrical and Metal products performed as expected in the quarter. We need a stronger second half to hit our full year forecast, and the strengthening of steel prices we are seeing, along with the seasonal volume increase, supports a stronger second half. 
So overall, the second quarter was a good one for Tyco. I feel good about our cost focus, and I am encouraged by the improving order activity, which is in line with our expected modest pickup in the second half and sets the tone for solid improvement in fiscal 2011.
Now let me turn the call over to Chris to review our operational performance and a few financial items. And then we will review our outlook for the third quarter and full year."
107534,100324843,57931,"Tyco International Ltd., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everybody. Let me start with ADT Worldwide. Revenue of $1.8 billion declined 1.5% organically.

Let me start with ADT Worldwide. Revenue of $1.8 billion declined 1.5% organically. Recurring revenue, which represented over 55% of ADT's total revenue in the quarter, continued to perform well, with organic revenue growth of 4%. However, systems installation and service revenue continued to be soft, with an organic revenue decline of 8% in the quarter. 
Despite this pressure on the top line, the operating margin before special items in the quarter of 14.7% increased 230 basis points over the prior year, with improvement in all geographic regions. Restructuring activities, along with cost-containment actions and growth in our higher-margin recurring revenue business, more than offset the impact of lower systems installation volume.
From a regional perspective within ADT, our North American residential and small business unit grew its recurring revenue 7% organically in the quarter. The operating margin before special items improved two full percentage points over the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, we grew our residential account base by nearly 5% and increased our average revenue per user by 3%. Additionally, our residential attrition rate improved by 20 basis points on a quarter-sequential basis to 13.1%.
Turning to our North American commercial business, our end markets continued to be impacted by the economic downturn. Organic revenue declined 9% in the quarter, but we are starting to see signs of improvement, including sequential growth in orders from retailers. We are encouraged by the improved activity and expect these trends to continue. Our operating margin improved, despite the decline in organic revenue, as the benefits of restructuring and cost-containment actions more than offset the revenue headwind. Additionally, the North American commercial attrition rate improved 40 basis points to 13.6%.
Moving on to Europe, Middle East and Africa, organic revenue declined 6%. The operating margin before special items increased to 6.5%, compared to 3.1% a year ago, primarily due to the benefits of our restructuring actions. As Ed mentioned, we expect our European operating margin to improve by 100 basis points going forward, due to the divestiture of our Security business in France. In addition, there will likely be some further pruning of our European portfolio, but those transactions will be much smaller in size, compared to the Security business in France. 
In the Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions, organic revenue grew 8% on a combined basis. Systems installations and service revenue grew 6% on an organic basis, after four consecutive quarters of an organic-revenue decline. Our operating margin before special items continue to be strong and improved 150 basis points year-over-year.
On a worldwide basis, our key metrics also continued their positive momentum. Our global account base grew 3% year-over-year to $7.4 million accounts and excluding the impact of foreign currency, our average revenue per user grew 1% to $45.91, with growth in all geographic regions. The worldwide attrition rate also improved nicely in the quarter, decreasing 30 basis points to 13.1% on a quarter-sequential basis.
Now let me turn to Flow Control, which had revenue in the quarter of $899 million and an organic revenue decline of 13%. Organic revenue growth in the Thermal Controls business of 2% was more than offset by a 19% organic revenue decline in Valves and Controls and a 7% organic revenue decline in Water. 
Before special items, operating income was $101 million and we included a charge of $9 million for a loss related to a project we retained, as part of the Earth Tech divestiture in 2008. Although we are benefiting from cost-containment actions and restructuring activities, this was more than offset by the volume de-leveraging impact of the $120 million organic revenue decline, resulting in an operating margin before special items of 11.2%. 
Order growth in the quarter turned positive, both year-over-year and on a sequential basis. Excluding currencies, orders increased 3% year-over-year and backlog of $1.63 billion remained flat on a quarter-sequential basis.
Looking ahead to the full year, we continue to expect an organic revenue decline in the high single digits, resulting in revenue of approximately $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. The volume de-leveraging from this organic revenue decline is expected to result in an operating margin before special items of approximately 12.5% for the full year. It's important to keep in mind that the improving order activity will mostly impact our fiscal 2011.
Turning now to Fire Protection Services. Revenue in the quarter was $807 million and organic revenue declined 7%, as we continue to experience softness in systems installation revenue, and to a much lesser degree, our service revenue. Service declined 1% organically. However, the rate of decline has improved over the last few quarters, and we expect service revenue to grow modestly in the second half of the year. On the other hand, systems installation revenue declined 12% organically in the quarter. 
Before special items, operating income was $66 million and our operating margin was 8.2%. The benefits of cost-containment initiatives and restructuring actions helped mitigate the margin pressure from the lower revenue. As Ed mentioned, backlog of $1.2 billion grew 1% on a quarter-sequential basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Due to the seasonal nature of our Fire business, we expect a stronger second half of the year. 
Moving now to Safety Products. Revenue in the quarter was $360 million, with an organic revenue decline of 7%, which was a bit better than we expected. Organic revenue growth of 1% in Electronic Security was more than offset by an organic revenue decline of 12% in Fire Suppression and 3% in Life Safety. The rate of decline over the last few quarters has significantly slowed, and we are starting to see an improvement in our order activity. 
Before special items, operating income was $52 million and the operating margin was 14.4%. Despite the continued revenue headwind, the operating margin remained relatively flat year-over-year due to the benefits of cost-containment initiatives, restructuring actions and better product mix. 
Additionally, the incremental investment in sales and marketing capabilities and R&D cost us about 60 basis points of margin year-over-year. Although this investment is a headwind to our operating margin performance, our sales and marketing and R&D spend is positioning the business for accelerated revenue growth, as business conditions improve.
Lastly, Electrical and Metal products performed as expected. Revenue in the quarter was $336 million and organic revenue declined 3%. Operating income before special items improved to $26 million, a year-over-year improvement of $50 million, driven primarily by substantially lower material costs for steel products. As we look to the second half of the year, we expect to see a seasonal pick-up in volume. Coupled with increased prices for both steel and copper products, we continue to expect the operating income before special items for the full year should approximate $120 million. For the third quarter, we expect revenue of $380 million and operating income before special items of $35 million.
Before I turn the call back over to Ed Breen, let me touch on a few other important items. First, we continue to generate strong cash flow in the quarter. Our free cash flow was $349 million and included $48 million of payments for restructuring. Year-to-date, free cash flow of $428 million, compared to $239 million last year. 
Next, corporate expense before special items in the quarter was $97 million. This was lower than our previous guidance of $110 million, mostly due to tighter cost containment and the timing of certain expenses. For the third quarter, we expect corporate expense to be approximately $105 million, and we now expect that our full year corporate expense will approximate $450 million. 
Next, our tax rate, excluding special items was 16.6% in the quarter, as we continue to be successful in our tax-planning activities. We are now reducing our full year tax rate guidance to 17% to 18% from our previous range of 19% to 20%. 
I also want to touch quickly on restructuring. To date, we have incurred approximately $32 million of restructuring charges, compared to our estimate of $100 million to $150 million for the year. As Ed mentioned, we'll be ramping up our restructuring spend in the second half of the year and expect that our full year restructuring charges will be toward the high end of the range. These actions provide very good payback and had significantly helped us reduce our cost structure and make our operations more efficient.
Now let me turn the call back over to Ed to wrap up this morning's call."
107534,100324843,57931,"Tyco International Ltd., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thanks, Chris. Now let's turn to our guidance for the third quarter. First, we expect revenue of approximately $4.25 billion, a modest increase over the second quarter. Although improving business conditions will result in a nice sequential improvement in",430,"Thanks, Chris. Now let's turn to our guidance for the third quarter. First, we expect revenue of approximately $4.25 billion, a modest increase over the second quarter. Although improving business conditions will result in a nice sequential improvement in our third quarter operating results, this will be partially offset by increased corporate expense and a higher tax rate. 
Let me comment on a few of these moving pieces. As I said, we expect a sequential improvement in operations, particularly in ADT, due to the seasonal nature of our Security business, as well as a pick-up in Flow Control. Electrical and Metal products is also expected to contribute nicely. This operational improvement is expected to increase our earnings by approximately $0.06 on a quarter-sequential basis.
Second, the expected increase in corporate expense to $105 million in the third quarter, which compares to $97 million in the second quarter, will cost us about $0.01 per share. And finally, we are forecasting a 17% to 18% tax rate, adjusted for special items for the full year. Given the lower tax rate we had in the second quarter, this will result in a sequential headwind of approximately $0.03 per share. 
When combined, these items result in a net increase to earnings of $0.02 per share on a quarter-sequential basis. Therefore, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations before special items in the third quarter to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.62. 
Based on our year-to-date performance and our guidance for the third quarter, we are increasing our full year earnings guidance to a range of $2.50 to $2.58 per share, compared to our previous guidance of $2.30 to $2.50 share. 
Our full year guidance incorporates better-than-expected operating results in the second half of our fiscal year, partially offset by increased corporate and tax expense when compared to the first half of fiscal 2010. We continue to expect full year revenue of approximately $17 billion despite the strengthening U.S. dollar over the last few months. 
Given that Broadview will only be part of Tyco for a quarter and a half, we have excluded the impact of Broadview from our guidance numbers provided on this call. Additionally, Broadview will not have a meaningful impact on our full year 2010 EPS. 
Finally, we feel good about the operational improvements we have made in our businesses and are encouraged by our increasing order activity. These items, along with the strategic actions we have made this year, should position Tyco for a stronger 2011. 
Operator, with that, now let's open up the lines for any questions."

And we've had the significant reviews with our teams in the last weeks, and that's why we say we're pretty confident we're going to be near the high end of that range. These programs just still have very good paybacks. They average out just a little over a two-year payback. So you can extrapolate the tailwind that, that gives us with these extra actions we're taking. And Jeff, I would categorize most of these actions as back office simplification moves still that we're making within businesses and actually combining some things between businesses in geographic regions.

As you know, we've been test marketing this in quite a few markets. We're feeling positive about it. We're still working on what our pricing model will be for that. But that's also moving the consumer off to more options that are available and therefore, a higher ARPU to those that want to take the interactive service. So we're feeling good about the ARPU that we've had. But we're really trying to plan out the next couple of years as to how we keep that momentum going, which would obviously be a positive more on the margin side. I'd also point out a couple of things you heard Chris mention on North America. I'm not declaring we've turned a quarter here. But with the economy improving some and some of our internal actions, it was nice to see the disco rates start to drift down finally, globally and specifically on the North America, which is a nice help because that's high-margin business.

And then when we ended 2009, through all the restructuring actions and cost containment actions we took, by the time we ended 2009, the margins were still at 14.3% despite, a give or take, a $600 million decline in revenue. And now this year, we're having -- the first two quarters have been our, as we said, our trough quarters here with revenue declining even more. And so we've been having a harder time holding that margin there. So as Chris mentioned in the guidance, we think the margins for this year will be about 12.5%. So we just couldn't keep up with the fixed-cost base that we have in that business as much. But I think you can see that a lot of actions we took really held us in there, considering revenue has dropped from $4.4 billion at the peak to around $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. And again, with the order activity turning, once you start pumping more revenue through that fixed-cost base, we should be in good shape. But maybe I give it to you one other way. If we're in the trough with margins around 12½%, that's 300 to 400 basis points better than the trough of this business back earlier in the decade and probably even more than that.

Flow didn't surprise me only because of the order activity. But Flow, I would consider more mid than late cycle. But we are seeing it there. And the other area we're seeing it is in Asia across-the-board, even in the non-resi stuff we saw pick up as we mentioned. And we're seeing some pickup, I'd say modest, but pickup in our retailer business, which was severely impacted starting about two years ago or a year and a half ago. So that's kind of the green shooting areas where we're not seeing the lift yet and again, I'm not surprised by this.

Good morning, and thanks to everybody for joining our conference call to discuss Tyco's second quarter results for fiscal year 2010 and the press release that we issued early this morning. With me on today's call are Tyco's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ed Breen; and our Chief Financial Officer, Chris Coughlin. 
Let me start by reminding you that during the course of the call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to look at today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there. 
In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask you to read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release issued this morning and all related tables, as well as the conference call slides can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tyco.com.
Also, with regard to the pending Broadview acquisition, the discussion during today's conference call do not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or solicitation of any vote or approval. The subject matter discussed today related to the Broadview acquisition is addressed in the registration statement on Form S-4, containing a proxy statement and prospectus, which is publicly available and has been filed by Tyco with the SEC. We urge you to read it.
Now let me quickly recap this quarter's results. Revenue in the quarter of $4.2 billion, was up slightly year-over-year, with an organic revenue decline of 5.8%. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco common shareholders was $0.65 per share and included income of $0.06 per share from special items. Before special items, earnings per share was $0.59, and this compared to our guidance of $0.50 to $0.52 per share. 
Before I turn the call over to Ed, let me quickly touch on the Broadview acquisition. We expect the transaction to close on May 14, pending the Brinks shareholder vote on May 12. We'll provide a detailed financial update on the acquisition in our next quarterly call. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Ed Breen.

The second quarter was a good quarter for Tyco on a number of fronts. And importantly, we exited the quarter, feeling encouraged by both our performance and an improving tone in some of our end markets. Our result",1364,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter was a good quarter for Tyco on a number of fronts. And importantly, we exited the quarter, feeling encouraged by both our performance and an improving tone in some of our end markets. 
Our results for the quarter continued to be driven by our cost-containment efforts, coupled with the continued growth of our recurring revenue and service activities. In addition to our operating performance, the quarter also saw a number of other positive developments including: first, our agreement to acquire Broadview Security and combine it with ADT; second, the sale of our French Security business, which was a meaningful step in repositioning our ADT business in Europe; third, an increase in our annual dividend; and lastly, an upgrade in our debt rating from Standard & Poor's to A-. 
Let me start off with a few overall operational comments and then a few thoughts on what we are seeing in each of our businesses. First, our teams continue to execute well on our cost-reduction and restructuring programs, and our restructuring actions will ramp up in the second half of the year. As you all know, we expect our organic revenue to be modestly negative in 2010, lower in the first half of the year, with improvement in the second half of the year. And managing our cost structure to match up with our revenue outlook has been a major focus for us. These efforts continue to pay off and are reflected in our operating margin performance, which was up nicely year-over-year. 
We are also doing a nice job from an asset-management perspective. Our working capital performance continues to be solid, and we are in a strong position with respect to both receivables and inventory. In addition, our free cash flow generation continues to be strong, and we are almost $200 million ahead of the last year's number through the first half of the fiscal year. On a full year basis, we continue to expect free cash flow to approximate net income.
We are also continuing to fully fund our organic growth investment activities in Security, Fire and Flow Control. Year-to-date, our capital spending levels have grown modestly on a year-over-year basis, with a high percentage of our capital going to growth investments. We also continued the fund increases in R&D, particularly in our emerging-market R&D centers, and our R&D expense increased about 4% year-over-year.
From a balance sheet perspective, our cash balance was about $2.7 billion at the end of the quarter, and we expect to use some of this to fund the Broadview acquisition. We are also contemplating bolt-on acquisitions that would use up to an additional $500 million. Even with these cash uses, we will still be in a strong cash position. So we expect to resume repurchasing shares soon after we close the Broadview acquisition. 
I also want to add that we continue to be pleased with everything we see in the Broadview integration planning process, and we have more than 10 functional teams who are actively working on integration planning. The acquisition will not have much impact on our fiscal 2010 EPS. We will only own Broadview for about 1½ quarters, but we continue to feel quite good about the $0.07 of EPS accretion for the first full year, going to $0.14 in year two, assuming a 70/30 equity cash split.
Broadview will increase the recurring revenue in ADT by approximately $500 million to nearly $4.4 billion, and increase the percentage of recurring revenue to about 60% of ADT's Worldwide revenue. The margin impact from the acquisition is also attractive and will ramp up, as we deliver on our cost synergies. We are estimating a 50 basis point margin increase to ADT Worldwide from the acquisition. And this is expected to increase to 150 basis points of impact by the second year. 
Finally, we put out a second press release this morning, announcing our intention to do a tax-free spin of our Electrical and Metal products business to our shareholders. We expect to file documents with the SEC over the next few months and conclude the transaction in the first half of fiscal 2011.
As most of you know, Electrical and Metal products is a high-quality business, but its results are often volatile. We believe it has a bright future as a separate public company, and we believe we are entering the right environment to execute this move. 
I want to now turn to each of our businesses and give you a bit of a feel for what we are seeing in our end markets. In ADT, our recurring revenue continues to perform well. Good account growth, good ARPU and improvement in the disconnect rate, all of which translated into 4% organic revenue growth. 
Revenue in the systems installation business in North America and Europe continue to be soft. But we have seen a nice pick-up in activity in Asia-Pacific, where revenue grew 10% organically in the quarter. Our worldwide order activity in systems installation business was flat sequentially, but we did see good order growth in Asia-Pacific. We are also beginning to see some signs of life in our retailer business, with an improvement in order activity in the quarter. But this business is still significantly below the peak levels of 2007.
Lastly in ADT, we continue to make margin progress in our European operations and exited the quarter with an operating margin of 6.5%, as the benefits of our restructuring actions are taking hold. We would expect our European operating margin to improve by 100 basis points going forward, due to the divestiture of our Security business in France.
Turning to Flow Control, our revenue was in line with our forecast. However, our second quarter results were impacted by a charge for a loss related to a project that we retained as part of the 2008 divestiture of our Earth Tech business. Absent this, our operating margin was better than expected. 
We think, the second quarter was the low point in the cycle, and we are seeing clear signs of improvement in some of our end markets. Backlog was flat on a sequential basis at $1.6 billion, and orders were up 3% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Importantly, our increased quoting activity has begun to translate into order activity, and our order outlook for the third quarter is for continued improvement. 
It is important to remember that we usually have a six-to-nine-month order-to-revenue conversion cycle in Flow Control, so the pick-up in order activity will be more meaningful to 2011 than to our 2010 results. That said, we look to the second half of the year in Flow Control, we expect to see an improvement in our revenue and our income due to a seasonal lift and also due to revenue from the Australian water desalination project that we announced a few quarters ago.
Next, the revenue on our Fire business was about what we expected, and we did a nice job on cost and margins. As we indicated in the press release, backlog grew 1%, which is an encouraging development. Also the second half of the year is typically a seasonally stronger period for this business. 
Next, Safety Products not only had a good quarter operationally, but also began to see an improvement in order activity. Orders grew 5% on a quarter-sequential basis and the tone of business has clearly improved. 
Finally, Electrical and Metal products performed as expected in the quarter. We need a stronger second half to hit our full year forecast, and the strengthening of steel prices we are seeing, along with the seasonal volume increase, supports a stronger second half. 
So overall, the second quarter was a good one for Tyco. I feel good about our cost focus, and I am encouraged by the improving order activity, which is in line with our expected modest pickup in the second half and sets the tone for solid improvement in fiscal 2011.
Now let me turn the call over to Chris to review our operational performance and a few financial items. And then we will review our outlook for the third quarter and full year.
"
107534,100324843,58299,"Tyco International Ltd., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everybody. Let me start with ADT Worldwide. Revenue of $1.8 billion declined 1.5% organically. Recurring revenue, which represented over 55% of ADT's total revenue in the quarter, continued to perform well, with organic reven",1414,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everybody. Let me start with ADT Worldwide. Revenue of $1.8 billion declined 1.5% organically. Recurring revenue, which represented over 55% of ADT's total revenue in the quarter, continued to perform well, with organic revenue growth of 4%. However, systems installation and service revenue continued to be soft, with an organic revenue decline of 8% in the quarter. 
Despite this pressure on the top line, the operating margin before special items in the quarter of 14.7% increased 230 basis points over the prior year, with improvement in all geographic regions. Restructuring activities, along with cost-containment actions and growth in our higher-margin recurring revenue business, more than offset the impact of lower systems installation volume.
From a regional perspective within ADT, our North American residential and small business unit grew its recurring revenue 7% organically in the quarter. The operating margin before special items improved two full percentage points over the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, we grew our residential account base by nearly 5% and increased our average revenue per user by 3%. Additionally, our residential attrition rate improved by 20 basis points on a quarter-sequential basis to 13.1%.
Turning to our North American commercial business, our end markets continued to be impacted by the economic downturn. Organic revenue declined 9% in the quarter, but we are starting to see signs of improvement, including sequential growth in orders from retailers. We are encouraged by the improved activity and expect these trends to continue. Our operating margin improved, despite the decline in organic revenue, as the benefits of restructuring and cost-containment actions more than offset the revenue headwind. Additionally, the North American commercial attrition rate improved 40 basis points to 13.6%.
Moving on to Europe, Middle East and Africa, organic revenue declined 6%. The operating margin before special items increased to 6.5%, compared to 3.1% a year ago, primarily due to the benefits of our restructuring actions. As Ed mentioned, we expect our European operating margin to improve by 100 basis points going forward, due to the divestiture of our Security business in France. In addition, there will likely be some further pruning of our European portfolio, but those transactions will be much smaller in size, compared to the Security business in France. 
In the Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions, organic revenue grew 8% on a combined basis. Systems installations and service revenue grew 6% on an organic basis, after four consecutive quarters of an organic-revenue decline. Our operating margin before special items continue to be strong and improved 150 basis points year-over-year.
On a worldwide basis, our key metrics also continued their positive momentum. Our global account base grew 3% year-over-year to $7.4 million accounts and excluding the impact of foreign currency, our average revenue per user grew 1% to $45.91, with growth in all geographic regions. The worldwide attrition rate also improved nicely in the quarter, decreasing 30 basis points to 13.1% on a quarter-sequential basis.
Now let me turn to Flow Control, which had revenue in the quarter of $899 million and an organic revenue decline of 13%. Organic revenue growth in the Thermal Controls business of 2% was more than offset by a 19% organic revenue decline in Valves and Controls and a 7% organic revenue decline in Water. 
Before special items, operating income was $101 million and we included a charge of $9 million for a loss related to a project we retained, as part of the Earth Tech divestiture in 2008. Although we are benefiting from cost-containment actions and restructuring activities, this was more than offset by the volume de-leveraging impact of the $120 million organic revenue decline, resulting in an operating margin before special items of 11.2%. 
Order growth in the quarter turned positive, both year-over-year and on a sequential basis. Excluding currencies, orders increased 3% year-over-year and backlog of $1.63 billion remained flat on a quarter-sequential basis.
Looking ahead to the full year, we continue to expect an organic revenue decline in the high single digits, resulting in revenue of approximately $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. The volume de-leveraging from this organic revenue decline is expected to result in an operating margin before special items of approximately 12.5% for the full year. It's important to keep in mind that the improving order activity will mostly impact our fiscal 2011.
Turning now to Fire Protection Services. Revenue in the quarter was $807 million and organic revenue declined 7%, as we continue to experience softness in systems installation revenue, and to a much lesser degree, our service revenue. Service declined 1% organically. However, the rate of decline has improved over the last few quarters, and we expect service revenue to grow modestly in the second half of the year. On the other hand, systems installation revenue declined 12% organically in the quarter. 
Before special items, operating income was $66 million and our operating margin was 8.2%. The benefits of cost-containment initiatives and restructuring actions helped mitigate the margin pressure from the lower revenue. As Ed mentioned, backlog of $1.2 billion grew 1% on a quarter-sequential basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Due to the seasonal nature of our Fire business, we expect a stronger second half of the year. 
Moving now to Safety Products. Revenue in the quarter was $360 million, with an organic revenue decline of 7%, which was a bit better than we expected. Organic revenue growth of 1% in Electronic Security was more than offset by an organic revenue decline of 12% in Fire Suppression and 3% in Life Safety. The rate of decline over the last few quarters has significantly slowed, and we are starting to see an improvement in our order activity. 
Before special items, operating income was $52 million and the operating margin was 14.4%. Despite the continued revenue headwind, the operating margin remained relatively flat year-over-year due to the benefits of cost-containment initiatives, restructuring actions and better product mix. 
Additionally, the incremental investment in sales and marketing capabilities and R&D cost us about 60 basis points of margin year-over-year. Although this investment is a headwind to our operating margin performance, our sales and marketing and R&D spend is positioning the business for accelerated revenue growth, as business conditions improve.
Lastly, Electrical and Metal products performed as expected. Revenue in the quarter was $336 million and organic revenue declined 3%. Operating income before special items improved to $26 million, a year-over-year improvement of $50 million, driven primarily by substantially lower material costs for steel products. As we look to the second half of the year, we expect to see a seasonal pick-up in volume. Coupled with increased prices for both steel and copper products, we continue to expect the operating income before special items for the full year should approximate $120 million. For the third quarter, we expect revenue of $380 million and operating income before special items of $35 million.
Before I turn the call back over to Ed Breen, let me touch on a few other important items. First, we continue to generate strong cash flow in the quarter. Our free cash flow was $349 million and included $48 million of payments for restructuring. Year-to-date, free cash flow of $428 million, compared to $239 million last year. 
Next, corporate expense before special items in the quarter was $97 million. This was lower than our previous guidance of $110 million, mostly due to tighter cost containment and the timing of certain expenses. For the third quarter, we expect corporate expense to be approximately $105 million, and we now expect that our full year corporate expense will approximate $450 million. 
Next, our tax rate, excluding special items was 16.6% in the quarter, as we continue to be successful in our tax-planning activities. We are now reducing our full year tax rate guidance to 17% to 18% from our previous range of 19% to 20%. 
I also want to touch quickly on restructuring. To date, we have incurred approximately $32 million of restructuring charges, compared to our estimate of $100 million to $150 million for the year. As Ed mentioned, we'll be ramping up our restructuring spend in the second half of the year and expect that our full year restructuring charges will be toward the high end of the range. These actions provide very good payback and had significantly helped us reduce our cost structure and make our operations more efficient.
Now let me turn the call back over to Ed to wrap up this morning's call.
"
107534,100324843,58299,"Tyco International Ltd., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thanks, Chris. Now let's turn to our guidance for the third quarter. First, we expect revenue of approximately $4.25 billion, a modest increase over the second quarter. Although improving business conditions will result in a nice sequential improvement in",430,"Thanks, Chris. Now let's turn to our guidance for the third quarter. First, we expect revenue of approximately $4.25 billion, a modest increase over the second quarter. Although improving business conditions will result in a nice sequential improvement in our third quarter operating results, this will be partially offset by increased corporate expense and a higher tax rate. 
Let me comment on a few of these moving pieces. As I said, we expect a sequential improvement in operations, particularly in ADT, due to the seasonal nature of our Security business, as well as a pick-up in Flow Control. Electrical and Metal products is also expected to contribute nicely. This operational improvement is expected to increase our earnings by approximately $0.06 on a quarter-sequential basis.
Second, the expected increase in corporate expense to $105 million in the third quarter, which compares to $97 million in the second quarter, will cost us about $0.01 per share. And finally, we are forecasting a 17% to 18% tax rate, adjusted for special items for the full year. Given the lower tax rate we had in the second quarter, this will result in a sequential headwind of approximately $0.03 per share. 
When combined, these items result in a net increase to earnings of $0.02 per share on a quarter-sequential basis. Therefore, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations before special items in the third quarter to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.62. 
Based on our year-to-date performance and our guidance for the third quarter, we are increasing our full year earnings guidance to a range of $2.50 to $2.58 per share, compared to our previous guidance of $2.30 to $2.50 share. 
Our full year guidance incorporates better-than-expected operating results in the second half of our fiscal year, partially offset by increased corporate and tax expense when compared to the first half of fiscal 2010. We continue to expect full year revenue of approximately $17 billion despite the strengthening U.S. dollar over the last few months. 
Given that Broadview will only be part of Tyco for a quarter and a half, we have excluded the impact of Broadview from our guidance numbers provided on this call. Additionally, Broadview will not have a meaningful impact on our full year 2010 EPS. 
Finally, we feel good about the operational improvements we have made in our businesses and are encouraged by our increasing order activity. These items, along with the strategic actions we have made this year, should position Tyco for a stronger 2011. 
Operator, with that, now let's open up the lines for any questions.

And I did just see this morning, our order activity for April in the Flow Control business, and it was up 10% year-over-year.

And we've had the significant reviews with our teams in the last weeks, and that's why we say we're pretty confident we're going to be near the high end of that range. These programs just still have very good paybacks. They average out just a little over a two-year payback. So you can extrapolate the tailwind that, that gives us with these extra actions we're taking. And Jeff, I would categorize most of these actions as back office simplification moves still that we're making within businesses and actually combining some things between businesses in geographic regions. So more on that side, not as much on the factory footprint side, which as you know is not as big in Tyco as many of the other industrial companies. So it's those types of actions.

As you know, we've been test marketing this in quite a few markets. We're feeling positive about it. We're still working on what our pricing model will be for that. But that's also moving the consumer off to more options that are available and therefore, a higher ARPU to those that want to take the interactive service. So we're feeling good about the ARPU that we've had. But we're really trying to plan out the next couple of years as to how we keep that momentum going, which would obviously be a positive more on the margin side. I'd also point out a couple of things you heard Chris mention on North America. I'm not declaring we've turned a quarter here. But with the economy improving some and some of our internal actions, it was nice to see the disco rates start to drift down finally, globally and specifically on the North America, which is a nice help because that's high-margin business. When you lose it, it's margin you're losing. So having that start to drift down is a good sign.

But if you look at our third quarter that we're in now, I would say by the time the quarter is done -- according to our forecast and by the way, reorders are a little tougher to forecast than revenue. You never know when pockets are going to come in. But it looks like we would be between 7% to 10% order growth in Flow for aggregate in the third quarter, and that's a year-over-year comment, so nice pickup. And by the way, the fact that April was 10%, I think bodes well that hopefully, we end somewhere in that range. I wouldn't want to put a forecast on fourth quarter orders yet. But these quotes are -- as we said, our quoting activity is pretty broad-based. We are bidding on some bigger projects that are out there that hadn't been around during the last year.

Each has now made some changes that based on our interpretation would allow them to include Tyco on a go-forward basis. When they make those decisions is really up to them.

And then when we ended 2009, through all the restructuring actions and cost containment actions we took, by the time we ended 2009, the margins were still at 14.3% despite, a give or take, a $600 million decline in revenue. And now this year, we're having -- the first two quarters have been our, as we said, our trough quarters here with revenue declining even more. And so we've been having a harder time holding that margin there. So as Chris mentioned in the guidance, we think the margins for this year will be about 12.5%. So we just couldn't keep up with the fixed-cost base that we have in that business as much. But I think you can see that a lot of actions we took really held us in there, considering revenue has dropped from $4.4 billion at the peak to around $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. And again, with the order activity turning, once you start pumping more revenue through that fixed-cost base, we should be in good shape. But maybe I give it to you one other way. If we're in the trough with margins around 12½%, that's 300 to 400 basis points better than the trough of this business back earlier in the decade and probably even more than that. So we've really toned down the overhead of this business. And hopefully, again, as revenue comes back, we'll get that benefit.

If you kind of go through the pieces, I give you the green shoots and I guess no green shoots yet, Flow clearly improved. Electrical & Metal improved somewhat of a very severe bottom. And our TSP business improved some. And that, I'm not surprised by that. I'm sure it's cycle manufacturing businesses that we have, so that didn't surprise me. Flow didn't surprise me only because of the order activity. But Flow, I would consider more mid than late cycle. But we are seeing it there. And the other area we're seeing it is in Asia across-the-board, even in the non-resi stuff we saw pick up as we mentioned. And we're seeing some pickup, I'd say modest, but pickup in our retailer business, which was severely impacted starting about two years ago or a year and a half ago. So that's kind of the green shooting areas where we're not seeing the lift yet and again, I'm not surprised by this. It's in the non-resi commercial installation businesses in North America and Europe, and I would think they would be the last ones to come back.

 Now let me quickly recap this quarter’s results. Revenue in the quarter are 4.3 billion was up 3% year-over-year with flat organic revenue. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco common shareholders was $0.50 per share and included $0.22 per share related to special items. Before special items, earnings per share was $0.72 compared to our guidance of $0.60 to $0.62 per share. The $0.72 per share compares to the midpoint of our guidance of $0.61. The $0.11 difference consisted primarily of $0.7 of better operating results, $0.10 attributable to a lower tax rate offset by a net fixed end charge for a legal reserve and a benefit from certain pension plan changes.
 Now let me turn the call over to Ed Breen for some opening comments. Ed will be followed by Naren who will discuss our ADT business and then Chris will review the results from our other businesses before we wrap up and take your questions.

107534,108794777,71282,"Tyco International Ltd., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives"," Thanks Antonella and good morning everyone. Overall, this was a good quarter for Tyco. From an operational perspective, we saw sequential improvement in revenue and operating margin across all business segments. Additionally, we completed the acquisition",777," Thanks Antonella and good morning everyone. Overall, this was a good quarter for Tyco. From an operational perspective, we saw sequential improvement in revenue and operating margin across all business segments. Additionally, we completed the acquisition of Broadview Security and are well underway with the integration process and are very excited about the opportunities of joining the best of both ADT and Broadview.
 From a capital perspective, we invested more to strengthen our businesses and returned excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Let me start off with a few overall comments. First, the majority of our segments, including the service side of our fire business grew revenue organically year-over-year. The systems installation and service side of our ADT business turned positive after 6 consecutive quarters of organic revenue decline.
 Operating margins improved both year-over-year and sequentially, driven by our close management efforts and a continued growth of our recurring revenue and service activities. Additionally, increased volume in our product and manufacturing businesses also contributed to the operating margin’s improvement. From an orders perspective, it’s important to keep in mind that our service and recurring revenue businesses have been growing and represent 40% of our total revenue. Orders for the remaining 60% of our portfolio, which is our product and systems installation revenue grew 5% year-over-year on a global basis with order growth and flow control, fire and safety products.
 Second, our free cash flow generation continues to be strong and provides us with the financial flexibility to fund our organic growth investment activities, make selective acquisitions and return excess cash to our shareholders.
 As we indicated last quarter, we resumed our share repurchase program and to date, we’ve purchased 15.8 million shares for $575 million. We expect to continue repurchasing shares during the fourth quarter and will likely utilize the remaining 325 million authorization under the program by our fiscal yearend. Now let me make a few quick comments or two about each of our businesses and then Naren and Chris will provide you with more details in a few minutes.
 Starting with ADT, our recurring revenue continued to perform well with 4% organic revenue growth. Excluding Broadview, our account base and [indiscernible] both increased and our disconnect rate continued to improve. Additionally, the systems installation business has stabilized. Growth in the Asia Pacific and Latin American regions and improving conditions in North America offset the continued softness in Europe. We also saw continued improvement in our operating margin, both sequentially and year-over-year. Growth in our higher margin recurring revenue business, coupled with the benefits of restructuring activities and cost actions as well as improved productivity and mix in our systems installation business contributed nicely to the operating margin improvement.
 Turning to flow control, performance in the quarter was as expected. Sequential improvement in revenue and operating income and continued growth and order activity. The announced divestiture of our waterworks business in Europe is another step in focusing our portfolio on industries and products that we can leverage on a global basis. This business, which sells to markets in Europe makes products such as hydrants, fittings, couplings and valves primarily for the transmission and distribution of water for residential use. Our intention is to grow our flow control business with global products and services that utilize advanced technology and critical applications.
 Next, our fire business had operating margin improvement both sequentially and year-over-year despite the continued pressure on the top line. More importantly, the quarter marked a turning point to positive order activity and backlog continued to grow.
 Next, the continued investments we have made in our safety products business to fund our growth plans and maintain our R&D sales and marketing spin throughout the economic downturn are starting to pay off. We are well positioned for a recovery and have seen the benefit of increased volume in our operating margin which improved 350 basis points year-over-year.
 And finally, electric or metal products performed a bit better than expected in the quarter due to improved pricing for both steel and copper products. The previously announce tax re-spin of this business to our shareholders continues to move forward and we are tracking to complete the separation within the first half of our fiscal year of 2011.
 Overall, we saw improving conditions across all our businesses in the quarter. The top line stabilized, operating margins increased and order activity improved. Additionally, we made good progress focusing our portfolio around our 3 core platforms of security, fire and flow control.
 Now, let me turn the call over to Naran to review our performance in ADT and provide you with an update on the Broadview integration process.

ADT continued to show good progress against all of our key financial and operating metrics. Revenue in the quarter was $1.8 billion with organic revenue growth for the first time in several quarters growing at 3%. Recurring revenue continued to grow nicely at 4%, driven by our North America residential and small business operations. We also continued to see nice recurring revenue growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America.
 Systems installation and service revenue grew slightly on our organic basis, up almost half a percent. While we still saw declines in North America and EMEA, the decline grew very large compared to what we’ve seen in the past. These declines were offset by 17% organic revenue growth in the rest of the world.
 Before special items, operating income was $275 million and the operating margin was 15.1%. Excluding the impact of Broadview, and a $12 million benefit from the quarter related to certain pension plan changes, the operating income before special items was $271 million and the operating margin was 15.3%, a 170 basis point improvement year-over-year. While a portion of this improvement is a result of our improved business mix with more of the higher margin recurring revenue, we are also reaping the benefits of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives including our operation of excellence initiatives.
 We also saw continued progress in improving customer attention, with a 30 basis point improvement in our attrition rate to 12.8%. Our accounts phase now stands at over 8.8 million recurring customers, including the addition of the Broadview account base of 1.4 million customers. Excluding Broadview, we grew our account base by 3% and our average revenue per user grew 1% to $45.72 excluding the impact of foreign currency, which is consistent with what we’ve seen over the past several quarters.
 As Broadview’s customer base was nearly 100% residential compared to ADT’s mix of residential and commercial customers, the new blended overall decreased by 4% to $43.42 per account. In terms of regional performance, we continue to see solid performance in our North America residential business where units and upward growth were consistent with what we’ve seen over the past several quarters.
 Although the commercial side of our North America business remains soft, we are seeing increased activities in certain vertical markets like retail. Despite the 3% decline in organic revenue, our operating margin improved 110 basis points year-over-year as the benefits of our restructuring and cost containment actions more than offset the revenue head wind.
 In EMEA, we continue to see strong margin improvement in both the UK and Continental Europe. The operating margin before special items of 12.1% increased 820 basis points year-over-year and 560 basis points on a quarter sequential basis. These results included a $12 million benefit related to certain pension plan changes which contributed 300 basis points to the margin improvement. With these trends, we continue to feel good about achieving our 10% target by the end of 2011.
 In the rest of the world, which include several of our key emerging markets, we are seeing solid top and bottom line growth. Growth was 10% for recurring revenue, plus systems installation and service revenue growth was in the mid to high teens. We continue to invest in emerging markets and remain excited by the opportunities we see there.
 Much of our focus during the third quarter was on the closing of the Broadview acquisition and the initial stages of integration of this business into our North America residential and small business platform. As you are aware, we closed the deal in the middle of May so our results include about 6 weeks of Broadview this quarter. Broadview’s impact on the quarter was an operating loss of $8 million, primarily driven by the purchase accounting impact of the transaction that we mentioned when we announced the deal.
 As we move forward, it will become more difficult to call our Broadview’s results separately as we are fully integrating the business into our ADT residential and small business platform. We’ve adapted the best of both approach to integration and are committed to leveraging the best people, processes and technology from both organizations as we build our new ADT North America residential business.
 John Koch, who’s been leading our ADT North America business for the past 4 years will lead this combined business. John has assembled a leadership team that includes several key leaders from those ADT and Broadview. We are very pleased with the progress we’ve made so far in our integration approach, and we remain confident that we’ll deliver on the synergy and accretion expectations that we stated when we announced the deal.
 On a fiscal year basis, we expect the impact to be neutral in fiscal 2010 and accretive by about $0.10 in fiscal 2011. Decrease in estimates include the impact of non cash purchase accounting charges. Looking at this on a cash basis, the fiscal 2011 accretion is actually $0.18 per share. Much of our current efforts are focused on the marketing side. As we prepare to migrate away from the Broadview and consolidate all of our lead generation to the ADT brand, we expect to finalize this transition during the fourth quarter.
 We’ve also begun to train our sales teams on the standards of our product offerings and are moving forward to integrate our field teams into a common management structure. In addition, we’ve focused considerable time and effort on communications with both our customers and our employees. While we’re still early in the process, the response from customers appear to be favorable with both businesses showing modest improvements in retention on a quarter sequential basis.
 Finally, I thought I’d comment on the roll out of our new interactive services platform, ADT Pulse. As we indicated in the past, we launched our operational pilots during the third quarter and are currently offering these solutions in 5 test markets across the country. These are operational pilots focused on developing our capabilities to sell, install and service the new solutions which combine light safety with life style.
 The initial customer response has been positive with no marketing and advertising support. We are also seeing a nice pickup in our installation fees and our [indiscernible]. We are currently ramping up our training efforts and expect to expand from our current pilot approach to a full market by market national roll out later this calendar year. I look forward to updating you on our progress with ADT Pulse during future calls.
 Before I turn it over to Chris, let me provide you with our guidance for the fourth quarter. We expect revenue to approximate $1.9 billion with an operating margin before special items of approximately 16%.
 Now let me turn the call over to Chris.

The transaction is expected to close in our fourth qua",1320," Thanks, Naren and good morning everyone. I’ll start with flow control. As Ed mentioned, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our waterworks business in Europe for approximately $245 million. The transaction is expected to close in our fourth quarter, and is now reported in discontinued operations. On an annual basis, this business generates about $350 million of revenue with an operating margin in the high single digits.
 Approximately one penny per share in the quarter, an estimated $0.5 per share for the year has moved to discontinued operations. During the quarter, flow control had revenue of $849 million which again excludes the revenue from our European Waterworks business. Organic revenue declined 7% as the 11% growth in water and the 16% growth in thermal control were more than offset by a 17% decline in the valves business. As expected the organic revenue decline has moderated. The 7% decline this quarter compares to a 14% decline in the first quarter and a 13% decline in the second quarter.  Before special items operating income was $119 million and the operating margin was 14%. Despite the volume de-leveraging, the operating margin performance in the quarter was similar to last year due to increased activity in our pacific water business, related to the Australian desalinization project.
 Additionally the operating margin continued to benefit from our cross management and restructuring activities. For the second consecutive quarter, we have seen year over year growth in orders which is encouraging. Excluding currency, orders grew 4% year over year. It is important to keep in mind that there is a 6 to 9 month order to revenue conversion cycle and flow. So the recent order activity we are seeing will most likely impact our fiscal to year 2011. Backlog of $1.5 billion declined 3% on a quarter sequential basis, again excluding the impact of foreign currency; primarily driven by the shipments of products for the Australian desalinization project.
 As we look to the fourth quarter, we expected continued improvement in organic revenue with a year over year organic revenue decline in the mid single digits. While our revenue will grow sequentially, product mix in the quarter is expected to result in an operating margin before special items of approximately 13%. Turning now to our Fire business, revenue in the quarter was $822 million and the organic revenue declined 6%. Service revenue grew 2% organically, offset by continued weakness in system installation which declined 13% organically. Our strategy to be more selective in our project work has contributed to the organic revenue decline. However, the benefit of this discipline can be seen in our improved earnings and operating margin performance.
 Before special items, operating income was $85 million and the operating margin was 10.3%. Operating results were positively impacted by $7 million benefit related to certain pension plan changes which improved the operating margin by 80 basis points. The remaining improvement in operating margin of 110 basis points resulted from the benefits of our restructuring actions, cost containment activities and the selectivity in project work which more than offset to revenue decline. We expect operating income before special items in the forth quarter to approximate the third quarter level, excluding that pension benefit.
 Year over year orders turned positively growing 4%, again excluding the impact of foreign currency. Backlog of $1.2 billion increased 5% on a quarter sequential basis excluding the impact of foreign currency. Moving down to safety products, revenue grew 5% in the quarter to $389 million with an organic revenue growth of 6.5%. The revenue growth was driven by strong performance in electronics security which grew 15% organically and life safety which grew 14% organically. Organic revenue was flat in fire suppression after five quarters of double digit organic decline. Before special items operating income was $65 million and operating margin improved 350 basis points to 16.7%.
 Higher revenue and better proactively coupled with savings from our restructuring actions and close containment activities more than offset our continued investment in sales, marketing and R&D. On a year over year basis we expect organic revenue growth to be similar to the third quarter with an operating margin of approximately 16%. Lastly, electrical and metal products had revenue of $390 million with an organic revenue growth of 15%. Year over year revenue growth was primarily due to higher selling prices for both steel and copper products. Although demand has stabilized, volume remains at historically low levels.
 Despite the continued low volume, the operating income before special items of $41 million was better than expected and represents a significant improvement over the prior years operating loss of $6 million. The $47 million increase in operating income is primarily due to better steel spreads. Looking to the fourth quarter we have seen steel prices weaken in recent weeks after increasing sharply the first half of the calendar year. Based on current market dynamics we expect revenue of $375 million and operating income of approximately $30 million. So before I turn back the call over to Ed let me touch on a few other important items.
 As you have just heard, certain of our defined benefit plans were converted to define contribution plans resulting in a $22 million benefit in the quarter which has been reported in our business segment results. Next we perform a number of actuarial evaluations during the second half of the year to determine if there are any liability reserves which need adjustments. As a result we increased the legal reserve by $52 million which is reported in corporate expense. Including this charge, corporate expense before special items in the quarter was $142 million.
 Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect corporate expense to be approximately $115 million bringing our full year corporate expense to about $450 million. Turning to interest expense; we issued $5500 million of bonds at a very attractive interest rate. Additionally we redeemed approximately $870 million of outstanding bonds resulting in an $87 million charge in the quarter which again is included in special items. Next, our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 6%, well below the rate we guided to last quarter. We had expected our annual tax rate to be in the 17-18% range and now believe our tax rate for the full year will be in the range of 15-16%. This improvement reflects the impact of our tax planning activities as well as the Broadview acquisition.
 As we have discussed in the past, the timing of the impact of tax items can move the rate significantly quarter to quarter. We expect the fourth quarter tax rate to approximate 23%. We intend to continue repurchasing shares in the fourth quarter and expect our average share count to be about $500 million in the fourth quarter, as it will include the full impact of the shares issue for the Broadview acquisition.  I also want to touch for a minute on restructuring. To date we have incurred approximately $60 million of restructuring charges excluding Broadview; compared to our estimate of approximately $150 million for the year.
 Our original estimate includes a cost to significantly restructure or shut down certain small operating units. We are now more confident that we will be able to sell certain of these operations which could therefore reduce our restructuring costs by $40-50 million. This would result in full year restructuring charges of approximately $100 million. A majority of these actions we have taken over the last two years are permanent in nature and will not result in increased costs as business conditions continue to improve. In addition we incurred restructuring and acquisition charges of $37 million in the quarter related to the Broadview transaction.
 We continue to expect these charges will approximate $100 million of which a large majority will be incurred in the first 6 months of the acquisition. Now let me turn the call back over to Ed to wrap up this morning’s call.

As I previously mentioned, we have continued to actively manage our portfolio. The Broadview acquisition has increased the return revenue portion of our portfolio. And we have taken several steps in divesting businesses that do not align with our global strategy. Overall the actions we have taken this year have further strengthened our core platforms. Second our teams around the world have continued to respond quickly to the continued challenging economic environment. We have managed our cost position well, restructured certain operations and maintained key investments that position our businesses for future growth and continued margin expansion.
 Lastly, our already strong balance sheet position has been further strengthened by our refinancing of debt and reduced tax rate. Now let’s turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect that the trends we saw this quarter to continue. We expect fourth quarter revenue of approximately $4.4 billion. The overall operating margin in the forth quarter should slightly improve from the 10.4% we achieved in the third quarter. Our debt restructuring should decrease our interest expense by approximately $5 million sequentially and as Chris explained our tax rate will approximate 23% I the fourth quarter. We therefore expect our EPS before special items in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.64.
 Last quarter we indicated that we expected EPS to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.58 for the full year including approximately $0.05 of EPS from our European Waterworks business. As this business is now reported in discontinued operations, our full year guidance range would be $2.45 to $2.53 per share. Based on our fourth quarter guidance, we now expect the EPS from continuing operations before special items to be in the range of $2.56 to $2.58 which again excludes the $0.05 of earnings from our Waterworks business. Therefore our revised guidance of $2.56 to $2.58 is a $0.06 to $0.10 per share increase from our previous guidance. And with that operator let’s open up the lines for any questions.

First in 2010 in the guidance that we have provided the restructuring and acquisition cost related to the transaction we have excluded from the guidance. The impact of the purchase accounting which includes adjustments to the deferred revenue base as well as a subscriber asset base which needs to be amortized, those are operating costs that we have included in our guidance for the year.
 So there are a lot of adjustments that happened and some pretty complicated purchase accounting adjustments which generated this $8 million loss for the quarter. Again that is for a six week kind of time period but the normal operating margin that we saw as a stand alone were essentially the margins that we achieved in the quarter. So no real change there, it’s just a noise from the purchase accounting. So I hope that clarifies it.

So that’s kind of the ball park of what we’re talking and it’s both a little bit on the Fire side and a little bit on the security side then we’ll be pretty much done with I’d say that program.
 Steve what I feel good about is we’ve got – we’re getting much better discipline around our lead process, what we’re going after, what we’re not going after, the verticals we want, the verticals we don’t want. So we are as Chris mentioned, we’re purposely even – but more on the Fire than ADT side but both sides of the business, we’re purposely reducing our organic revenue growth a little bit on purpose because we’re not going after some verticals and we are clearly though seeing the benefit of that in the bottom line margin performance of the business.
 So as Naren said if I look at it with the divestitures we’ve done, with the restructuring and the selectivity of bidding, we’ve got the margin this quarter at 9.1% on a true run rate basis on the ADT side and you can see very nice margin improvement occurring on the international Fire side which is really for the same reason.
 So I think we’re – in the next I’d say two quarters or so I would say we are clicking about where we want to be with the portfolio and it won’t change from there.

We actually thought a couple of big orders would hit in June, it did not but we ended up pretty flat in June. So the aggregate for the – so you’re correct, we were up higher in April and May, kind of down flat in June and therefore we ended up at 4.3% for the quarter.
 I did feel pretty good that we had about the same result here in July which we just preliminarily rolled up yesterday so that feels good. But I guess what I’ve been watching because it is lumpy and one or two big orders can really sway, I’m looking at the lead flow that our sales team is working on and it feels very robust right now and there is a couple big what I call elephant deals that I don’t know when they’re going to float but I have a high confidence that we’re going to get a couple of these.
 So again the flow of it feels good coming in with the sales team and not to talk about competition per se but I have noticed a few other flow control companies also saying that their sales activity this quarter just feels pretty robust and they’re feeling good. So I’m not declaring victory that we’ve turned the corner but it’s two quarters in a row now of organic growth and if you go back, fiscal ’09 this business was – orders were down over 20%, as was the competitors that report, in the first quarter we improved that to down 13% and now we’re second and third quarter and July now positive with good lead generation.
 So I think it bodes well kind of for the second half of next fiscal year.

Good morning, and thanks for joining our conference call to discuss Tyco’s third quarter results for fiscal year 2010 and the press release issued earlier this morning. With me today are Tyco’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ed Breen; our Chief Financial Officer, Chris Coughlin; as well as Naren Gursahaney, President of ADT Worldwide.
Let me remind you that during the course of the call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to look at today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask you to read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press releases issued this morning and all related tables, as well as the conference call slides, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tyco.com.
Now let me quickly recap this quarter's results. Revenue in the quarter of $4.3 billion was up 3% year-over-year with flat organic revenue. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco common shareholders was $0.50 per share and included $0.22 per share related to special items.
Before special items, earnings per share was $0.72 compared to our guidance of $0.60 to $0.62 per share.  The $0.72 per share compares to the midpoint of our guidance of $0.61. The $0.11 difference consisted primarily of $0.07 of better operating results, $0.10 attributable to a lower tax rate, offset by a net fixed [ph] charge for a legal reserve and a benefit from certain pension plan changes.
Now let me turn the call over to Ed Breen for some opening comments. Ed will be followed by Naren, who will discuss our ADT business, and then Chris will review the results from our other businesses before we wrap up and take your questions."

From an operational perspective, we saw sequential improvement in revenue and operating margin across all business segments. Additionally, we completed the acquisition of Broadview Security and are well underway with the integration process and are very excited about the opportunities of joining the best of both ADT and Broadview. From a capital perspective, we invested more to strengthen our businesses and returned excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Let me start off with a few overall comments. First, the majority of our segments, including the service side of our Fire business, grew revenue organically year-over-year. The systems installation and service side of our ADT business turned positive after six consecutive quarters of organic revenue decline.
Operating margins improved both year-over-year and sequentially, driven by our cost management efforts and the continued growth of our recurring revenue and service activities. Additionally, increased volume in our product and manufacturing businesses also contributed to the operating margin improvement.
From an orders perspective, it's important to keep in mind that our Service and Recurring revenue businesses have been growing and represent 40% of our total revenue. Orders for the remaining 60% of our portfolio, which is our Product and Systems Installation revenue, grew 5% year-over-year on a global basis, with order growth in Flow Control, Fire and Safety Products.
Second, our free cash flow generation continues to be strong and provides us with the financial flexibility to fund our organic growth investment activities, make selective acquisitions and return excess cash to our shareholders.
As we indicated last quarter, we resumed our share repurchase program and to date, have repurchased 15.8 million shares for $575 million. We expect to continue repurchasing shares during the fourth quarter, and we'll likely utilize the remaining 325 million authorization under the program by our fiscal year end.
Now let me make a few quick comments or two about each of our businesses, and then Naren and Chris will provide you with more details in a few minutes.
Starting with ADT, our recurring revenue continued to perform well with 4% organic revenue growth. Excluding Broadview, our account base and ARPU both increased and the disconnect rate continued to improve.
Additionally, the Systems Installation business has stabilized. Growth in the Asia-Pacific and Latin America regions and improving conditions in North America offset the continued softness in Europe.
We also saw a continued improvement in our operating margin both sequentially and year-over-year. Growth in our higher-margin recurring revenue business, coupled with the benefits of restructuring activities and cost actions, as well as improved productivity and mix in our Systems Installation business, contributed nicely to the operating margin improvement.
Turning to Flow Control. Performance in the quarter was as expected, sequential improvement in revenue and operating income and continued growth in order activity. The announced divestiture of our Waterworks business in Europe is another step in focusing our portfolio on industries and products that we can leverage on a global basis.
This business, which sells to markets in Europe, makes products such as hydrants, fittings, couplings and valves primarily for the transmission and distribution of water for residential use. Our intention is to grow our Flow Control business with global products and services that utilize advanced technology and critical applications.
Next, our Fire business had operating margin improvement, both sequentially and year-over-year despite the continued pressure on the top line. More importantly, the quarter marked a turning point to positive order activity, and backlog continued to grow.
Next, the continued investments we have made in our Safety Products business to fund our growth plans and maintain our R&D, sales and marketing spend throughout the economic downturn are starting to pay off. We are well positioned for a recovery and have seen the benefit of increased volume in our operating margin, which improved 350 basis points year-over-year.
And finally, Electrical and Metal products performed a bit better than expected in the quarter due to improved pricing for both steel and copper products. The previously announced tax re-spin of this business to our shareholders continues to move forward, and we are tracking to complete the separation within the first half of our fiscal year 2011.
Overall, we saw improving conditions across all our businesses in the quarter. The top line stabilized, operating margins increased and order activity improved. Additionally, we made good progress focusing our portfolio around our three-core platforms of Security, Fire and Flow Control.
Now let me turn the call over to Naren to review our performance in ADT and provide you with an update on the Broadview integration process."

ADT continued to show good progress against all of our key financial and operating metrics. Revenue in the quarter was $1.8 billion, with organic revenue growth for the first time in several quarters growing at 3%.",1114,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. ADT continued to show good progress against all of our key financial and operating metrics. Revenue in the quarter was $1.8 billion, with organic revenue growth for the first time in several quarters growing at 3%. Recurring revenue continued to grow nicely at 4%, driven by our North America residential and small-business operations. We also continued to see nice recurring revenue growth in Asia-Pacific and Latin America.
Systems Installation service revenue grew slightly on an organic basis, up almost 0.5%. While we still saw declines in North America and EMEA, the declines were very modest compared to what we've seen in the past. These declines were offset by 17% organic revenue growth in the Rest of the World.
Before special items, operating income was $275 million and the operating margin was 15.1%. Excluding the impact of Broadview and a $12 million benefit in the quarter related to certain pension plan changes, the operating income before special items was $271 million and the operating margin was 15.3%, a 170 basis point improvement year-over-year. While a portion of this improvement is the result of our improved business mix with more of the higher-margin recurring revenue, we are also reaping the benefits of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives, including our operational excellence initiatives.
We also saw continued progress in improving customer retention, with the 30-basis-point improvement in our attrition rate to 12.8%. Our account base now stands at over 8.8 million recurring customers, including the addition of the Broadview account base of 1.4 million customers. Excluding Broadview, we grew our account base by 3% and our average revenue per user grew 1% to $45.72, excluding the impact of foreign currency, which is consistent with what we've seen over the past several quarters. As Broadview's customer base was nearly 100% residential compared to ADT's mix of residential and commercial customers, the new blended overall ARPU decreased by 4% to $43.42 per account.
In terms of regional performance, we continue to see solid performance in our North America residential business where units in ARPU growth were consistent with what we've seen over the past several quarters.  Although the commercial side of our North America business remains soft, we are seeing increased activities in certain vertical markets like retail. Despite the 3% decline in organic revenue, our operating margin improved 110 basis points year-over-year as the benefits of our restructuring and cost containment actions more than offset the revenue headwind.
In EMEA, we continue to see strong margin improvement in both the U.K. and Continental Europe. The operating margin before special items of 12.1% increased 820 basis points year-over-year and 560 basis points on a quarter-sequential basis. These results included a $12 million benefit related to certain pension plan changes, which contributed 300 basis points to the margin improvement. With these trends, we continue to feel good about achieving our 10% target by the end of 2011.
In the Rest of the World, which includes several of our key emerging markets, we are seeing solid top and bottom line growth. Growth was 10% for recurring revenue, while Systems Installation and Service revenue growth was in the mid to high teens. We continue to invest in emerging markets and remain excited by the opportunities we see there.
Much of our focus during the third quarter was on the closing of the Broadview acquisition and the initial stages of integration of this business into our North America residential and small-business platform. As you are aware, we closed the deal in the middle of May, so our results include about six weeks of Broadview this quarter. Broadview's impact on the quarter was an operating loss of $8 million, primarily driven by the purchase accounting impact of the transaction that we mentioned when we announced the deal.
As we move forward, it'll become more difficult to call our Broadview results separately as we are fully integrating the business into our ADT residential and small-business platform. We've adapted the best of both approach to integration and are committed to leveraging the best people, processes and technology from both organizations as we build our new ADT North America residential business.
John Koch, who's been leading our ADT North America business for the past four years, will lead this combined business. John has assembled a leadership team that includes several key leaders from both ADT and Broadview. We are very pleased with the progress we've made so far in our integration efforts, and we remain confident that we'll deliver on the synergy and accretion expectations that we stated when we announced the deal.
On a fiscal-year basis, we expect the impact to be neutral in fiscal 2010 and accretive by about $0.10 in fiscal 2011. The accretion estimate includes the impact of non-cash purchase accounting charges. Looking at this on a cash basis, the fiscal 2011 accretion is actually $0.18 per share.
Much of our current efforts are focused on the marketing side as we prepare to migrate away from the Broadview brand and consolidate all of our lead generation to the ADT brand. We expect to finalize this transition during the fourth quarter.
We have also begun to train our sales teams on the standard set of product offerings and are moving forward to integrate our field teams into a common management structure. In addition, we've focused considerable time and effort on communications with both our customers and our employees. While we're still early in the process, the response from customers appears to be favorable, with both businesses showing modest improvements in retention on a quarter-sequential basis.
Finally, I thought I'd comment on the rollout of our new interactive services platform, ADT Pulse. As we indicated in the past, we've launched our operational pilots during the third quarter and are currently operating these solutions in five test markets across the country. These are operational pilots focused on developing our capabilities to sell, install and service these new solutions which combine life safety with life style. The initial customer response has been positive with no marketing and advertising support. We are also seeing a nice pick up in our installation fees and ARPU. 
We are currently ramping up our training efforts and expect to expand from our current pilot approach to a full market-by-market national rollout later this calendar year. I look forward to updating you on our progress with ADT Pulse during future calls.
Before I turn it over to Chris, let me provide you with our guidance for the fourth quarter. We expect revenue to approximate $1.9 billion, with an operating margin before special items of approximately 16%.  
Now let me turn the call over to Chris."
107534,108794777,71462,"Tyco International Ltd., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thanks, Naren, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with Flow Control. As Ed mentioned, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our Waterworks business in Europe for approximately $245 million. The transaction is expected to close in our fourth quar",1310,"Thanks, Naren, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with Flow Control. As Ed mentioned, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our Waterworks business in Europe for approximately $245 million. The transaction is expected to close in our fourth quarter and is now reported in Discontinued Operations.
On an annual basis, this business generates about $350 million of revenue with an operating margin in the high-single digits. Approximately $0.01 per share in the quarter and an estimated $0.05 per share for the year has moved to Discontinued Operations.
During the quarter, Flow Control had revenue of $849 million, which again, excludes the revenue from our European Waterworks businesses. Organic revenue declined 7% as the 11% growth in Water and the 16% growth in Thermal Control were more than offset by a 17% decline in the Valves business. As expected, the organic revenue decline has moderated. The 7% decline this quarter compares to a 14% decline in the first quarter and a 13% decline in the second quarter.
Before special items, operating income was $119 million and the operating margin was 14%. Despite the volume deleveraging, the operating margin performance in the quarter was similar to last year due to increased activity in our Pacific Water business related to the Australian desalinization (sic)[desalination] project.  Additionally, the operating margin continued to benefit from our cost management and restructuring activities.
For the second consecutive quarter, we have seen year-over-year growth in orders which is encouraging. Excluding currency, orders grew 4% year-over-year. It's important to keep in mind that there is a six to nine month order-to-revenue conversion cycle in Flow. So the recent order activity we are seeing will most likely impact our fiscal year 2011. Backlog of $1.5 billion declined 3% on a quarter-sequential basis, again, excluding the impact of foreign currency, primarily driven by the shipments of products for the Australian desalinization (sic)[desalination] project.
As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect continued improvement in organic revenue with a year-over-year organic revenue decline in the mid-single digits. While our revenue will grow sequentially, product mix in the quarter is expected to result in an operating margin before special items of approximately 13%.
Turning now to our Fire business. Revenue in the quarter was $822 million and the organic revenue declined 6%. Service revenue grew 2% organically, offset by a continued weakness in System Installation which declined 13% organically. Our strategy to be more selective in our project work has contributed to the organic revenue decline.  However, the benefit of this discipline can be seen in our improved earnings and operating margin performance.
Before special items, operating income was $85 million and the operating margin was 10.3%. Operating results were positively impacted by a $7 million benefit related to certain pension plan changes, which improved the operating margin by 80 basis points. The remaining improvement in operating margin of 110 basis points resulted from the benefits of our restructuring actions, cost containment activities and the selectivity in project work which more than offset the revenue decline. We expect operating income before special items in the fourth quarter to approximate the third quarter level, excluding that pension benefit.
Year-over-year, orders turned positive, growing 4%, again, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Backlog of $1.2 billion increased 5% on a quarter-sequential basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency.
Moving now to Safety Products. Revenue grew 5% in the quarter to $389 million with an organic revenue growth of 6.5%. The revenue growth was driven by strong performance in Electronics Security, which grew 15% organically and Life Safety, which grew 14% organically. Organic revenue was flat in Fire Suppression after five quarters of double-digit organic decline.
Before special items, operating income was $65 million and operating margin improved 350 basis points to 16.7%. Higher revenue and better productivity, coupled with savings from our restructuring actions and cost-containment activities, more than offset our continued investments in sales, marketing and R&D. On a year-over-year you basis, we expect organic revenue growth to be similar to the third quarter with an operating margin of approximately 16%.
Lastly, Electrical and Metal products have revenue of $390 million, with an organic revenue growth of 15%. Year-over-year revenue growth was primarily due to higher selling prices for both steel and copper products. Although demand has stabilized, volume remains at historically low levels 
Despite the continued low volume, the operating income before special items of $41 million was better than expected and represents a significant improvement over the prior year's operating loss of $6 million. The $47 million increase in operating income is primarily due to better steel spreads. 
Looking to the fourth quarter, we have seen steel prices weaken in recent weeks after increasing sharply in the first half of the calendar year. Based on current market dynamics, we expect revenue of $375 million and operating income of approximately $30 million.
So before I turn the call back over to Ed, let me touch on a few other important items. As you have just heard, certain of our defined benefit plans were converted to defined contribution plans resulting in a $22 million benefit in the quarter, which has been reported in our business segment results. Next, we performed a number of actuarial evaluations during the second half of the year to determine if there are any liability reserves which need adjustment. As a result, we increased the legal reserve by $52 million which is reported in corporate expense. Including this charge, corporate expense before special items in the quarter was $142 million. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect corporate expense to be approximately $115 million, bringing our full year corporate expense to about $450 million.
Turning to interest expense. We issued $500 million of bonds at a very attractive interest rate. Additionally, we redeemed approximately $875 million of outstanding bonds, resulting in an $87 million charge in the quarter which again is included in special items.
Next, our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 6%, well below the rate we guided to last quarter. We had expected our annual tax rate to be in the 17% to 18% range, and now believe our tax rate for the full year will be in the range of 15% to 16%. This improvement reflects the impact of our tax planning activities as well as the Broadview acquisition.
As we have discussed in the past, the timing and the impact of tax items can move the rate significantly quarter to quarter. We expect the fourth quarter's tax rate to approximate 23%. We intend to continue repurchasing shares in the fourth quarter and expect our average share count to be about $500 million in the fourth quarter, as it will include the full impact of the shares issued for the Broadview acquisition.
I also want to touch for a minute on restructuring. To date, we have incurred approximately $60 million of restructuring charges excluding Broadview, compared to our estimate of approximately $150 million for the year. Our original estimate included costs to significantly restructure or shut down certain small operating units. We are now more confident that we will be able to sell certain of these operations which could therefore reduce our restructuring cost by $40 million to $50 million. This would result in full year restructuring charges of approximately $100 million. A majority of these actions we have taken over the last two years are permanent in nature and will not result in increased cost as business conditions continue to improve.  
In addition, we incurred restructuring and acquisition charges of $37 million in the quarter related to the Broadview transaction. We continue to expect these charges will approximate $100 million, of which a large majority will be incurred in the first six months of the acquisition.
Now let me turn the call back over to Ed to wrap up this morning's call."

As I previously mentioned, we have continued to actively manage our portfolio. The Broadview acquisition has increased the recurring revenue portion of our portfolio, and we have taken several steps in divesting businesses that do not align with our global strategy. Overall, the actions we have taken this year have further strengthened our core platforms. 
Second, our teams around the world have continued to respond quickly to the continued challenging economic environment. We have managed our cost position well, restructured certain operations and maintained key investments that position our businesses for future growth and continued margin expansion. Lastly, our already-strong balance sheet position has been further strengthened by our refinancing of debt and reduced tax rate.
Now let's turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect the trends we saw this quarter to continue. We expect fourth quarter revenue of approximately $4.4 billion. The overall operating margin in the fourth quarter should slightly improve from the 10.4% we achieved in the third quarter.
Our debt restructuring should decrease our interest expense by approximately $5 million sequentially, and as Chris explained, our tax rate will approximate 23% in the fourth quarter.  We therefore expect our EPS before special items in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.64.
Last quarter, we indicated that we expected EPS to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.58 for the full year, including approximately $0.05 of EPS from our European Waterworks business. As this business is now reported in Discontinued Operations, our full year guidance range would be $2.45 to $2.53 per share. Based on our fourth quarter guidance, we now expect EPS from continuing operations before special items to be in the range of $2.56 to $2.58, which again, excludes the $0.05 of earnings from our Waterworks business. Therefore, our revised guidance of $2.56 to $2.58 is a $0.06 to $0.10 per share increase from our previous guidance.

First, in 2010, in the guidance that we have provided, the restructuring and acquisition costs related to the transaction, we have excluded from the guidance. The impact of the purchase accounting, which includes adjustments to the deferred revenue base, as well as the subscriber asset base which needs to be amortized, those are operating costs that we have included in our guidance for the year. So there are a lot of adjustments that happened and some pretty complicated purchase accounting adjustments, which generated this $8 million loss for the quarter. Again, that's for a six-week-kind-of-time period. But the normal operating margin that we saw Broadview as a stand alone were essentially the margins that we achieved in the quarter.

Steve, what I feel good about is we're getting much better discipline around our lead process, what we're going after, what we're not going after, the verticals we want, the verticals we don't want. So we are, as Chris mentioned, we're purposely more on the Fire than ADT side but both sides of the business, we're purposely reducing our organic revenue growth a little bit on purpose, because we're not going after some verticals. And we are clearly though seeing the benefit of that in the bottom line margin performance of the business. So as Naren said, if I look at it, with the divestitures we've done, with the restructuring and the selectivity of bidding, we've got the margins this quarter at 9.1% on a true run-rate basis on the ADT side, and you can see very nice margin improvement occurring on the international Fire side, which is really for the same reasons.

We're looking at some acquisitions stuff that could be up to $500 million and one we're looking at who knows if we'll get over the finish line, it'll be a couple of hundred million. So it's that type of range. I'd say right down in the middle of the plate in either Fire, Flow or Security. But even with that, when we model out our capital plan going forward, we're in a nice position to still have excess cash. We're funding all our internal capital, we're funding all our growth initiatives. So we've been very comfortable. You can see from what we previously guided through last quarter, we did significantly more share repurchase during the quarter. And if we do the $325 million more here in the fourth quarter, we will have done $900 million in about four and a half months."

But I guess what I've been watching because it is a lumpy and one or two big orders can really sway it, I'm looking at that the lead Flow that our sales team is working on and it feels very robust right now. And there's a couple of big, what I call elephant deals that I don't know when they're going to book, but I have a high confidence that we're going to get a couple of these. So again, the flow of it feels good coming in with the sales team. And not to talk about competition per se, but I have noticed a few other flow control companies also saying that their sales activity this quarter just feels pretty robust and they're feeling good. So I'm not declaring victory that we've turned the quarter, but it's two quarters in a row now of organic growth. And if you go back, fiscal '09, this business was -- the orders were down over 20% as well as the competitors report. In the first quarter, we improved that to down 13%.

Good morning, and thanks for joining our conference call to discuss Tyco’s third quarter results for fiscal year 2010 and the press release issued earlier this morning. With me today are Tyco’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ed Breen; our Chief Financial Officer, Chris Coughlin; as well as Naren Gursahaney, President of ADT Worldwide.
Let me remind you that during the course of the call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to look at today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask you to read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press releases issued this morning and all related tables, as well as the conference call slides, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tyco.com.
Now let me quickly recap this quarter's results. Revenue in the quarter of $4.3 billion was up 3% year-over-year with flat organic revenue. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco common shareholders was $0.50 per share and included $0.22 per share related to special items.
Before special items, earnings per share was $0.72 compared to our guidance of $0.60 to $0.62 per share.  The $0.72 per share compares to the midpoint of our guidance of $0.61. The $0.11 difference consisted primarily of $0.07 of better operating results, $0.10 attributable to a lower tax rate, offset by a net fixed [ph] charge for a legal reserve and a benefit from certain pension plan changes.
Now let me turn the call over to Ed Breen for some opening comments. Ed will be followed by Naren, who will discuss our ADT business, and then Chris will review the results from our other businesses before we wrap up and take your questions."

From an operational perspective, we saw sequential improvement in revenue and operating margin across all business segments. Additionally, we completed the acquisition of Broadview Security and are well underway with the integration process and are very excited about the opportunities of joining the best of both ADT and Broadview. From a capital perspective, we invested more to strengthen our businesses and returned excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Let me start off with a few overall comments. First, the majority of our segments, including the service side of our Fire business, grew revenue organically year-over-year. The systems installation and service side of our ADT business turned positive after six consecutive quarters of organic revenue decline.
Operating margins improved both year-over-year and sequentially, driven by our cost management efforts and the continued growth of our recurring revenue and service activities. Additionally, increased volume in our product and manufacturing businesses also contributed to the operating margin improvement.
From an orders perspective, it's important to keep in mind that our Service and Recurring revenue businesses have been growing and represent 40% of our total revenue. Orders for the remaining 60% of our portfolio, which is our Product and Systems Installation revenue, grew 5% year-over-year on a global basis, with order growth in Flow Control, Fire and Safety Products.
Second, our free cash flow generation continues to be strong and provides us with the financial flexibility to fund our organic growth investment activities, make selective acquisitions and return excess cash to our shareholders.
As we indicated last quarter, we resumed our share repurchase program and to date, have repurchased 15.8 million shares for $575 million. We expect to continue repurchasing shares during the fourth quarter, and we'll likely utilize the remaining 325 million authorization under the program by our fiscal year end.
Now let me make a few quick comments or two about each of our businesses, and then Naren and Chris will provide you with more details in a few minutes.
Starting with ADT, our recurring revenue continued to perform well with 4% organic revenue growth. Excluding Broadview, our account base and ARPU both increased and the disconnect rate continued to improve.
Additionally, the Systems Installation business has stabilized. Growth in the Asia-Pacific and Latin America regions and improving conditions in North America offset the continued softness in Europe.
We also saw a continued improvement in our operating margin both sequentially and year-over-year. Growth in our higher-margin recurring revenue business, coupled with the benefits of restructuring activities and cost actions, as well as improved productivity and mix in our Systems Installation business, contributed nicely to the operating margin improvement.
Turning to Flow Control. Performance in the quarter was as expected, sequential improvement in revenue and operating income and continued growth in order activity. The announced divestiture of our Waterworks business in Europe is another step in focusing our portfolio on industries and products that we can leverage on a global basis.
This business, which sells to markets in Europe, makes products such as hydrants, fittings, couplings and valves primarily for the transmission and distribution of water for residential use. Our intention is to grow our Flow Control business with global products and services that utilize advanced technology and critical applications.
Next, our Fire business had operating margin improvement, both sequentially and year-over-year despite the continued pressure on the top line. More importantly, the quarter marked a turning point to positive order activity, and backlog continued to grow.
Next, the continued investments we have made in our Safety Products business to fund our growth plans and maintain our R&D, sales and marketing spend throughout the economic downturn are starting to pay off. We are well positioned for a recovery and have seen the benefit of increased volume in our operating margin, which improved 350 basis points year-over-year.
And finally, Electrical and Metal products performed a bit better than expected in the quarter due to improved pricing for both steel and copper products. The previously announced tax re-spin of this business to our shareholders continues to move forward, and we are tracking to complete the separation within the first half of our fiscal year 2011.
Overall, we saw improving conditions across all our businesses in the quarter. The top line stabilized, operating margins increased and order activity improved. Additionally, we made good progress focusing our portfolio around our three-core platforms of Security, Fire and Flow Control.
Now let me turn the call over to Naren to review our performance in ADT and provide you with an update on the Broadview integration process."

ADT continued to show good progress against all of our key financial and operating metrics.

ADT continued to show good progress against all of our key financial and operating metrics. Revenue in the quarter was $1.8 billion, with organic revenue growth for the first time in several quarters growing at 3%. Recurring revenue continued to grow nicely at 4%, driven by our North America residential and small-business operations. We also continued to see nice recurring revenue growth in Asia-Pacific and Latin America.
Systems Installation service revenue grew slightly on an organic basis, up almost 0.5%. While we still saw declines in North America and EMEA, the declines were very modest compared to what we've seen in the past. These declines were offset by 17% organic revenue growth in the Rest of the World.
Before special items, operating income was $275 million and the operating margin was 15.1%. Excluding the impact of Broadview and a $12 million benefit in the quarter related to certain pension plan changes, the operating income before special items was $271 million and the operating margin was 15.3%, a 170 basis point improvement year-over-year. While a portion of this improvement is the result of our improved business mix with more of the higher-margin recurring revenue, we are also reaping the benefits of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives, including our operational excellence initiatives.
We also saw continued progress in improving customer retention, with the 30-basis-point improvement in our attrition rate to 12.8%. Our account base now stands at over 8.8 million recurring customers, including the addition of the Broadview account base of 1.4 million customers. Excluding Broadview, we grew our account base by 3% and our average revenue per user grew 1% to $45.72, excluding the impact of foreign currency, which is consistent with what we've seen over the past several quarters. As Broadview's customer base was nearly 100% residential compared to ADT's mix of residential and commercial customers, the new blended overall ARPU decreased by 4% to $43.42 per account.
In terms of regional performance, we continue to see solid performance in our North America residential business where units in ARPU growth were consistent with what we've seen over the past several quarters.  Although the commercial side of our North America business remains soft, we are seeing increased activities in certain vertical markets like retail. Despite the 3% decline in organic revenue, our operating margin improved 110 basis points year-over-year as the benefits of our restructuring and cost containment actions more than offset the revenue headwind.
In EMEA, we continue to see strong margin improvement in both the U.K. and Continental Europe. The operating margin before special items of 12.1% increased 820 basis points year-over-year and 560 basis points on a quarter-sequential basis. These results included a $12 million benefit related to certain pension plan changes, which contributed 300 basis points to the margin improvement. With these trends, we continue to feel good about achieving our 10% target by the end of 2011.
In the Rest of the World, which includes several of our key emerging markets, we are seeing solid top and bottom line growth. Growth was 10% for recurring revenue, while Systems Installation and Service revenue growth was in the mid to high teens. We continue to invest in emerging markets and remain excited by the opportunities we see there.
Much of our focus during the third quarter was on the closing of the Broadview acquisition and the initial stages of integration of this business into our North America residential and small-business platform. As you are aware, we closed the deal in the middle of May, so our results include about six weeks of Broadview this quarter. Broadview's impact on the quarter was an operating loss of $8 million, primarily driven by the purchase accounting impact of the transaction that we mentioned when we announced the deal.
As we move forward, it'll become more difficult to call our Broadview results separately as we are fully integrating the business into our ADT residential and small-business platform. We've adapted the best of both approach to integration and are committed to leveraging the best people, processes and technology from both organizations as we build our new ADT North America residential business.
John Koch, who's been leading our ADT North America business for the past four years, will lead this combined business. John has assembled a leadership team that includes several key leaders from both ADT and Broadview. We are very pleased with the progress we've made so far in our integration efforts, and we remain confident that we'll deliver on the synergy and accretion expectations that we stated when we announced the deal.
On a fiscal-year basis, we expect the impact to be neutral in fiscal 2010 and accretive by about $0.10 in fiscal 2011. The accretion estimate includes the impact of non-cash purchase accounting charges. Looking at this on a cash basis, the fiscal 2011 accretion is actually $0.18 per share.
Much of our current efforts are focused on the marketing side as we prepare to migrate away from the Broadview brand and consolidate all of our lead generation to the ADT brand. We expect to finalize this transition during the fourth quarter.
We have also begun to train our sales teams on the standard set of product offerings and are moving forward to integrate our field teams into a common management structure. In addition, we've focused considerable time and effort on communications with both our customers and our employees. While we're still early in the process, the response from customers appears to be favorable, with both businesses showing modest improvements in retention on a quarter-sequential basis.
Finally, I thought I'd comment on the rollout of our new interactive services platform, ADT Pulse. As we indicated in the past, we've launched our operational pilots during the third quarter and are currently operating these solutions in five test markets across the country. These are operational pilots focused on developing our capabilities to sell, install and service these new solutions which combine life safety with life style. The initial customer response has been positive with no marketing and advertising support. We are also seeing a nice pick up in our installation fees and ARPU. 
We are currently ramping up our training efforts and expect to expand from our current pilot approach to a full market-by-market national rollout later this calendar year. I look forward to updating you on our progress with ADT Pulse during future calls.
Before I turn it over to Chris, let me provide you with our guidance for the fourth quarter. We expect revenue to approximate $1.9 billion, with an operating margin before special items of approximately 16%.  
Now let me turn the call over to Chris."
107534,108794777,71463,"Tyco International Ltd., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thanks, Naren, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with Flow Control. As Ed mentioned, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our Waterworks business in Europe for approximately $245 million. The transaction is expected to close in our fourth quar",1310,"Thanks, Naren, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with Flow Control. As Ed mentioned, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our Waterworks business in Europe for approximately $245 million. The transaction is expected to close in our fourth quarter and is now reported in Discontinued Operations.
On an annual basis, this business generates about $350 million of revenue with an operating margin in the high-single digits. Approximately $0.01 per share in the quarter and an estimated $0.05 per share for the year has moved to Discontinued Operations.
During the quarter, Flow Control had revenue of $849 million, which again, excludes the revenue from our European Waterworks businesses. Organic revenue declined 7% as the 11% growth in Water and the 16% growth in Thermal Control were more than offset by a 17% decline in the Valves business. As expected, the organic revenue decline has moderated. The 7% decline this quarter compares to a 14% decline in the first quarter and a 13% decline in the second quarter.
Before special items, operating income was $119 million and the operating margin was 14%. Despite the volume deleveraging, the operating margin performance in the quarter was similar to last year due to increased activity in our Pacific Water business related to the Australian desalinization (sic)[desalination] project.  Additionally, the operating margin continued to benefit from our cost management and restructuring activities.
For the second consecutive quarter, we have seen year-over-year growth in orders which is encouraging. Excluding currency, orders grew 4% year-over-year. It's important to keep in mind that there is a six to nine month order-to-revenue conversion cycle in Flow. So the recent order activity we are seeing will most likely impact our fiscal year 2011. Backlog of $1.5 billion declined 3% on a quarter-sequential basis, again, excluding the impact of foreign currency, primarily driven by the shipments of products for the Australian desalinization (sic)[desalination] project.
As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect continued improvement in organic revenue with a year-over-year organic revenue decline in the mid-single digits. While our revenue will grow sequentially, product mix in the quarter is expected to result in an operating margin before special items of approximately 13%.
Turning now to our Fire business. Revenue in the quarter was $822 million and the organic revenue declined 6%. Service revenue grew 2% organically, offset by a continued weakness in System Installation which declined 13% organically. Our strategy to be more selective in our project work has contributed to the organic revenue decline.  However, the benefit of this discipline can be seen in our improved earnings and operating margin performance.
Before special items, operating income was $85 million and the operating margin was 10.3%. Operating results were positively impacted by a $7 million benefit related to certain pension plan changes, which improved the operating margin by 80 basis points. The remaining improvement in operating margin of 110 basis points resulted from the benefits of our restructuring actions, cost containment activities and the selectivity in project work which more than offset the revenue decline. We expect operating income before special items in the fourth quarter to approximate the third quarter level, excluding that pension benefit.
Year-over-year, orders turned positive, growing 4%, again, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Backlog of $1.2 billion increased 5% on a quarter-sequential basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency.
Moving now to Safety Products. Revenue grew 5% in the quarter to $389 million with an organic revenue growth of 6.5%. The revenue growth was driven by strong performance in Electronics Security, which grew 15% organically and Life Safety, which grew 14% organically. Organic revenue was flat in Fire Suppression after five quarters of double-digit organic decline.
Before special items, operating income was $65 million and operating margin improved 350 basis points to 16.7%. Higher revenue and better productivity, coupled with savings from our restructuring actions and cost-containment activities, more than offset our continued investments in sales, marketing and R&D. On a year-over-year you basis, we expect organic revenue growth to be similar to the third quarter with an operating margin of approximately 16%.
Lastly, Electrical and Metal products have revenue of $390 million, with an organic revenue growth of 15%. Year-over-year revenue growth was primarily due to higher selling prices for both steel and copper products. Although demand has stabilized, volume remains at historically low levels 
Despite the continued low volume, the operating income before special items of $41 million was better than expected and represents a significant improvement over the prior year's operating loss of $6 million. The $47 million increase in operating income is primarily due to better steel spreads. 
Looking to the fourth quarter, we have seen steel prices weaken in recent weeks after increasing sharply in the first half of the calendar year. Based on current market dynamics, we expect revenue of $375 million and operating income of approximately $30 million.
So before I turn the call back over to Ed, let me touch on a few other important items. As you have just heard, certain of our defined benefit plans were converted to defined contribution plans resulting in a $22 million benefit in the quarter, which has been reported in our business segment results. Next, we performed a number of actuarial evaluations during the second half of the year to determine if there are any liability reserves which need adjustment. As a result, we increased the legal reserve by $52 million which is reported in corporate expense. Including this charge, corporate expense before special items in the quarter was $142 million. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect corporate expense to be approximately $115 million, bringing our full year corporate expense to about $450 million.
Turning to interest expense. We issued $500 million of bonds at a very attractive interest rate. Additionally, we redeemed approximately $875 million of outstanding bonds, resulting in an $87 million charge in the quarter which again is included in special items.
Next, our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 6%, well below the rate we guided to last quarter. We had expected our annual tax rate to be in the 17% to 18% range, and now believe our tax rate for the full year will be in the range of 15% to 16%. This improvement reflects the impact of our tax planning activities as well as the Broadview acquisition.
As we have discussed in the past, the timing and the impact of tax items can move the rate significantly quarter to quarter. We expect the fourth quarter's tax rate to approximate 23%. We intend to continue repurchasing shares in the fourth quarter and expect our average share count to be about $500 million in the fourth quarter, as it will include the full impact of the shares issued for the Broadview acquisition.
I also want to touch for a minute on restructuring. To date, we have incurred approximately $60 million of restructuring charges excluding Broadview, compared to our estimate of approximately $150 million for the year. Our original estimate included costs to significantly restructure or shut down certain small operating units. We are now more confident that we will be able to sell certain of these operations which could therefore reduce our restructuring cost by $40 million to $50 million. This would result in full year restructuring charges of approximately $100 million. A majority of these actions we have taken over the last two years are permanent in nature and will not result in increased cost as business conditions continue to improve.  
In addition, we incurred restructuring and acquisition charges of $37 million in the quarter related to the Broadview transaction. We continue to expect these charges will approximate $100 million, of which a large majority will be incurred in the first six months of the acquisition.
Now let me turn the call back over to Ed to wrap up this morning's call."
107534,108794777,71463,"Tyco International Ltd., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thanks, Chris.

As I previously mentioned, we have continued to actively manage our portfolio. The Broadview acquisition has increased the recurring revenue portion of our portfolio, and we have taken several steps in divesting businesses that do not align with our global strategy. Overall, the actions we have taken this year have further strengthened our core platforms. 
Second, our teams around the world have continued to respond quickly to the continued challenging economic environment. We have managed our cost position well, restructured certain operations and maintained key investments that position our businesses for future growth and continued margin expansion. Lastly, our already-strong balance sheet position has been further strengthened by our refinancing of debt and reduced tax rate.
Now let's turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect the trends we saw this quarter to continue. We expect fourth quarter revenue of approximately $4.4 billion. The overall operating margin in the fourth quarter should slightly improve from the 10.4% we achieved in the third quarter.
Our debt restructuring should decrease our interest expense by approximately $5 million sequentially, and as Chris explained, our tax rate will approximate 23% in the fourth quarter.  We therefore expect our EPS before special items in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.64.
Last quarter, we indicated that we expected EPS to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.58 for the full year, including approximately $0.05 of EPS from our European Waterworks business. As this business is now reported in Discontinued Operations, our full year guidance range would be $2.45 to $2.53 per share. Based on our fourth quarter guidance, we now expect EPS from continuing operations before special items to be in the range of $2.56 to $2.58, which again, excludes the $0.05 of earnings from our Waterworks business. Therefore, our revised guidance of $2.56 to $2.58 is a $0.06 to $0.10 per share increase from our previous guidance.
And with that, operator, let's open up the line for any questions."

First, in 2010, in the guidance that we have provided, the restructuring and acquisition costs related to the transaction, we have excluded from the guidance. The impact of the purchase accounting, which includes adjustments to the deferred revenue base, as well as the subscriber asset base which needs to be amortized, those are operating costs that we have included in our guidance for the year. So there are a lot of adjustments that happened and some pretty complicated purchase accounting adjustments, which generated this $8 million loss for the quarter. Again, that's for a six-week-kind-of-time period. But the normal operating margin that we saw Broadview as a stand alone were essentially the margins that we achieved in the quarter. So no real change there, it's just the noise from the purchase accounting. So I hope that clarifies it."

Steve, what I feel good about is we're getting much better discipline around our lead process, what we're going after, what we're not going after, the verticals we want, the verticals we don't want. So we are, as Chris mentioned, we're purposely more on the Fire than ADT side but both sides of the business, we're purposely reducing our organic revenue growth a little bit on purpose, because we're not going after some verticals. And we are clearly though seeing the benefit of that in the bottom line margin performance of the business. So as Naren said, if I look at it, with the divestitures we've done, with the restructuring and the selectivity of bidding, we've got the margins this quarter at 9.1% on a true run-rate basis on the ADT side, and you can see very nice margin improvement occurring on the international Fire side, which is really for the same reasons.

We actually thought a couple of big orders would hit June, it did not. But we ended up pretty flat in June. So you're correct, we were up higher in April and May, kind of down flat in June and therefore, we ended up at 4.3% for the quarter. I did feel pretty good that we had about the same results here in July, which we just preliminarily rolled up yesterday. So that feels good. But I guess what I've been watching because it is a lumpy and one or two big orders can really sway it, I'm looking at that the lead Flow that our sales team is working on and it feels very robust right now. And there's a couple of big, what I call elephant deals that I don't know when they're going to book, but I have a high confidence that we're going to get a couple of these. So again, the flow of it feels good coming in with the sales team. And not to talk about competition per se, but I have noticed a few other flow control companies also saying that their sales activity this quarter just feels pretty robust and they're feeling good. So I'm not declaring victory that we've turned the quarter, but it's two quarters in a row now of organic growth. And if you go back, fiscal '09, this business was -- the orders were down over 20% as well as the competitors report. In the first quarter, we improved that to down 13%. And now the second and third quarter and July, now positive with good lead generation. So I think it bodes well, kind of for the second half of next fiscal year."

Let me remind you that during the course of the call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to look at today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there.
In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask you to read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press releases issued this morning and all related tables, as well as the conference call slides can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tyco.com.
When we refer to changes in average revenue per user, backlog and order activity, these changes are excluding the impact of foreign currency. Additionally, references to our operating margins during the call are excluding special items, which is a non-GAAP measure. Again, these non-GAAP measures are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release.
Now let me quickly recap this quarter's results. Revenue in the quarter of $4.5 billion was up 4% year-over-year, with organic revenue growth of 2%. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco common shareholders was $0.55 per share and included $0.19 of special items, primarily related to restructuring activity. Earnings per share from continuing operations before special items was $0.74 compared to our guidance of $0.62 to $0.64, driven by approximately $0.03 per share of better operating results and $0.08 per share due to a better-than-expected tax rate.
Now let me turn the call over to Ed for some opening comments."
107534,114273536,86808,"Tyco International Ltd., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2010",2010-11-09,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thanks, Antonella, and good morning, everyone. Overall, 2010 was a good year for Tyco. Not only am I pleased with our operating performance in yet another challenging year, but more importantly, I am pleased with how we have continued to position our busi",1038,"Thanks, Antonella, and good morning, everyone. Overall, 2010 was a good year for Tyco. Not only am I pleased with our operating performance in yet another challenging year, but more importantly, I am pleased with how we have continued to position our businesses for future growth. Before I get into our results for the quarter, I want to spend a few minutes reviewing the progress we made in 2010 in the key areas of cost management, growth investments, portfolio refinement and our focus on cash.
First, our cost management remained a top priority. Throughout the year, we were very active in identifying and executing cost-containment initiatives and restructuring programs. These actions helped offset the impact of the organic revenue decline we expected in 2010 and contributed to the 100 basis point improvement in our operating margin year-over-year.
Second, we continue to invest in our businesses to strengthen our long-term competitive capabilities for both products and services. For example, the acquisition of Broadview Security increased our recurring revenue base. Broadview's solid North American footprint brings additional capability and capacity to generate new high quality accounts, as well as additional install and service expertise.
Our capital spending grew modestly year-over-year as it has each year through the downturn. A high percentage of our capital goes towards growth in our large service revenue base, which continue to grow nicely in 2010 and represented about 40% of our revenue. From a technology and innovation standpoint, we increased our engineering headcount in our R&D centers around the world by almost 20% during the year. 
Let me touch on a few of our service and product introductions this year. In our ADT North America business, we recently rolled out ADT Plus (sic) [ADT Pulse], our new interactive home security platform, and we are supporting the launch with a highly visible advertising campaign. In our Fire business, we are rolling out our remote diagnostics service which allows us to remotely monitor our customers' fire alarm network. This technology enables us to diagnose problems without a truck roll, reduce the system downtime and improve our first-time fixed rate. And our Security Products business recently released a new video management platform, which allows users to seamlessly integrate analog and IP cameras into a single solution. 
Additionally, we continue to focus our efforts in emerging markets. During the year, we acquired two Brazilian Valve manufacturers, which expanded and complement our Flow Control product offerings and leadership position in South America.
Additionally, we have developed several localized products. For example, our Sensormatic business has recently introduced the essential solution set, which is a lower-cost anti-theft solution, with feature suitable for the emerging markets. 
Third, we have completed the last major portion of our portfolio refinement with the sale of a majority interest in our Electrical and Metal products business. Earlier in the year, we took a meaningful step in repositioning ADT in Europe by divesting our business in France and more recently, we have exited some smaller, non-strategic markets. 
Last quarter, we announced the sale of our Flow Control European Waterworks business which we recently completed. Over the last few years, we have significantly refined our portfolio around our three core platforms of Security, Fire and Flow Control, and we have now reached a point where the heavy lifting is behind us.
Lastly, we continue to generate solid cash flow. During the year, we used our cash to invest in our businesses, make selective acquisitions and return excess cash to shareholders. We completed our $1 billion share repurchase program, increased our annual dividend and announced a new $1 billion share repurchase program. 
Our revenue picture has continued to brighten over the last few quarters, our organic revenue has improved each quarter throughout 2010 and in the fourth quarter, we reported organic revenue growth of 2%, with improvement in all business segments. More importantly, order activity has continued to improve on a year-over-year basis each quarter throughout the year. For the quarter, our operating margin improved 120 basis points year-over-year, and we expect that it will continue to improve in each business segment in 2011.
Now let me give you a quick overview of our results for the quarter for each of the businesses, and then Chris will provide you with more detail in a few minutes. Starting with ADT, our recurring revenue continues to perform well with improvement in all key metrics: account growth, ARPU and a disconnect rate, all of which translated into organic recurring revenue growth of 5% in the quarter. Systems installation and service revenue stabilized last quarter after six consecutive quarters of organic revenue decline and grew 1% in the fourth quarter, driven by the Asia-Pacific and Latin America regions. Additionally, we continue to make margin progress in our ADT EMEA region which exited the quarter with an operating margin of 9.8%, reflecting the benefits of our restructuring actions and portfolio refinement.
On a global basis, ADT's operating margin improved both sequentially and year-over-year, driven by improved operational performance in our systems installation and service revenue, growth in our higher-margin recurring revenue business which is partly attributable to the Broadview acquisition and the continued benefit of restructuring and cost-reduction activities.
Turning to Flow Control. Our revenue was in-line with our forecast. However, our fourth quarter operating earnings were impacted by a charge related to a project that we retained as part of the 2008 divestiture of our Earth Tech business. Absent this, our operating margin was better than expected. Year-over-year, growth in our Flow Control orders continued in the fourth quarter. Orders were up in all three platforms of Valves, Water and Thermal, and our customer activity continues to be strong. 
Moving to Fire. The turnaround in order activity we saw last quarter has continued. The summer seasonality of our service work, as well as the benefits from restructuring and cost containment resulted in better-than-expected operating income in the quarter. 
And finally, Safety Products saw strong order activity in the fourth quarter, resulting in better-than-expected organic revenue growth. More importantly, we accelerated our investments in R&D and sales and marketing to better position the business for future growth.
Now let me turn the call over to Chris to discuss our operating results in more detail."

Revenue of $1.95 billion grew 8% in the quarter, with organic revenue growth of 3%. Recurring revenue, which represents more than half of ADT's total revenue, continued to perform nicely, growing 5% organically in the quarter, driven by continued strong growth in North America. Additionally, ADT's systems installation and service revenue grew 1% organically in the quarter. Strong organic growth in the rest of the world more than offset the modest decline in North America and EMEA.
From a profit perspective, operating income before special items in the quarter was $306 million, and the operating margin was 15.7%. The operating margin improved 150 basis points year-over-year, while we continue to increase our investment in sales and marketing.
From a regional perspective within ADT, nearly 90% of our North American Residential and small business unit is recurring revenue, which grew approximately 35% or 7% organically in the quarter. The operating margin remains strong year-over-year, while we continue to invest in our sales force expansion.
Additionally, our key metrics continued their positive momentum. Year-over-year, average revenue per user grew 1%, and our account base grew 2%, excluding the accounts we acquired as part of the Broadview acquisition. Our Residential attrition rate improved 40 basis points year-over-year and 10 basis points on a quarter-sequential basis to 13%.
Turning to our North America Commercial business. The mix of revenue is very different. 60% is systems installation and service revenue, while 40% is recurring revenue. The organic revenue decline moderated to 1% in the quarter, and we saw a nice turn in commercial order activity which was up 10% year-over-year. The operating margin improved 50 basis points year-over-year as the benefits of restructuring and cost-containment activities more than offset the revenue decline. The attrition rate remains in the low 13% range, which is a nice improvement from the 13.8% attrition rate in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Next in EMEA, the organic revenue decline continued to moderate, declining 1% in the quarter, which is an improvement from the mid-single digits we saw earlier in the year. The operating margin improved 260 basis points year-over-year to 9.8% as we have made significant strides in restructuring the region. 
And finally, in the Asia-Pacific and Latin America regions where revenue is predominantly commercial, we saw solid organic revenue growth of 11% in the quarter. The operating margin is in the low teens and reflects a 140 basis points improvement year-over-year. Emerging markets performed well during the quarter growing double digits organically as we continue to focus on expanding our presence.
Turning to our key metrics for ADT Worldwide. Our global account base now stands at 8.9 million accounts, which is a 21% increase over 2009 and a 3% increase when adjusting for the accounts acquired in the Broadview acquisition. Average revenue per user for our heritage ADT account base grew 1.5% year-over-year on a global basis.
As the mix in our account base has shifted more to Residential with the Broadview acquisition, our global average revenue per user of $44.60 declined 3%. Our worldwide attrition rate held steady at 12.8% on a sequential basis.
Before I move on to Flow Control, let me quickly touch on the Broadview integration. We have completed two major milestones in the Broadview integration since our last earnings call. First, our customer day one, which included the conversion from Broadview brands to a single ADT brand in the marketplace was very successful, while advertisement and marketing materials have been fully converted to the ADT brand name. Secondly, we have integrated our financial reporting in human resource systems. Overall, the Broadview integration is progressing as planned and we are on track to continue to deliver on our synergy and earnings accretion targets.
Turning now to Flow Control. Revenue of $868 million in the quarter declined 5% organically, which was in line with our guidance. Solid organic revenue growth in Water of 9% and Thermal Control of 8% was more than offset by a 12% decline in Valves. We expect the organic revenue decline in Valves to continue to moderate based on increased Valve order activity over the last few quarters.
Operating income before special items was $111 million, and the operating margin was 12.8%. Included in the operating income is a $9 million charge related to a project we retained as a part of the Earth Tech divestiture in 2008, which adversely impacted the operating margin by 100 basis points. The operating margin continues to be impacted by volume deleveraging, which was partially offset by the restructuring activities and cost-containment action. These changes in our cost structure will enhance our operating margin performance as volume continues to improve. 
We continue to be encouraged by our order activity, which has improved on a year-over-year basis for the last three quarters. As you may recall, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we received a large order for an Australian desalinization project. Excluding the impact of this project, order rates in the quarter increased 5% year-over-year. To date, we have completed 75% of that project and expect to recognize the remaining revenue during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. 
As we completed several large Pacific water projects, including shipments related to the desalinization project during the quarter, backlog of $1.5 billion declined 5% on a quarter-sequential basis.
Turning to Fire Protection Services, revenue in the quarter was $893 million, and organic revenue declined 1%. Service revenue, which represents more than 50% of the total revenue, grew 4% organically in the quarter and was more than offset by continued weakness in systems installation, which declined 6% in the quarter. However, the pace of the decline in systems installation has slowed considerably from the double-digit decline we have seen in previous quarters even as we continue to be very selective in our project work.
Operating income before special items was $91 million in the quarter, and operating margin was 10.2%. Growth in service revenue along with continued benefits from restructuring and cost-containment activities, as well as the selectivity of project work contributed to this operating margin performance. 
Order activity in Fire continued to be encouraging, with a 4% year-over-year increase in the quarter. Typically, Fire is operationally stronger in the summer months especially in the education end market as a significant amount of electronic upgrade work is performed while schools are closed. As expected, backlog of $1.2 billion declined 4% on a quarter-sequential basis.
Moving on to Safety Products. Revenue grew 9% in the quarter to $406 million, with organic revenue growth of 13%. The organic revenue growth was driven by solid performance across all three platforms. Electronic Security grew 24%, Life Safety grew 18%, and Fire Suppression grew 6%. 
Before special items, operating income increased 17% to $63 million, and the operating margin improved 100 basis points to 15.5% year-over-year even as we accelerated certain sales, marketing and R&D investments in the quarter. Strong organic revenue growth, benefits from restructuring activities and improved productivity contributed to the operating margin improvement during the quarter. 
On a full year basis, we increased our investment in R&D, sales and marketing by 6% in Safety Products, and we will continue to drive innovation especially as we build out our presence in the emerging markets.
As we announced earlier this morning, we have agreed to sell 51% of our Electrical and Metal Products business to CD&R. Total cash from the transaction to Tyco is approximately $720 million, with minimal tax leakage. We came to the conclusion that a sale of a majority stake in Electrical and Metal products would be in the best interest of our shareholders based on several key factors. 
First, it provides our shareholders with an attractive value for the 51% ownership stake, $720 million in cash and a retained interest of 49%. We will use the proceeds to accelerate our previously announced $1 billion share buyback program. It will also allow our shareholders to benefit from an eventual divestiture of our remaining stake as the markets in Electrical and Metal products strengthen in the future, and it increases our focus on our core Security, Fire and Flow Control business platforms and will increase our service revenue to about 45% of our total revenue next year. It also reduces volatility in our operating results. And lastly, the Electrical and Metal Products business will be able to pursue its own strategy as a separate company, led by its own management team.
So let me quickly summarize the estimated earnings impact of the transaction. We will continue to consolidate the results of Electrical and Metal products until closing, which we will expect to happen in the December to January time frame. Post closing, we will report the earnings from our remaining ownership under the equity method, meaning a single after-tax number in our P&L within income from continuing operations.
As you know, the results of this business are difficult to predict. On a full year basis, we have assumed a 10% increase in operating earnings in 2011 to $125 million. For purposes of our guidance, we expect Electrical and Metal products to contribute approximately $360 million of revenue and $20 million of operating earnings before special items in the first quarter.
For the remainder of 2011, we expect our equity interest post closing will result in an expected loss of approximately $15 million, due primarily to non-cash acquisition accounting adjustments such as the write-up of inventory, as well as interest charges. The $720 million of cash from the transaction will be used to buy back shares in our second and third quarters. We estimate that total earnings per share we will report from operations of Electrical and Metal products and a lower share count will add approximately $0.07 per share to our base Tyco EPS in 2011 and $0.12 per share on an annualized basis.
In addition, we expect to report an after-tax gain of approximately $200 million on the transaction. Again, we expect there will be minimal taxes on the transaction.
Let me touch on a few other important items. First, corporate expense before special items was $110 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year corporate expense to $444 million. As we look ahead to 2011, we expect corporate expense for the full year to be in the range of $400 million to $420 million, with about $100 million of expense in the first quarter.
Turning to interest expense. We had $56 million of net interest expense in the quarter. As this reflects a full quarter's benefit of the debt refinancing we completed in the third quarter, this is a good quarterly run rate for fiscal 2011's net interest expense.
Next, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.6%, well below the rate we guided to last quarter. The reduced rate was a result of a number of positive, non-recurring tax items, which were recorded in the quarter. For 2011, we are expecting our tax rate to be in the range of 18% to 19%, an increase from this year's 13% level. Anticipated increases in earnings and high tax jurisdictions, as well as non-recurring tax benefits reported in 2010 will drive the increase in the rate next year.
As you have seen in the past, you should expect some volatility in this rate quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of recognizing certain tax matters. We exited the year with a diluted share count of 493 million shares. Based on our $1 billion share repurchase program, we expect an average share count of approximately 480 million shares in fiscal 2011.
Let me quickly now touch on restructuring. As Ed mentioned, we were active in executing numerous restructuring actions to reduce our cost base in 2010, and we also incurred charges in connection with the acquisition of Broadview Security. We ended 2010 with total restructuring and acquisition charges of approximately $180 million and a net gain on divestitures of about $40 million.
For 2011, we expect to incur restructuring and acquisition charges of approximately $150 million related to the Broadview acquisition and other restructuring actions. As I mentioned previously, we expect to report a gain on the divestiture of Electrical and Metal products of approximately $200 million. We will continue to exclude both the charges and the gain from our guidance in 2011 in order to provide a more meaningful analysis of our quarterly results. We will, however, continue to provide you all of the details of our special items on a segment-by-segment basis. 
Before I turn the call back over to Ed, I want to call your attention to the realignment of our segments, which will begin in the first fiscal quarter of 2011. We have created an integrated Global Fire segment, consolidating the Fire Suppression and Life Safety platforms of our current Safety Products segment into our Fire Protection segment, which will be led by George Oliver. Additionally, the Electronic Security Products platform within our current Safety Products segment will be integrated into our ADT business, which will continue to be led by Naren Gursahaney. So when we report our first quarter results, we will have three core segments of Security, Fire and Flow Control. 
Now let me turn the call back over to Ed to wrap up this morning's call."
107534,114273536,86808,"Tyco International Ltd., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2010",2010-11-09,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thanks, Chris. Let's turn now to our earnings guidance, starting with some thoughts on the fiscal first quarter. We expect to see growth in our ADT business, both on the top line and in our operating margin, driven by continued growth in our higher-margin",627,"Thanks, Chris. Let's turn now to our earnings guidance, starting with some thoughts on the fiscal first quarter. We expect to see growth in our ADT business, both on the top line and in our operating margin, driven by continued growth in our higher-margin recurring revenue base, as well as the acquisition of Broadview Security. We expect ADT's revenue to approximate $2 billion, with more than 100 basis point improvement year-over-year, and the operating margin to approximately 15.5%.
Turning to Fire, we expect revenue of approximately $1.1 billion, with an operating margin of approximately 10%. In our Flow Control business, we have seen improved order activity, and we expect Flow to be a contributor to our growth and earnings in fiscal 2011, mostly in the second half of the year. Although we will have a tough revenue compare in the Water business in 2011 due to the large Australian project we recognized in 2010, we expect improvement in the Valves business and continued growth in Thermal to offset this decline on a full year basis.
For the first quarter of fiscal '11, we expect Flow Control's revenue to approximate $825 million, with an operating margin of 13%. Again, we expect Flow's revenue and earnings to increase in the second half of the year as we have seen improvement in our order activity in recent months. And just to be clear, the business-specific guidance that I provided is based on our new reporting structure that Chris just discussed.
Overall, we expect revenue in the first quarter to approximate $4.3 billion, including the $360 million revenue contribution from Electrical and Metal. We expect operating income before special items in the range of $450 million to $460 million, including the $20 million operating income contribution from Electrical and Metal. Based on these items and the specific guidance Chris provided for corporate expense and below the line items, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations before special items in the first quarter to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.67 based on a weighted average share count of just over 490 million. 
Now let's shift our guidance to the full year. We expect full year revenue of $16.6 billion to $16.8  billion, including the $370 million revenue contribution from Electrical and Metals that we expect in the first quarter. As we have continued to restructure and refine our portfolio, we expect to see continued operating margin improvement in 2011. We expect our operating margin to increase 120 to 150 basis points in 2011 to the range of 11.5% to 11.8%. Included in our full year guidance is $20 million of operating income related to Electrical and Metal in the first quarter and a $15 million loss related to our equity interest for the remainder of the year. As a result, we expect our earnings per share from continuing operations before special items for the full year to be in the range of $2.85 to $2.95. As Chris mentioned, our earnings guidance excludes acquisition and restructuring charges, as well as the net benefit from the divestiture activity.
Before I open up the lines for questions, I would like to acknowledge Chris Coughlin, who is retiring after five years as our CFO. It has been my pleasure to work alongside Chris, and I want to thank you for your significant contributions to Tyco. You have had a long and successful career, and I know you are looking forward to enjoying more time with your family and certainly, on the golf course in your retirement. I know I speak on behalf of everyone at Tyco in wishing you the best in the years ahead. 
Thanks for joining us on the call. And operator, if you could open it up for any questions."

I guess my kind of just comment to add to the question is that if you did $2.70 this year guiding $2.85 to $2.95, that would imply 6% to 9% EPS growth, with probably 3% lower share count. That's not giving yourselves much credit for operating improvements."

But to Chris' point, I think guidance for next year was $3.10, with pent in the number. If you use the numbers, again, all the analysts had in aggregate, you would take $0.26 out of the number, which would put you at $2.84. And as we just mentioned TEMP for the full year, the $20 million profit in the first quarter, $15 million loss basically neutral. So if you just do that, it would take the adjusted guidance if I just use that to $2.84, just to put some numbers around what Chris said, and we just guided to $2.85 to $2.95. So that's a big, big piece of it there. If you look at the macro picture, I mean, we're counting on -- and this will go a little bit to our earnings momentum that we think we have next year, we're counting on total revenue growth in the 4% to 5% range. Currency helps out a little bit organically, we're forecasting a little bit lower. So our swing organically would be from minus, say, 3% that we had in fiscal 2010 to a plus approximately 2% to 3% in fiscal 2011. So that would be the revenue line. And then to your question on the operating income growth, if you just take Electrical and Metal out of this conversation, we will be growing our operating income somewhere in the mid- to high teens year-over-year on that 4% to 5% revenue growth. So I think we're going to get that good leverage through the P&L during the year. Part of that will be the Broadview acquisition being in for the full year and a very big piece of that, obviously, will be our cost containment and restructuring actions continuing to take in."

But I mean, if you look at it now, I think we've got a very good handle as we just mentioned around the recurring part of the business, kind of growing in the 4% to 5% range.

So I think those two, I think, are pretty locked in I would think if the economy kind of stays where it's at. So then if you look at the rest of the business which is Flow, overall, we're thinking that Flow is still soft in the first half of the year, with a lift in the second half of the year because we're seeing the order trends and the conversion is kind of nine months to get there. So that keeps it down a little bit, but again, second half of the year, better. And then systems installation side of both on the Fire side is down still, although nothing like it was. It's mid-single digits negative now, it was double digits and we're being much more selective on some project work. So you're still negative on the systems installations, although again, improving each quarter. And I think when you wrap all that together, that's how we kind of got to a few percentage points of organic revenue growth. And look, if the economy continues to improve, that will potentially be conservative. But we're counting on an environment we're sitting in kind of right now as we see it."

When you look at both of those other companies, a big part of their portfolio leads the Valve business, and those parts of their portfolios were up much more than the Valve part, which I think portends well for what could be coming here, which also ties to why we've been feeling so bullish about the customer activity we're seeing. So I thought this was the first good quarter from some of our competitors who have leading indicators by like six months. But yes, not only are we seeing an order increase during the last couple of quarters, but also it looks like more could be coming here, but we'll have to wait and see on that. I would point out just as another tidbit, our orders in the month of October grew 6.2%, which is, again, a little bit of an improvement from the quarter we just ended which was 5%. So the trend appears to be continuing."

Your first comment, let me just go through a bunch of kind of numbers with you to show you the pattern. When the business dropped at fiscal '09, our orders were down a little more than 20%. In the first quarter of 2010",283,"Yes, well, let me just clarify that. Your first comment, let me just go through a bunch of kind of numbers with you to show you the pattern. When the business dropped at fiscal '09, our orders were down a little more than 20%. In the first quarter of 2010, our orders were down 13%. Then we started to go positive, and let me just read you them, second quarter was 3.6% positive, third quarter was 4.3% positive and the fourth quarter was 5.3% positive. And I just mentioned a moment ago, October was plus 6.2%. So although that's I would say mid-single digit, you can see a gradual increase right through that period there. And then my other point was and again, I'm not forecasting this in our numbers, we did not take this into account, but when you look at some leading indicators like some pumps, some process management stuff that was just mentioned a moment ago from some competitors, they are seeing double-digit order growth rates occurring, and we would typically at that pattern, continue. You would potentially six, seven months down the road see that in the Valve business. And again, we have not taken double digit into account here as you can tell from our guidance. But that's kind of where things are. So to my point about just customer activity, our teams as we pulse them are feeling bullish about the activity out there. But, again, I just read you the exact numbers that we've seen so far. So gradual, I don't know if that's gradual, it's pretty significant improvement from 20% down.

And so I think we took some value off the table, which I think was the appropriate thing for our shareholders, while still providing additional upside potential and eliminating some of the volatility.

The recurring piece is kind of growing in that 4% to 5% range right now. And that should probably be 5% to 6%, a little bit better because you've got the economy's not quite there and all that. So we should be able to pick that growth rate up. And by the way, as a point, the Fire business has been picking up on service side from one point negative to plus 4% this month. So I would say that the 45% of our recurring business should be growing 5%, 6%, something like that. And then you get to kind of the Flow business, and I think that's a big question mark back to the last conversation. It's clearly a nice single-digit grower, but it is a double-digit grower because before the downturn, we were growing 15% to 20% and so was some of the other big players in the market. So I think there's a lot [indiscernible] if you talk next year but just long term, very nice upside because the infrastructure build around the world. And then our systems installation and service business, when you lump in the higher growth in emerging markets and a little bit lower growth in the other markets, it's also like a 6% grower. So you lump all that together, I think, organically in a decent economy, we have a pretty nice growth rate and a lot of stability with the recurring revenue."

With me today are Tyco’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ed Breen; and our Chief Financial Officer, Chris Coughlin.
Let me remind you that during the course of the call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to look at today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there. 
In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask you to read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press releases issued this morning and all related tables, as well as the conference call slides can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tyco.com.
When we refer to changes in average revenue per user, backlog and order activity, these changes are excluding the impact of foreign currency. Additionally, references to our operating margins during the call are excluding special items, which is a non-GAAP measure. Again, these non-GAAP measures are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release.
Now let me quickly recap this quarter's results. Revenue in the quarter of $4.5 billion was up 4% year-over-year, with organic revenue growth of 2%. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco common shareholders was $0.55 per share and included $0.19 of special items, primarily related to restructuring activities. Earnings per share from continuing operations before special items was $0.74 compared to our guidance of $0.62 to $0.64, driven by approximately $0.03 per share of better operating results and $0.08 per share due to a better-than-expected tax rate.
Now let me turn the call over to Ed for some opening comments."
107534,114273536,87055,"Tyco International Ltd., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2010",2010-11-09,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thanks, Antonella, and good morning, everyone. Overall, 2010 was a good year for Tyco. Not only am I pleased with our operating performance in yet another challenging year, but more importantly, I am pleased with how we have continued to position our busi",1038,"Thanks, Antonella, and good morning, everyone. Overall, 2010 was a good year for Tyco. Not only am I pleased with our operating performance in yet another challenging year, but more importantly, I am pleased with how we have continued to position our businesses for future growth. Before I get into our results for the quarter, I want to spend a few minutes reviewing the progress we made in 2010 in the key areas of cost management, growth investments, portfolio refinement and our focus on cash.
First, our cost management remained a top priority. Throughout the year, we were very active in identifying and executing cost-containment initiatives and restructuring programs. These actions helped offset the impact of the organic revenue decline we expected in 2010 and contributed to the 100 basis point improvement in our operating margin year-over-year.
Second, we continue to invest in our businesses to strengthen our long-term competitive capabilities for both products and services. For example, the acquisition of Broadview Security increased our recurring revenue base. Broadview's solid North American footprint brings additional capabilities and capacity to generate new high quality accounts, as well as additional install and service expertise.
Our capital spending grew modestly year-over-year as it has each year through the downturn. A high percentage of our capital goes towards growth in our large service revenue base, which continued to grow nicely in 2010 and represented about 40% of our revenue. From a technology and innovation standpoint, we increased our engineering headcount in our R&D centers around the world by almost 20% during the year. 
Let me touch on a few of our service and product introductions this year. In our ADT North America business, we recently rolled out ADT Plus (sic) [ADT Pulse], our new interactive home security platform, and we are supporting the launch with a highly visible advertising campaign. In our Fire business, we are rolling out our remote diagnostics service which allows us to remotely monitor our customers' fire alarm network. This technology enables us to diagnose problems without a truck roll, reduce the system downtime and improves our first-time fixed rate. And our Security Products business recently released a new video management platform, which allows users to seamlessly integrate analog and IP cameras into a single solution. 
Additionally, we continue to focus our efforts in emerging markets. During the year, we acquired two Brazilian Valve manufacturers, which expanded and complement our Flow Control product offerings and leadership position in South America.
Additionally, we have developed several localized products. For example, our Sensormatic business has recently introduced the essentials solution set, which is a lower-cost anti-theft solution, with feature suitable for the emerging markets. 
Third, we have completed the last major portion of our portfolio refinement with the sale of a majority interest in our Electrical and Metal products business. Earlier in the year, we took a meaningful step in repositioning ADT in Europe by divesting our business in France and more recently, we have exited some smaller, non-strategic markets. 
Last quarter, we announced the sale of our Flow Control European Waterworks business which we recently completed. Over the last few years, we have significantly refined our portfolio around our three core platforms of Security, Fire and Flow Control, and we have now reached a point where the heavy lifting is behind us.
Lastly, we continue to generate solid cash flow. During the year, we used our cash to invest in our businesses, make selective acquisitions and return excess cash to shareholders. We completed our $1 billion share repurchase program, increased our annual dividend and announced a new $1 billion share repurchase program. 
Our revenue picture has continued to brighten over the last few quarters, our organic revenue has improved each quarter throughout 2010 and in the fourth quarter, we reported organic revenue growth of 2%, with improvement in all business segments. More importantly, order activity has continued to improve on a year-over-year basis each quarter throughout the year. For the quarter, our operating margin improved 120 basis points year-over-year, and we expect that it will continue to improve in each business segment in 2011.
Now let me give you a quick overview of our results for the quarter for each of the businesses, and then Chris will provide you with more detail in a few minutes. Starting with ADT, our recurring revenue continues to perform well with improvement in all key metrics: account growth, ARPU and a disconnect rate, all of which translated into organic recurring revenue growth of 5% in the quarter. Systems installation and service revenue stabilized last quarter after six consecutive quarters of organic revenue decline and grew 1% in the fourth quarter, driven by the Asia-Pacific and Latin America regions. Additionally, we continue to make margin progress in our ADT EMEA region which exited the quarter with an operating margin of 9.8%, reflecting the benefits of our restructuring actions and portfolio refinement.
On a global basis, ADT's operating margin improved both sequentially and year-over-year, driven by improved operational performance in our systems installation and service revenue, growth in our higher-margin recurring revenue business which is partly attributable to the Broadview acquisition and the continued benefit of restructuring and cost-reduction activities.
Turning to Flow Control. Our revenue was in-line with our forecast. However, our fourth quarter operating earnings were impacted by a charge related to a project that we retained as part of the 2008 divestiture of our Earth Tech business. Absent this, our operating margin was better than expected. Year-over-year, growth in our Flow Control orders continued in the fourth quarter. Orders were up in all three platforms of Valves, Water and Thermal, and our customer activity continues to be strong. 
Moving to Fire. The turnaround in order activity we saw last quarter has continued. The summer seasonality of our service work, as well as the benefits from restructuring and cost containment resulted in better-than-expected operating income in the quarter. 
And finally, Safety Products saw strong order activity in the fourth quarter, resulting in better-than-expected organic revenue growth. More importantly, we accelerated our investments in R&D and sales and marketing to better position the business for future growth.
Now let me turn the call over to Chris to discuss our operating results in more detail."
107534,114273536,87055,"Tyco International Ltd., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2010",2010-11-09,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone.

Revenue of $1.95 billion grew 8% in the quarter, with organic revenue growth of 3%. Recurring revenue, which represents more than half of ADT's total revenue, continued to perform nicely, growing 5% organically in the quarter, driven by continued strong growth in North America. Additionally, ADT's systems installation and service revenue grew 1% organically in the quarter. Strong organic growth in the rest of the world more than offset the modest decline in North America and EMEA.
From a profit perspective, operating income before special items in the quarter was $306 million, and the operating margin was 15.7%. The operating margin improved 150 basis points year-over-year, while we continue to increase our investment in sales and marketing.
From a regional perspective within ADT, nearly 90% of our North American Residential and small business unit is recurring revenue, which grew approximately 35% or 7% organically in the quarter. The operating margin remains strong year-over-year, while we continue to invest in our sales force expansion.
Additionally, our key metrics continued their positive momentum. Year-over-year, average revenue per user grew 1%, and our account base grew 2%, excluding the accounts we acquired as part of the Broadview acquisition. Our Residential attrition rate improved 40 basis points year-over-year and 10 basis points on a quarter-sequential basis to 13%.
Turning to our North America Commercial business. The mix of revenue is very different. 60% is systems installation and service revenue, while 40% is recurring revenue. The organic revenue decline moderated to 1% in the quarter, and we saw a nice turn in commercial order activity which was up 10% year-over-year. The operating margin improved 50 basis points year-over-year as the benefits of restructuring and cost-containment activities more than offset the revenue decline. The attrition rate remains in the low 13% range, which is a nice improvement from the 13.8% attrition rate in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Next in EMEA, the organic revenue decline continued to moderate, declining 1% in the quarter, which is an improvement from the mid-single digits we saw earlier in the year. The operating margin improved 260 basis points year-over-year to 9.8% as we have made significant strides in restructuring the region. 
And finally, in the Asia-Pacific and Latin America regions where revenue is predominantly commercial, we saw solid organic revenue growth of 11% in the quarter. The operating margin is in the low teens and reflects a 140 basis points improvement year-over-year. Emerging markets performed well during the quarter growing double digits organically as we continue to focus on expanding our presence.
Turning to our key metrics for ADT Worldwide. Our global account base now stands at 8.9 million accounts, which is a 21% increase over 2009 and a 3% increase when adjusting for the accounts acquired in the Broadview acquisition. Average revenue per user for our heritage ADT account base grew 1.5% year-over-year on a global basis.
As the mix in our account base has shifted more to Residential with the Broadview acquisition, our global average revenue per user of $44.60 declined 3%. Our worldwide attrition rate held steady at 12.8% on a sequential basis.
Before I move on to Flow Control, let me quickly touch on the Broadview integration. We have completed two major milestones in the Broadview integration since our last earnings call. First, our customer day one, which included the conversion from Broadview Brinks to a single ADT brand in the marketplace was very successful, all advertisement and marketing materials have been fully converted to the ADT brand name. Secondly, we have integrated our financial reporting in human resource systems. Overall, the Broadview integration is progressing as planned and we are on track to continue to deliver on our synergy and earnings accretion targets.
Turning now to Flow Control. Revenue of $868 million in the quarter declined 5% organically, which was in line with our guidance. Solid organic revenue growth in Water of 9% and Thermal Control of 8% was more than offset by a 12% decline in Valves. We expect the organic revenue decline in Valves to continue to moderate based on increased Valve order activity over the last few quarters.
Operating income before special items was $111 million, and the operating margin was 12.8%. Included in the operating income is a $9 million charge related to a project we retained as a part of the Earth Tech divestiture in 2008, which adversely impacted the operating margin by 100 basis points. The operating margin continues to be impacted by volume de-leveraging, which was partially offset by the restructuring activities and cost-containment action. These changes in our cost structure will enhance our operating margin performance as volume continues to improve. 
We continue to be encouraged by our order activity, which has improved on a year-over-year basis for the last three quarters. As you may recall, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we received a large order for an Australian desalinization project. Excluding the impact of this project, order rates in the quarter increased 5% year-over-year. To date, we have completed 75% of that project and expect to recognize the remaining revenue during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. 
As we completed several large Pacific water projects, including shipments related to the desalinization project during the quarter, backlog of $1.5 billion declined 5% on a quarter-sequential basis.
Turning to Fire Protection Services, revenue in the quarter was $893 million, and organic revenue declined 1%. Service revenue, which represents more than 50% of the total revenue, grew 4% organically in the quarter and was more than offset by continued weakness in systems installation, which declined 6% in the quarter. However, the pace of the decline in systems installation has slowed considerably from the double-digit decline we have seen in previous quarters even as we continue to be very selective in our project work.
Operating income before special items was $91 million in the quarter, and operating margin was 10.2%. Growth in service revenue along with continued benefits from restructuring and cost-containment activities, as well as the selectivity of project work contributed to this operating margin performance. 
Order activity in Fire continued to be encouraging, with a 4% year-over-year increase in the quarter. Typically, Fire is operationally stronger in the summer months especially in the education end-market as a significant amount of electronic upgrade work is performed while schools are closed. As expected, backlog of $1.2 billion declined 4% on a quarter-sequential basis.
Moving on to Safety Products. Revenue grew 9% in the quarter to $406 million, with organic revenue growth of 13%. The organic revenue growth was driven by solid performance across all three platforms. Electronic Security grew 24%, Life Safety grew 18%, and Fire Suppression grew 6%. 
Before special items, operating income increased 17% to $63 million, and the operating margin improved 100 basis points to 15.5% year-over-year even as we accelerated certain sales, marketing and R&D investments in the quarter. Strong organic revenue growth, benefits from restructuring activities and improved productivity contributed to the operating margin improvement during the quarter. 
On a full year basis, we increased our investment in R&D, sales and marketing by 6% in Safety Products, and we will continue to drive innovation especially as we build out our presence in the emerging markets.
As we announced earlier this morning, we have agreed to sell 51% of our Electrical and Metal Products business to CD&R. Total cash from the transaction to Tyco is approximately $720 million, with minimal tax leakage. We came to the conclusion that a sale of a majority stake in Electrical and Metal products would be in the best interest of our shareholders based on several key factors. 
First, it provides our shareholders with an attractive value for the 51% ownership stake, $720 million in cash and a retained interest of 49%. We will use the proceeds to accelerate our previously announced $1 billion share buyback program. It will also allow our shareholders to benefit from an eventual divestiture of our remaining stake as the markets in Electrical and Metal products strengthen in the future, and it increases our focus on our core Security, Fire and Flow Control business platforms and will increase our service revenue to about 45% of our total revenue next year. It also reduces volatility in our operating results. And lastly, the Electrical and Metal Products business will be able to pursue its own strategy as a separate company, led by its own management team.
So let me quickly summarize the estimated earnings impact of the transaction. We will continue to consolidate the results of Electrical and Metal products until closing, which we will expect to happen in the December to January time frame. Post-closing, we will report the earnings from our remaining ownership under the equity method, meaning a single after-tax number in our P&L within income from continuing operations.
As you know, the results of this business are difficult to predict. On a full year basis, we have assumed a 10% increase in operating earnings in 2011 to $125 million. For purposes of our guidance, we expect Electrical and Metal products to contribute approximately $360 million of revenue and $20 million of operating earnings before special items in the first quarter.
For the remainder of 2011, we expect our equity interest post-closing will result in an expected loss of approximately $15 million, due primarily to non-cash acquisition accounting adjustments such as the write-up of inventory, as well as interest charges. The $720 million of cash from the transaction will be used to buy back shares in our second and third quarters. We estimate the total earnings per share we will report from operations of Electrical and Metal products and a lower share count will add approximately $0.07 per share to our base Tyco EPS in 2011 and $0.12 per share on an annualized basis.
In addition, we expect to report an after-tax gain of approximately $200 million on the transaction. Again, we expect there will be minimal taxes on the transaction.
Let me touch on a few other important items. First, corporate expense before special items was $110 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year corporate expense to $444 million. As we look ahead to 2011, we expect corporate expense for the full year to be in the range of $400 million to $420 million, with about $100 million of expense in the first quarter.
Turning to interest expense. We had $56 million of net interest expense in the quarter. As this reflects a full quarter's benefit of the debt refinancing we completed in the third quarter, this is a good quarterly run rate for fiscal 2011's net interest expense.
Next, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.6%, well below the rate we guided to last quarter. The reduced rate was a result of a number of positive, non-recurring tax items, which were recorded in the quarter. For 2011, we are expecting our tax rate to be in the range of 18% to 19%, an increase from this year's 13% level. Anticipated increases in earnings and high tax jurisdictions, as well as non-recurring tax benefits reported in 2010 will drive the increase in the rate next year.
As you have seen in the past, you should expect some volatility in this rate quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of recognizing certain tax matters. We exited the year with a diluted share count of 493 million shares. Based on our $1 billion share repurchase program, we expect an average share count of approximately 480 million shares in fiscal 2011.
Let me quickly now touch on restructuring. As Ed mentioned, we were active in executing numerous restructuring actions to reduce our cost base in 2010, and we also incurred charges in connection with the acquisition of Broadview Security. We ended 2010 with total restructuring and acquisition charges of approximately $180 million and a net gain on divestitures of about $40 million.
For 2011, we expect to incur restructuring and acquisition charges of approximately $150 million related to the Broadview acquisition and other restructuring actions. As I mentioned previously, we expect to report a gain on the divestiture of Electrical and Metal products of approximately $200 million. We will continue to exclude both the charges and the gain from our guidance in 2011 in order to provide a more meaningful analysis of our quarterly results. We will, however, continue to provide you all of the details of our special items on a segment-by-segment basis. 
Before I turn the call back over to Ed, I want to call your attention to the realignment of our segments, which will begin in the first fiscal quarter of 2011. We have created an integrated Global Fire segment, consolidating the Fire Suppression and Life Safety platforms of our current Safety Products segment into our Fire Protection segment, which will be led by George Oliver. Additionally, the Electronic Security Products platform within our current Safety Products segment will be integrated into our ADT business, which will continue to be led by Naren Gursahaney. So when we report our first quarter results, we will have three core segments of Security, Fire and Flow Control. 
Now let me turn the call back over to Ed to wrap up this morning's call."

Let's turn now to our earnings guidance, starting with some thoughts on the fiscal first quarter. We expect to see growth in our ADT business, both on the top line and in our operating margin, driven by continued growth in our higher-margin",625,"Thanks, Chris. Let's turn now to our earnings guidance, starting with some thoughts on the fiscal first quarter. We expect to see growth in our ADT business, both on the top line and in our operating margin, driven by continued growth in our higher-margin recurring revenue base, as well as the acquisition of Broadview Security. We expect ADT's revenue to approximate $2 billion, with more than 100 basis point improvement year-over-year in the operating margin, to approximately 15.5%.
Turning to Fire, we expect revenue of approximately $1.1 billion, with an operating margin of approximately 10%. In our Flow Control business, we have seen improved order activity, and we expect Flow to be a contributor to our growth and earnings in fiscal 2011, mostly in the second half of the year. Although we will have a tough revenue compare in the Water business in 2011 due to the large Australian project we recognized in 2010, we expect improvement in the Valves business and continued growth in Thermal to offset this decline on a full-year basis.
For the first quarter of fiscal '11, we expect Flow Control's revenue to approximate $825 million, with an operating margin of 13%. Again, we expect Flow's revenue and earnings to increase in the second half of the year as we have seen improvement in our order activity in recent months. And just to be clear, the business-specific guidance that I provided is based on our new reporting structure that Chris just discussed.
Overall, we expect revenue in the first quarter to approximate $4.3 billion, including the $360 million revenue contribution from Electrical and Metal. We expect operating income before special items in the range of $450 million to $460 million, including the $20 million operating income contribution from Electrical and Metal. Based on these items and the specific guidance Chris provided for corporate expense and below the line items, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations before special items in the first quarter to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.67 based on a weighted average share count of just over 490 million. 
Now let's shift our guidance to the full year. We expect full year revenue of $16.6 billion to $16.8 billion, including the $370 million revenue contribution from Electrical and Metals that we expect in the first quarter. As we have continued to restructure and refine our portfolio, we expect to see continued operating margin improvement in 2011. We expect our operating margin to increase 120 to 150 basis points in 2011 to the range of 11.5% to 11.8%. Included in our full year guidance is $20 million of operating income related to Electrical and Metal in the first quarter and a $15 million loss related to our equity interest for the remainder of the year. As a result, we expect our earnings per share from continuing operations before special items for the full year to be in the range of $2.85 to $2.95. As Chris mentioned, our earnings guidance excludes acquisition and restructuring charges, as well as the net benefit from divestiture activity.
Before I open up the lines for questions, I would like to acknowledge Chris Coughlin, who is retiring after five years as our CFO. It has been my pleasure to work alongside Chris, and I want to thank you for your significant contributions to Tyco. You have had a long and successful career, and I know you are looking forward to enjoying more time with your family and certainly, on the golf course in your retirement. I know I speak on behalf of everyone at Tyco in wishing you the best in the years ahead. 
Thanks for joining us on the call. And operator, if you could open it up for any questions."

I guess my kind of just comment to add to the question is that if you did $2.70 this year guiding $2.85 to $2.95, that would imply 6% to 9% EPS growth, with probably 3% lower share count. That's not giving yourselves much credit for operating improvements."

Therefore, we’re looking at pretty significant growth year-over-year. Additionally, we had the tax headwind of about $0.20 per share. So operationally, I think we're going to be up.

But to Chris' point, I think guidance for next year was $3.10, with TEMP in the number. If you use the numbers, again, all the analysts had in aggregate, you would take $0.26 out of the number, which would put you at $2.84. And as we just mentioned TEMP for the full year, the $20 million profit in the first quarter, $15 million loss the rest of the year is basically just neutral. So if you just do that, it would take the adjusted guidance, if I just use, that to $2.84, just to put some numbers around what Chris said, and we just guided to $2.85 to $2.95. So that's a big, big piece of it there. If you look at the macro picture, I mean, we're counting on -- and this will go a little bit to our earnings momentum that we think we have next year, we're counting on total revenue growth in the 4% to 5% range. Currency helps out a little bit organically, we're forecasting a little bit lower. So our swing organically would be from minus, say, 3% that we had in fiscal 2010 to a plus approximately 2% to 3% in fiscal 2011. So that would be the revenue line. And then to your question on the operating income growth, if you just take Electrical and Metal out of this conversation, we will be growing our operating income somewhere in the mid- to high-teens year-over-year on that 4% to 5% revenue growth. So I think we're going to get that good leverage through the P&L during the year. Part of that will be the Broadview acquisition being in for the full year and a very big piece of that, obviously, will be our cost containment and restructuring actions continuing to tick in."

But I mean, if you look at it now, I think we've got a very good handle as we just mentioned around the recurring part of the business, kind of growing in the 4% to 5% range. So ADT recurring is in the 4% to 5% on a global basis. North America would be higher when you lump it all together, and Fire in the quarter on a service rev base grew about 4%. So I think those two, I think, are pretty locked in I would think, if the economy kind of stays where it's at. So then if you look at the rest of the business which is Flow, overall, we're thinking that Flow is still soft in the first half of the year, with a lift in the second half of the year because we're seeing the order trends and the conversion is kind of nine months to get there. So that keeps it down a little bit, but again, second half of the year, better. And then systems installation side of both -- on the Fire side is down still, although nothing like it was. It's mid-single digits negative now, it was double digits and we're being much more selective on some project work. So you're still negative on the systems installation side, although again, improving each quarter. And I think when you wrap all that together, that's how we kind of got to a few percentage points of organic revenue growth. And look, if the economy continues to improve, that will potentially be conservative. But we're counting on an environment we're sitting in kind of right now as we see it."

And the other company we always get compared to out there, when you look at the order growth in the quarter, order growth on the like-for-like business is very similar. But Nigel, I would point out to you, again, I don't want to read too much into this, and we're not taking this fully into account. When you look at both of those other companies, a big part of their portfolio leads the Valve business, and those parts of their portfolios were up much more than the Valve part, which I think portends well for what could be coming here, which also ties to why we've been feeling so bullish about the customer activity we're seeing. So I thought this was the first good quarter from some of our competitors who have leading indicators by like six months. But yes, not only are we seeing an order increase during the last couple of quarters, but also it looks like more could be coming here, but we'll have to wait and see on that. I would point out just as another tidbit, our orders in the month of October grew 6.2%, which is, again, a little bit of an improvement from the quarter we just ended which was 5%.

And so I think we took some value off the table, which I think was the appropriate thing for our shareholders, while still providing additional upside potential and eliminating some of the volatility. And again, it's unknown as to how long it would take to get back to sort of historic levels. So I think that the value of cash today when you look at it on a DCF kind of basis, we took all of those things into consideration, looked at all alternatives and clearly believe that this is the better alternative for our shareholders than a spin of the business."

The recurring piece is kind of growing in that 4% to 5% range right now. And that should probably be 5% to 6%, a little bit better because you've got a bad -- the economy's not quite there and all that. So we should be able to pick that growth rate up. And by the way, as a point, the Fire business has been picking up on service side from one point negative to plus 4% this month. So I would say that the 45% of our recurring business should be growing 5%, 6%, something like that. And then you get to kind of the Flow business, and I think that's a big question mark back to the last conversation. It's clearly a nice single-digit grower, but it is a double-digit grower because before the downturn, we were growing 15% to 20% and so was some of the other big players in the market. So I think there's a lot of oomph in that business if you talk not next year but just long term, very nice upside because of infrastructure build around the world. And then our systems installation and service business, when you lump in the higher growth in emerging markets and a little bit lower growth in the other markets, is also like a 6% grower. So you lump all that together, I think, organically in a decent economy, we have a pretty nice growth rate and a lot of stability with the recurring revenue."

With me today, are Tyco's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ed Breen and our Chief Financial Officer, Chris Coughlin.
Let me remind you that during the course of the call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to look at today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there.
In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions and we ask you to read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press releases issued this morning and all related tables, as well as the conference call slides, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at Tyco.com.
When we refer to changes in average revenue per user, backlog and order activity, these changes are excluding the impact of foreign currency. Additionally, references to our operating margins during the call are excluding special items, which is a non-GAAP measure. Again, these non-GAAP measures are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release.
Now, let me quickly recap this quarter's results. Revenue in the quarter of $4.5 billion was up 4% year-over-year with organic revenue growth of 2%. Earnings per share from continuing operations, attributable to Tyco common shareholders was $0.55 per share and included $0.19 of special items, primarily related to restructuring activities.
Earnings per share from continuing operations before special items was $0.74, compared to our guidance of $0.62 to $0.64, driven by approximately $0.03 per share of better operating results and $0.08 per share due to a better than expected tax rate.
Now let me turn the call over to Ed for some opening comments.

And good morning, everyone. Overall, 2010 was a good year for Tyco. Not only am I pleased with our operating performance in yet another challenging year, but more importantly, I am pleased with how we have continued to position our businesses for future growth.
Before I get into our results for the quarter, I want to spend a few minutes reviewing the progress we made in 2010, in the key areas of cost management, growth investments, portfolio refinement and our focus on cash.
First, our cost management remained a top priority. Throughout the year, we were very active in identifying and executing cost containment initiatives and restructuring programs. These actions helped to offset the impact of the organic revenue decline we expected in 2010 and contributed to the 100 basis point improvement in our operating margin, year-over-year.
Second, we continue to invest in our businesses to strengthen our long-term competitive capabilities for both products and services. For example, the acquisition of Broadview Security increased our recurring revenue base. Broadview's solid and North American footprint brings additional capability and capacity to generate new high quality accounts, as well as additional install and service expertise.
Our capital spending grew modestly year-over-year, as it has each year through the downturn. A high percentage of our capital goes towards growth in our large service revenue base, which continued to grow nicely in 2010 and represented about 40% of our revenue. From a technology and innovation standpoint, we increased our engineering head count in our R&D centers around the world by almost 20% during the year.
Let me touch on a few of our service and product introductions this year. In our ADT North America business, we recently rolled out ADT Plus, our new interactive home security platform and we are supporting the launch with a highly visible advertising campaign.
In our Fire business, we are rolling out our remote diagnostic service, which allows us to remotely monitor our customers fire alarm network. This technology enables us to diagnose problems without a truck roll, reduces system downtime and improves our first-time fix rate.
And, our security products business recently released a new video management platform, which allows users to seamlessly integrate analog and IP cameras into a single solution.
Additionally, we continue to focus our efforts in emerging markets. During the year, we acquired two Brazilian valve manufacturers, which expanded and compliment our Flow Control product offerings and leadership position in South America.
Additionally, we have developed several localized products. For example, our Sensormatic business has recently introduced the Essentials solution set, which is a lower cost, anti-theft solution with features suitable for the emerging markets.
Third, we have completed the last major portion of our portfolio refinement with the sale of the majority interest in our electrical and metal products business. Earlier in the year, we took a meaningful step in repositioning ADT in Europe by divesting our business in France and more recently, we have exited some smaller non-strategic markets.
Last quarter, we announced the sale of our Flow Control European Waterworks business, which we recently completed. Over the last few years, we have significantly refined our portfolio around our three core platforms of Security, Fire and Flow Control and we have now reached a point where the heavy lifting is behind us.
Lastly, we continue to generate solid cash flow. During the year, we used our cash to invest in our businesses, make selective acquisitions and return excess cash to shareholders. We completed our $1 billion share repurchase program, increased our annual dividend and announced a new $1 billion share repurchase program.
Our revenue picture has continued to brighten over the last few quarters. Our organic revenue has improved each quarter throughout 2010 and in the fourth quarter, we reported organic revenue growth of 2% with improvement in all business segments.
More importantly, order activity has continued to improve on a year-over-year basis, each quarter throughout the year. For the quarter, our operating margin improved 120 basis points; year-over-year and we expect that it will continue to improve in each business segment in 2011.
Now, let me give you a quick overview of our results for the quarter, for each of the businesses and then Chris will provide you with more details in a few minutes. Starting with ADT, our recurring revenue continues to perform well with improvement in all key metrics, account growth, ARPU and the disconnect rate, all of which translated into organic recurring revenue growth of 5% in the quarter.
Systems Installation and Service revenue stabilized last quarter, after six consecutive quarters of organic revenue decline and grew 1% in the fourth quarter, driven by the Asia, Pacific and Latin America regions.
Additionally, we continued to make margin progress in our ADT EMEA region, which exited the quarter with an operating margin of 9.8%, reflecting the benefits of our restructuring actions and portfolio refinement.
On a global basis, ADT's operating margin improved both sequentially and year-over-year driven by improved operational performance in our Systems Installation and Service revenue, growth in our higher margin recurring revenue business, which is partly attributable to the Broadview acquisition and the continued benefit of restructuring and cost reduction activities.
Turning to Flow Control, our revenue was in-line with our forecast. However, our fourth quarter operating earnings were impacted by a charge related to a project, that we retained as part of the 2008 divestiture of our Earth Tech business. Absent this, our operating margin was better than expected.
Year-over-year, growth in our Flow Control orders continued in the fourth quarter. Orders were up in all three platforms of valves, water and thermal and our customer activity continues to be strong.
Moving to Fire, the turnaround in order activity we saw last quarter has continued. The summer seasonality of our service work, as well as the benefits from restructuring and cost containment resulted in better than expected operating income in the quarter.
And finally, safety products saw strong order activity in the fourth quarter, resulting in better than expected organic revenue growth. More importantly, we accelerated our investments in R&D and sales and marketing, to better position the business for future growth.
Now, let me turn the call over to Chris to discuss our operating results in more detail.

Let me start with ADT Worldwide. Revenue of $1.95 billion grew 8% in the quarter with organic revenue growth of 3%. Recurring revenue, which represents more than half ADT's total revenue, continued to perform nicely",2215,"Thanks, Ed. And good morning, everyone. Let me start with ADT Worldwide. Revenue of $1.95 billion grew 8% in the quarter with organic revenue growth of 3%. Recurring revenue, which represents more than half ADT's total revenue, continued to perform nicely, growing 5% organically in the quarter, driven by continued strong growth in North America.
Additionally, ADT Systems Installation and Service revenue grew 1% organically in the quarter. Strong organic growth in the rest of the world more than offset the modest decline in North America and EMEA.
From a proper perspective, operating income before special items in the quarter was $306 million and the operating margin was 15.7%. The operating margin improved 150 basis points, year-over-year, while we continued to increase our investment in sales and marketing.
From a regional perspective, within ADT, nearly 90% of our North America residential and small business unit is recurring revenue, which grew approximately 35% or 7% organically in the quarter. The operating margin remains strong year-over-year, while we continued to invest in our sales force expansion.
Additionally, our key metrics continued their positive momentum. Year-over-year, average revenue per user grew 1% and our account base grew 2%, excluding the accounts we acquired as part of the Broadview acquisition. Our residential attrition rate improved 40 basis points year-over-year and 10 basis points on a quarter sequential basis to 13%.
Turning to our North America Commercial business, the mix of revenue is very different, 60% is Systems Installation and Service revenue, while 40% is recurring revenue. The organic revenue decline moderated to 1% in the quarter and we saw a nice turn in commercial order activity, which was up 10% year-over-year.
The operating margin improved 50 basis points year-over-year, as the benefits of restructuring and cost containment activities more than offset the revenue decline. The attrition rate remains in the low 13% range, which is a nice improvement from the 13.8% attrition rate in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Next, in EMEA, the organic revenue decline continued to moderate, declining 1% in the quarter, which is an improvement from the mid-single digits we saw earlier in the year. The operating margin improved 260 basis points year-over-year to 9.8%, as we have made significant strides in restructuring the region.
And finally, in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions, where revenue is predominantly commercial, we saw solid organic revenue growth of 11% in the quarter. The operating margin is in the low teens and reflects a 140 basis points improvement year-over-year. Emerging markets performed well during the quarter, running double digits organically, as we continue to focus on expanding our presence.
Turning to our key metrics for ADT Worldwide, our global account base now stands at $8.9 million accounts, which is a 21% increase over 2009 and a 3% increase when adjusting for the accounts acquired in the Broadview acquisition. Average revenue per user for our Heritage ADT account base grew 1.5% year-over-year on a global basis.
As the mix in our account base has shifted more to residential with the Broadview acquisition, our global average revenue per user of $44.60, declined 3%. Our worldwide attrition rate held steady at 12.8%, on a sequential basis.
Before I move on to Flow Control, let me quickly touch on the Broadview integration. We have completed two major milestones in the Broadview integration since our last earnings call. First, our customer day one, which included the conversion from Broadview Brinks, to a single ADT brand in the market place was very successful.
While advertisement and marketing materials have been fully converted to the ADT brand name. Secondly, we have integrated our financial reporting and human resource systems. Overall, the Broadview integration is progressing and as planned and we are on track to continue to deliver on our synergy and earnings accretion targets.
Turning now to Flow Control, revenue of $868 million in the quarter declined 5% organically, which was in line with our guidance. Solid organic revenue growth in Water of 9% and Thermal Controls of 8% was more than offset by a 12% decline in Valves. We expect the organic revenue decline in Valves to continue to moderate, based on increased Valve order activity, over the last few quarters.
Operating income before special items was $111 million and the operating margin was 12.8%. Included in the operating income, is a $9 million charge related to a project we retained as a part of the Earth Tech divestiture in 2008, which adversely impacted the operating margin by 100 basis points.
The operating margin continues to be impacted by volume deleveraging, which was partially offset by the restructuring activities and cost containment actions. These changes in our cost structure will enhance our operating margin performance as volume continues to improve.
We continue to be encouraged by our order activity, which has improved on a year-over-year basis for the last three quarters. As you may recall, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we received a large order for an Australian desalinization project. Excluding the impact of this project, order rates in the quarter increased 5%, year-over-year.
To date, we have completed 75% of that project and expect to recognize the remaining revenue during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. As we completed several large Pacific Water projects, including shipments related to the desalinization project during the quarter, backlog of $1.5 billion declined 5% on a quarter sequential basis.
Turning to Fire Protection services, revenue in the quarter was $893 million in organic revenue, declined 1%. Service revenue, which represents more than 50% of total revenue, grew 4% organically in the quarter and was more than offset by continued weakness in Systems Installation, which declined 6% in the quarter.
However, the pace of the decline in Systems Installation has slowed considerably, from the double-digit decline we have seen in previous quarters, even as we continue to be very selective in our project work.
Operating income before special items was $91 million in the quarter and operating margin was 10.2%. Growth in service revenue, along with continued benefits from restructuring and cost containment activity, as well as the selectivity of project work contributed to this operating margin performance.
Order activity and Fire continued to be encouraging with a 4% year-over-year increase in the quarter. Typically, Fire is operationally stronger in the summer months, especially in the education end market, as a significant amount of electronic upgrade work is performed while schools are closed. As expected, backlog of $1.2 billion declined 4% on a quarter sequential basis.
Moving on to Safety Products, revenue grew 9% in the quarter to $406 million with organic revenue growth of 13%. The organic revenue growth was driven by solid performance across all three platforms. Electronic security grew 24%. Life Safety grew 18% and Fire Suppression grew 6%.
Before special items, operating income increased 17% to $63 million and the operating margin improved 100 basis points, to 15.5% year-over-year, even as we accelerated certain sales, marketing and R&D investments in the quarter.
Strong organic revenue growth, benefits from restructuring activity and improved productivity, contributed to the operating margin improvement during the quarter.
On a full-year basis, we increased our investment in R&D, sales and marketing, by 6% in Safety Product and we will continue to drive innovation, especially as we build out our presence in the emerging markets.
As we announced early this morning, we have agreed to sell 51% of our Electrical and Metal Products business to CD&R. Total cash in the transaction to Tyco is approximately $720 million, with minimal tax leakage. We came to the conclusion that a sale of a majority stake in Electrical and Metal Products would be in the best interest of our shareholders, based on several key factors.
First, it provides our shareholders with an attractive value for the 51% ownership stake, $720 million in cash and a retained interest of 49%. We will use the proceeds to accelerate our previously announced $1 billion share buyback program. And we will also allow our shareholders to benefit from an eventual divestiture of our remaining stake as the markets in electrical metal products strengthen in the future.
And it increases our focus on our core security buyer and Flow Control business platforms and will increase our service revenue to about 45% of our total revenue next year. It also reduces volatility in our operating results and lastly, the Electrical and Metal Products business will be able to pursue its own strategy as a separate company led by its own management team.
So let me quickly summarize the estimated earnings impact of the transaction.
We will continue to consolidate the results of Electrical and Metal Products until closing, which we will expect to happen in the December-to-January timeframe. Post-closing, we will report the earnings from our remaining ownership under the equity method, meaning a single after-tax number in our P&L, within income from continuing operations.
As you know, the results of this business are difficult to predict. On a full-year basis, we have assumed a 10% increase in operating earnings in 2011 to $125 million. For purposes of our guidance, we expect Electrical and Metal Products to contribute approximately $360 million of revenue and $20 million of operating earnings before special items, in the first quarter.
For the remainder of 2011, we expect our equity interest post-closing will result in an expected loss of approximately $15 million, due primarily to noncash acquisition accounting adjustments, such as the write-up of inventory, as well as interest charges. The $720 million of cash from the transaction will be used to buy back shares in our second and third quarters.
We estimate the total earnings per share, we will report from operations of Electrical and Metal Products and a lower share count, will add approximately $0.07 per share to our base Tyco EPS in 2011 and $0.12 per share on an annualized basis. In addition, we expect to report an after-tax gain of approximately $200 million on the transaction. Again, we expect there will be minimal taxes on the transaction.
Let me touch on a few other important items. First, corporate expense before special items was $110 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our full-year corporate expense to $444 million. As we look ahead to 2011, we expect corporate expense for the full year to be in the range of $400 million to $420 million, with about $100 million of expense in the first quarter.
Turning to interest expense, we had $56 million of net interest expense in the quarter. As this reflects a full quarter's benefit of the debt refinancing we completed in the third quarter, this is a good quarterly run rate for fiscal 2011's net interest expense.
Next, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.6%, well below the rate we guided to last quarter. The reduced rate was a result of a number of positive nonrecurring tax items, which were recorded in the quarter.
For 2011, we are expecting our tax rate to be in the range of 18% to 19%, an increase from this year's 13% level. Anticipated increases in earnings and high tax jurisdictions, as well as nonrecurring tax benefits reported in 2010, will drive the increase in the rate next year.
As you have seen in the past, you should expect some volatility in this rate, quarter-to-quarter, due to the timing of recognizing certain tax matters. We exited the year with a diluted share count of 493 million shares. Based on our $1 billion share repurchase program, we expect an average share count of approximately 480 million shares in fiscal 2011.
Let me quickly now touch on restructuring.
As Ed mentioned, we were active in executing numerous restructuring actions to reduce our cost base in 2010. And we also incurred charges in connection with the acquisition of Broadview Security. We ended 2010 with total restructuring and acquisition charges of approximately $180 million and a net gain on divestitures of about $40 million.
For 2011, we expect to incur restructuring and acquisition charges of approximately $150 million, related to the Broadview acquisition and other restructuring actions. As I mentioned previously, we would expect to report a gain on the divestiture of Electrical and Metal Products of approximately $200 million.
We will continue to exclude both the charges and the gain from our guidance in 2011, in order to provide a more meaningful analysis of our quarterly results. We will, however, continue to provide you all of the details of our special items, on a segment-by-segment basis.
Before I turn the call back over to Ed, I want to call your attention to the realignment of our segments, which will begin in the first fiscal quarter of 2011.
We have created an integrated global fire segment, consolidating the fire suppression and life safety platforms of our current Safety Product segment, into our Fire Protection segment, which will be led by George Oliver.
Additionally, the Electronic Security products platform, within our current Safety Products segment, will be integrated into our ADT business, which will continue to be led by Naren Gursahaney. So when we report our first quarter result, we will have three core segments of Security, Fire and Flow Control.
Now, let me turn the call back over to Ed to wrap up this morning's call.

Let's turn now to our earnings guidance starting with some thoughts on the fiscal first quarter.We expect to see growth in our ADT business, both on the top line and in our operating margin, driven by continued growth in our higher margin",623,"Thanks, Chris. Let's turn now to our earnings guidance starting with some thoughts on the fiscal first quarter.
We expect to see growth in our ADT business, both on the top line and in our operating margin, driven by continued growth in our higher margin recurring revenue base, as well as the acquisition of Broadview Security. We expect ADT's revenue to approximate $2 billion, with more than 100 basis points improvement, year-over-year, in the operating margin to approximately 15.5%.
Turning to Fire, we expect revenue of approximately $1.1 billion, with an operating margin of approximately 10%. In our Flow Control business, we have seen improved order activity and we expect Flow to be a contributor to our growth in earnings in fiscal 2011, mostly in the second half of the year. Although we will have a tough revenue compare in the Water business in 2011, due to the large Australian project we recognized in 2010. We expect improvement in the Valves business and continued growth in Thermal, to offset this decline on a full-year basis.
For the first quarter of fiscal '11, we expect Flow Control's revenue to approximate $825 million, with an operating margin of 13%. Again, we expect Flow's revenue and earnings to increase in the second half of the year, as we have seen improvement in our order activity in recent months. And just to be clear, the business-specific guidance that I provided is based on our new reporting structure that Chris just discussed.
Overall, we expect revenue in the first quarter to approximate $4.3 billion, including the $360 million revenue contribution from Electrical and Metal. We expect operating income before special items in the range of $450 million to $460 million, including the $20 million operating income contribution from Electrical and Metal.
Based on these items and the specific guidance Chris provided for corporate expense and below-the-line items, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations, before special items, in the first quarter to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.67, based on a weighted average share count of just over 490 million.
Now, let's shift our guidance up to the full year. We expect full-year revenue of $16.6 billion to $16.8 billion, including the $370 million revenue contribution from Electrical and Metals that we expect in the first quarter.
As we have continued to restructure and refine our portfolio, we expect to see continued operating margin improvement in 2011. We expect our operating margin to increase 120 to 150 basis points, in 2011, to the range of 11.5%, to 11.8%.
Included in our full-year guidance, is $20 million of operating income related to Electrical and Metal, in the first quarter and a $15 million loss, related to our equity interest for the remainder of the year. As a result, we expect our earnings per share from continuing operations, before special items, for the full year, to be in the range of $2.85 to $2.95.
As Chris mentioned, our earnings guidance excluding acquisition and restructuring charges, as well as the net benefit from divestiture activity.
Before I open up the lines for question, I would like to acknowledge Chris Coughlin, who is retiring after five years as our CFO. It has been my pleasure to have worked alongside Chris and I want to thank you for your significant contributions to Tyco.

And I guess my comment to add to the question is that, if you did $2.70 this year, guiding to $2.85 to $2.95, that would imply 6% to 9% EPS growth, with probably a 3% lower share count. That's not giving yourselves much credit for operating improvements.

If you use the numbers that, again, all of the analysts had in aggregate, you would take $0.26 out of the number, which would put you at $2.84 and as we just mentioned, temp for the full year, with the $20 million profit in the first quarter, $15 million, now rest of the year is basically just neutral.
So that, if you just do that, it would take the adjusted guidance, if I just used that to $2.84, just to put some numbers around what Chris said and we just guided to $2.85 to $2.95. So, that is a big piece of it there. If you look at the macro picture, we're counting on - and this will go a little bit to our earnings momentum that we think we have next year. We're counting on total revenue growth in the 4% to 5% range.
Now, currency helps out a little bit, organic, we're forecasting a little bit lower, so our swing organically would be from minus, say 3%, that we had in fiscal 2010 to a plus approximately 2% to 3% in fiscal 2011. So, that would be the revenue line.
And then to your question, on the operating income growth, if you just take Electrical and Metal out of this conversation, we will be growing our operating income somewhere in the mid-to-high teens, year-over-year, on that 4% to 5% revenue growth. So I think we're going to get a good leverage through the P&L during the year.
Part of that will be the Broadview acquisition being in for a full year. And a very big piece of that obviously will be our cost containment and restructuring actions continuing to kick in.

So, ADT recurring is in the 4% to 5%, on a global basis. North America would be higher, but when you lump it all together and Fire in the quarter on a service rep base grew about 4%. So I think those two, I think are pretty locked in, I would think, if the economy kind of stays where it’s at.
So then if you look at the rest of the business, which is Flow, overall we’re thinking that Flow is still soft in the first half of the year, with a lift in the second half of the year because, we’re seeing the order trends and the conversion is kind of nine months to get there. So, you know, that keeps it down a little bit, but again, second half of the year, better.
And then Systems Installation side on the Fire side is down still, although nothing like it was. It’s mid-single digits, negative, now. It was double-digits and we’re being much more selective on some project work. So you are still negative on the Systems Installation, although, again improving each quarter and I think when you wrap all of that together, that’s how we kind of got to a few percentage points of organic revenue growth.
And look, if the economy continues to improve, that will potentially be conservative but we are counting on in an environment we are sitting in kind of right now as we see it.

And when you look at it, by the way their process management is not exactly our Valve business. The part that relates to us, our business, grew almost identical in the quarter to what theirs grew, by the way both orders and revenue.
And the other company we always get compared to out there, when you look at the order growth in the quarter, order growth on the like-for-like business is very similar. But Nigel, I would point out to you, again, I don’t want to read too much into this and we’re not taking this fully into account, when you look at both of those other companies, a big part of their portfolio leads the Valve business and those parts of their portfolios were up much more than the Valve part, which I think portends well for what could be coming here, which also ties to why we’ve been feeling so bullish about the customer activity we’re seeing.
So, I thought this was the first good quarter from some of our competitors, who have leading indicators by like six months, that yes, not only are we seeing an order increase during the last couple of quarters, but also it looks like more could be coming here, but we will have to wait and see on that. I would point out, just as another tidbit, our orders in the month of October grew 6.2%, which is again a little bit of an improvement from the quarter we just ended, which was 5%.

One, on the sale price, I’m just trying to get my head around the decision here letting go 51% of E&MP, for basically under seven times operating profit over the last, what - five years, under four times peak operating profit, certainly a bigger number off the recent trough. Is it really just cash at this point, because you could have made a decision obviously to hold out until as you said the economy gets - things get better and you get a much, much better valuation.

We looked very significantly at the multiples that the competitors are trading at right now, which is certainly below the multiple of which we - that we got on the sale.
So, if you look at it right now, we got about 7.5 times EBITDA for the business. And, so I think we took some value off the table, which I think was the appropriate thing for our shareholders, while still providing additional upside potential and eliminating some of the volatility.
And again, it’s unknown as to how long it would take to get back to sort of historic levels. So, I think that the value of cash today, when you look at it on an ECF kind of basis, that we took all of those things into consideration and looked at all alternatives and clearly believed that this is the better alternative for our shareholders, than a spin of the business.

All right. And, Ed, you talked a little bit about growth, certainly for next year, but as you think about the business longer term, with the new profile, how are you thinking, or how should we think about organic growth, given the 7.5% plus down the other year and 3% this year and given the 2% to 3% you’re terming up for next year, where does this - where does the portfolio sort of normalize out, if we could use that term?

The recurring piece is kind of growing in that 4% to 5% range right now. And that should probably be 5% to 6%, a little bit better because you got a bad - you know, the economy is not quite there and all of that. So, we should be able to pick that growth rate up. And by the way, the point, the Fire business has been picking up on the service side from one point negative, to plus 4% this month.
So I would say that the 45% of our recurring business should be growing 5% to 6%, something like that. And then you get the kind of - the Flow business and I think that’s a big question Mark, back to the last conversation, it’s clearly a nice single-digit grower, but is it a double-digit grower? Because before the downturn, we were growing 15% to 20% and so was some of the other big players in the market.
So, I think there is a lot of oomph in that business, if you talk, not for next year, but for the long-term, very nice upside because the infrastructure build around the world. And then our Systems Installation and Service business, when you lump in the higher growth in emerging markets and a little bit lower growth in the other markets, is also like a 6% grower. So, you lump all of that together and I think organically and in a decent economy, we have a pretty nice growth rate and a lot of stability with the recurring revenue.
