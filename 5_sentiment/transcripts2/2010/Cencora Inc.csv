As you probably know from our press release this morning, AmerisourceBergen delivered an extremely strong first quarter to our fiscal year that began October 1, 2009. We're off to a strong start, and as result,",1454,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. As you probably know from our press release this morning, AmerisourceBergen delivered an extremely strong first quarter to our fiscal year that began October 1, 2009. We're off to a strong start, and as result, have increased our revenue, and margin assumptions and EPS guidance for fiscal 2010. This quarterly performance follows our strong September quarter, which completed a strong fiscal '09 where we grew our GAAP EPS of 17%. There's a lot to like about this first quarter where we hit historic records in many key metrics. Mike will drill down on the details, but here are the highlights.Revenues were a record $19.3 billion, up a robust 11.5% over last year, crossing the $19 billion threshold for the first time. Gross profit margins expanded 15%, reflecting our strong generics programs and specialty positioning. Again, this quarter, our dollars of operating expense were closely controlled hitting a historic low and as percentage of revenues.  Operating margin continued to expand, as it has in each of the last four years, this quarter, while whopping 22 basis points. We continue to do a great job controlling our receivables and inventory. Diluted earnings per share were $0.52 on a GAAP basis, up a robust 44% over last year, and that's on top of the December EPS that was up 12% last year.  Lots to like about this quarter.  The highlights of the quarter, reflect a theme of consistency that continues to be characteristic of AmerisourceBergen and demonstrates this front [ph] of our two profit drivers, generics and specialty pharmaceuticals.  Before I address some of the company specifics, a few words on the industry: First, healthcare reform. Healthcare reform is obviously a moving target after the election in Massachusetts, and the outcome will probably not be known for some time. The key take away though is that our industry and the role that ABC plays in it is strong with or without healthcare reform.  With healthcare reform results in more pharmaceuticals being dispensed, that is good for the industry and ABC. But I would note that without healthcare reform, we posted very stellar results this quarter, and over the last eight years, delivered 16% compounded EPS growth.Second, on the topic of pharmaceutical industry revenue growth, INS forecast of 3% to 5% for calendar 2010 seems to be in the right zip code for us. Part of our strong revenue this quarter reflects increasing industry momentum. Third, the manufacturing pricing environment; with only three weeks in the calendar locked to date, it's a little early to forecast the trend. January manufacturer pricing increases have been about what we've expected, and as noted previously, we expect brand name manufacturer price increases to be down from the 8% to 9% range we experienced in the last two years. Fee-for-service, of course mitigates the pricing increase impact and as noted previously, we started on a fee-for-service with Pfizer January 1.Fourth, the competitive pricing environment within our industry; I would continue to describe the environment as competitive but stable, with few billion dollar pieces of business in play in the next 12 months or so and few billion dollar pieces of business changing wholesalers historically.Now a closer look at ABC; our robust 11.5% revenue increased over $19 billion reflected the strength of the overall market, new business, particularly in the drug company and strong performance in almost every market segment. The drug company had double-digit increases in independent and hospitals, reflecting new business that we began to anniversary in March.The Specialty Group, now at a run rate of over $16 billion annually, with a little more than half of the revenue coming from oncology, had particularly strong revenues in ASD, our vaccine, nephrology and blood plasma distributor and ICS, our third-party logistics provider. Our Packaging Group, bounced back with a double-digit revenue increase.  We had the strongest generic quarter in our history, with a handful of noteworthy product introductions, reflecting the strength and diversity of our customer mix, where nearly all of our customers look to us for their generic product. Our strong position on the oncology market benefited this quarter from the August launch of oxaliplatin, the generic version of Eloxatin.  Our generic revenue increase was more than double our total revenue increase. Our strong gross profit performance this quarter was due in part to our generic programs. We continue to increase our generic penetration with the existing customers. And during the quarter, launched a program specifically tailored to the needs alternate site customers. In hospitals, our generic initiative that helps [ph] our proprietary PROGEN offering with a specific requirement of a large GPO launched in August and is proving very successful. It is important to note that even without generic launches, our EPS growth would have increased in the 20% zip code. The important take away here is that we have a strong sustainable business model without generic introductions.  As demonstrated this quarter, our performance can become truly outstanding when significant generic launches are added.Our strong revenues continue to reflect our broad service offering in each of our market segments. We have spoken previously about our broad offering at Specialty Group that is orders of magnitude ahead of any offering in the market. Lash, for example, our patient reimbursement counseling business, had some 1,300 associates and had a very strong quarter. Oncologists, as another example, looked to us for far more than product, and oncology revenues continue to be strong because of the value-added service we provide oncologists, in addition to outstanding execution of basic pack and ship. Our Good Neighbor Pharmacy franchise-like program for independents and regional chain retailers now numbers over 3,700 stores. We have over 5,000 stores participating in GNP provider network, providing access to third-party payers. Helping hospitals improve their operations and to save money is standard operating procedure at ABC. The message here is that programs and services are an important driver of the success in the distribution business, and along with generics, had a positive impact on our gross margin this quarter.Again this quarter, the associates of ABC did an extraordinary job of controlling expenses. Of our 22 basis point improvement in operating margin, 12 of those basis points came from driving our total expenses down to 156 basis points, a record low. And those total expenses include all of our corporate expenses. This only happens when cost control is part of the culture of the company as with ABC. While it is true that we continue to benefit from the very efficient distribution centers we constructed after the merger, the true secret sauce of expense control is the dedication, discipline and very positive attitude of our associates who work hard everyday, knowing that people's health and sometimes lives depend upon what they do.Our expense control is particularly noteworthy because due to our generic penetration, the number of pharmaceutical invoice lines we ship are increasing faster than our revenues. Or said another way, due to our increased penetration, we have to ship more bottles of pills to get the same revenue. We delivered this strong expense control as we continue significant expenditures on business transformation, our new SAP-based ERP system. Our BT program is on schedule and on budget and will position us extremely well to meet the future needs of our customers. We are currently in test on several elements of BT and expect to begin implementing back office functions to BT later this fiscal year.Along with controlling expenses, we continue to do an outstanding job controlling our inventory and receivables, driving down our DSO this quarter by one day to 17 days, in spite of a challenging financial environment, particularly for smaller businesses. Our receivables performance is a key indicator that we are delivering value to our customers. Given our strong balance sheet, let me reiterate our position on acquisitions. Although none are contemplated in our guidance, we are receptive to acquisitions and has spent over $1 billion in the last eight years on acquisitions. An acquisition, in our basic business of pharmaceutical distributional related businesses, like Bellco, will have appeal to us, and we look to stay within our area of core competency. We are in an excellent position for acquisitions, both financially and organizationally.The future for FY '10 and beyond is very bright for ABC. While we don't expect to deliver 44% EPS growth every quarter, we're obviously off to a very good start. Though it is early in our fiscal year, we have increased our revenue and operating margin assumptions, and EPS guidance to reflect our performance and our optimism. I am as excited I have ever been about our industry and ABC's prospects within that industry.  Here's Mike for added color."

We truly had a phenomenal quarter, and we even exceeded the revised guidance we gave in December at our Investor Day. We had a double digit revenue increase, 22 basis point operating margin",1475,"Thanks, Dave, and welcome to all who have joined us this morning. We truly had a phenomenal quarter, and we even exceeded the revised guidance we gave in December at our Investor Day. We had a double digit revenue increase, 22 basis point operating margin expansion, solid expense control and working capital discipline, all of which combined to provide greater than 14% EPS growth against the prior year quarter that grew earnings in the double digits. Our performance was certainly driven by our positioning in the right parts of the market, generics and specialty, and we benefited from recent product introductions in those areas.I will detail the benefit we received this quarter from recent generic launches, and it was significant. And we'll talk about the benefit anticipated from expected new launches over the remainder of fiscal 2010 in my financial review. I will also detail our updated guidance for fiscal 2010. Now let's start with the look at the income statement. Our top line growth was an outstanding 11.5% driven by revenue growth of just under 13% in the drug company and 80% in specialty. 7% of the drug company's growth and 6% of our overall growth came from our new customers that we're added last year, primarily in March and April, and we'll start to anniversary at the end of our second fiscal quarter. The remainder of the drug company growth was driven by overall market growth and the above market growth of a few of our largest customers.The Specialty Group grew a robust 7.7%, driven by distribution growth, primarily ASP, our nephrology blood plasma and flu vaccine distributor and ICS, our third-party logistics company. As I mentioned previously, we will start to anniversary the 2009 new business and the drug company in March of 2010. And our revenue growth will slow accordingly and should be in line with market growth of 3% to 5% in the second half of our fiscal year. However, with our great performance in the December quarter, we are comfortable with raising our consolidated revenue growth assumption to between 7% and 8% for the fiscal year.Our gross profit in the December quarter grew even faster than our top line, increasing 15%,  by far the highest quarterly gross profit growth rate in our recent history. On a percentage basis, our gross margin expanded by 8 basis points in the quarter. Approximately 2/3 of our quarterly gross profit increase was driven by the impact of recent generic launches, including a full quarter benefit from the August 2009 at-risk launch of oxaliplatin, which were primarily aided the Specialty Group in a number of scheduled launches, which benefited the drug company.  This level of benefit to gross in the quarter was unusual and far exceeded the typical aggregate benefit we received from generic launches, which generally doesn't exceed more than a couple of pennies in any one quarter. Looking forward, we expect a reduced but still substantial positive impact from generic launches in our second fiscal quarter, but we would expect the second half of our fiscal year to return to historic norms.  Assisted by these new launches, generic growth in the quarter was well over 20% and helped to offset the margin impact from the growth of some of our largest customers who enjoy our best pricing. We had a LIFO charge in the quarter of $7.8 million compared to $5 million in the prior year quarter.Now moving to operating expenses, we enjoyed significant operating leverage, once again, as we handled the incremental volume with only modest expense increases. Operating expenses increased 3% in the quarter, well below the 11 1/2% revenue increase with the majority of the expense increase relating to incentive compensation and health benefits. Operating expense margins in the December quarter declined by an impressive 12 basis points compared to last year. We continue to expect we will have operating leverage going forward with operating expenses increasing in the range of 1% to 3% for the full year, well below our top line growth rate.  As a result of the significant gross profit increase, in combination with the modest expense growth, operating income increased by over 30% in the quarter and operating margin increased by a significant 22 basis points. Without the continuing exceptional benefit from new generic launches that we experienced this quarter, operating margin expansion will moderate throughout the rest of the year. However, factoring in our stellar first quarter performance, we are comfortable raising our full-year operating margin expansion assumption to the low to mid single-digit basis point range.Below operating income, net interest expense of $17 million increased by 22% over the prior year, reflecting the impact of our $400 million bond issuance in November, net of the related revolver paydown, as well as lower rates earned on our invested cash balances. As a result of the bond offering and continued low market interest rates to be earned on in invested cash, net interest expense for the year should be approximately $20 million higher than last year's net interest.Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 38.2%, slightly less than our anticipated effective rate for the year of 38.4% and less than the 38.6% rate in last year's December quarter. Our record quarterly diluted EPS of $0.52 per share grew by 44% compared to last year. The EPS increase exceeded our 35% growth and income from continuing operations, due to a 6% reduction in average outstanding shares compared to last year as a result of our continuing share repurchase program.Now let's turn to our cash flow and balance sheet,  we used $42 million of cash in operations in the quarter, much less than the $304 million we used in the prior year quarter. We had our normal seasonal increase in inventory as we added between two and three days of inventory at the end of the calendar year, reflecting our need to keep high service levels for our customers despite a number of supplier holiday week closings. On average, our 26 days of inventory on hand during the quarter was consistent with last year's average days on hand. Our DSO for the quarter was very impressive once again at 17 days, down a day from a year ago reflecting improvements in both drug and specialty. These improvement continues to reflect the quality of our service and customer base as well as the diligence of our associates. DPOs in the quarter were consistent with the prior year.Capital expenditures were heavily weighted towards our ERP-enabled business transformation effort and the $43 million were similar to last year. We purchased $145 million of our common stock during the quarter and are ahead of the pace needed to hit our full-year $350 million share repurchase assumption.As we have consistently said, our first goal for cash deployment is to grow our business through acquisitions or internal investment, and to the extent we have additional funds subject to market conditions, as always, we would return of those funds to shareholders. We have now returned over $4 billion to shareholders through repurchases since August 2004.During the quarter, we also improved our already strong balance sheet by taking advantage of improving market conditions to issue $400 million of 10-year bonds at an effective rate of less than 5%. With the proceeds, we've repaid over $200 million of revolver borrowings. And while having a negative interest spread impact in 2010, we have improved our financial position by extending debt maturities, increasing liquidity and locking in very attractive long-term rates.  Our gross debt to total debt in capital ratio at the end of December was 33%, very much in line with our long-term goal of a range of 30% to 35%.Now turning to our guidance for fiscal 2010, as a result of the first quarter exceeding our revised expectations, we have increased our annual diluted EPS guidance from the higher end of a range of $1.82 to $1.92, to a new range of $1.89 to $1.98. This reflects an increase to our revenue growth assumption, as I mentioned earlier, to a range of 78%, and increase to our operating margin expansion assumption to a range of low to mid single-digit basis points expansion and no changes to our free cash flow range of $500 million to $575 million or our $350 million share repurchase assumptions. In addition, as I noted at Investor Day in December, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 has the toughest comparison to the prior year due to the benefit we received from generic launches and the LIFO credit we experienced in the fourth quarter last year. So again, a fantastic quarter by any measure, reflecting our positioning in the right areas of the market, generics and specialty, the quality of our customers and our associates and our continued focus on operational excellence and working capital discipline.  Now here's Mike Kilpatric for Q&A."

Of course, as we go on further in the year, we would expect that to drop and the benefit, as I said, I think will still be fairly substantial in the second quarter. Not as big as 1Q and it will continue to go down, I think, as we get to the third and fourth quarter. And again, keep in mind that it is an at-risk product and that can change at any time."

So we work pretty hard to have a customized program and getting some good traction, which is really paying off for us. I think with that, we will cut it off. We are sensitive to everybody's time and we realize there's a lot of activity going on throughout the market. I would just conclude by again thanking you for joining us. We've had a very, very strong first quarter. Obviously, off to a very strong start for the year. We think our two profit drivers, which are generics and specialty pharmaceuticals, were very much in evidence. We've raised our EPS guidance going forward. We're very excited about how we started. So with that, we thank you and we look forward to sharing our second quarter results with you in April."

As you probably know from our press release this morning, ABC delivered a very strong second quarter that ended in March, resulting in a very strong first half of our fiscal year that began October 1, 2009. This",1675,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. As you probably know from our press release this morning, ABC delivered a very strong second quarter that ended in March, resulting in a very strong first half of our fiscal year that began October 1, 2009. This outstanding first half performance follows our last fiscal year's 17% increase in EPS and is ahead of the 16% compounded annual growth rate we delivered over the last eight years. There's lots to like about this quarter. 
Mike will drill down on the details, but here are the highlights: Revenues once again crossed the $19 billion mark, up a robust 11.5% year-over-year, an instant replay of last quarter; gross profit also increased in double digits again; expenses were down as a percent of revenue versus last year, driving operating margin of 18 basis points this quarter; diluted EPS was $0.63 on a GAAP basis, up a robust 34% over last year, and that's on top of the 17% increase last March. We did a good job of controlling our receivables and inventory and had over $1 billion in cash on March 31. 
The quarter reflected a theme of consistent growth that continues to be characteristic of ABC. Our two primary growth drivers, Generics and Specialty, continue to be key elements of our performance and position us well for the future. Before I address some of the company's specifics, a few words on the industry.
First, healthcare reform. Healthcare reform is now the law of the land, though the real work is just beginning as the regulations are written. Though the details remain to be seen, we think our industry and company has fared very well. Though eventually filling prescription doughnut whole and providing RX coverage for tens of millions of the uninsured will not have an immediate impact, the long-term benefit for our industry and ABC is very positive. 
Eventually, establishing a regulatory framework for biosimilars could ultimately be as beneficial to our specialty business as generics are to our traditional wholesale business. Our Lash and Xcenda consulting businesses with their cadre of Pharm.Ds., PhDs and reimbursement counselors now has the greatest potential of work they have ever had. The Medicare generic pricing formula for our retail customers, though not as robust as we would have liked, was ultimately the preferred Senate version instead of the House version and featured a better definition of cost. 
Our pharmaceutical manufacturer partners clearly emerged as part of the solution to the issues facing healthcare, a dramatic reversal of their positioning the last time healthcare reform was addressed. So taken in total, we are pleased with the long-term impact healthcare reform will have on our business. It reinforces our long-term confidence in our industry and our company and further validates our two primary growth drivers: Specialty and Generics. 
Second, pharmaceutical industry revenue growth. The IMS forecast of 3% to 5% for calendar 2010 seemed to be in the right zip code to us and is reflected in our strong revenue growth this quarter. 
Third, manufacture pricing environment. Fee-for-service, of course, mitigates much of the impact to wholesalers from brand-name manufacturer price increases. As previously stated, we expect brand-name price increases to be down from the 8% to 9% range we experienced the last two years. And that continues to be the case, with our guesstimate currently above our original expectation of 5% to 6%. 
Fourth, competitive pricing environment within our industry. I would continue to describe the environment as competitive but stable. With few billion dollar pieces of business in play in the next 12 months or so and few billion dollar pieces of business changing wholesalers historically. 
Now a closer look at ABC. Our robust 11.5% revenue increase of $2 billion to over $19 billion reflected the strength of the overall market, strong growth in our larger customers and new business, particularly in our growth company where both the Retail and Industrial segments delivered double-digit revenue growth. New business, largely from two group purchasing organizations, one retail and one institutional, contributed over 4% of the total revenue growth and has now largely anniversaried. So it should be no surprise that revenue growth for the second half of the year will more closely reflect the market growth. 
Our discussions with CVS regarding the Longs business and Walgreens, regarding the Duane Reade's business, are ongoing. Our current contracts on both accounts carry well into FY '11 at a minimum and could be extended past our current contract. We have a great relationship with both CVS and Walgreens and the former Duane Reade leadership team, most of which is remaining in place. 
In discussing revenues, it is important to note the wide diversity of our customer base with only one customer representing more than 10% of our business and the next largest in the 5% range. In addition, all but our largest customer look to us for at least some of their generics. In drug, our Good Neighbor Pharmacy franchise life program for independents and regional chain retailers now numbers about 3,700 stores. We have over 5,000 stores participating in GNP provider network, providing access to third-party payers.
 The Specialty Group continues to have a $16 billion annual run rate with about half of the revenues in oncology products to oncologists. We service the largest numbers of oncology practices in the industry by a large margin. And significantly, most of the largest are most innovative. ASD, our vaccine, metrology and blood plasma distributor and ICS, our third-party logistics company had strong revenues in the quarter as did our consulting businesses Lash and Xcenda. Our double-digit gross profit increase in this quarter reflected our attractive customer mix and generics. 
We continue to benefit from the at-risk launch of oxaliplatin, generic Eloxatin and that will continue to our second, though at a lesser amount. Oxaliplatin is a good example of our two growth drivers of Specialty and Generics, coming together with a strong generic contribution in the Specialty space. We have noted on frequent occasions that we like the Specialty space because many new products will enter the market through that channel and Specialty products frequently provide an opportunity for expanded value-added services. The Specialty channel can also provide generic opportunities as demonstrated by oxaliplatin where a large market position in this space proved very beneficial to both manufacturers and dispensers. Within oncology, we currently anticipate generic introduction of Gemzar and Taxotere in November and our Remidex in December of 2010, the first quarter of our fiscal 2011. 
Cost control continues to be an important part of the culture of ABC and our CE2, customer efficiency cost-effective program is an important part of that culture. This quarter, the associates of ABC grew total operating costs down 20 basis points versus last year and at 156 basis points as a percent of revenue equaled the historic record low of this metric achieved last quarter. Our total operating costs in dollars this quarter were below last year in spite of 11.5% or almost $2 billion increase in revenues, demonstrating dramatic cost discipline and our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure. At ABC, controlling cost is part of our DNA and having cost discipline is always an added advantage. 
It's important to note that we delivered outstanding cost control at the same time we continued significant expenditures on business transformation, our new SAP-based ERP [enterprise resource planning] system. Our BT program is on schedule and on budget and will position us extremely well to meet the future demands of our customers. We are currently in test on several elements of BT and expect to begin implementing back office functions of BT later this fiscal year. Along with controlling expenses, our associates continue to do an outstanding job controlling our inventory and receivables, driving our DSO this quarter to 17 days. Our receivables performance is a key indicator of the strength of our customer base and that we're delivering value to our customers.
Operating margin expansion has continued to be a key focus of this management team. In each of the last four fiscal years, we have increased our operating margin by five to eight basis points and of course, the basis point on $75 billion is a significant $7.5 million or $0.015 cents a share. This quarter and this half continued our trend. In this fiscal year, we expect to increase our operating margin again, this time in the high single or low double-digit basis points. 
Given our strong balance sheet, let me reiterate our position on acquisitions. Although none are contemplated in our guidance, we are receptive to acquisitions and have spent over $1 billion in the last eight years for acquisitions. An acquisition in our basic business of pharmaceutical distribution or related business like Bellco would have appeal to us, and we would look to stay within our area of core competency. We are in an excellent position for acquisitions, both financially and organizationally. 
And when you add up all of the elements, we had a great quarter and a great first half of our fiscal year and it reflected our optimism with increasing the guidance for EPS for fiscal 2010. 
Before I turn the floor over to Mike for some added color, let me reiterate my enthusiasm for our industry and our company. We have a tough comparison for our second half, but this management team has a history of delivering EPS growth in many different environments. In just the last three years, the EPS increase has been 20%, 14% and 17%. Our new guidance of $2.01 to $2.10 per share represents a 19% to 24% increase over last year. With our strong presence in Generics and Specialty, we are extremely well placed in the industry. We have a demonstrated track record of controlling costs and increasing operating margin. 
Healthcare reform has enhanced our long-term prospects. It is very early to opine about FY '11, but with our positioning in Generics and Specialty, I am very excited about our prospects for FY '11 and beyond. Here's Mike."
24809,100483786,57267,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-22-2010",2010-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. It's very exciting once again to report quarterly results that have a tremendous amount of positive factors. Our results, which include double-digit revenue and gross profit increases, expense reduction, workin",1694,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. It's very exciting once again to report quarterly results that have a tremendous amount of positive factors. Our results, which include double-digit revenue and gross profit increases, expense reduction, working capital discipline and strong cash flow all leading to greater than 30% EPS growth, are simply outstanding. They reflect incredible efforts by our associates, unparalleled customer service and continued exceptional operational execution. And the good news is that our strong positioning in the growth areas of the market, Generics and Specialty, should continue to provide us with strong opportunities for growth in the foreseeable future. 
Certainly, we will have tougher comparisons to the prior year in the second half of fiscal 2010, as we anniversary some of our significant customer wins in new generic product introductions. Despite these tougher comparisons, our new guidance reflects 19% to 24% EPS growth for the year. I will detail that new guidance at the end of my remarks. While we are extremely pleased with our second quarter results, I would like to remind everyone that from a quarterly earnings perspective, the March quarter has traditionally been our strongest quarter and this year is no exception. Despite a number of moving parts, a substantial portion of the sequential increase in our EPS from the December quarter to the March quarter relates to benefits from manufacturer price increases during the March quarter. Certainly, our fee-for-service agreements have mitigated much of our quarterly earnings variability from manufacturer price increases. However, the 10% or so of our brand-name business that is still subject to the timing and magnitude of manufacturer price increases continues to benefit the March quarter more than any other, and as usual, will normalize in the second half of our fiscal year.
Now, turning to the income statement, which I'll walk down starting with the top line. Our revenues increased 11.5% in the quarter, driven by 13% Drug Company growth and 5% Specialty Group growth. Our significant customer contracts that we added last year, primarily in March and April, contributed about 4.5% and 5.5% of our total growth and Drug Company growth, respectively. The majority of this new business has now annualized, and we expect market growth in the second half of fiscal '10 from these customers. The remainder of the Drug Company growth was driven by the growth of some of our largest customers as well as overall market growth. 
The Specialty Group grew 5%, driven by ASD and ICS. Our service and consulting companies also grew at a robust pace. While we continue to expect that our revenue growth will be in the 7% to 8% range for the year and in line with market growth of 3% to 5% in the second half of the year, the continued strong growth rates of our largest customers could easily drive us to the higher end of our range. 
Our gross profit in the March quarter grew in double digits for the second consecutive quarter, increasing 11% over the prior year as a result of our top line growth including robust Generics growth. As I mentioned last quarter, we expected to receive a substantial positive impact from recent generic launches in the March quarter, though reduced from the first quarter benefits, and that is exactly what happened. Generic launches contributed $0.08 to our quarterly earnings, below the first quarter impact, but well above the couple of pennies we consider normal in any quarter. A significant amount of this benefit continued to be from oxaliplatin, which as a result of a settlement between its generic manufacturers and the brand manufacturer, can no longer be sold by the generic manufacturers after June 30. However, generic product already in the channel at that date can continue to be sold, and with our existing inventory levels in the Specialty Group, we expect to have product available in the marketplace at least through our fiscal year end. And that benefit is now reflected in our increased EPS guidance. 
One other note on gross profit in the quarter, we did benefit by approximately $12 million from an annual rebate true up with a generic supplier. On a percentage basis, gross margin declined two basis points as the contributions from the greater than 20% generic revenue growth and recent generic launches largely offset the impact of our largest customers growing faster than the overall market and normal competitive pressures. 
Our LIFO charge in the quarter was $10.7 million compared to $11.6 million last year. For the six months, the charge was $18.5 million compared to $16.5 million a year ago.
Moving to operating expenses. We continue to enjoy significant operating leverage especially in the Drug Company as expenses declined despite the double-digit increase in revenue. Expenses as a percentage of revenue declined 20 basis points as productivity in our distribution centers continues to improve and our CE2 philosophy of customer efficiency and cost effectiveness resulted in ongoing savings.
As we move through the second half of the year, we will see some sequential expense dollar increases, as expected, due to the timing of our annual compensation cycle and increased expenses related to our ERP-enabled business transformation program. For the year, we continue to expect operating expense increases in the 1% to 3% range. 
As a result of reducing expenses while growing revenue in the double digits, operating margin in the quarter increased by an impressive 18 basis points over last year. In the second half of the year, we would expect our operating margin expansion to moderate due to a reduced benefit from generic introductions, the growth of our larger customers and tougher prior year comparisons. But with our strong performance in the first half, we now expect our full year operating margin expansion to be in the high single-digit to low double-digit basis point range, well above our original expectations for fiscal 2010. 
The low operating income, net interest expense of $19.3 million increased 33% over the prior year, reflecting the full quarter impact of our November bond offering, net of the related revolver pay down, as well as lower rates earned on our invested cash balances. We continue to expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $20 million higher than it was in fiscal 2009. 
Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 37.9%, below our anticipated effective rate for the year of 38.4%, primarily due to the impact of completing certain federal tax audits. Our record quarterly diluted EPS of $0.63 grew by 34% compared to last year. The EPS increase exceeded our 26% growth in net income due to a 6% reduction in average outstanding diluted shares compared to last year's quarter, primarily due to the impact of our share repurchase programs over the last year.
Now let's turn to our cash flows on the balance sheet, where we continue to demonstrate excellent performance. We generated $388 million of cash from operations in the quarter, bringing our six-month total to $346 million compared to $32 million for the first six months of last year. We had $45 million of capital expenditures in the quarter and $88 million for the six months and continue to expect to spend in the $140 million range for the year. We could be slightly higher depending on the timing of certain expenditures related to our business transformation program. 
From a statistical standpoint, average inventory days on hand during the quarter were 25 days, down one day sequentially as expected from our calendar year and seasonal peak, and we were also down a day from the prior year. Receivables management continues to be a focus, and we had outstanding performance once again as average DSOs in the quarter were 17.2 days, down a day from a year ago. Average DPOs rate of about a half-day due to the timing of quarter and purchase activity. 
From a share repurchase perspective, we purchased $111 million of our stock in the quarter, bringing our six-month total to $255 million, well ahead of the pace necessary to meet our guidance of $350 million of share repurchases for the year. We ended March with more than $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet. And as we have said consistently, our first priority from a cash deployment perspective is to grow our business. As we have historically demonstrated, to the extent we do not deploy capital for that purpose and we would remain on target to meet our cash flow goals, and certainly depending on overall market conditions, we could exceed our current year share repurchase targets.
Now turning to our updated fiscal 2010 guidance. We have raised our diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.12 to a range of $2.01 to $2.10, which represents a 19% to 24% increase over 2009 EPS from continuing operations, which as a reminder, grew a strong 17%. As we have consistently reinforced since giving our original guidance for the year in November, we expected our first half of the year to grow significantly faster than the second half due to the positive impact of our new business and generic launch timing in the first half and tougher comparisons to the second half of last year and none of that has changed. The new EPS range continues to reflect an annual revenue growth assumption of 7% to 8% for the year. 
The most significant change to our assumptions is the increase in our operating margin expansion to the high single-digit to low double-digit basis point range from the low to mid single-digit range. This reflects both our strong second quarter performance as well as the expectation that we will receive some continuing benefit from oxaliplatin in the second half of our fiscal year. We have also raised our free cash flow expectation to a range of $525 million to $600 million for the year. Our share repurchase expectation remains unchanged at $350 million. 
So again, a fantastic quarter and an incredible six months where we have taken advantage of our strong market positioning, executed extremely well while continuing to build for the future, and that future looks very bright for AmerisourceBergen.

We think probably the biggest penetration particularly on our pro-generics program has been in the retail sector where we think we're capturing north of 80% of the available generic spend in that area. That continues to come up as our compliance increases. Where we've put a lot of focus on and where we've had a lot of success recently has been in the alternate site market, where the product portfolios are a little bit more customized at times and a little bit more specialized. We've spent a lot of time customizing our ProGenerics program for the off-site customers, and I think we're probably 50% to 60% penetrated there so we've got more room to go. On the hospital side, historically, we have always supplied the hospitals a very large percentage of their generics, but a lot of that has been through hospital GPO contracts. And I think going back to last August, when we made our agreement with Novation for us to supply oral solid generics to their hospitals under our program, the percentage that has come from our program versus the percentage of generics coming from the hospital GPO contracts has continued to rise and I think continues to represent a good opportunity for us going forward. So that kind of gives you a little bit of a segment-by-segment view."

As you probably know from our press release this morning, ABC delivered a very strong second quarter that ended in March resulting in a very strong first half of our fiscal year that began October 1, 2009. This",1705,"  Good morning and thank you for joining us. As you probably know from our press release this morning, ABC delivered a very strong second quarter that ended in March resulting in a very strong first half of our fiscal year that began October 1, 2009. This outstanding first-half performance followed our last fiscal year's 17% increase in EPS and is ahead of a 16% compounded annual growth rate we delivered over the last 8 years. There's a lot to like about this quarter, Michael will drill down on the details but here are the highlights: revenues once again crossed the $19 billion mark up a road by 11.5% year over year, an instant replay of the last quarter; gross profit also increased in double digits again, expenses were down as percent revenue versus last year driving operating margin of 18 basis point this quarter, the (inaudible) PS were $0.63 on a gap basis up a road by 34% over the last year that's on top of the 17% increase last March. We did a good job of controlling our receivables and inventory and had over $1 billion in cash on March 31st. The quarter reflected the theme of consisting growth that continues to be characteristic of ABC. Our two primary growth drivers, generics and specialty continued to be key elements of our performance and position us well for the future.
  Before I address some of the company's specifics, a few words on the industry: First, healthcare reform, health care reform is now the law of the land, though the real work is just beginning as the regulations are written. Though the details remain to be seen, we think our industry and company has fared very well. Though eventually, filling the prescription doing a whole and providing [Rx] coverage for tens of millions of the [uninsured] will not have an immediate impact, the long comeback that for our industry in ABC is very positive.
  Eventually, establishing a regulatory framework for via similar could ultimately, be as beneficial to our special business as generics are to our traditional wholesale business. Our lash and (inaudible) consulting business with our category of foreign [bees], PhDs and reimbursement counselors now has the greatest potential work they've ever had. In medicare, generic pricing formula for our retail customers though not as robust as what it would like was ultimately the preferred set of version instead of the house version has featured a better definition of cost.
  Our pharmaceutical manufacture partners clearly emerged as part of the solution to the issues facing healthcare, a dramatic reversal of their positioning the last time healthcare reform was addressed. So taking in total we're pleased with the long term impact, healthcare reform will have in our business. It reinforces our long-term confidence in our industry and our company and further validate our two primary growth drivers, specialty and generics.
  Second, pharmaceutical industry revenue growth, the IMS were cast of 3% or 5% for calendar 2010 seemed to be in the right zip code to us and is reflected in our strong revenue growth this quarter.
  Third, manufactural pricing department, fee for service of course, delegates much of the impact the wholesalers from brand name manufacture price increases. As previously stated, we expect brand name price increases to be down from the 8% to 9% range, we experience the last two years and that continues to be the case, with our [guest and the currently] above our original expectation of 5% to 6%.
  Fourth, competitive pricing environment within our industry, I would continue to describe new environment as competitive much stable with few billion dollar pieces of business in [plan] in the next 12 months or so and few billion dollar pieces of business changing wholesalers historically. Now, a closer look at ABC, our [robust] 11.5% revenue increase of $2 billion to over $19 billion reflected the strength of the overall market, strong growth in our larger customers and new business particularly in our drug company where both the retail and industrial segments delivered double-digit revenue growth. New business, largely from 2 group (inaudible) organization, one retail, and one institutional contribute over 4% of the total revenue growth and has now largely at [adversary]. So it should be no surprise, that revenue, growth for the second half of the year will more closely reflect the market growth. Our discussion with CBS regarding the former Long's business and Walgreen regarding the Duane Reade business are on-going.
  Our current contracts on both accounts carry will and FY 11 at a minimum and could be extended, past our current contracts. We have a great relationship with both CBS and Walgreen and the former Duane Reade leadership team most of which is remaining a place. In discussing revenues, it is important to note the wide diversity of our customer base with only one customer representing more than 10% of our business and the next largest in the 5% range.
 In addition, all that our largest customer moved to us for at least some of their generics, a drug our good neighbor pharmacy franchise-like program for independent and regional change retailers. Now numbers about 3,700 stores. We have over 5,000 stores participating in GMP-provider network, providing access to third-party pairs. Especially group continues to have a $16 billion annual run rate with about half of the revenues in oncology products, 2 oncologist. We service the largest number of oncology practices in the industry by a large margin.
  And significantly, most of the largest are most innovative. ASD are vaccine, nephrology, and blood plasma distributor and ICS are third-party logistics program for our third-party logistics company has strong revenues in the quarter as did our consulting businesses [lash] and extended.
  Our double-digit gross profit increase this quarter reflected our [attracted] customer [mixed] and generics. We continue to benefit from the at risk launch of our (inaudible), generic [Eloxatin] and that benefit will continue to our second half during the last year on map.
  Our (inaudible) is a good example of our two-growth drivers of specialty and generics coming together with a strong generic contribution and a specialty [space]. We have noted on frequent occasions that we'd like to specially space because many new price will enter the market through that channel and especially products frequently provide an opportunity for expanded value added services. Especially [channel] can also provide generic opportunities as demonstrated by [actual plan] for our large market position in this space proved very beneficial to both manufacturers and dispensers. Within oncology, we currently anticipate generic introduction of Gemzar and Taxotere in November and a [remidax] in December of 2010, the first quarter of our fiscal 2011.
  Cost control continues to be an important part of a culture of ABC and our CE2 customer efficiency, cost effective program is an important part of that culture. This quarter, the associates of ABC drew total operating cost down 20 basis points versus last year added a 156 basis points is percent of revenue, equal to historic record low of this metric achieved last quarter. Our total operating costs in dollars this quarter were below last year in spite of 11.5% or almost $2 billion increase in revenues, demonstrating dramatic cost discipline and our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure. At ABC, controlling costs is part of our DNA, and having cost discipline is always an added advantage.
  It is important [to know] that we delivered outstanding cost control, at the same time we continue significant expenditures on business transformation, our new SAP based, ERP system. Our BT program is on schedule and on budget, and will position us extremely well to meet the future demands of our customers. We are currently in test on several elements of BT and expect to begin implementing back office functions of BT later this fiscal year.
  Along with controlling expenses, our associates continue to do an outstanding job, controlling our inventory and receivables, driving our [DSL] this quarter to 17 days. Our receivables performance is a key indicator of the strength of our customer-based and that we're delivering value to our customers.
  Operating margin expansion has continued to be a key focus of this management team. In each of the last four fiscal years, we have increased our operating margin by five to eight basis points, and of course, the basis point on 75 billion is a significant seven and a half million or one and a half [cents] of share. This quarter, and this has continued our trend, at this fiscal year, we expect to increase our operating margin again, this time in the high single or low double-digit basis points.
  Given our strong balance sheet, let me reiterate our position on acquisitions. Although, non are contemplated in our values, we are receptive to acquisitions and spent over a billion dollars in the last eight years on acquisitions. In acquisition and our basic business of pharmaceutical distribution or related business like Bellco, would have appealed to us and we would look to stay within our area of core competency. We are in excellent position for acquisitions, both financially and organizationally.
  And when you add up all the elements, we had a great quarter and a great first half of our fiscal year and have reflected our optimism with increasing the guidance for EPS for fiscal of 2010. Before I turn the floor over the Mike for some added [color], let me reiterate my enthusiasm for our industry and company. We have a tough comparison for our second half but this management team has a history of delivering EPS group in many different environments. In just the last three years, the EPS increased has been 20%, 14% and 17%. Our new guidance of $2 to $1 to $2.10 per share represents a 19% to 24% increase over last year.
  With our strong presence in generics and specialty, we are extremely well placed in the industry. We have a demonstrated track record of controlling costs and increasing operating margin. Healthcare reform has enhanced our long term prospects. It is very early to (apply) about FY 11, but with our positioning in generics and specialty, I am very excited about our prospects for FY 11 and beyond. Here's Mike.

It is very exciting once again to report quarterly results that have a tremendous amount of positive factors. Our results, which include double digit revenue and gross profit increases, expense reduction, working capital discipline, and strong cash flow, all leading to greater than 30% EPS growth, are simply outstanding. They reflect incredible efforts, by our associates, unparallel customer service and continued exceptional operational execution. And the good news is, that our strong positioning in the growth areas of the market, generics and specialty, should continue to provide us with strong opportunities for growth in the foreseeable future. Certainly, we will have [suffered] comparisons to the prior year in the second half of fiscal 2010, as we anniversary some of our significant customer [wins], the new generic product introductions. Despite the [suffered] comparisons, our new guidance reflects 19% to 24% EPS growth for the year. I will detail that new guidance at the end of my remarks.
  While we are extremely pleased with our second quarter results, I would like to remind everyone that from a quarterly earnings perspective, the March quarter has traditionally been our strongest quarter and this year is no exception. Despite a number of moving parts, a substantial portion of this sequential increase in our EPS from the December quarter to the March quarter, relates the benefits from manufacture price increases during the March quarter. Certainly our fees for service agreements have mitigated much of our quarterly earnings variability from manufacture price increases. However, the 10% or so of our brand name business that is still subject to the timing and magnitude of manufacture price increases continues to benefit the March quarter more than any other, and as usual, will normalize in the second half of our fiscal year.
  Now, trying to the income statement, which all walk down starting with the top line, our revenues increased to 11.5% in the quarter, driven by 13% drug company growth and 5% specialty group growth, our significant customer contracts that we added last year, primarily in March and April, contributed about 4.5% and 5.5% of our total growth, and drug company growth respectably. The majority of this new business has now annualized and we expect market growth in the second half of fiscal 10 from these customers. The remainder of the drug company growth was driven by the growth of some of our largest customers, as well as overall market growth.
  Especially group grew 5%, driven by [ASD and ICS]. Our service and consulting companies also grew at a [robust] pace. While we continue to expect that our revenue growth will be in the 7% to 8% range for the year and in line with market growth of 3% to 5% in the second half of the year the continued strong growth rate of our largest customers could easily drive us to the higher end of our range.
  Our gross profit in the March quarter grow a double digits for the second consecutive quarter increasing 11% over the quarter year, as a result of our top line growth including (robust) generics growth. As I mention last quarter, we expected to receive a substantial positive impact from recent generic launches in the March quarter though reduced from the first quarter benefit and that is exactly what happened. Generic launches contributed $0.08 to our quarterly earnings below the first quarter impact but well above the couple of pennies, we consider normal in any quarter.
  A significant amount of this benefit continued to be from (inaudible) which has the result of a settlement between its generic manufacturers and the brand manufacturer can no longer resolve by the generic manufacturers after June 30. However, generic product already in the channel at that date can continue to be sold and with our existing inventory levels in especially group, we expect to have product available in the market place at least through our fiscal year end. And that benefit is now reflected in our increase DPS guidance.
  One other note on gross profit in the quarter we did benefit by approximately $12 million from an annual rebate through up with the generic supplier. On a percentage basis gross margin decline to basis point as the contribution from the greater than 20% generic revenue growth and recent generic launches largely offset the impact of our largest customers growing faster than the overall market in normal competitive pressures.
  Our (inaudible) charge in the quarter was $10.7 million compared to $11.6 million last year. For the six months the charged was $18.5 million compared to $16.5 million a year ago.
  Moving to operating expenses, we continue to enjoy significant operating leverage especially in the drug company as expenses decline despite the double-digit increase in revenue. Expenses as a percentage of revenue decline 20 basis points as productivity in our distribution centers continues to improve in our CE2 philosophy of customer efficiency and cost effectiveness resolve it in ongoing savings.
  As we moved through the second half for the year, we will see some sequential expense dollar increases as expected due to the timing of our annual compensation cycle and increase expenses related to our ERP enabled business transformation program.
  For the year, we continue to expect operating expense increases in the 1% to 3% range. As a result of reducing expenses while growing revenue in the double digits, operating margin in the quarter increased by an impressive 18 basis point zero over the last year.
  In the second half of the year, we would've expect our operating margin expansion to moderate due to a reduce benefit from the generic introductions, the growth of our larger customers in top of prior comparison. But with our strong, [performed performance] in the first half , we now accept our four-year operating margin expansion to be in the high single digit below double-digit basis point range well above our original expectation for fiscal 2010.
  Below operating income net interest expense of $19.3 million increased 33% over the priority year reflecting the full quarter impact of our November [fund] offering. Neither of the related [revolver] pay down as well as lower range earned on our invested cash balances.
  We continue to expect our four-year net interest expense to be approximately $20 million higher than it was in fiscal 2009. Our effective cash rate in quarter was 37.9% below our anticipated effective rate for the year of 38.4% primarily due to the impact of completing certain federal tax audits. Our record quarterly deluded DPS is $0.63 grew by 34% compared to last year. The EPS have increased, exceeded our 26% growth and net income due to a 6% reduction in average outstanding deluded shares compared to the last year's quarter, primarily due to the impact of our share repurchase programs over the last year.
  Now let's turn to our cash flows and a balance sheet, where we continued to demonstrate excellent performance. We generated $388 million of cash from operations in the quarter bringing our six-month total to $346 million compared to $32 million for the first six months of the last year. We have $45 million of capital expenditures in the quarter in $88 million for the six months and continued to expect to spend in a $140 million range for the year. We could be slightly higher depending on the timing of certain expenditures related to our business transformation program.
  From a statistical standpoint, average inventory days' on-hand during the quarter were 25 days, down one day sequentially as expected from our calendar year end seasonal pick and we were also down a day from the prior year. Receivables management continues to be a focus and we had outstanding performance once again as average DSOs in the quarter were 17.2 days down a day from a year ago. Average DPOs were up about a half day due to the timing of quarter-end purchase activity.
  From a share repurchase perspective, we purchased $111 million of our stock in a quarter bringing our six-month total to a $255 million well ahead of the phase necessary to meet our guidance of $350 million of sharing purchases for the year. We ended March with more than a billion dollars of cash on our balance sheet and as we have said consistently, our first priority from a cash deployment perspective, is to grow our business.
  As we have historically demonstrated it, to the extent we do not deploy capital for that purpose and we remain on target to meet our cash flow goals and certainly depending on our overall market conditions, we could exceed our current year share repurchase targets.
  Now turning to our updated fiscal 2010 guidance, we have raised our deluded earnings per share guidance by $0.12 to a range of $2 and $1 to a $2 and $0.10 which represents a 19% to 24% increase over 2009 EPS from continuing operations which has a reminder we were strong at 17%. As we have consistently reinforce since giving our original guidance for the year in November, we expected our first half of year to grow significantly faster than the second half due to the positive impact of our new business in generic launch timing in the first half and tougher comparisons to the second half of last year and none of that has changed. The new EPS range continues to reflect an annual revenue growth assumption of 7% to 8% for the year. The most significant change to our assumptions is the increase in our operating margin expansion to the high single digit to low double-digit basis point range from below to the mid-single digit range.
  This reflects both our strong stepping quarter performance as well as the expectation that we will receive some continuing benefit from [actual plan] in the second half of our fiscal year. We have also raised our free cash flow expectation, to arrange a $525 million to $600 million for the year. Our share repurchase expectation remains unchanged at $350 million. So again, a fantastic quarter and an incredible six months we're we have taken advantage of our strong market positioning, executed extremely well, while continuing to build for the future and our future looks very bright for AmerisourBergen.

  Our next question comes from [John Wilson Raymond James].
  John Wilson Raymond James
  Hi. Good morning. What I, this is from Mike. What do you think the second biggest driver of the outside the [sheet]? What, it seem number one (inaudible), number two is.
  Mike
  Yes. I think number two is the fact that are close that came to a higher than we expected. John and I, you know, were sorted out the year with a 5%to 7% in a growth revenue assumption. And now we raise the 7% to 8% and I said it’s, you know, it’s easily be going up in that range. So, I think the revenue growth, the generic component that came with that revenue growth and the fact that we handled it with barely lot of expenses. And you know, showing that leveraged that we had in the business. So, I think that’s the second driver of the above.
  John Wilson Raymond James
  Great, secondly you mentioned the kind of quickly, there’s a $12 million trap in the quarter. Could you explain that and should we think about that one time or that trough up that maybe represents the profit, there should be an over multiple quarter that just happen here. I can only answer one quarter.
  Mike
  Yes, I think the ladder (John). It’s not unusual for us to have trough ups, particularly with the generic suppliers over rebates. In particular case, we have an annual rebates component of our agreement. And because of rumors acquisition, and rumors new product introduction there is some confusion over on what was, what it is included. And we rap that out in March.
  Raymond James
  So you brought out the profits in March quarter. There is a couple of sounds  Maybe two sounds that maybe you won’t thinking about and we would not thinking about cause it just happen in rebates.
  Mike
  Yes.
  Raymond James
  OK. All right.
  Mike
  And John again, I just speak to you know why we don’t give quarter a guy. We look at the whole year. And you know, get some infatuation you know, from time to time individual quarter.
  Raymond James
  Sure. And just some other quick things, we certainly seeing the retail pharmacist suffer more pharmacy go larger and pressure from mocking from medicate. How was that being reflected and they are dealing with you? What do you hearing in that from some point?
  Mike
  Well, I mean were trying to work out perfectly with that John. I mean one of the great strengths we bring them is our strong generic program. A generic program called, you know, (progen). You know, we think we would bring them the best generic proper opportunities available in the market place. You know every bid is good. The competition is dealing with the big box chains in the like. So, you know, were working very, very close with that. We have a coaching program. We’re working with that now. You know, help them render a business of better. We have a big private labor program, commercial program in a like. We’re kind of work very closer with them. I will honestly tell you John long as I’ve been in this business which is you know.
  Raymond James
  It’s a long time, a really long time.
  Mike
  You know people maybe talking about in the minds of the independent. I got to tell you there is, they keep talking about. There are different kinds of programs. Drive in medical equipment. You know, vaccine program there’s like. So, they continue the whole run and do fine.

  I do have a comment on the chain business, the longs in the [Dynwe Web] relationship as you put it. But can you give us a general rule from what kind of working capital of those chains tie-up on, you know, data base basis for you. Would we see longing, you know, for improvement or distortion in your inventory in terms as a return, as a result some lost business potentially.
  Unidentified Analyst
  Yes, there is a, this is Mike Bob. No big impact. You know [long], fairly adorable retailer, fairly normal. A profile again keep in mind, you know [Dywne] reads. You know about $500 million a year worth of business. And there is a very small part our business that is 1 percent. You would not see a meaningful impact on our working capital sites.
  Raymond James
  Okay. Any kind of rules from those percent of revenues on inventory might be, bare in minimums. You have to keep supporting those just not any break out
  Unidentified Analyst
  Yes, nothing. Again, I won’t give anything specifically. And keep in mind in total in our company. You know our networking capital is presented by revenues about 1 percent here. So, you know the receivable in the inventory actually goes wasted as the payable associated with it so it is not big impact.

As you probably know from our press release this morning, ABC delivered a very strong second quarter that ended in March, resulting in a very strong first half of our fiscal year that began October 1, 2009. This",1674,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. As you probably know from our press release this morning, ABC delivered a very strong second quarter that ended in March, resulting in a very strong first half of our fiscal year that began October 1, 2009. This outstanding first half performance follows our last fiscal year's 17% increase in EPS and is ahead of the 16% compounded annual growth rate we delivered over the last eight years. There's lots to like about this quarter. 
Mike will drill down on the details, but here are the highlights: Revenues once again crossed the $19 billion mark, up a robust 11.5% year-over-year, an instant replay of last quarter; gross profit also increased in double digits again; expenses were down as a percent of revenue versus last year, driving operating margin of 18 basis points this quarter; diluted EPS was $0.63 on a GAAP basis, up a robust 34% over last year, and that's on top of the 17% increase last March. We did a good job of controlling our receivables and inventory and had over $1 billion in cash on March 31. 
The quarter reflected a theme of consistent growth that continues to be characteristic of ABC. Our two primary growth drivers, Generics and Specialty, continue to be key elements of our performance and position us well for the future. Before I address some of the company's specifics, a few words on the industry.
First, healthcare reform. Healthcare reform is now the law of the land, though the real work is just beginning as the regulations are written. Though the details remain to be seen, we think our industry and company has fared very well. Though eventually filling prescription doughnut whole and providing Rx coverage for tens of millions of the uninsured will not have an immediate impact, the long-term benefit for our industry and ABC is very positive. 
Eventually, establishing a regulatory framework for biosimilars could ultimately be as beneficial to our specialty business as generics are to our traditional wholesale business. Our Lash and Xcenda consulting businesses with their cadre of Pharm.Ds., PhDs and reimbursement counselors now has the greatest potential of work they have ever had. The Medicare generic pricing formula for our retail customers, though not as robust as we would have liked, was ultimately the preferred Senate version instead of the House version and featured a better definition of cost. 
Our pharmaceutical manufacturer partners clearly emerged as part of the solution to the issues facing healthcare, a dramatic reversal of their positioning the last time healthcare reform was addressed. So taken in total, we are pleased with the long-term impact healthcare reform will have on our business. It reinforces our long-term confidence in our industry and our company and further validates our two primary growth drivers: Specialty and Generics. 
Second, pharmaceutical industry revenue growth. The IMS forecast of 3% to 5% for calendar 2010 seemed to be in the right zip code to us and is reflected in our strong revenue growth this quarter. 
Third, manufacture pricing environment. Fee-for-service, of course, mitigates much of the impact to wholesalers from brand-name manufacturer price increases. As previously stated, we expect brand-name price increases to be down from the 8% to 9% range we experienced the last two years. And that continues to be the case, with our guesstimate currently above our original expectation of 5% to 6%. 
Fourth, competitive pricing environment within our industry. I would continue to describe the environment as competitive but stable. With few billion dollar pieces of business in play in the next 12 months or so and few billion dollar pieces of business changing wholesalers historically. 
Now a closer look at ABC. Our robust 11.5% revenue increase of $2 billion to over $19 billion reflected the strength of the overall market, strong growth in our larger customers and new business, particularly in our growth company where both the Retail and Industrial segments delivered double-digit revenue growth. New business, largely from two group purchasing organizations, one retail and one institutional, contributed over 4% of the total revenue growth and has now largely anniversaried. So it should be no surprise that revenue growth for the second half of the year will more closely reflect the market growth. 
Our discussions with CVS regarding the Longs business and Walgreens, regarding the Duane Reade's business, are ongoing. Our current contracts on both accounts carry well into FY '11 at a minimum and could be extended past our current contract. We have a great relationship with both CVS and Walgreens and the former Duane Reade leadership team, most of which is remaining in place. 
In discussing revenues, it is important to note the wide diversity of our customer base with only one customer representing more than 10% of our business and the next largest in the 5% range. In addition, all but our largest customer look to us for at least some of their generics. In drug, our Good Neighbor Pharmacy franchise life program for independents and regional chain retailers now numbers about 3,700 stores. We have over 5,000 stores participating in GNP provider network, providing access to third-party payers.
 The Specialty Group continues to have a $16 billion annual run rate with about half of the revenues in oncology products to oncologists. We service the largest numbers of oncology practices in the industry by a large margin. And significantly, most of the largest are most innovative. ASD, our vaccine, metrology and blood plasma distributor and ICS, our third-party logistics company had strong revenues in the quarter as did our consulting businesses Lash and Xcenda. Our double-digit gross profit increase in this quarter reflected our attractive customer mix and generics. 
We continue to benefit from the at-risk launch of oxaliplatin, generic Eloxatin and that will continue to our second, though at a lesser amount. Oxaliplatin is a good example of our two growth drivers of Specialty and Generics, coming together with a strong generic contribution in the Specialty space. We have noted on frequent occasions that we like the Specialty space because many new products will enter the market through that channel and Specialty products frequently provide an opportunity for expanded value-added services. The Specialty channel can also provide generic opportunities as demonstrated by oxaliplatin where a large market position in this space proved very beneficial to both manufacturers and dispensers. Within oncology, we currently anticipate generic introduction of Gemzar and Taxotere in November and Arimidex in December of 2010, the first quarter of our fiscal 2011. 
Cost control continues to be an important part of the culture of ABC and our CE2, customer efficiency cost-effective program is an important part of that culture. This quarter, the associates of ABC grew total operating costs down 20 basis points versus last year and at 156 basis points as a percent of revenue equaled the historic record low of this metric achieved last quarter. Our total operating costs in dollars this quarter were below last year in spite of 11.5% or almost $2 billion increase in revenues, demonstrating dramatic cost discipline and our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure. At ABC, controlling cost is part of our DNA and having cost discipline is always an added advantage. 
It's important to note that we delivered outstanding cost control at the same time we continued significant expenditures on business transformation, our new SAP-based ERP [enterprise resource planning] system. Our BT program is on schedule and on budget and will position us extremely well to meet the future demands of our customers. We are currently in test on several elements of BT and expect to begin implementing back office functions of BT later this fiscal year. Along with controlling expenses, our associates continue to do an outstanding job controlling our inventory and receivables, driving our DSO this quarter to 17 days. Our receivables performance is a key indicator of the strength of our customer base and that we're delivering value to our customers.
Operating margin expansion has continued to be a key focus of this management team. In each of the last four fiscal years, we have increased our operating margin by five to eight basis points and of course, the basis point on $75 billion is a significant $7.5 million or $0.015 cents a share. This quarter and this half continued our trend. In this fiscal year, we expect to increase our operating margin again, this time in the high single or low double-digit basis points. 
Given our strong balance sheet, let me reiterate our position on acquisitions. Although none are contemplated in our guidance, we are receptive to acquisitions and have spent over $1 billion in the last eight years for acquisitions. An acquisition in our basic business of pharmaceutical distribution or related business like Bellco would have appeal to us, and we would look to stay within our area of core competency. We are in an excellent position for acquisitions, both financially and organizationally. 
And when you add up all of the elements, we had a great quarter and a great first half of our fiscal year and it reflected our optimism with increasing the guidance for EPS for fiscal 2010. 
Before I turn the floor over to Mike for some added color, let me reiterate my enthusiasm for our industry and our company. We have a tough comparison for our second half, but this management team has a history of delivering EPS growth in many different environments. In just the last three years, the EPS increase has been 20%, 14% and 17%. Our new guidance of $2.01 to $2.10 per share represents a 19% to 24% increase over last year. With our strong presence in Generics and Specialty, we are extremely well placed in the industry. We have a demonstrated track record of controlling costs and increasing operating margin. 
Healthcare reform has enhanced our long-term prospects. It is very early to opine about FY '11, but with our positioning in Generics and Specialty, I am very excited about our prospects for FY '11 and beyond. Here's Mike."
24809,100483786,57367,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-22-2010",2010-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. It's very exciting once again to report quarterly results that have a tremendous amount of positive factors. Our results, which include double-digit revenue and gross profit increases, expense reduction, workin",1690,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. It's very exciting once again to report quarterly results that have a tremendous amount of positive factors. Our results, which include double-digit revenue and gross profit increases, expense reduction, working capital discipline and strong cash flow all leading to greater than 30% EPS growth, are simply outstanding. They reflect incredible efforts by our associates, unparalleled customer service and continued exceptional operational execution. And the good news is that our strong positioning in the growth areas of the market, Generics and Specialty, should continue to provide us with strong opportunities for growth in the foreseeable future. 
Certainly, we will have tougher comparisons to the prior year in the second half of fiscal 2010, as we anniversary some of our significant customer wins in new generic product introductions. Despite these tougher comparisons, our new guidance reflects 19% to 24% EPS growth for the year. I will detail that new guidance at the end of my remarks. While we are extremely pleased with our second quarter results, I would like to remind everyone that from a quarterly earnings perspective, the March quarter has traditionally been our strongest quarter and this year is no exception. Despite a number of moving parts, a substantial portion of the sequential increase in our EPS from the December quarter to the March quarter relates to benefits from manufacturer price increases during the March quarter. Certainly, our fee-for-service agreements have mitigated much of our quarterly earnings variability from manufacturer price increases. However, the 10% or so of our brand-name business that is still subject to the timing and magnitude of manufacturer price increases continues to benefit the March quarter more than any other, and as usual, will normalize in the second half of our fiscal year.
Now, turning to the income statement, which I'll walk down starting with the top line. Our revenues increased 11.5% in the quarter, driven by 13% Drug Company growth and 5% Specialty Group growth. Our significant customer contracts that we added last year, primarily in March and April, contributed about 4.5% and 5.5% of our total growth and Drug Company growth, respectively. The majority of this new business has now annualized, and we expect market growth in the second half of fiscal '10 from these customers. The remainder of the Drug Company growth was driven by the growth of some of our largest customers as well as overall market growth. 
The Specialty Group grew 5%, driven by ASD and ICS. Our service and consulting companies also grew at a robust pace. While we continue to expect that our revenue growth will be in the 7% to 8% range for the year and in line with market growth of 3% to 5% in the second half of the year, the continued strong growth rates of our largest customers could easily drive us to the higher end of our range. 
Our gross profit in the March quarter grew in double digits for the second consecutive quarter, increasing 11% over the prior year as a result of our top line growth including robust Generics growth. As I mentioned last quarter, we expected to receive a substantial positive impact from recent generic launches in the March quarter, though reduced from the first quarter benefit, and that is exactly what happened. Generic launches contributed $0.08 to our quarterly earnings, below the first quarter impact, but well above the couple of pennies we consider normal in any quarter. A significant amount of this benefit continued to be from oxaliplatin, which as a result of a settlement between its generic manufacturers and the brand manufacturer, can no longer be sold by the generic manufacturers after June 30. However, generic product already in the channel at that date can continue to be sold, and with our existing inventory levels in the Specialty Group, we expect to have product available in the marketplace at least through our fiscal year end. And that benefit is now reflected in our increased EPS guidance. 
One other note on gross profit in the quarter, we did benefit by approximately $12 million from an annual rebate true up with a generic supplier. On a percentage basis, gross margin declined two basis points as the contributions from the greater-than-20% generic revenue growth and recent generic launches largely offset the impact of our largest customers growing faster than the overall market and normal competitive pressures. 
Our LIFO charge in the quarter was $10.7 million compared to $11.6 million last year. For the six months, the charge was $18.5 million compared to $16.5 million a year ago.
Moving to operating expenses. We continue to enjoy significant operating leverage especially in the Drug Company as expenses declined despite the double-digit increase in revenue. Expenses as a percentage of revenue declined 20 basis points as productivity in our distribution centers continues to improve and our CE2 philosophy of customer efficiency and cost effectiveness resulted in ongoing savings.
As we move through the second half of the year, we will see some sequential expense dollar increases, as expected, due to the timing of our annual compensation cycle and increased expenses related to our ERP-enabled business transformation program. For the year, we continue to expect operating expense increases in the 1% to 3% range. 
As a result of reducing expenses while growing revenue in the double digits, operating margin in the quarter increased by an impressive 18 basis points over last year. In the second half of the year, we would expect our operating margin expansion to moderate due to a reduced benefit from generic introductions, the growth of our larger customers and tougher prior-year comparisons. But with our strong performance in the first half, we now expect our full year operating margin expansion to be in the high single-digit to low double-digit basis point range, well above our original expectations for fiscal 2010. 
Below operating income, net interest expense of $19.3 million increased 33% over the prior year, reflecting the full quarter impact of our November bond offering, net of the related revolver pay down, as well as lower rates earned on our invested cash balances. We continue to expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $20 million higher than it was in fiscal 2009. 
Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 37.9%, below our anticipated effective rate for the year of 38.4%, primarily due to the impact of completing certain federal tax audits. Our record quarterly diluted EPS of $0.63 grew by 34% compared to last year. The EPS increase exceeded our 26% growth in net income due to a 6% reduction in average outstanding diluted shares compared to last year's quarter, primarily due to the impact of our share repurchase programs over the last year.
Now let's turn to our cash flows and the balance sheet, where we continue to demonstrate excellent performance. We generated $388 million of cash from operations in the quarter, bringing our six-month total to $346 million compared to $32 million for the first six months of last year. We had $45 million of capital expenditures in the quarter and $88 million for the six months and continue to expect to spend in the $140 million range for the year. We could be slightly higher depending on the timing of certain expenditures related to our business transformation program. 
From a statistical standpoint, average inventory days on hand during the quarter were 25 days, down one day sequentially as expected from our calendar year and seasonal peak, and we were also down a day from the prior year. Receivables management continues to be a focus, and we had outstanding performance once again as average DSOs in the quarter were 17.2 days, down a day from a year ago. Average DPOs rate of about a half-day due to the timing of quarter and purchase activity. 
From a share repurchase perspective, we purchased $111 million of our stock in the quarter, bringing our six-month total to $255 million, well ahead of the pace necessary to meet our guidance of $350 million of share repurchases for the year. We ended March with more than $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet. And as we have said consistently, our first priority from a cash deployment perspective is to grow our business. As we have historically demonstrated, to the extent we do not deploy capital for that purpose and we would remain on target to meet our cash flow goals, and certainly depending on overall market conditions, we could exceed our current year share repurchase targets.
Now turning to our updated fiscal 2010 guidance. We have raised our diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.12 to a range of $2.01 to $2.10, which represents a 19% to 24% increase over 2009 EPS from continuing operations, which as a reminder, grew a strong 17%. As we have consistently reinforced since giving our original guidance for the year in November, we expected our first half of the year to grow significantly faster than the second half due to the positive impact of our new business and generic launch timing in the first half and tougher comparisons to the second half of last year and none of that has changed. The new EPS range continues to reflect an annual revenue growth assumption of 7% to 8% for the year. 
The most significant change to our assumptions is the increase in our operating margin expansion to the high single-digit to low double-digit basis point range from the low to mid single-digit range. This reflects both our strong second quarter performance as well as the expectation that we will receive some continuing benefit from oxaliplatin in the second half of our fiscal year. We have also raised our free cash flow expectation to a range of $525 million to $600 million for the year. Our share repurchase expectation remains unchanged at $350 million. 
So again, a fantastic quarter and an incredible six months where we have taken advantage of our strong market positioning, executed extremely well while continuing to build for the future, and that future looks very bright for AmerisourceBergen.

And I think you're going to see more of that. One of the issues of healthcare reform is what happens with the whole issue of biosimilars.

Where we've put a lot of focus on and where we've had a lot of success recently has been in the alternate site market, where the product portfolios are a little bit more customized at times and a little bit more specialized. We've spent a lot of time customizing our ProGenerics program for the off-site customers, and I think we're probably 50% to 60% penetrated there so we've got more room to go. On the hospital side, historically, we have always supplied the hospitals a very large percentage of their generics, but a lot of that has been through hospital GPO contracts. And I think going back to last August, when we made our agreement with Novation for us to supply oral solid generics to their hospitals under our program, the percentage that has come from our program versus the percentage of generics coming from the hospital GPO contracts has continued to rise and I think continues to represent a good opportunity for us going forward.

I'm just trying to get a sense of when that profit gets recognized from the wholesaler level?"

As you probably know from our press release this morning, ABC delivered a very strong third fiscal quarter that ended in June in a series of strong quarters. We are well on our way to delivering an outstanding y",1992,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. As you probably know from our press release this morning, ABC delivered a very strong third fiscal quarter that ended in June in a series of strong quarters. We are well on our way to delivering an outstanding year that ends September 30, and this is on top of our last year fiscal 17% EPS increase and ahead of the 16% compound annual growth rate we delivered over the last eight years. There's lots to like about this quarter and our long-term performance. 
Mike will drill down on the details, but here are the highlights. Revenues were a record $19.6 billion, increasing well over $1 billion from the June quarter last year and up 6.6%. Gross profit again increased in double digits. Total operating expenses were down 10 basis points as a percent to revenue versus last year, equal to the historic low of the first two fiscal quarters' operating expense ratio. Operating margin was up an outstanding 28 basis points this quarter. Diluted EPS were $0.57 on a GAAP basis, up a robust 36% over last year and up 24%, excluding special items. That's on top of the 20% increase we reported last June, big increases on top of big increases. We did a good job of controlling our receivables and inventory and had over $1 billion in cash on June 30. The quarter reflected the theme of consistent growth that continues to be characteristic of ABC. 
Though we usually do not mention external recognition, I'm going to make an exception this quarter due to the extraordinary nature of three noteworthy items. First, our largest customer recognized us with their VIP award for value, innovation and performance at their first-ever supplier award banquet. At ABC, customer recognition is the most important, and recognition from our largest customer is very meaningful. Second, Bloomberg Businessweek, in the June 21 issue, included ABC in their annual list of the 50 Best Performing Companies in the S&P 500 based on total shareholder return for the last five years. Bloomberg Businessweek reported ABC's five-year return as 115%. And Fortune Magazine, in their May 5 issue, ranked ABC as number 22 in total shareholder return for the period of 1999 to 2009, with an annual rate of return of 22% over that 10-year period. Our associates and I take great pride in the fact that only 21 companies on the Fortune 500 outperformed ABC for the last 10 years.
Before I address some company specifics, a few words on the industry. First, pharmaceutical industry revenue growth. The IMS forecast of 3% to 5% for calendar 2010 seems to be in the right zip code to us. Second, manufacturer pricing environment. Fee-for-service, of course, mitigates much of the impact to wholesalers from brand-name manufacturer price increases. We currently expect brand-name price increases to be similar to the 8% to 9% range we experienced last year. 
It is important to note two milestones regarding fee-for-service. One, we signed a fee-for-service agreement with Glaxo this quarter. So now essentially all of our brand-name Pharmaceutical business is operating under some type of fee-for-service. And two, we renewed our fee-for-service contracts with the three brand-name manufacturers that recently completed mega-mergers. Both these events demonstrate the value that the national wholesalers bring to our manufacturer partners under our prime vendor relationships with our dispensing customers. Not only do we make a wide array of product available to our dispensing customers on a daily, just-in-time basis, providing inventory control to both manufacturer and dispensing customers, capturing valuable realtime data in the process, but among other things, we provide pharmaceutical supply channel security, and we manage the credit and receivable function for the manufacturer for literally tens of thousands of customers. We think these recent fee-for-service agreements lay to rest any question about the value the national wholesalers bring to manufacturers.
Third, competitive pricing environment within our industry. I would continue to describe the environment as competitive but stable, with few billion-dollar pieces of business in play in the next 12 months or so and a few billion-dollar pieces of business changing hands historically. 
Now a closer look at ABC. Among the big news at ABC this quarter would be the fact that we went live with the first phase of our business transformation process that includes an eventual total conversion to SAP, among other things. We expect to begin the next phase of business transformation in our first fiscal quarter of FY '11, and we'll continue through a phased approach. When completed, our BT implementation will provide us with insights, flexibility and operating efficiency, which will differentiate our offer to our current and potential customers and meet or exceed their information technology needs for years to come. It is important to note that during the phasing period of business transformation, we will be operating two systems, both SAP and our legacy IT systems, putting some pressure on cost-containment efforts. The very good news is that when completed in FY '13, we will get relief from the dual-system expenses and have a state-of-the-art ERP system. Our investment in business transformation is an important investment in our future, just like our investment in new distribution centers several years ago that are now helping to drive down our operating costs.
Another item of note would be the status of our inventory oxaliplatin, generic Eloxatin. We have a policy against providing insight in these specific item inventories but are making an exception in this case due to the size and unusual circumstances around the product and its impact. To refresh your memory, oxaliplatin cannot be sold by the generic manufacturers after June 30, 2010, until reintroduction in August 2012. Wholesalers can continue to sell through any inventory that was on hand as of June 30. We currently estimate that given our expected level of demand, we will have sufficient oxaliplatin inventory to meet the needs of our oncologist customers, at least through the first half of our fiscal '11 that begins October 1.
The two primary growth drivers at ABC, generics and specialty, were very much in evidence again this quarter. Sometimes, of course, the two drivers overlap as they did this quarter with oxaliplatin in our Specialty business. The wide diversity of our customer base with only one customer representing more than 10% of our business, with the next largest dropping down at a 5% range, enhances our generic growth driver where the vast majority of our customers look to us for at least some of their generics. 
Our Generic business was very strong, with double-digit increases over last year, easily outpacing our 6.6% revenue growth. Our traditional drug company, ABDC, had a revenue increase of 8%, reflecting the strength of the market, the strong growth of our largest customers, as well as the strength of our programs and total service offerings. We have now anniversary-ed most of the new business that accounted for the double-digit revenue growth of the last few quarters. 
Our Specialty Group, ABSG, was up 3% with a run rate over $16 billion annually, with about half of the revenues in oncology products to oncologists. We service the largest number of community oncology practices in the industry by far, and significantly, most of the largest and most innovative. I recently met with several of our largest practices and continue to be thoroughly impressed with the patient accessibility and focus on quality care they provide.
ASD, our blood plasma, nephrology and vaccine distributor and ICS, our third-party logistics company, had strong revenues in the quarter as did our Consulting businesses, Lash and Xcenda. Our Packaging business also had strong revenues in the quarter. Our total company double-digit gross profit increase this quarter reflected our attractive customer mix and generics. We continue to benefit from the at-risk launch of oxaliplatin, generic Eloxatin, as I noted earlier. 
Cost control continues to be an important part of the culture of ABC and our CE2 customer efficiency, cost-effectiveness philosophy is an important part of that culture. This quarter, the total cost of running ABC was about equal to last year in spite of a 6% increase in revenue, and the associates of ABC drove total operating costs as a percent to revenue down 10 basis points versus last year, equaling our historic best performance in this metric. Along with controlling expenses, our associates continued to do an outstanding job controlling our inventory and receivables, driving our DSO to 17 days again this quarter. Our receivables performance is a key indicator of the strength of our customer base and that we are delivering value to our customers. We continue to do an excellent job controlling our inventory, while maintaining very high service levels.
Operating margin expansion has continued to be a key focus of this management team, which delivered an impressive 28 basis points increase in operating margin this quarter versus last year. In each of the last four years, we have increased our operating margin by five to eight basis points, and of course, the basis points on $75-plus billion of revenue is a significant $7.5 million or $0.015 a share. 
Given our strong balance sheet, let me reiterate our position on acquisitions. Although none are contemplated in our guidance, we are receptive to acquisitions and have spent over $1 billion in the last eight years on acquisitions. An acquisition in our basic business of pharmaceutical distribution or related business would have appeal to us, and we look to stay within our area of core competency. We are in an excellent position for acquisitions, both financially and organizationally. So when you add up all the elements, we had a great quarter and a great fiscal year-to-date and have reflected our optimism by increasing the guidance for EPS and revenue for fiscal year 2010, which Mike will detail.
Before I turn the floor over to Mike for some added color, let me give you my very early thoughts on FY '11, which we will begin October 1 since we continue to get questions about the current year contribution of oxaliplatin and our ability to grow our business next year with this comparison.
We are still in our very detailed bottoms-up planning process, but here are our preliminary thoughts. The $0.05 per share benefit from special items we enjoyed this quarter will not be repeated next year. The oxaliplatin benefit enjoyed in FY '10 will not be repeated in total, but the combination of inventory carryover of the oxaliplatin product, combined with the benefit of two other specialty generic introductions, could provide a similar benefit in total to the FY '10 benefit we received from the at-risk launch of oxaliplatin. 
In addition, we now expect not to renew the contract with Duane Reade ending December 31, 2010, which represents approximately $500 million of annual revenue. Net of special items and assuming the specialty generic offset at this preliminary stage, we see EPS for FY '11 increasing in the 7% to 11% range over the midpoint of our increased FY '10 guidance. We continue to be very comfortable with long-term EPS growth goal of 15%. Looking past FY '11, our FY '12, which begins October 1, 2011, will include the largest brand to generic product conversion in industry history that is expected to begin November 2011.
For FY '13, we expect to begin to experience the benefits of our business transformation and the elimination of running dual IT systems. FY '14 will benefit from the 30 million or so uninsured patients entering the healthcare system with pent-up demand for pharmaceutical products, the most efficient element of the healthcare system. So both the next year and the next several years will be strong.
With ABC's position in generics and specialty and with our diverse customer base and cost structure, I have never been more enthusiastic about the role of our company within an industry with a future that has never been brighter. Here's Mike."
24809,109031229,69682,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-27-2010",2010-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Another great quarter and a superb nine months leading to increased EPS guidance, once again, with our new forecasted range for fiscal 2010 of $2.16 to $2.20, representing an increase of 28% to 30% over EPS fro",1990,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Another great quarter and a superb nine months leading to increased EPS guidance, once again, with our new forecasted range for fiscal 2010 of $2.16 to $2.20, representing an increase of 28% to 30% over EPS from continuing operations of $1.69 a year ago. 
Our third quarter performance was driven by above-market revenue growth, benefits from new and recent generic launches, a robust price increase environment and continued cost in working capital discipline. These are all familiar themes, with generics providing most of the upside against our expectations in the quarter. 
In addition to our continued strong operational performance, favorable litigation results contributed $0.05 per share to the quarter, enhancing our GAAP results. $0.04 of these litigation benefits are included in gross profit, and the other $0.01 is included in operating expenses within the facility consolidations line. I will give more detail on these items within my income statement review, and we'll summarize our increased EPS guidance at the end of my comments.
Now let's start with a walk down the income statement. Our record $19.6 billion of revenue in the third quarter increased 6.6% over last year and was above market growth. The Drug Company grew 8%, helped by the strong growth of its largest customers, as well as a 1% contribution from a large new customer added last August. 
The Specialty Group grew 3%, driven once again by ASD, our blood plasma and nephrology distributor and ICS, our third-party logistics company. The Specialty Group has grown 5% for the nine months ended June, which is in line with our 5% to 7% guidance for specialty growth for the year. Generics in this space have moderated top line growth but have certainly enhanced our overall profitability.
With our stronger-than-expected revenue growth for ABC as a whole, we now expect top line growth for fiscal '10 to exceed our previous 7% to 8% forecast and assume full year revenue growth to be between 8% and 9%. This range implies fourth quarter revenue growth in line with market growth of 3% to 5%. Our gross profit in the June quarter grew in double digits for the third consecutive quarter, increasing 13% over last June. 4% of this growth was from a $19 million legal settlement we received from a pharmaceutical manufacturer related to antitrust litigation as disclosed as a subsequent event in our March 10-Q. Double-digit generic revenue growth, including the impact of several new and recent launches, also contributed significantly to gross profit in the quarter. Oxaliplatin, once again, provided a large amount of that generic benefit, contributing $25 million or $0.05 of benefit to the quarter. This was in line with last quarter's contribution and better than we expected.
As Dave mentioned, despite the settlement between the brand and generic suppliers that prohibits those generic manufacturers from selling oxaliplatin after June 30, wholesalers can continue to sell the product they had on hand at the end of June, and we expect to have product available for sale to oncologists at least through the first half of our fiscal 2011. 
I will note, however, that with the 34% reduction in average selling price or ASP that became effective July 1 for this product, we anticipate a decline in our selling price, which will reduce our gross profit per unit going forward. Accordingly, we are only expecting a benefit of approximately $0.03 in our fourth fiscal quarter from oxali [oxaliplatin]. In addition to oxaliplatin, there were a number of other generic launches in the quarter, which provided an incremental $0.02 to $0.03 over our normal couple-of-pennies-per-quarter expectation for new launches. 
I also mentioned in my opening comments that there were significant manufacturer price increases in the quarter. And while much of this impact on the brand name side was mitigated by our fee-for-service agreements, there were a number of increases, particularly on the generics side, that provided benefits to the quarter. That manufacturer price activity also drove an increase in our LIFO charge in the quarter. This charge for the quarter was $11 million compared to a $4 million charge last year, reflecting both strong brand-name price inflation and a year-over-year reduction in generic price deflation.
For the nine months ended June 30, our charge was $30 million compared to $21 million in the similar period last year. Our current expectation is for our annual LIFO charge to be in the low $30 million range. As usual, we will perform our annual LIFO calculation at the end of September, and as in the past, there can be some adjustment as a result of that snapshot.
Moving to operating expenses. Total expense dollars in the quarter were flat compared to last June. Keep in mind that last year's quarter included an $8.9 million impairment charge for one of our subsidiaries. In the current quarter, we benefited from a $4.4 million reversal of a legal accrual as a result of a favorable court decision related to ongoing employment litigation with a former Bergen Brunswig executive. 
Offsetting that positive item, bad debt expenses in the quarter increased by approximately $6 million over last year, primarily related to certain physician customers in the Specialty Group. While we continue to expect operating expenses to increase 1% to 3% for the year, looking ahead to the fourth quarter and consistent with the last few years, we expect the significant sequential expense dollar increase between our third and fourth quarters. Historically, this has been due to the timing of certain customer promotional activities such as our annual customer trade shows. In addition this year, as a result of going live in July with the first phase of our ERP-enabled business transformation project, we are now maintaining duplicate information technology infrastructures, and we'll continue to do so for the remainder of the transition period for the move from our legacy system to SAP. 
The incremental IT costs to maintain dual systems is expected to be approximately $10 million per quarter, with approximately half of that relating to the start of depreciation for the new system. Our future savings will really start to accrue at the end of the transition period, starting in fiscal 2013 when we retire our legacy system and no longer have duplicate infrastructure costs or the project costs related to the ERP implementation. 
Moving to operating income, EBIT of $282 million in the quarter increased a robust 32% over last year, 21% excluding the favorable litigation items. Operating margin expanded by an impressive 28 basis points in the quarter and for the nine months, are up 23 basis points, well above our expectations. As we have mentioned consistently throughout the year, we expect a tough fourth quarter comparison due to the benefit we received in the prior-year fourth quarter from a LIFO credit and from generic introductions, specifically oxaliplatin. 
In addition with our higher expense levels expected in this year's fourth quarter, I would expect relatively flat operating margins in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. We have increased our operating margin expansion expectation for the full year to the mid- to high teens basis point range. And keep in mind that our operating margin expansion expectation when we began the year was in the flat to low single-digit basis point range.
Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense of $18 million was up 22% as expected due to our bond offering earlier in the year. Our effective income tax rate was 38.1% in the quarter compared to 36.8% in last year's June quarter, which benefited from certain adjustments. Our diluted EPS of $0.57 in the quarter increased by 36% compared to last year's EPS from continuing operations and was above our 30% growth in income from continuing operations due to a 5% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding. The reduction in shares was primarily due to our continuing share repurchase program, net of option exercises. Excluding our $0.05 litigation benefit, diluted EPS of $0.52 was up $0.10 or 24% compared to the June 2009 quarter.
Now let's turn to our cash flows and the balance sheet where we continue to demonstrate excellent performance. We generated $213 million of cash from operations in the quarter, bringing our nine-month total to $559 million compared to $430 million for the first nine months of last year, and we remain on track to hit our full year targets. We had $44 million of capital expenditures in the quarter and $132 million for the nine months and currently expect between $165 million and $175 million for the year, an increase over our prior estimates, primarily due to the timing of certain business transformation expenditures. 
From a working capital standpoint, average inventory days on hand during the quarter were 24 days, consistent with the prior year. Receivables management continues to be a focus as average DSOs in the quarter were 17.2 days, down almost a day during the prior year. Average DPOs were up one day, mainly due to the timing of purchases. From a share repurchase perspective, we purchased $95 million of our stock in the quarter, bringing our nine-month total to $350 million, meeting our initial guidance for the full year, and accordingly, we are increasing our fiscal 2010 share repurchase guidance to $450 million. At June 30, we have $218 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.
Our gross debt to total debt in equity ratio at the end of June is 32%, in line with our target 30% to 35% ratio, and we continue to have more than $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet, which continues to provide us with great financial flexibility.
Now let's turn to our updated fiscal 2010 guidance. We are increasing and narrowing our diluted EPS guidance from a range of $2.01 to $2.10 to a new range of $2.16 to $2.20. This new range represents a 28% to 30% increase over 2009 EPS from continuing operations, which as a reminder, were a strong 17%. This new range, as always, is on a GAAP basis and includes the $0.05 benefit we received from litigation items in the third quarter. Our updated guidance implies the diluted EPS range of $0.44 to $0.48 in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, the major differences between our fourth quarter EPS range and our third quarter diluted EPS of $0.57 are: the non-recurrence of the $0.05 of litigation benefits we received in the third quarter, increased operating expense expectations in Q4 of $0.03 to $0.04 versus Q3 and a net reduction of $0.02 to $0.03 in buy-side profits as declines in the benefit from oxaliplatin and price increases should offset the benefit from new generic introductions in the quarter. 
From a full year fiscal '10 assumption standpoint, we now expect revenue growth to be 8% to 9%, operating margin expansion to be in the mid- to high teens basis point range, free cash flow to remain in the $525 million to $600 million range and share repurchases to increase to approximately $450 million.
Keep in mind that Dave's preliminary comments on fiscal 2011 EPS growth are based on a $2.13 base EPS for fiscal '10, which is the $2.18 midpoint of our GAAP range, less the $0.05 of litigation benefits we received in fiscal 2010. 
As always, we will give our detailed guidance in early November on our fiscal year-end earnings call, where we would expect to have much greater clarity on all of our fiscal 2011 assumptions, including the specialty generic opportunities.
So again, a lot to like about the third quarter, the nine months and our outlook for the full year. We continue to benefit from our market positioning in specialty and generics and from the incredible work ethic and dedication of our associates, who continue to provide superior service to both our external and internal customers. The future continues to be very bright for AmerisourceBergen.

I think that contribution is going to be much greater in 2011 than 2010. Right now, there's only one generic supplier that's been approved. And often, when there's only one supplier, it acts more like a brand name drug than it does like a generic until more manufacturers come into play, which we would expect to happen. And again, maybe that's in fiscal '11. I think the other thing that's important to note about Lovenox is that it's mostly sold to our institutional pharmacy customers. And as a result, a very small percentage will actually go through our ProGeneric program, where we get our highest profit margin. A lot of that product is going to be sold through third-party GPO contracts so the overall margin percentage is less than what I've seen some people estimate at this point. However, I think this is a product that is going to maintain a fairly high generic price in relation to the brand price because of its difficulty to manufacture, and again I think it's going to provide a nice impact in fiscal '11.

And I think that's resulted in certain generic manufacturers being in better positions than they thought they would be with certain products, which has led to an increased pricing of those generics. During the quarter, we did get a benefit from generic price increases. We don't have the same fee-for-service constraint that mitigates the price increases with generic manufacturers that we do have with the brand names. Now I'm saying that, so I think that's a long-term trend in that industry. I'm not sure that it is. But I think what it shows is that the generic manufacturers are going to actively manage their portfolios. As more and more generics come on the market, they're going to make decisions about which ones to produce, which ones not to produce. And certainly, that can lead to some price activity. But again, we'd like to keep in mind our philosophy. We'd like to keep it spread around. And even when there have been some of those shortages, I think our broad base of 100 manufacturers has enabled us when there have been shortages to continue to provide great service to our customers."

As you probably know from our press release this morning, ABC delivered a very strong third fiscal quarter that ended in June in a series of strong quarters. We are well on our way to delivering an outstanding",1992," Good morning, and thank you for joining us. As you probably know from our press release this morning, ABC delivered a very strong third fiscal quarter that ended in June in a series of strong quarters. We are well on our way to delivering an outstanding year that ends September 30, and this is on top of our last year fiscal 17% EPS increase and ahead of the 16% compound annual growth rate we delivered over the last eight years. There's lots to like about this quarter and our long-term performance.
 Mike will drill down on the details, but here are the highlights. Revenues were a record $19.6 billion, increasing well over $1 billion from the June quarter last year and up 6.6%. Gross profit again increased in double digits. Total operating expenses were down 10 basis points as a percent to revenue versus last year, equal to the historic low of the first two fiscal quarters' operating expense ratio. Operating margin was up an outstanding 28 basis points this quarter. Diluted EPS were $0.57 on a GAAP basis, up a robust 36% over last year and up 24%, excluding special items. That's on top of the 20% increase we reported last June, big increases on top of big increases. We did a good job of controlling our receivables and inventory and had over $1 billion in cash on June 30. The quarter reflected the theme of consistent growth that continues to be characteristic of ABC.
 Though we usually do not mention external recognition, I'm going to make an exception this quarter due to the extraordinary nature of three noteworthy items. First, our largest customer recognized us with their VIP award for value, innovation and performance at their first-ever supplier award banquet. At ABC, customer recognition is the most important, and recognition from our largest customer is very meaningful. Second, Bloomberg Businessweek, in the June 21 issue, included ABC in their annual list of the 50 Best Performing Companies in the S&P 500 based on total shareholder return for the last five years. Bloomberg Businessweek reported ABC's five-year return as 115%. And Fortune Magazine, in their May 5 issue, ranked ABC as number 22 in total shareholder return for the period of 1999 to 2009, with an annual rate of return of 22% over that 10-year period. Our associates and I take great pride in the fact that only 21 companies on the Fortune 500 outperformed ABC for the last 10 years.
 Before I address some company specifics, a few words on the industry. First, pharmaceutical industry revenue growth. The IMS forecast of 3% to 5% for calendar 2010 seems to be in the right zip code to us. Second, manufacturer pricing environment. Fee-for-service, of course, mitigates much of the impact to wholesalers from brand-name manufacturer price increases. We currently expect brand-name price increases to be similar to the 8% to 9% range we experienced last year.
 It is important to note two milestones regarding fee-for-service. One, we signed a fee-for-service agreement with Glaxo this quarter. So now essentially all of our brand-name Pharmaceutical business is operating under some type of fee-for-service. And two, we renewed our fee-for-service contracts with the three brand-name manufacturers that recently completed mega-mergers. Both these events demonstrate the value that the national wholesalers bring to our manufacturer partners under our prime vendor relationships with our dispensing customers. Not only do we make a wide array of product available to our dispensing customers on a daily, just-in-time basis, providing inventory control to both manufacturer and dispensing customers, capturing valuable realtime data in the process, but among other things, we provide pharmaceutical supply channel security, and we manage the credit and receivable function for the manufacturer for literally tens of thousands of customers. We think these recent fee-for-service agreements lay to rest any question about the value the national wholesalers bring to manufacturers.
 Third, competitive pricing environment within our industry. I would continue to describe the environment as competitive but stable, with few billion-dollar pieces of business in play in the next 12 months or so and a few billion-dollar pieces of business changing hands historically.
 Now a closer look at ABC. Among the big news at ABC this quarter would be the fact that we went live with the first phase of our business transformation process that includes an eventual total conversion to SAP, among other things. We expect to begin the next phase of business transformation in our first fiscal quarter of FY '11, and we'll continue through a phased approach. When completed, our BT implementation will provide us with insights, flexibility and operating efficiency, which will differentiate our offer to our current and potential customers and meet or exceed their information technology needs for years to come. It is important to note that during the phasing period of business transformation, we will be operating two systems, both SAP and our legacy IT systems, putting some pressure on cost-containment efforts. The very good news is that when completed in FY '13, we will get relief from the dual-system expenses and have a state-of-the-art ERP system. Our investment in business transformation is an important investment in our future, just like our investment in new distribution centers several years ago that are now helping to drive down our operating costs.
 Another item of note would be the status of our inventory oxaliplatin, generic Eloxatin. We have a policy against providing insight in these specific item inventories but are making an exception in this case due to the size and unusual circumstances around the product and its impact. To refresh your memory, oxaliplatin cannot be sold by the generic manufacturers after June 30, 2010, until reintroduction in August 2012. Wholesalers can continue to sell through any inventory that was on hand as of June 30. We currently estimate that given our expected level of demand, we will have sufficient oxaliplatin inventory to meet the needs of our oncologist customers, at least through the first half of our fiscal '11 that begins October 1.
 The two primary growth drivers at ABC, generics and specialty, were very much in evidence again this quarter. Sometimes, of course, the two drivers overlap as they did this quarter with oxaliplatin in our Specialty business. The wide diversity of our customer base with only one customer representing more than 10% of our business, with the next largest dropping down at a 5% range, enhances our generic growth driver where the vast majority of our customers look to us for at least some of their generics.
 Our Generic business was very strong, with double-digit increases over last year, easily outpacing our 6.6% revenue growth. Our traditional drug company, ABDC, had a revenue increase of 8%, reflecting the strength of the market, the strong growth of our largest customers, as well as the strength of our programs and total service offerings. We have now anniversary-ed most of the new business that accounted for the double-digit revenue growth of the last few quarters.
 Our Specialty Group, ABSG, was up 3% with a run rate over $16 billion annually, with about half of the revenues in oncology products to oncologists. We service the largest number of community oncology practices in the industry by far, and significantly, most of the largest and most innovative. I recently met with several of our largest practices and continue to be thoroughly impressed with the patient accessibility and focus on quality care they provide.
 ASD, our blood plasma, nephrology and vaccine distributor and ICS, our third-party logistics company, had strong revenues in the quarter as did our Consulting businesses, Lash and Xcenda. Our Packaging business also had strong revenues in the quarter. Our total company double-digit gross profit increase this quarter reflected our attractive customer mix and generics. We continue to benefit from the at-risk launch of oxaliplatin, generic Eloxatin, as I noted earlier.
 Cost control continues to be an important part of the culture of ABC and our CE2 customer efficiency, cost-effectiveness philosophy is an important part of that culture. This quarter, the total cost of running ABC was about equal to last year in spite of a 6% increase in revenue, and the associates of ABC drove total operating costs as a percent to revenue down 10 basis points versus last year, equaling our historic best performance in this metric. Along with controlling expenses, our associates continued to do an outstanding job controlling our inventory and receivables, driving our DSO to 17 days again this quarter. Our receivables performance is a key indicator of the strength of our customer base and that we are delivering value to our customers. We continue to do an excellent job controlling our inventory, while maintaining very high service levels.
 Operating margin expansion has continued to be a key focus of this management team, which delivered an impressive 28 basis points increase in operating margin this quarter versus last year. In each of the last four years, we have increased our operating margin by five to eight basis points, and of course, the basis points on $75-plus billion of revenue is a significant $7.5 million or $0.015 a share.
 Given our strong balance sheet, let me reiterate our position on acquisitions. Although none are contemplated in our guidance, we are receptive to acquisitions and have spent over $1 billion in the last eight years on acquisitions. An acquisition in our basic business of pharmaceutical distribution or related business would have appeal to us, and we look to stay within our area of core competency. We are in an excellent position for acquisitions, both financially and organizationally. So when you add up all the elements, we had a great quarter and a great fiscal year-to-date and have reflected our optimism by increasing the guidance for EPS and revenue for fiscal year 2010, which Mike will detail.
 Before I turn the floor over to Mike for some added color, let me give you my very early thoughts on FY '11, which we will begin October 1 since we continue to get questions about the current year contribution of oxaliplatin and our ability to grow our business next year with this comparison.
 We are still in our very detailed bottoms-up planning process, but here are our preliminary thoughts. The $0.05 per share benefit from special items we enjoyed this quarter will not be repeated next year. The oxaliplatin benefit enjoyed in FY '10 will not be repeated in total, but the combination of inventory carryover of the oxaliplatin product, combined with the benefit of two other specialty generic introductions, could provide a similar benefit in total to the FY '10 benefit we received from the at-risk launch of oxaliplatin.
 In addition, we now expect not to renew the contract with Duane Reade ending December 31, 2010, which represents approximately $500 million of annual revenue. Net of special items and assuming the specialty generic offset at this preliminary stage, we see EPS for FY '11 increasing in the 7% to 11% range over the midpoint of our increased FY '10 guidance. We continue to be very comfortable with long-term EPS growth goal of 15%. Looking past FY '11, our FY '12, which begins October 1, 2011, will include the largest brand to generic product conversion in industry history that is expected to begin November 2011.
 For FY '13, we expect to begin to experience the benefits of our business transformation and the elimination of running dual IT systems. FY '14 will benefit from the 30 million or so uninsured patients entering the healthcare system with pent-up demand for pharmaceutical products, the most efficient element of the healthcare system. So both the next year and the next several years will be strong.
 With ABC's position in generics and specialty and with our diverse customer base and cost structure, I have never been more enthusiastic about the role of our company within an industry with a future that has never been brighter. Here's Mike.

Another great quarter and a superb nine months leading to increased EPS guidance, once again, with our new forecasted range for fiscal 2010 of $2.16 to $2.20, representing an increase of 28% to 30% over EPS fr",1990," Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Another great quarter and a superb nine months leading to increased EPS guidance, once again, with our new forecasted range for fiscal 2010 of $2.16 to $2.20, representing an increase of 28% to 30% over EPS from continuing operations of $1.69 a year ago.
 Our third quarter performance was driven by above-market revenue growth, benefits from new and recent generic launches, a robust price increase environment and continued cost in working capital discipline. These are all familiar themes, with generics providing most of the upside against our expectations in the quarter.
 In addition to our continued strong operational performance, favorable litigation results contributed $0.05 per share to the quarter, enhancing our GAAP results. $0.04 of these litigation benefits are included in gross profit, and the other $0.01 is included in operating expenses within the facility consolidations line. I will give more detail on these items within my income statement review, and we'll summarize our increased EPS guidance at the end of my comments.
 Now let's start with a walk down the income statement. Our record $19.6 billion of revenue in the third quarter increased 6.6% over last year and was above market growth. The Drug Company grew 8%, helped by the strong growth of its largest customers, as well as a 1% contribution from a large new customer added last August.
 The Specialty Group grew 3%, driven once again by ASD, our blood plasma and nephrology distributor and ICS, our third-party logistics company. The Specialty Group has grown 5% for the nine months ended June, which is in line with our 5% to 7% guidance for specialty growth for the year. Generics in this space have moderated top line growth but have certainly enhanced our overall profitability.
 With our stronger-than-expected revenue growth for ABC as a whole, we now expect top line growth for fiscal '10 to exceed our previous 7% to 8% forecast and assume full year revenue growth to be between 8% and 9%. This range implies fourth quarter revenue growth in line with market growth of 3% to 5%. Our gross profit in the June quarter grew in double digits for the third consecutive quarter, increasing 13% over last June. 4% of this growth was from a $19 million legal settlement we received from a pharmaceutical manufacturer related to antitrust litigation as disclosed as a subsequent event in our March 10-Q. Double-digit generic revenue growth, including the impact of several new and recent launches, also contributed significantly to gross profit in the quarter. Oxaliplatin, once again, provided a large amount of that generic benefit, contributing $25 million or $0.05 of benefit to the quarter. This was in line with last quarter's contribution and better than we expected.
 As Dave mentioned, despite the settlement between the brand and generic suppliers that prohibits those generic manufacturers from selling oxaliplatin after June 30, wholesalers can continue to sell the product they had on hand at the end of June, and we expect to have product available for sale to oncologists at least through the first half of our fiscal 2011.
 I will note, however, that with the 34% reduction in average selling price or ASP that became effective July 1 for this product, we anticipate a decline in our selling price, which will reduce our gross profit per unit going forward. Accordingly, we are only expecting a benefit of approximately $0.03 in our fourth fiscal quarter from oxali [oxaliplatin]. In addition to oxaliplatin, there were a number of other generic launches in the quarter, which provided an incremental $0.02 to $0.03 over our normal couple-of-pennies-per-quarter expectation for new launches.
 I also mentioned in my opening comments that there were significant manufacturer price increases in the quarter. And while much of this impact on the brand name side was mitigated by our fee-for-service agreements, there were a number of increases, particularly on the generics side, that provided benefits to the quarter. That manufacturer price activity also drove an increase in our LIFO charge in the quarter. This charge for the quarter was $11 million compared to a $4 million charge last year, reflecting both strong brand-name price inflation and a year-over-year reduction in generic price deflation.
 For the nine months ended June 30, our charge was $30 million compared to $21 million in the similar period last year. Our current expectation is for our annual LIFO charge to be in the low $30 million range. As usual, we will perform our annual LIFO calculation at the end of September, and as in the past, there can be some adjustment as a result of that snapshot.
 Moving to operating expenses. Total expense dollars in the quarter were flat compared to last June. Keep in mind that last year's quarter included an $8.9 million impairment charge for one of our subsidiaries. In the current quarter, we benefited from a $4.4 million reversal of a legal accrual as a result of a favorable court decision related to ongoing employment litigation with a former Bergen Brunswig executive.
 Offsetting that positive item, bad debt expenses in the quarter increased by approximately $6 million over last year, primarily related to certain physician customers in the Specialty Group. While we continue to expect operating expenses to increase 1% to 3% for the year, looking ahead to the fourth quarter and consistent with the last few years, we expect the significant sequential expense dollar increase between our third and fourth quarters. Historically, this has been due to the timing of certain customer promotional activities such as our annual customer trade shows. In addition this year, as a result of going live in July with the first phase of our ERP-enabled business transformation project, we are now maintaining duplicate information technology infrastructures, and we'll continue to do so for the remainder of the transition period for the move from our legacy system to SAP.
 The incremental IT costs to maintain dual systems is expected to be approximately $10 million per quarter, with approximately half of that relating to the start of depreciation for the new system. Our future savings will really start to accrue at the end of the transition period, starting in fiscal 2013 when we retire our legacy system and no longer have duplicate infrastructure costs or the project costs related to the ERP implementation.
 Moving to operating income, EBIT of $282 million in the quarter increased a robust 32% over last year, 21% excluding the favorable litigation items. Operating margin expanded by an impressive 28 basis points in the quarter and for the nine months, are up 23 basis points, well above our expectations. As we have mentioned consistently throughout the year, we expect a tough fourth quarter comparison due to the benefit we received in the prior-year fourth quarter from a LIFO credit and from generic introductions, specifically oxaliplatin.
 In addition with our higher expense levels expected in this year's fourth quarter, I would expect relatively flat operating margins in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. We have increased our operating margin expansion expectation for the full year to the mid- to high teens basis point range. And keep in mind that our operating margin expansion expectation when we began the year was in the flat to low single-digit basis point range.
 Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense of $18 million was up 22% as expected due to our bond offering earlier in the year. Our effective income tax rate was 38.1% in the quarter compared to 36.8% in last year's June quarter, which benefited from certain adjustments. Our diluted EPS of $0.57 in the quarter increased by 36% compared to last year's EPS from continuing operations and was above our 30% growth in income from continuing operations due to a 5% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding. The reduction in shares was primarily due to our continuing share repurchase program, net of option exercises. Excluding our $0.05 litigation benefit, diluted EPS of $0.52 was up $0.10 or 24% compared to the June 2009 quarter.
 Now let's turn to our cash flows and the balance sheet where we continue to demonstrate excellent performance. We generated $213 million of cash from operations in the quarter, bringing our nine-month total to $559 million compared to $430 million for the first nine months of last year, and we remain on track to hit our full year targets. We had $44 million of capital expenditures in the quarter and $132 million for the nine months and currently expect between $165 million and $175 million for the year, an increase over our prior estimates, primarily due to the timing of certain business transformation expenditures.
 From a working capital standpoint, average inventory days on hand during the quarter were 24 days, consistent with the prior year. Receivables management continues to be a focus as average DSOs in the quarter were 17.2 days, down almost a day during the prior year. Average DPOs were up one day, mainly due to the timing of purchases. From a share repurchase perspective, we purchased $95 million of our stock in the quarter, bringing our nine-month total to $350 million, meeting our initial guidance for the full year, and accordingly, we are increasing our fiscal 2010 share repurchase guidance to $450 million. At June 30, we have $218 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.
 Our gross debt to total debt in equity ratio at the end of June is 32%, in line with our target 30% to 35% ratio, and we continue to have more than $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet, which continues to provide us with great financial flexibility.
 Now let's turn to our updated fiscal 2010 guidance. We are increasing and narrowing our diluted EPS guidance from a range of $2.01 to $2.10 to a new range of $2.16 to $2.20. This new range represents a 28% to 30% increase over 2009 EPS from continuing operations, which as a reminder, were a strong 17%. This new range, as always, is on a GAAP basis and includes the $0.05 benefit we received from litigation items in the third quarter. Our updated guidance implies the diluted EPS range of $0.44 to $0.48 in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, the major differences between our fourth quarter EPS range and our third quarter diluted EPS of $0.57 are: the non-recurrence of the $0.05 of litigation benefits we received in the third quarter, increased operating expense expectations in Q4 of $0.03 to $0.04 versus Q3 and a net reduction of $0.02 to $0.03 in buy-side profits as declines in the benefit from oxaliplatin and price increases should offset the benefit from new generic introductions in the quarter.
 From a full year fiscal '10 assumption standpoint, we now expect revenue growth to be 8% to 9%, operating margin expansion to be in the mid- to high teens basis point range, free cash flow to remain in the $525 million to $600 million range and share repurchases to increase to approximately $450 million.
 Keep in mind that Dave's preliminary comments on fiscal 2011 EPS growth are based on a $2.13 base EPS for fiscal '10, which is the $2.18 midpoint of our GAAP range, less the $0.05 of litigation benefits we received in fiscal 2010.
 As always, we will give our detailed guidance in early November on our fiscal year-end earnings call, where we would expect to have much greater clarity on all of our fiscal 2011 assumptions, including the specialty generic opportunities.
 So again, a lot to like about the third quarter, the nine months and our outlook for the full year. We continue to benefit from our market positioning in specialty and generics and from the incredible work ethic and dedication of our associates, who continue to provide superior service to both our external and internal customers. The future continues to be very bright for AmerisourceBergen.
 Now here's Mike Kilpatric for Q&A.

I think that contribution is going to be much greater in 2011 than 2010. Right now, there's only one generic supplier that's been approved. And often, when there's only one supplier, it acts more like a brand name drug than it does like a generic until more manufacturers come into play, which we would expect to happen. And again, maybe that's in fiscal '11. I think the other thing that's important to note about Lovenox is that it's mostly sold to our institutional pharmacy customers. And as a result, a very small percentage will actually go through our ProGeneric program, where we get our highest profit margin. A lot of that product is going to be sold through third-party GPO contracts so the overall margin percentage is less than what I've seen some people estimate at this point. However, I think this is a product that is going to maintain a fairly high generic price in relation to the brand price because of its difficulty to manufacture, and again I think it's going to provide a nice impact in fiscal '11. It's contemplated in our guidance, and it really helps to levelize the generic contribution between the two years.

I mean, we are -- revenues have run a little stronger than we thought they would, and that's what resulted in the increased guidance of our revenues going from 8% to 9% versus where we're starting the year. We've done a good job in our expenses and then continue to do a good job leveraging the business, which is one of the great drivers of this business, the oxaliplatin. It turned out to be better than we thought earlier in the year. We thought, even in the last quarter, we thought that the pricing, the ASP, would be a little different than what it turned out. So those are pretty big ones that come to mind. Mike?

And I think that's resulted in certain generic manufacturers being in better positions than they thought they would be with certain products, which has led to an increased pricing of those generics. During the quarter, we did get a benefit from generic price increases. We don't have the same fee-for-service constraint that mitigates the price increases with generic manufacturers that we do have with the brand names. Now I'm saying that, so I think that's a long-term trend in that industry. I'm not sure that it is. But I think what it shows is that the generic manufacturers are going to actively manage their portfolios. As more and more generics come on the market, they're going to make decisions about which ones to produce, which ones not to produce. And certainly, that can lead to some price activity. But again, we'd like to keep in mind our philosophy. We'd like to keep it spread around. And even when there have been some of those shortages, I think our broad base of 100 manufacturers has enabled us when there have been shortages to continue to provide great service to our customers.

As you probably know from our press release this morning, ABC delivered a very strong third fiscal quarter that ended in June in a series of strong quarters. We are well on our way to delivering an outstanding y",1992,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. As you probably know from our press release this morning, ABC delivered a very strong third fiscal quarter that ended in June in a series of strong quarters. We are well on our way to delivering an outstanding year that ends September 30, and this is on top of our last year fiscal 17% EPS increase and ahead of the 16% compound annual growth rate we delivered over the last eight years. There's lots to like about this quarter and our long-term performance. 
Mike will drill down on the details, but here are the highlights. Revenues were a record $19.6 billion, increasing well over $1 billion from the June quarter last year and up 6.6%. Gross profit again increased in double digits. Total operating expenses were down 10 basis points as a percent to revenue versus last year, equal to the historic low of the first two fiscal quarters' operating expense ratio. Operating margin was up an outstanding 28 basis points this quarter. Diluted EPS were $0.57 on a GAAP basis, up a robust 36% over last year and up 24%, excluding special items. That's on top of the 20% increase we reported last June, big increases on top of big increases. We did a good job of controlling our receivables and inventory and had over $1 billion in cash on June 30. The quarter reflected the theme of consistent growth that continues to be characteristic of ABC. 
Though we usually do not mention external recognition, I'm going to make an exception this quarter due to the extraordinary nature of three noteworthy items. First, our largest customer recognized us with their VIP award for value, innovation and performance at their first-ever supplier award banquet. At ABC, customer recognition is the most important, and recognition from our largest customer is very meaningful. Second, Bloomberg Businessweek, in the June 21 issue, included ABC in their annual list of the 50 Best Performing Companies in the S&P 500 based on total shareholder return for the last five years. Bloomberg Businessweek reported ABC's five-year return as 115%. And Fortune Magazine, in their May 5 issue, ranked ABC as number 22 in total shareholder return for the period of 1999 to 2009, with an annual rate of return of 22% over that 10-year period. Our associates and I take great pride in the fact that only 21 companies on the Fortune 500 outperformed ABC for the last 10 years.
Before I address some company specifics, a few words on the industry. First, pharmaceutical industry revenue growth. The IMS forecast of 3% to 5% for calendar 2010 seems to be in the right zip code to us. Second, manufacturer pricing environment. Fee-for-service, of course, mitigates much of the impact to wholesalers from brand-name manufacturer price increases. We currently expect brand-name price increases to be similar to the 8% to 9% range we experienced last year. 
It is important to note two milestones regarding fee-for-service. One, we signed a fee-for-service agreement with Glaxo this quarter. So now essentially all of our brand-name Pharmaceutical business is operating under some type of fee-for-service. And two, we renewed our fee-for-service contracts with the three brand-name manufacturers that recently completed mega-mergers. Both these events demonstrate the value that the national wholesalers bring to our manufacturer partners under our prime vendor relationships with our dispensing customers. Not only do we make a wide array of product available to our dispensing customers on a daily, just-in-time basis, providing inventory control to both manufacturer and dispensing customers, capturing valuable realtime data in the process, but among other things, we provide pharmaceutical supply channel security, and we manage the credit and receivable function for the manufacturer for literally tens of thousands of customers. We think these recent fee-for-service agreements lay to rest any question about the value the national wholesalers bring to manufacturers.
Third, competitive pricing environment within our industry. I would continue to describe the environment as competitive but stable, with few billion-dollar pieces of business in play in the next 12 months or so and a few billion-dollar pieces of business changing hands historically. 
Now a closer look at ABC. Among the big news at ABC this quarter would be the fact that we went live with the first phase of our business transformation process that includes an eventual total conversion to SAP, among other things. We expect to begin the next phase of business transformation in our first fiscal quarter of FY '11, and we'll continue through a phased approach. When completed, our BT implementation will provide us with insights, flexibility and operating efficiency, which will differentiate our offer to our current and potential customers and meet or exceed their information technology needs for years to come. It is important to note that during the phasing period of business transformation, we will be operating two systems, both SAP and our legacy IT systems, putting some pressure on cost-containment efforts. The very good news is that when completed in FY '13, we will get relief from the dual-system expenses and have a state-of-the-art ERP system. Our investment in business transformation is an important investment in our future, just like our investment in new distribution centers several years ago that are now helping to drive down our operating costs.
Another item of note would be the status of our inventory oxaliplatin, generic Eloxatin. We have a policy against providing insight in these specific item inventories but are making an exception in this case due to the size and unusual circumstances around the product and its impact. To refresh your memory, oxaliplatin cannot be sold by the generic manufacturers after June 30, 2010, until reintroduction in August 2012. Wholesalers can continue to sell through any inventory that was on hand as of June 30. We currently estimate that given our expected level of demand, we will have sufficient oxaliplatin inventory to meet the needs of our oncologist customers, at least through the first half of our fiscal '11 that begins October 1.
The two primary growth drivers at ABC, generics and specialty, were very much in evidence again this quarter. Sometimes, of course, the two drivers overlap as they did this quarter with oxaliplatin in our Specialty business. The wide diversity of our customer base with only one customer representing more than 10% of our business, with the next largest dropping down at a 5% range, enhances our generic growth driver where the vast majority of our customers look to us for at least some of their generics. 
Our Generic business was very strong, with double-digit increases over last year, easily outpacing our 6.6% revenue growth. Our traditional drug company, ABDC, had a revenue increase of 8%, reflecting the strength of the market, the strong growth of our largest customers, as well as the strength of our programs and total service offerings. We have now anniversary-ed most of the new business that accounted for the double-digit revenue growth of the last few quarters. 
Our Specialty Group, ABSG, was up 3% with a run rate over $16 billion annually, with about half of the revenues in oncology products to oncologists. We service the largest number of community oncology practices in the industry by far, and significantly, most of the largest and most innovative. I recently met with several of our largest practices and continue to be thoroughly impressed with the patient accessibility and focus on quality care they provide.
ASD, our blood plasma, nephrology and vaccine distributor and ICS, our third-party logistics company, had strong revenues in the quarter as did our Consulting businesses, Lash and Xcenda. Our Packaging business also had strong revenues in the quarter. Our total company double-digit gross profit increase this quarter reflected our attractive customer mix and generics. We continue to benefit from the at-risk launch of oxaliplatin, generic Eloxatin, as I noted earlier. 
Cost control continues to be an important part of the culture of ABC and our CE2 customer efficiency, cost-effectiveness philosophy is an important part of that culture. This quarter, the total cost of running ABC was about equal to last year in spite of a 6% increase in revenue, and the associates of ABC drove total operating costs as a percent to revenue down 10 basis points versus last year, equaling our historic best performance in this metric. Along with controlling expenses, our associates continued to do an outstanding job controlling our inventory and receivables, driving our DSO to 17 days again this quarter. Our receivables performance is a key indicator of the strength of our customer base and that we are delivering value to our customers. We continue to do an excellent job controlling our inventory, while maintaining very high service levels.
Operating margin expansion has continued to be a key focus of this management team, which delivered an impressive 28 basis points increase in operating margin this quarter versus last year. In each of the last four years, we have increased our operating margin by five to eight basis points, and of course, the basis points on $75-plus billion of revenue is a significant $7.5 million or $0.015 a share. 
Given our strong balance sheet, let me reiterate our position on acquisitions. Although none are contemplated in our guidance, we are receptive to acquisitions and have spent over $1 billion in the last eight years on acquisitions. An acquisition in our basic business of pharmaceutical distribution or related business would have appeal to us, and we look to stay within our area of core competency. We are in an excellent position for acquisitions, both financially and organizationally. So when you add up all the elements, we had a great quarter and a great fiscal year-to-date and have reflected our optimism by increasing the guidance for EPS and revenue for fiscal year 2010, which Mike will detail.
Before I turn the floor over to Mike for some added color, let me give you my very early thoughts on FY '11, which we will begin October 1 since we continue to get questions about the current year contribution of oxaliplatin and our ability to grow our business next year with this comparison.
We are still in our very detailed bottoms-up planning process, but here are our preliminary thoughts. The $0.05 per share benefit from special items we enjoyed this quarter will not be repeated next year. The oxaliplatin benefit enjoyed in FY '10 will not be repeated in total, but the combination of inventory carryover of the oxaliplatin product, combined with the benefit of two other specialty generic introductions, could provide a similar benefit in total to the FY '10 benefit we received from the at-risk launch of oxaliplatin. 
In addition, we now expect not to renew the contract with Duane Reade ending December 31, 2010, which represents approximately $500 million of annual revenue. Net of special items and assuming the specialty generic offset at this preliminary stage, we see EPS for FY '11 increasing in the 7% to 11% range over the midpoint of our increased FY '10 guidance. We continue to be very comfortable with long-term EPS growth goal of 15%. Looking past FY '11, our FY '12, which begins October 1, 2011, will include the largest brand to generic product conversion in industry history that is expected to begin November 2011.
For FY '13, we expect to begin to experience the benefits of our business transformation and the elimination of running dual IT systems. FY '14 will benefit from the 30 million or so uninsured patients entering the healthcare system with pent-up demand for pharmaceutical products, the most efficient element of the healthcare system. So both the next year and the next several years will be strong.
With ABC's position in generics and specialty and with our diverse customer base and cost structure, I have never been more enthusiastic about the role of our company within an industry with a future that has never been brighter. Here's Mike."
24809,109031229,75919,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-27-2010",2010-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Another great quarter and a superb nine months leading to increased EPS guidance, once again, with our new forecasted range for fiscal 2010 of $2.16 to $2.20, representing an increase of 28% to 30% over EPS fro",1990,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Another great quarter and a superb nine months leading to increased EPS guidance, once again, with our new forecasted range for fiscal 2010 of $2.16 to $2.20, representing an increase of 28% to 30% over EPS from continuing operations of $1.69 a year ago. 
Our third quarter performance was driven by above-market revenue growth, benefits from new and recent generic launches, a robust price increase environment and continued cost in working capital discipline. These are all familiar themes, with generics providing most of the upside against our expectations in the quarter. 
In addition to our continued strong operational performance, favorable litigation results contributed $0.05 per share to the quarter, enhancing our GAAP results. $0.04 of these litigation benefits are included in gross profit, and the other $0.01 is included in operating expenses within the facility consolidations line. I will give more detail on these items within my income statement review, and we'll summarize our increased EPS guidance at the end of my comments.
Now let's start with a walk down the income statement. Our record $19.6 billion of revenue in the third quarter increased 6.6% over last year and was above market growth. The Drug Company grew 8%, helped by the strong growth of its largest customers, as well as a 1% contribution from a large new customer added last August. 
The Specialty Group grew 3%, driven once again by ASD, our blood plasma and nephrology distributor and ICS, our third-party logistics company. The Specialty Group has grown 5% for the nine months ended June, which is in line with our 5% to 7% guidance for specialty growth for the year. Generics in this space have moderated top line growth but have certainly enhanced our overall profitability.
With our stronger-than-expected revenue growth for ABC as a whole, we now expect top line growth for fiscal '10 to exceed our previous 7% to 8% forecast and assume full year revenue growth to be between 8% and 9%. This range implies fourth quarter revenue growth in line with market growth of 3% to 5%. Our gross profit in the June quarter grew in double digits for the third consecutive quarter, increasing 13% over last June. 4% of this growth was from a $19 million legal settlement we received from a pharmaceutical manufacturer related to antitrust litigation as disclosed as a subsequent event in our March 10-Q. Double-digit generic revenue growth, including the impact of several new and recent launches, also contributed significantly to gross profit in the quarter. Oxaliplatin, once again, provided a large amount of that generic benefit, contributing $25 million or $0.05 of benefit to the quarter. This was in line with last quarter's contribution and better than we expected.
As Dave mentioned, despite the settlement between the brand and generic suppliers that prohibits those generic manufacturers from selling oxaliplatin after June 30, wholesalers can continue to sell the product they had on hand at the end of June, and we expect to have product available for sale to oncologists at least through the first half of our fiscal 2011. 
I will note, however, that with the 34% reduction in average selling price or ASP that became effective July 1 for this product, we anticipate a decline in our selling price, which will reduce our gross profit per unit going forward. Accordingly, we are only expecting a benefit of approximately $0.03 in our fourth fiscal quarter from oxali [oxaliplatin]. In addition to oxaliplatin, there were a number of other generic launches in the quarter, which provided an incremental $0.02 to $0.03 over our normal couple-of-pennies-per-quarter expectation for new launches. 
I also mentioned in my opening comments that there were significant manufacturer price increases in the quarter. And while much of this impact on the brand name side was mitigated by our fee-for-service agreements, there were a number of increases, particularly on the generics side, that provided benefits to the quarter. That manufacturer price activity also drove an increase in our LIFO charge in the quarter. This charge for the quarter was $11 million compared to a $4 million charge last year, reflecting both strong brand-name price inflation and a year-over-year reduction in generic price deflation.
For the nine months ended June 30, our charge was $30 million compared to $21 million in the similar period last year. Our current expectation is for our annual LIFO charge to be in the low $30 million range. As usual, we will perform our annual LIFO calculation at the end of September, and as in the past, there can be some adjustment as a result of that snapshot.
Moving to operating expenses. Total expense dollars in the quarter were flat compared to last June. Keep in mind that last year's quarter included an $8.9 million impairment charge for one of our subsidiaries. In the current quarter, we benefited from a $4.4 million reversal of a legal accrual as a result of a favorable court decision related to ongoing employment litigation with a former Bergen Brunswig executive. 
Offsetting that positive item, bad debt expenses in the quarter increased by approximately $6 million over last year, primarily related to certain physician customers in the Specialty Group. While we continue to expect operating expenses to increase 1% to 3% for the year, looking ahead to the fourth quarter and consistent with the last few years, we expect the significant sequential expense dollar increase between our third and fourth quarters. Historically, this has been due to the timing of certain customer promotional activities such as our annual customer trade shows. In addition this year, as a result of going live in July with the first phase of our ERP-enabled business transformation project, we are now maintaining duplicate information technology infrastructures, and we'll continue to do so for the remainder of the transition period for the move from our legacy system to SAP. 
The incremental IT costs to maintain dual systems is expected to be approximately $10 million per quarter, with approximately half of that relating to the start of depreciation for the new system. Our future savings will really start to accrue at the end of the transition period, starting in fiscal 2013 when we retire our legacy system and no longer have duplicate infrastructure costs or the project costs related to the ERP implementation. 
Moving to operating income, EBIT of $282 million in the quarter increased a robust 32% over last year, 21% excluding the favorable litigation items. Operating margin expanded by an impressive 28 basis points in the quarter and for the nine months, are up 23 basis points, well above our expectations. As we have mentioned consistently throughout the year, we expect a tough fourth quarter comparison due to the benefit we received in the prior-year fourth quarter from a LIFO credit and from generic introductions, specifically oxaliplatin. 
In addition with our higher expense levels expected in this year's fourth quarter, I would expect relatively flat operating margins in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. We have increased our operating margin expansion expectation for the full year to the mid- to high teens basis point range. And keep in mind that our operating margin expansion expectation when we began the year was in the flat to low single-digit basis point range.
Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense of $18 million was up 22% as expected due to our bond offering earlier in the year. Our effective income tax rate was 38.1% in the quarter compared to 36.8% in last year's June quarter, which benefited from certain adjustments. Our diluted EPS of $0.57 in the quarter increased by 36% compared to last year's EPS from continuing operations and was above our 30% growth in income from continuing operations due to a 5% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding. The reduction in shares was primarily due to our continuing share repurchase program, net of option exercises. Excluding our $0.05 litigation benefit, diluted EPS of $0.52 was up $0.10 or 24% compared to the June 2009 quarter.
Now let's turn to our cash flows and the balance sheet where we continue to demonstrate excellent performance. We generated $213 million of cash from operations in the quarter, bringing our nine-month total to $559 million compared to $430 million for the first nine months of last year, and we remain on track to hit our full year targets. We had $44 million of capital expenditures in the quarter and $132 million for the nine months and currently expect between $165 million and $175 million for the year, an increase over our prior estimates, primarily due to the timing of certain business transformation expenditures. 
From a working capital standpoint, average inventory days on hand during the quarter were 24 days, consistent with the prior year. Receivables management continues to be a focus as average DSOs in the quarter were 17.2 days, down almost a day during the prior year. Average DPOs were up one day, mainly due to the timing of purchases. From a share repurchase perspective, we purchased $95 million of our stock in the quarter, bringing our nine-month total to $350 million, meeting our initial guidance for the full year, and accordingly, we are increasing our fiscal 2010 share repurchase guidance to $450 million. At June 30, we have $218 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.
Our gross debt to total debt in equity ratio at the end of June is 32%, in line with our target 30% to 35% ratio, and we continue to have more than $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet, which continues to provide us with great financial flexibility.
Now let's turn to our updated fiscal 2010 guidance. We are increasing and narrowing our diluted EPS guidance from a range of $2.01 to $2.10 to a new range of $2.16 to $2.20. This new range represents a 28% to 30% increase over 2009 EPS from continuing operations, which as a reminder, were a strong 17%. This new range, as always, is on a GAAP basis and includes the $0.05 benefit we received from litigation items in the third quarter. Our updated guidance implies the diluted EPS range of $0.44 to $0.48 in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, the major differences between our fourth quarter EPS range and our third quarter diluted EPS of $0.57 are: the non-recurrence of the $0.05 of litigation benefits we received in the third quarter, increased operating expense expectations in Q4 of $0.03 to $0.04 versus Q3 and a net reduction of $0.02 to $0.03 in buy-side profits as declines in the benefit from oxaliplatin and price increases should offset the benefit from new generic introductions in the quarter. 
From a full year fiscal '10 assumption standpoint, we now expect revenue growth to be 8% to 9%, operating margin expansion to be in the mid- to high teens basis point range, free cash flow to remain in the $525 million to $600 million range and share repurchases to increase to approximately $450 million.
Keep in mind that Dave's preliminary comments on fiscal 2011 EPS growth are based on a $2.13 base EPS for fiscal '10, which is the $2.18 midpoint of our GAAP range, less the $0.05 of litigation benefits we received in fiscal 2010. 
As always, we will give our detailed guidance in early November on our fiscal year-end earnings call, where we would expect to have much greater clarity on all of our fiscal 2011 assumptions, including the specialty generic opportunities.
So again, a lot to like about the third quarter, the nine months and our outlook for the full year. We continue to benefit from our market positioning in specialty and generics and from the incredible work ethic and dedication of our associates, who continue to provide superior service to both our external and internal customers. The future continues to be very bright for AmerisourceBergen.

And often, when there's only one supplier, it acts more like a brand name drug than it does like a generic until more manufacturers come into play, which we would expect to happen. And again, maybe that's in fiscal '11. I think the other thing that's important to note about Lovenox is that it's mostly sold to our institutional pharmacy customers. And as a result, a very small percentage will actually go through our ProGeneric program, where we get our highest profit margin. A lot of that product is going to be sold through third-party GPO contracts so the overall margin percentage is less than what I've seen some people estimate at this point. However, I think this is a product that is going to maintain a fairly high generic price in relation to the brand price because of its difficulty to manufacture, and again I think it's going to provide a nice impact in fiscal '11.

And I think that's resulted in certain generic manufacturers being in better positions than they thought they would be with certain products, which has led to an increased pricing of those generics. During the quarter, we did get a benefit from generic price increases. We don't have the same fee-for-service constraint that mitigates the price increases with generic manufacturers that we do have with the brand names. Now I'm saying that, so I think that's a long-term trend in that industry. I'm not sure that it is. But I think what it shows is that the generic manufacturers are going to actively manage their portfolios. As more and more generics come on the market, they're going to make decisions about which ones to produce, which ones not to produce. And certainly, that can lead to some price activity. But again, we'd like to keep in mind our philosophy. We'd like to keep it spread around.

Mike will d",1890,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. As you probably know from our press release this morning, ABC had a strong fourth fiscal quarter ending in September that completed a record fiscal year that was extraordinary by almost any standard. Mike will drill down on the details, but let me note the fiscal year highlights.
Revenues increased over 8% to $78 billion. Gross margin increased by 11%, while expenses increased 3%, driving operating margins up for the fifth consecutive year this year by a strong 19 basis points. We crossed the $1 billion threshold of pretax earnings for the first time. 
EPS was up a whopping 28%, excluding litigation benefits. We generated over $1 billion of cash in the year, and we did all this while we invest in our future by beginning the implementation of business transformation, our SAP-enhanced ERP system that when completed, will meet the future needs of our customers and suppliers for years to come.  This year's performance was delivered on top of last year's 17% increase in EPS. Our compounded EPS growth since the company was created in 2001 is also 17%.
Strong performance in our September quarter speaks to the momentum we carry into our new fiscal year that began October 1. Our fourth quarter ending in September was a strong quarter in a series of strong quarters. Revenues increased $1 billion and over 5% to $19.7 billion. Gross profit increased over 10%, as we continue to benefit from our generic programs in both our Growth Company and Specialty Group. 
Our DSOs were down one day versus last year's 17 days. We are reporting a lot of strong performance metrics this quarter and year, and our DSO performance is one of the most powerful, because it speaks volumes about the strength of our customer base and the satisfaction of our customers with our total service and program package.  So lots to like about the year and the quarter in a series of strong quarters and fiscal years. The standby for ABC would be great performance in a resilient industry with positive momentum going into FY '11, driven by a solid customer mix featuring generics and specialty.
Before I address some company specifics, a few industry insights. First, U.S. pharmaceutical industry revenue growth. The IMS forecast of 3% to 5% for calendar 2010 and 2011 seems to be in the right zip code to us.  Next, competitive pricing environment within our industry. I would continue to describe the environment as competitive but stable, with few billion dollar pieces of business in play in the next 12 months or so and a few pieces of business this size changing wholesalers historically.  We continue to spend significant time and effort in Washington looking after the interest of our customers and shareholder. And like all of you, we'll be closely watching today's election results.
Now a little closer look at ABC. Among the big news items at ABC this quarter is that we went live with what we refer to as build one of our business transformation process that includes an eventual total conversion to SAP among other things. Build one includes our back-office functions for the  Growth Company and corporate. We expect to begin the next phase of business transformation, which we call build two, in the spring and this will entail converting each of the drug company distribution centers to the new system one by one. 
When completed, our BT implementation will provide us with insights, flexibility and operating efficiency, which will differentiate our offer to our current and potential customers and meet or exceed their information technology need for years to come.  It is important to note that during the phase-in period of business transformation, we will be operating two systems, both SAP and our legacy IT system, putting some pressure on cost containment efforts. The very good news is that when completed, we will get relief from the dual system expenses and have a state-of-the-art ERP system.  Our investment in business transformation is an important investment in our future just like our investment in new distribution centers several years ago that is now helping to drive down our operating cost.
Another noteworthy news items for the company is that our growth company's Good Neighbor Pharmacy, our franchise-like retail program of over 3,700 independent and regional chain customers, received the highest ranking in customer satisfaction for chain store pharmacies by J.D. Power and Associates. The fact that Good Neighbor Pharmacy is recognized as a chain is a powerful statement of the role of independence in the health channel, and noteworthy that two other networks of independent pharmacies ranked higher than the national warehousing chains.  The GNP recognition is strong testimony that ABC is doing business with the right customers and providing them with the right tools.  
And with the drug company, the drug company has now anniversaried all the significant new business captured over the last year that accounted in part for a 10% revenue increase in FY '10. The revenue growth of 6% in the drug company this quarter includes about 1% from a large customer that began with us a year ago, August. The drug company had a very strong generic quarter again, with generics outpacing total revenue growth by a large margin.
Our Specialty Group continues to set the standard of specialty distribution within the industry, with over $16 billion of annual revenue, about half of that in oncology products to oncologists, where we are rolling out our new suite of clinical and commercial solutions to oncologists called Nucleus. Our Nucleus solution is the most comprehensive commercial and clinical program in the market and features, among other elements, a new fully integrated dispensing cabinet. While the top line in oncology supply has been negatively impacted by generics, most notably oxaliplatin, generic Eloxatin. The bottom line has been very positively impacted.
Though we are usually uncomfortable talking about specific item inventory levels, we have made an exception with oxaliplatin due to the magnitude of its impact. And as noted and consistent with our remarks last quarter, we currently have enough oxaliplatin on hand to meet the expected demand of our customers through March 2011, that is to our second fiscal quarter of FY '11.
ASD, our blood plasma, nephrology and vaccine distributor had another strong quarter, benefiting from the early shipments of flu vaccine this quarter as the Besse Medical. ICS, our third-party logistics provider, also had a strong quarter. ICS discontinued serving U.S. oncology on a third-party logistics contract that moved to direct manufacturer distribution effective two months ago in September. While having a minimal impact on the bottom line of the Specialty Group and ABC, annual revenues will be impacted by about $800 million beginning October 1.
It is important to remember this third-party logistic company loss when evaluating our year-over-year Specialty Group revenues and to remember that the lost revenues have not occurred in our mainstream distribution business of oncology supply, ASD and Besse Medical, and do not represent a loss of market share. It is important to note that only one customer does more than 10% of our total revenue, and after that one customer, the next largest is in the 5% range of total revenues. Our current revenues reflect the strength of our diversified customer base.
So before I address our guidance for FY '11, let me recap FY '10, a very strong year, following a series of strong years, reflecting growth that continues to be a characteristic of ABC. EPS is up 28%, not including the gain from litigation, driven by Generics and Specialty, operating margin expansion, with cash generation outpacing after-tax earnings. For the past nine years, that is the entire history of AmerisourceBergen, our compound EPS growth rate of 17% is 20% for the last five years and 24% for the last three years.
With our strong cash position, let me reiterate our position on acquisitions. Although none are contemplated in our guidance, we are receptive to acquisitions, and have spent over $1 billion in the last eight years on acquisitions. And acquisition and our basic business of pharmaceutical distribution or related business would have appealed to us, and we look to stay within our area of core competency.  We are in an excellent position for acquisitions, both financially and organizationally.
Now we look at FY '11. We expect to grow our revenues with the market in the 2% to 4% range. We expect operating margin to increase in the low to mid-single-digit basis point range. We expect to continue our share repurchase program in the $400 million range. All of the above, we expect will drive our EPS to $2.31 to $2.41, a 7% to 12% increase on top of the extraordinary 28% increase in FY '10, excluding litigation gains. So the dead end is a strong performance continues. 
Beyond FY '11, I will offer the following perspective with a caveat that is very preliminary. Our FY '12 will feature the largest brand name to generic conversion in the history of the drug company. Beginning in November 2011, our first fiscal '12 quarter, when LIPITOR and Zyprexa are expected to go generic. The Specialty Group will have tough comparisons due to generics, including introductions that occurred in FY '10 and FY '11, but on balance, we look for FY '12 to be another good year.
Our FY '13 will feature the carryover of the FY '12 generic conversions in the drug company, several of which will occur in our fourth or September quarter and the beginning of the benefit from the completion of our business transformation program when duplicate IT cost should be eliminated. Our FY '14 will feature positive impacts from BT and the entrants of some $32 million or so, maybe even as many as $40 million uninsured into the healthcare system as part of the healthcare reform legislation.
It is our opinion that these uninsured will account in the market with a high demand for pharmaceutical services, which of course, is the most efficient element of healthcare. The new demand created by these newly insured will be a great boost to our FY '14 and carry into our FY '15, both years of which we expect to have solid generic introductions as well.  We are hopeful that somewhere along the way, the billions of dollars of research being expended annually by big pharma will yield some exciting new products and of course, at-risk launches can occur without warning.
The takeaway here is that demand for the products we distribute is strong, well into the future and the ABC circle of life is as relevant today as it was a decade ago. We are comfortable with our 15% long-term EPS growth goal, particularly given our track record of 17% for the last nine years, under conditions that could easily be described as challenging, but the 15% goal for a specific year needs to be mitigated, following extraordinary years like the 28% increase year just reported.
I continue to be very excited about the future role of the pharmaceutical distribution industry and the role that ABC will play in that industry with our drivers of specialty products and generics. I can tell you with the experience approaching four decades in the industry, our best years are yet to come.  Here is Mike."

We had a great ending to what was already an incredible year with 14% EPS growth in the fourth quarter despite a tough comparison to our prior year fourth quarter, which grew EPS by 22%.Before I review our quart",2021,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. We had a great ending to what was already an incredible year with 14% EPS growth in the fourth quarter despite a tough comparison to our prior year fourth quarter, which grew EPS by 22%.
Before I review our quarterly results followed by some more commentary on next year's guidance, I would like to take a few minutes to reflect on our full year fiscal 2010 performance and compare that performance to our original expectations for the year. As a reminder, our long-term financial model is based on revenue growth, operating margin expansion and significant cash generation, and we exceeded all of our original fiscal '10 financial targets in these areas.
Our original revenue growth guidance for fiscal 2010 was in above market 5% to 7%, factoring in the significant new customers we added in fiscal 2009, and we finished the year well above that range with full year revenue growth of 8.6%. We expanded operating margins by a robust 19 basis points, far exceeding our original assumption of flat to low single-digit basis points operating margin expansion. This original assumption reflected headwinds from a significant customer repricing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, as well as incremental ERP spending in fiscal 2010.
While both of these occurred, our actual performance benefited significantly from the at-risk launch of oxaliplatin in the Specialty Group and stronger than expected by-side performance from both brand name and generic pharmaceuticals, as well as stellar productivity gains in expense control in the drug company.
From a historical perspective, our annual operating income exceeded $1 billion for the first time.  On top of our strong operating performance, we once again demonstrated very disciplined working capital management, highlighted by a year-over-year decline in accounts receivable balances despite the robust sales increases, resulting in free cash flow of $924 million for fiscal 2010, far exceeding our original estimate of free cash flow in a range of $500 million to $575 million. That strong free cash flow allowed us to accelerate certain internal projects, raise our dividend by 33% and expand our share repurchase program, where we brought back $470 million of our shares compared to our original $350 million guidance.
All of these factors, combined to drive our GAAP diluted earnings per share to $2.22, a 31% increase over diluted EPS from continuing operations in fiscal 2009, and well above our original EPS guidance range for the year of $1.82 to $1.92. Excluding the special benefits we received from litigation gains, fiscal '10 diluted EPS would have been $2.16 or a 28% increase over fiscal '09.
Also, very importantly, we strengthened our already strong balance sheet during the year, received the ratings upgrade, won awards for customer service and implemented the first phase of our ERP-enabled business transformation project. Truly, an exceptional all-around year for ABC, and we thank all of our associates who continue to deliver a superior level of customer service everyday.
Now moving to our quarterly results and starting with our top line. Revenue increased by 5.3%, with almost 1% of that increase attributed to a large alternate site customer we added in August of 2009. The drug company increased its top line by 6%, benefited by that new customer, as well as by the above-market growth of certain of the drug company's largest customers.
The Specialty Group grew 4% in the quarter, once again, driven by AST, our nephrology and blood plasma distributor and ICS, our third-party logistics company. As Dave mentioned, during the quarter, ICS has discontinued a large three PL contract that has moved to direct manufacturer distribution. The loss of this $800 million a year contract will impact Specialty Revenue growth by about 5% in fiscal 2011 and overall ABC revenue growth by about 1%. But importantly, we'll only have a minimal net earnings impact.
Gross profit increased by 10% in the quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter in which we achieved double-digit growth. The growth in gross profit this quarter is particularly impressive, as we have now anniversaried the August 2009 oxaliplatin launch, as well as the 2009 new customer additions. Oxaliplatin gross profit contributed $0.04 to the current quarter earnings, exceeding our expectation of $0.03 and was down sequentially and from our prior year quarter levels as anticipated.
Accordingly, most of the quarterly gross profit growth has come from the drug company were double-digit generic sales growth, including the impact of new launches and performance under branded fee-for-service agreements, more than offset normal competitive pressures on margin. Our LIFO charge in the quarter was $400,000 compared to a credit of $5.7 million last year. And for the year, our LIFO charge was $30 million compared to a charge of $15 million last year.
Moving to operating expenses. I mentioned last quarter that expenses would increase significantly sequentially between the third and fourth quarters, and that has occurred as expected. Part of that fourth quarter increase as discussed last quarter was the commencement in the quarter of duplicate IT infrastructure cost, as a result of our Go-Live with the first phase of our ERP implementation.  We will continue to incur approximately $10 million of duplicate IT cost per quarter, as we fully transition away from our legacy system, which is expected to occur by the end of fiscal '12.
Also contributing to the expense increase in the quarter, we wrote off about $7 million of software cost and incurred $2.5 million of intangible asset impairments. In addition, we incurred quarterly increases in incentive compensation, as well as bad debt expense, which while still higher than average, was down sequentially from last quarter.
Our double-digit growth in gross profit led to an impressive 11% increase in operating profit, and our operating margin of 126 basis points in the quarter increased by six basis points over the prior year period. For the year, once again, our operating margin of 142 basis points increased by an outstanding 19 bps.
Moving below operating income, net interest expense of $18 million in the quarter increased to 21%, consistent with prior quarterly trends due to our bond offering earlier in the fiscal year. Our effective income tax rate of 38% in the quarter was in line with last year's rate. Our diluted EPS in the quarter of $0.50 increased by $0.06 or 14% from a year ago. Our EPS growth exceeded our 8.5% increase in net income due to the reduction in average diluted shares outstanding, primarily as a result of our share repurchase program over the last 12 months.  Average diluted outstanding shares in the quarter were just under 284 million, down 4% from last year.
Now let's turn to our cash flow in the balance sheet, where we continue to demonstrate excellent performance. Cash generated from operations in the September quarter was an extremely strong $549 million, bringing our full year cash flow from operations to $1.1 billion. 
Our free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $924 million for the year, well above our increased guidance of $525 million to $600 million, primarily due to better-than-expected working capital management and the year-end timing of payments to manufacturers.  Inventory days on hand averaged 25 days during fiscal 2010, consistent with last year, and average DSO for the year of 17.3 days was down almost a full day compared to 2009. DPOs were up on average but about a half day, reflecting product mix shifts to more generics and timing.
Our gross total debt and capital ratio at the end of September was 31.3%, within our target range of 30% to 35%. We bought $120 million of our shares during the quarter, bringing our full year share repurchases to $470 million, and our board authorized a new $500 million share buyback program in September. And as of the end of our fiscal year, we have $598 million remaining under board-authorized repurchase programs. Our cash balance at the end of September exceeded $1.6 billion, leaving us with great financial flexibility as we enter fiscal 2011.
Now let's turn to our guidance for the coming year. Our fiscal 2011 guidance for diluted earnings per share is a range of $2.31 to $2.41, an increase of 7% to 12% over our fiscal 2010 diluted EPS of $2.16, which excludes our $0.05 benefit from fiscal 2010 litigation gains.  The assumptions behind this guidance includes revenue growth of 2% to 4%, operating margin expansion in the low to mid-single-digit basis point range, and free cash flow in the $625 million to $700 million range, which is in line with our long-term goal of free cash flow approximating net income. Our guidance assume share repurchases of approximately $400 million depending, of course, on market conditions.  We would also expect net interest expense to be up to 20% higher in fiscal 2011, as we anticipate fee increases upon renewals of our liquidity facilities and less capitalized interest, now that we are live with our ERP platform.
In addition, we expect our effective income tax rate to be in the 38.4% range, above the 38% we experienced in fiscal 2010, which benefited from certain adjustments, primarily from tax audits. We should also see our capital expenditures decline from the $185 million level back to the $150 million range.
To drill down a little more on our revenue and margin assumptions, we expect the drug company to grow with overall market growth, which we believe is in the 3% to 5% range. As we stated last quarter, this assumes the transfer of the Duane Reade business at the end of our first quarter and the expiration of the volume-base along the CVS contract at the end of our third fiscal quarter. On the specialty side, we expect revenue growth to be flat to slightly down, reflecting the 5% impact from the third-party logistics customer I mentioned earlier that is now going direct. In addition, we expect some top line moderation from new generics. 
Importantly, however, we should have significant operating margin expansion in specialty despite tough comparables, as we expect the impact from generic Gemzar and Taxotere, along with the continued availability of oxaliplatin for at least half of the year to more than offset the contribution we received from oxaliplatin in fiscal 2010. That contribution was approximately $0.25 of earnings. 
Within the drug company, we expect relatively flat operating margins as positive product mix trends should offset the incremental IT expenses discussed earlier. It's important to note that even with the incremental IT expenses, total operating expense growth for ABC as a whole should be less than revenue growth, as we expect continued productivity gains in our distribution network.  The Packaging Group, while very small to ABC at less than 1/2 of 1% of total revenue, is expected to grow earnings in double digits on top of the 30% earnings growth they experienced in fiscal 2010.
As a reminder, we generally do not give quarterly guidance due to the inherent variability in our business on a quarterly basis. However, remember that our fiscal 2010 first quarter EPS was up a phenomenal 44% due to an unusually large benefit from generic introductions, most notably, oxaliplatin. Accordingly, looking forward to fiscal '11, the December quarter is expected to be our toughest quarterly comparison, even with the planned mid-November launch of the two new specialty generic products, which we believe will have a limited impact on our first fiscal quarter results as our customers transition from their brand agreements.
Taking all of this into account, we would expect our first fiscal quarter results to be in line with those from last December.  I know that we've covered a lot of information, but let me summarize by once again reiterating that we had a solid quarter, which finished an incredible year with over 30% EPS growth, and our momentum going into fiscal 2011 remains very strong. And despite tough comparisons to fiscal 2010, especially in the first quarter, we expect a solid year once again.
Now let me turn it over to Barbara Brungess, our new Vice President of Corporate Investor and Investor Relations for Q&A."

There's some estimates float around that have us over 50% of over some items in the market. So we'll say our model is pretty tried and true here. We continue to enhance it. And as I mentioned on our new Nucleus roll out, we're very excited about that. It includes a new cabinet, which we think the market's going to be very receptive to. So we're very happy with our program. We don't think there's any big pieces we're lacking or the like. And the fact that we've been able to maintain our strong leadership in that market, we think, would enhance that or would endorse that."

One of the things that makes that somewhat unique is that you don't have an ability to negotiate when the time's up. It literally has to be bid by statutes. So I would expect it to be a competitive environment, and I would expect everybody to show up, and I would expect everybody to be rational."

In fact, we're living up the story right now. It's a great story to participate in. Generics have been very, very attractive to us. And we think the same thing will happen as biosimilars or whatever they are called, enter the market, and then a large marketshare will benefit it. Whatever happens with those products, they're still going to need the kinds of services and the distribution capability that we bring to the party. And in fact, they made need it in an intensified fashion, because they may be unfamiliar with the marketing. So they may have a great appetite for the services that we provide, not only in our traditional Specialty business, but also with the people like Lash, who have a very large reimbursement counseling business, our extended business which helps with REMS-type evaluations and the like.

As you probably know from our press release this morning, ABC had a strong fourth fiscal quarter ending in September that completed a record fiscal year that was extraordinary by almost any standard. Mike will d",1890,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. As you probably know from our press release this morning, ABC had a strong fourth fiscal quarter ending in September that completed a record fiscal year that was extraordinary by almost any standard. Mike will drill down on the details, but let me note the fiscal year highlights.
Revenues increased over 8% to $78 billion. Gross margin increased by 11%, while expenses increased 3%, driving operating margins up for the fifth consecutive year this year by a strong 19 basis points. We crossed the $1 billion threshold of pretax earnings for the first time. 
EPS was up a whopping 28%, excluding litigation benefits. We generated over $1 billion of cash in the year, and we did all this while we invest in our future by beginning the implementation of business transformation, our SAP-enhanced ERP system that when completed, will meet the future needs of our customers and suppliers for years to come.  This year's performance was delivered on top of last year's 17% increase in EPS. Our compounded EPS growth since the company was created in 2001 is also 17%.
Strong performance in our September quarter speaks to the momentum we carry into our new fiscal year that began October 1. Our fourth quarter ending in September was a strong quarter in a series of strong quarters. Revenues increased $1 billion and over 5% to $19.7 billion. Gross profit increased over 10%, as we continue to benefit from our generic programs in both our Growth Company and Specialty Group. 
Our DSOs were down one day versus last year's 17 days. We are reporting a lot of strong performance metrics this quarter and year, and our DSO performance is one of the most powerful, because it speaks volumes about the strength of our customer base and the satisfaction of our customers with our total service and program package.  So lots to like about the year and the quarter in a series of strong quarters and fiscal years. The standby for ABC would be great performance in a resilient industry with positive momentum going into FY '11, driven by a solid customer mix featuring generics and specialty.
Before I address some company specifics, a few industry insights. First, U.S. pharmaceutical industry revenue growth. The IMS forecast of 3% to 5% for calendar 2010 and 2011 seems to be in the right zip code to us.  Next, competitive pricing environment within our industry. I would continue to describe the environment as competitive but stable, with few billion dollar pieces of business in play in the next 12 months or so and a few pieces of business this size changing wholesalers historically.  We continue to spend significant time and effort in Washington looking after the interest of our customers and shareholder. And like all of you, we'll be closely watching today's election results.
Now a little closer look at ABC. Among the big news items at ABC this quarter is that we went live with what we refer to as build one of our business transformation process that includes an eventual total conversion to SAP among other things. Build one includes our back-office functions for the  Growth Company and corporate. We expect to begin the next phase of business transformation, which we call build two, in the spring and this will entail converting each of the drug company distribution centers to the new system one by one. 
When completed, our BT implementation will provide us with insights, flexibility and operating efficiency, which will differentiate our offer to our current and potential customers and meet or exceed their information technology need for years to come.  It is important to note that during the phase-in period of business transformation, we will be operating two systems, both SAP and our legacy IT system, putting some pressure on cost containment efforts. The very good news is that when completed, we will get relief from the dual system expenses and have a state-of-the-art ERP system.  Our investment in business transformation is an important investment in our future just like our investment in new distribution centers several years ago that is now helping to drive down our operating cost.
Another noteworthy news items for the company is that our growth company's Good Neighbor Pharmacy, our franchise-like retail program of over 3,700 independent and regional chain customers, received the highest ranking in customer satisfaction for chain store pharmacies by J.D. Power and Associates. The fact that Good Neighbor Pharmacy is recognized as a chain is a powerful statement of the role of independence in the health channel, and noteworthy that two other networks of independent pharmacies ranked higher than the national warehousing chains.  The GNP recognition is strong testimony that ABC is doing business with the right customers and providing them with the right tools.  
And with the drug company, the drug company has now anniversaried all the significant new business captured over the last year that accounted in part for a 10% revenue increase in FY '10. The revenue growth of 6% in the drug company this quarter includes about 1% from a large customer that began with us a year ago, August. The drug company had a very strong generic quarter again, with generics outpacing total revenue growth by a large margin.
Our Specialty Group continues to set the standard of specialty distribution within the industry, with over $16 billion of annual revenue, about half of that in oncology products to oncologists, where we are rolling out our new suite of clinical and commercial solutions to oncologists called Nucleus. Our Nucleus solution is the most comprehensive commercial and clinical program in the market and features, among other elements, a new fully integrated dispensing cabinet. While the top line in oncology supply has been negatively impacted by generics, most notably oxaliplatin, generic Eloxatin. The bottom line has been very positively impacted.
Though we are usually uncomfortable talking about specific item inventory levels, we have made an exception with oxaliplatin due to the magnitude of its impact. And as noted and consistent with our remarks last quarter, we currently have enough oxaliplatin on hand to meet the expected demand of our customers through March 2011, that is to our second fiscal quarter of FY '11.
ASD, our blood plasma, nephrology and vaccine distributor had another strong quarter, benefiting from the early shipments of flu vaccine this quarter as the Besse Medical. ICS, our third-party logistics provider, also had a strong quarter. ICS discontinued serving U.S. oncology on a third-party logistics contract that moved to direct manufacturer distribution effective two months ago in September. While having a minimal impact on the bottom line of the Specialty Group and ABC, annual revenues will be impacted by about $800 million beginning October 1.
It is important to remember this third-party logistic company loss when evaluating our year-over-year Specialty Group revenues and to remember that the lost revenues have not occurred in our mainstream distribution business of oncology supply, ASD and Besse Medical, and do not represent a loss of market share. It is important to note that only one customer does more than 10% of our total revenue, and after that one customer, the next largest is in the 5% range of total revenues. Our current revenues reflect the strength of our diversified customer base.
So before I address our guidance for FY '11, let me recap FY '10, a very strong year, following a series of strong years, reflecting growth that continues to be a characteristic of ABC. EPS is up 28%, not including the gain from litigation, driven by Generics and Specialty, operating margin expansion, with cash generation outpacing after-tax earnings. For the past nine years, that is the entire history of AmerisourceBergen, our compound EPS growth rate of 17% is 20% for the last five years and 24% for the last three years.
With our strong cash position, let me reiterate our position on acquisitions. Although none are contemplated in our guidance, we are receptive to acquisitions, and have spent over $1 billion in the last eight years on acquisitions. And acquisition and our basic business of pharmaceutical distribution or related business would have appealed to us, and we look to stay within our area of core competency.  We are in an excellent position for acquisitions, both financially and organizationally.
Now we look at FY '11. We expect to grow our revenues with the market in the 2% to 4% range. We expect operating margin to increase in the low to mid-single-digit basis point range. We expect to continue our share repurchase program in the $400 million range. All of the above, we expect will drive our EPS to $2.31 to $2.41, a 7% to 12% increase on top of the extraordinary 28% increase in FY '10, excluding litigation gains. So the dead end is a strong performance continues. 
Beyond FY '11, I will offer the following perspective with a caveat that is very preliminary. Our FY '12 will feature the largest brand name to generic conversion in the history of the drug company. Beginning in November 2011, our first fiscal '12 quarter, when LIPITOR and Zyprexa are expected to go generic. The Specialty Group will have tough comparisons due to generics, including introductions that occurred in FY '10 and FY '11, but on balance, we look for FY '12 to be another good year.
Our FY '13 will feature the carryover of the FY '12 generic conversions in the drug company, several of which will occur in our fourth or September quarter and the beginning of the benefit from the completion of our business transformation program when duplicate IT cost should be eliminated. Our FY '14 will feature positive impacts from BT and the entrants of some $32 million or so, maybe even as many as $40 million uninsured into the healthcare system as part of the healthcare reform legislation.
It is our opinion that these uninsured will account in the market with a high demand for pharmaceutical services, which of course, is the most efficient element of healthcare. The new demand created by these newly insured will be a great boost to our FY '14 and carry into our FY '15, both years of which we expect to have solid generic introductions as well.  We are hopeful that somewhere along the way, the billions of dollars of research being expended annually by big pharma will yield some exciting new products and of course, at-risk launches can occur without warning.
The takeaway here is that demand for the products we distribute is strong, well into the future and the ABC circle of life is as relevant today as it was a decade ago. We are comfortable with our 15% long-term EPS growth goal, particularly given our track record of 17% for the last nine years, under conditions that could easily be described as challenging, but the 15% goal for a specific year needs to be mitigated, following extraordinary years like the 28% increase year just reported.
I continue to be very excited about the future role of the pharmaceutical distribution industry and the role that ABC will play in that industry with our drivers of specialty products and generics. I can tell you with the experience approaching four decades in the industry, our best years are yet to come.  Here is Mike.

We had a great ending to what was already an incredible year with 14% EPS growth in the fourth quarter despite a tough comparison to our prior year fourth quarter, which grew EPS by 22%.
Before I review our quarterly results followed by some more commentary on next year's guidance, I would like to take a few minutes to reflect on our full year fiscal 2010 performance and compare that performance to our original expectations for the year. As a reminder, our long-term financial model is based on revenue growth, operating margin expansion and significant cash generation, and we exceeded all of our original fiscal '10 financial targets in these areas.
Our original revenue growth guidance for fiscal 2010 was in above market 5% to 7%, factoring in the significant new customers we added in fiscal 2009, and we finished the year well above that range with full year revenue growth of 8.6%. We expanded operating margins by a robust 19 basis points, far exceeding our original assumption of flat to low single-digit basis points operating margin expansion. This original assumption reflected headwinds from a significant customer repricing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, as well as incremental ERP spending in fiscal 2010.
While both of these occurred, our actual performance benefited significantly from the at-risk launch of oxaliplatin in the Specialty Group and stronger than expected by-side performance from both brand name and generic pharmaceuticals, as well as stellar productivity gains in expense control in the drug company.
From a historical perspective, our annual operating income exceeded $1 billion for the first time.  On top of our strong operating performance, we once again demonstrated very disciplined working capital management, highlighted by a year-over-year decline in accounts receivable balances despite the robust sales increases, resulting in free cash flow of $924 million for fiscal 2010, far exceeding our original estimate of free cash flow in a range of $500 million to $575 million. That strong free cash flow allowed us to accelerate certain internal projects, raise our dividend by 33% and expand our share repurchase program, where we brought back $470 million of our shares compared to our original $350 million guidance.
All of these factors, combined to drive our GAAP diluted earnings per share to $2.22, a 31% increase over diluted EPS from continuing operations in fiscal 2009, and well above our original EPS guidance range for the year of $1.82 to $1.92. Excluding the special benefits we received from litigation gains, fiscal '10 diluted EPS would have been $2.16 or a 28% increase over fiscal '09.
Also, very importantly, we strengthened our already strong balance sheet during the year, received the ratings upgrade, won awards for customer service and implemented the first phase of our ERP-enabled business transformation project. Truly, an exceptional all-around year for ABC, and we thank all of our associates who continue to deliver a superior level of customer service everyday.
Now moving to our quarterly results and starting with our top line. Revenue increased by 5.3%, with almost 1% of that increase attributed to a large alternate site customer we added in August of 2009. The drug company increased its top line by 6%, benefited by that new customer, as well as by the above-market growth of certain of the drug company's largest customers.
The Specialty Group grew 4% in the quarter, once again, driven by AST, our nephrology and blood plasma distributor and ICS, our third-party logistics company. As Dave mentioned, during the quarter, ICS has discontinued a large three PL contract that has moved to direct manufacturer distribution. The loss of this $800 million a year contract will impact Specialty Revenue growth by about 5% in fiscal 2011 and overall ABC revenue growth by about 1%. But importantly, we'll only have a minimal net earnings impact.
Gross profit increased by 10% in the quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter in which we achieved double-digit growth. The growth in gross profit this quarter is particularly impressive, as we have now anniversaried the August 2009 oxaliplatin launch, as well as the 2009 new customer additions. Oxaliplatin gross profit contributed $0.04 to the current quarter earnings, exceeding our expectation of $0.03 and was down sequentially and from our prior year quarter levels as anticipated.
Accordingly, most of the quarterly gross profit growth has come from the drug company were double-digit generic sales growth, including the impact of new launches and performance under branded fee-for-service agreements, more than offset normal competitive pressures on margin. Our LIFO charge in the quarter was $400,000 compared to a credit of $5.7 million last year. And for the year, our LIFO charge was $30 million compared to a charge of $15 million last year.
Moving to operating expenses. I mentioned last quarter that expenses would increase significantly sequentially between the third and fourth quarters, and that has occurred as expected. Part of that fourth quarter increase as discussed last quarter was the commencement in the quarter of duplicate IT infrastructure cost, as a result of our Go-Live with the first phase of our ERP implementation.  We will continue to incur approximately $10 million of duplicate IT cost per quarter, as we fully transition away from our legacy system, which is expected to occur by the end of fiscal '12.
Also contributing to the expense increase in the quarter, we wrote off about $7 million of software cost and incurred $2.5 million of intangible asset impairments. In addition, we incurred quarterly increases in incentive compensation, as well as bad debt expense, which while still higher than average, was down sequentially from last quarter.
Our double-digit growth in gross profit led to an impressive 11% increase in operating profit, and our operating margin of 126 basis points in the quarter increased by six basis points over the prior year period. For the year, once again, our operating margin of 142 basis points increased by an outstanding 19 bps.
Moving below operating income, net interest expense of $18 million in the quarter increased to 21%, consistent with prior quarterly trends due to our bond offering earlier in the fiscal year. Our effective income tax rate of 38% in the quarter was in line with last year's rate. Our diluted EPS in the quarter of $0.50 increased by $0.06 or 14% from a year ago. Our EPS growth exceeded our 8.5% increase in net income due to the reduction in average diluted shares outstanding, primarily as a result of our share repurchase program over the last 12 months.  Average diluted outstanding shares in the quarter were just under 284 million, down 4% from last year.
Now let's turn to our cash flow in the balance sheet, where we continue to demonstrate excellent performance. Cash generated from operations in the September quarter was an extremely strong $549 million, bringing our full year cash flow from operations to $1.1 billion. 
Our free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $924 million for the year, well above our increased guidance of $525 million to $600 million, primarily due to better-than-expected working capital management and the year-end timing of payments to manufacturers.  Inventory days on hand averaged 25 days during fiscal 2010, consistent with last year, and average DSO for the year of 17.3 days was down almost a full day compared to 2009. DPOs were up on average but about a half day, reflecting product mix shifts to more generics and timing.
Our gross total debt and capital ratio at the end of September was 31.3%, within our target range of 30% to 35%. We bought $120 million of our shares during the quarter, bringing our full year share repurchases to $470 million, and our board authorized a new $500 million share buyback program in September. And as of the end of our fiscal year, we have $598 million remaining under board-authorized repurchase programs. Our cash balance at the end of September exceeded $1.6 billion, leaving us with great financial flexibility as we enter fiscal 2011.
Now let's turn to our guidance for the coming year. Our fiscal 2011 guidance for diluted earnings per share is a range of $2.31 to $2.41, an increase of 7% to 12% over our fiscal 2010 diluted EPS of $2.16, which excludes our $0.05 benefit from fiscal 2010 litigation gains.  The assumptions behind this guidance includes revenue growth of 2% to 4%, operating margin expansion in the low to mid-single-digit basis point range, and free cash flow in the $625 million to $700 million range, which is in line with our long-term goal of free cash flow approximating net income. Our guidance assume share repurchases of approximately $400 million depending, of course, on market conditions.  We would also expect net interest expense to be up to 20% higher in fiscal 2011, as we anticipate fee increases upon renewals of our liquidity facilities and less capitalized interest, now that we are live with our ERP platform.
In addition, we expect our effective income tax rate to be in the 38.4% range, above the 38% we experienced in fiscal 2010, which benefited from certain adjustments, primarily from tax audits. We should also see our capital expenditures decline from the $185 million level back to the $150 million range.
To drill down a little more on our revenue and margin assumptions, we expect the drug company to grow with overall market growth, which we believe is in the 3% to 5% range. As we stated last quarter, this assumes the transfer of the Duane Reade business at the end of our first quarter and the expiration of the volume-base along the CVS contract at the end of our third fiscal quarter. On the specialty side, we expect revenue growth to be flat to slightly down, reflecting the 5% impact from the third-party logistics customer I mentioned earlier that is now going direct. In addition, we expect some top line moderation from new generics. 
Importantly, however, we should have significant operating margin expansion in specialty despite tough comparables, as we expect the impact from generic Gemzar and Taxotere, along with the continued availability of oxaliplatin for at least half of the year to more than offset the contribution we received from oxaliplatin in fiscal 2010. That contribution was approximately $0.25 of earnings. 
Within the drug company, we expect relatively flat operating margins as positive product mix trends should offset the incremental IT expenses discussed earlier. It's important to note that even with the incremental IT expenses, total operating expense growth for ABC as a whole should be less than revenue growth, as we expect continued productivity gains in our distribution network.  The Packaging Group, while very small to ABC at less than 1/2 of 1% of total revenue, is expected to grow earnings in double digits on top of the 30% earnings growth they experienced in fiscal 2010.
As a reminder, we generally do not give quarterly guidance due to the inherent variability in our business on a quarterly basis. However, remember that our fiscal 2010 first quarter EPS was up a phenomenal 44% due to an unusually large benefit from generic introductions, most notably, oxaliplatin. Accordingly, looking forward to fiscal '11, the December quarter is expected to be our toughest quarterly comparison, even with the planned mid-November launch of the two new specialty generic products, which we believe will have a limited impact on our first fiscal quarter results as our customers transition from their brand agreements.
Taking all of this into account, we would expect our first fiscal quarter results to be in line with those from last December.  I know that we've covered a lot of information, but let me summarize by once again reiterating that we had a solid quarter, which finished an incredible year with over 30% EPS growth, and our momentum going into fiscal 2011 remains very strong. And despite tough comparisons to fiscal 2010, especially in the first quarter, we expect a solid year once again.
Now let me turn it over to Barbara Brungess, our new Vice President of Corporate Investor and Investor Relations for Q&A.

And I'm not sure exactly where the market growth came out, probably in the high single-digits low double-digits, and the fact that we grew a little bit faster than that, reflects the fact that our compliance efforts continue to bear fruit, and we continue to get more of our customer's wallet.

For those of you who followed the industry for a long time, you may recall that when generics came in the market, there was a large -- the focus is going to be definitely for the wholesale and maybe the retailer and anyone who touched products, and we know that story ends. In fact, we're living up the story right now. It's a great story to participate in. Generics have been very, very attractive to us. And we think the same thing will happen as biosimilars or whatever they are called, enter the market, and then a large marketshare will benefit it. Whatever happens with those products, they're still going to need the kinds of services and the distribution capability that we bring to the party. And in fact, they made need it in an intensified fashion, because they may be unfamiliar with the marketing. So they may have a great appetite for the services that we provide, not only in our traditional Specialty business, but also with the people like Lash, who have a very large reimbursement counseling business, our extended business which helps with REMS-type evaluations and the like. So it's one of the things that makes our business attractive. And why we think that specialty space is still important for us to have a very large marketshare, going forward, because we do think there's a lot of opportunities coming down the road.

As you probably know from our press release this morning, ABC had a strong fourth fiscal quarter ending in September that completed a record fiscal year that was extraordinary by almost any standard. Mike will drill down on the details, but let me note the fiscal year highlights.
Revenues increased over 8% to $78 billion. Gross margin increased by 11%, while expenses increased 3%, driving operating margins up for the fifth consecutive year this year by a strong 19 basis points. We crossed the $1 billion threshold of pretax earnings for the first time. 
EPS was up a whopping 28%, excluding litigation benefits. We generated over $1 billion of cash in the year, and we did all this while we invested in our future by beginning the implementation of Business Transformation, our SAP-enhanced ERP system that when completed, will meet the future needs of our customers and suppliers for years to come.  This year's performance was delivered on top of last year's 17% increase in EPS. Our compounded EPS growth since the company was created in 2001 is also 17%.
The strong performance in our September quarter speaks to the momentum we carry into our new fiscal year that began October 1. Our fourth quarter ending in September was a strong quarter in a series of strong quarters. Revenues increased $1 billion and over 5% to $19.7 billion. Gross profit increased over 10%, as we continued to benefit from our generic programs in both our Drug Company and Specialty Group. 
Our DSOs were down one day versus last year's 17 days. We are reporting a lot of strong performance metrics this quarter and year, and our DSO performance is one of the most powerful, because it speaks volumes about the strength of our customer base and the satisfaction of our customers with our total service and program package.  So lots to like about the year and the quarter in a series of strong quarters and fiscal years. The sound bite for ABC would be great performance in a resilient industry with positive momentum going into FY '11, driven by a solid customer mix featuring generics and specialty.
Before I address some company specifics, a few industry insights. First, U.S. pharmaceutical industry revenue growth. The IMS forecast of 3% to 5% for calendar 2010 and 2011 seems to be in the right zip code to us.  Next, competitive pricing environment within our industry. I would continue to describe the environment as competitive but stable, with few billion dollar pieces of business in play in the next 12 months or so and a few pieces of business this size changing wholesalers historically.  We continue to spend significant time and effort in Washington looking after the interests of our customers and shareholders. And like all of you, we'll be closely watching today's election results.
Now a little closer look at ABC. Among the big news items at ABC this quarter is that we went live with what we refer to as build one of our business transformation process that includes an eventual total conversion to SAP among other things. Build one includes our back-office functions for the Drug Company and corporate. We expect to begin the next phase of business transformation, which we call build two, in the spring and this will entail converting each of the drug company distribution centers to the new system one by one. 
When completed, our BT implementation will provide us with insights, flexibility and operating efficiency, which will differentiate our offer to our current and potential customers and meet or exceed their information technology needs for years to come.  It is important to note that during the phase-in period of Business Transformation, we will be operating two systems, both SAP and our legacy IT system, putting some pressure on cost-containment efforts. The very good news is that when completed, we will get relief from the dual system expenses and have a state-of-the-art ERP system.  Our investment in business transformation is an important investment in our future just like our investment in new distribution centers several years ago that is now helping to drive down our operating costs.
Another noteworthy news items for the company is that our drug company's Good Neighbor Pharmacy, our franchise-like retail program of over 3,700 independent and regional chain customers, received the highest ranking in customer satisfaction for chain store pharmacies by J.D. Power and Associates. The fact that Good Neighbor Pharmacy is recognized as a chain is a powerful statement of the role of independents in the health channel, and noteworthy that two other networks of independent pharmacies ranked higher than the national warehousing chains.  The GNP recognition is strong testimony that ABC is doing business with the right customers and providing them with the right tools.  
And with the Drug Company, the Drug Company has now anniversaried all the significant new business captured over the last year that accounted in part for a 10% revenue increase in FY '10. The revenue growth of 6% in the Drug Company this quarter includes about 1% from a large customer that began with us a year ago August. The Drug Company had a very strong generic quarter again, with generics outpacing total revenue growth by a large margin.
Our Specialty Group continues to set the standard of specialty distribution within the industry, with over $16 billion of annual revenue, about half of that in oncology products to oncologists, where we are rolling out our new suite of clinical and commercial solutions to oncologists, called Nucleus. Our Nucleus solution is the most comprehensive commercial and clinical program in the market and features, among other elements, a new fully integrated dispensing cabinet. While the top line in oncology supply has been negatively impacted by generics, most notably oxaliplatin, generic Eloxatin, the bottom line has been very positively impacted.
Though we are usually uncomfortable talking about specific item inventory levels, we have made an exception with oxaliplatin due to the magnitude of its impact. And as noted and consistent with our remarks last quarter, we currently have enough oxaliplatin on hand to meet the expected demand of our customers through March 2011, that is, through our second fiscal quarter of FY '11.
ASD, our blood plasma, nephrology and vaccine distributor, had another strong quarter, benefiting from the early shipments of flu vaccine this quarter as did Besse Medical. ICS, our third-party logistics provider, also had a strong quarter. ICS discontinued serving U.S. Oncology on a third-party logistics contract that moved to direct manufacturer distribution effective two months ago in September. While having a minimal impact on the bottom line of the Specialty Group and ABC, annual revenues will be impacted by about $800 million beginning October 1.
It is important to remember this third-party logistic company loss when evaluating our year-over-year Specialty Group revenues and to remember that the lost revenues have not occurred in our mainstream distribution business of oncology supply, ASD and Besse Medical, and do not represent a loss of market share. It is important to note that only one customer does more than 10% of our total revenue, and after that one customer, the next largest is in the 5% range of total revenues. Our current revenues reflect the strength of our diversified customer base.
So before I address our guidance for FY '11, let me recap FY '10, a very strong year, following a series of strong years, reflecting growth that continues to be characteristic of ABC. EPS up 28%, not including the gain from litigation, driven by Generics and Specialty. Operating margin expansion, with cash generation outpacing after-tax earnings. For the past nine years, that is the entire history of AmerisourceBergen. Our compound EPS growth rate is 17%, is 20% for the last five years and 24% for the last three years.
With our strong cash position, let me reiterate our position on acquisitions. Although none are contemplated in our guidance, we are receptive to acquisitions and have spent over $1 billion in the last eight years on acquisitions. An acquisition in our basic business of pharmaceutical distribution or related business would have appeal to us, and we look to stay within our area of core competency. We are in an excellent position for acquisitions, both financially and organizationally.
Now we’ll look at FY '11. We expect to grow our revenues with the market in the 2% to 4% range. We expect operating margin to increase in the low to mid-single-digit basis point range. We expect to continue our share repurchase program in the $400 million range. All of the above we expect will drive our EPS to $2.31 to $2.41, a 7% to 12% increase on top of the extraordinary 28% increase of FY '10, excluding litigation gains. So the dead net is, the strong performance continues. 
Beyond FY '11, I will offer the following perspective with that caveat that is very preliminary. Our FY '12 will feature the largest brand name to generic conversion in the history of the Drug Company, beginning in November 2011, our first fiscal '12 quarter, when LIPITOR and Zyprexa are expected to go generic. The Specialty Group will have tough comparisons due to generics, including introductions that occurred in FY '10 and FY '11, but on balance, we look for FY '12 to be another good year.
Our FY '13 will feature the carryover of the FY '12 generic conversions in the Drug Company, several of which will occur in our fourth or September quarter and the beginning of the benefit from the completion of our Business Transformation program when duplicate IT costs should be eliminated. Our FY '14 will feature positive impacts from BT and the entrance of some $32 million or so, maybe even as many as $40 million, uninsured into the healthcare system as part of the healthcare reform legislation.
It is our opinion that these uninsured will encounter the market with a high demand for pharmaceutical services, which of course, is the most efficient element of healthcare. The new demand created by these newly insured will be a great boost to our FY '14 and carry into our FY '15, both years of which we expect to have solid generic introductions as well. We are hopeful that somewhere along the way, the billions of dollars of research being expended annually by big pharma will yield some exciting new products, and of course, at-risk launches can occur without warning.
The takeaway here is that demand for the products we distribute is strong well into the future, and the ABC circle of life is as relevant today as it was a decade ago. We are comfortable with our 15% long-term EPS growth goal, particularly given our track record of 17% for the last nine years, under conditions that could easily be described as challenging, but the 15% goal for a specific year needs to be mitigated, following extraordinary years like the 28% increase year just reported.
I continue to be very excited about the future role of the pharmaceutical distribution industry and the role that ABC will play in that industry with our drivers of specialty products and generics. I can tell you with experience approaching four decades in the industry, our best years are yet to come.  Here is Mike."

We had a great ending to what was already an incredible year with 14% EPS growth in the fourth quarter despite a tough comparison to our prior year fourth quarter, which grew EPS by 22%.Before I review our quart",2017,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. We had a great ending to what was already an incredible year with 14% EPS growth in the fourth quarter despite a tough comparison to our prior year fourth quarter, which grew EPS by 22%.
Before I review our quarterly results followed by some more commentary on next year's guidance, I would like to take a few minutes to reflect on our full year fiscal 2010 performance and compare that performance to our original expectations for the year. As a reminder, our long-term financial model is based on revenue growth, operating margin expansion and significant cash generation, and we exceeded all of our original fiscal '10 financial targets in these areas.
Our original revenue growth guidance for fiscal 2010 was an above-market 5% to 7%, factoring in the significant new customers we added in fiscal 2009, and we finished the year well above that range with full year revenue growth of 8.6%. We expanded operating margins by a robust 19 basis points, far exceeding our original assumption of flat to low single-digit basis points operating margin expansion. This original assumption reflected headwinds from a significant customer repricing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, as well as incremental ERP spending in fiscal 2010.
While both of these occurred, our actual performance benefited significantly from the at-risk launch of oxaliplatin in the Specialty Group and stronger than expected buy-side performance from both brand name and generic pharmaceuticals, as well as stellar productivity gains in expense control in the Drug Company.
From a historical perspective, our annual operating income exceeded $1 billion for the first time.  On top of our strong operating performance, we once again demonstrated very disciplined working capital management, highlighted by a year-over-year decline in accounts receivable balances despite the robust sales increases, resulting in free cash flow of $924 million for fiscal 2010, far exceeding our original estimate of free cash flow in a range of $500 million to $575 million. That strong free cash flow allowed us to accelerate certain internal projects, raise our dividend by 33% and expand our share repurchase program, where we brought back $470 million of our shares compared to our original $350 million guidance.
All of these factors combined to drive our GAAP diluted earnings per share to $2.22, a 31% increase over diluted EPS from continuing operations in fiscal 2009, and well above our original EPS guidance range for the year of $1.82 to $1.92. Excluding the special benefits we received from litigation gains, fiscal '10 diluted EPS would have been $2.16 or a 28% increase over fiscal '09.
Also, very importantly, we strengthened our already strong balance sheet during the year, received a ratings upgrade, won awards for customer service and implemented the first phase of our ERP-enabled Business Transformation project. Truly, an exceptional all-around year for ABC, and we thank all of our associates who continue to deliver a superior level of customer service every day.
Now moving to our quarterly results and starting with our top line. Revenue increased by 5.3%, with almost 1% of that increase attributed to a large alternate site customer we added in August of 2009. The drug company increased its top line by 6%, benefited by that new customer, as well as by the above-market growth of certain of the Drug Company's largest customers.
The Specialty Group grew 4% in the quarter, once again driven by ASD, our nephrology and blood plasma distributor, and ICS, our third-party logistics company. As Dave mentioned, during the quarter, ICS has discontinued a large 3PL contract that has moved to direct manufacturer distribution. The loss of this $800 million-a-year contract will impact Specialty Revenue growth by about 5% in fiscal 2011 and overall ABC revenue growth by about 1%, but importantly, will only have a minimal net earnings impact.
Gross profit increased by 10% in the quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter in which we achieved double-digit growth. The growth in gross profit this quarter is particularly impressive, as we have now anniversaried the August 2009 oxaliplatin launch, as well as the 2009 new customer additions. Oxaliplatin gross profit contributed $0.04 to the current quarter earnings, exceeding our expectation of $0.03, and was down sequentially and from our prior year quarter levels as anticipated.
Accordingly, most of the quarterly gross profit growth has come from the Drug Company where double-digit generic sales growth, including the impact of new launches and performance under branded fee-for-service agreements, more than offset normal competitive pressures on margins. Our LIFO charge in the quarter was $400,000 compared to a credit of $5.7 million last year. And for the year, our LIFO charge was $30 million compared to a charge of $15 million last year.
Moving to operating expenses. I mentioned last quarter that expenses would increase significantly sequentially between the third and fourth quarters, and that has occurred as expected. Part of that fourth quarter increase, as discussed last quarter, was the commencement in the quarter of duplicate IT infrastructure costs, as a result of our Go-Live with the first phase of our ERP implementation.  We will continue to incur approximately $10 million of duplicate IT cost per quarter, as we fully transition away from our legacy system, which is expected to occur by the end of fiscal '12.
Also contributing to the expense increase in the quarter, we wrote off about $7 million of software costs and incurred $2.5 million of intangible asset impairments. In addition, we incurred quarterly increases in incentive compensation, as well as bad debt expense, which while still higher than average, was down sequentially from last quarter.
Our double-digit growth in gross profit led to an impressive 11% increase in operating profit, and our operating margin of 126 basis points in the quarter increased by six basis points over the prior year period. For the year, once again, our operating margin of 142 basis points increased by an outstanding 19 bps.
Moving below operating income, net interest expense of $18 million in the quarter increased 21%, consistent with prior quarterly trends due to our bond offering earlier in the fiscal year. Our effective income tax rate of 38% in the quarter was in line with last year's rate. Our diluted EPS in the quarter of $0.50 increased by $0.06 or 14% from a year ago. Our EPS growth exceeded our 8.5% increase in net income due to the reduction in average diluted shares outstanding, primarily as a result of our share repurchase program over the last 12 months.  Average diluted outstanding shares in the quarter were just under 284 million, down 4% from last year.
Now let's turn to our cash flow in the balance sheet, where we continue to demonstrate excellent performance. Cash generated from operations in the September quarter was an extremely strong $549 million, bringing our full year cash flow from operations to $1.1 billion. 
Our free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $924 million for the year, well above our increased guidance of $525 million to $600 million, primarily due to better-than-expected working capital management and the year-end timing of payments to manufacturers.  Inventory days on hand averaged 25 days during fiscal 2010, consistent with last year, and average DSO for the year of 17.3 days was down almost a full day compared to 2009. DPOs were up on average by about a half day, reflecting product mix shifts to more generics and timing.
Our gross debt, total debt and capital ratio at the end of September was 31.3%, within our target range of 30% to 35%. We bought $120 million of our shares during the quarter, bringing our full year share repurchases to $470 million, and our board authorized a new $500 million share buyback program in September. And as of the end of our fiscal year, we have $598 million remaining under board-authorized repurchase programs. Our cash balance at the end of September exceeded $1.6 billion, leaving us with great financial flexibility as we enter fiscal 2011.
Now let's turn to our guidance for the coming year. Our fiscal 2011 guidance for diluted earnings per share is a range of $2.31 to $2.41, an increase of 7% to 12% over our fiscal 2010 diluted EPS of $2.16, which excludes our $0.05 benefit from fiscal 2010 litigation gains.  The assumptions behind this guidance includes revenue growth of 2% to 4%, operating margin expansion in the low to mid-single-digit basis point range, and free cash flow in the $625 million to $700 million range, which is in line with our long-term goal of free cash flow approximating net income. Our guidance assumes share repurchases of approximately $400 million, depending, of course, on market conditions.  We would also expect net interest expense to be up to 20% higher in fiscal 2011, as we anticipate fee increases upon renewals of our liquidity facilities and less capitalized interest, now that we are live with our ERP platform.
In addition, we expect our effective income tax rate to be in the 38.4% range, above the 38% we experienced in fiscal 2010, which benefited from certain adjustments, primarily from tax audits. We should also see our capital expenditures decline from the $185 million level back to the $150 million range.
To drill down a little more on our revenue and margin assumptions, we expect the Drug Company to grow with overall market growth, which we believe is in the 3% to 5% range. As we stated last quarter, this assumes the transfer of the Duane Reade business at the end of our first quarter and the expiration of the volume-base long CVS contract at the end of our third fiscal quarter. On the Specialty side, we expect revenue growth to be flat to slightly down, reflecting the 5% impact from the third-party logistics customer I mentioned earlier that is now going direct. In addition, we expect some top line moderation from new generics. 
Importantly, however, we should have significant operating margin expansion in Specialty despite tough comparables, as we expect the impact from generic Gemzar and Taxotere, along with the continued availability of oxaliplatin for at least half of the year, to more than offset the contribution we received from oxaliplatin in fiscal 2010. That contribution was approximately $0.25 of earnings. 
Within the Drug Company, we expect relatively flat operating margins as positive product mix trends should offset the incremental IT expenses discussed earlier. It's important to note that even with the incremental IT expenses, total operating expense growth for ABC as a whole should be less than revenue growth, as we expect continued productivity gains in our distribution network.  The Packaging Group, while very small to ABC at less than 1/2 of 1% of total revenue, is expected to grow earnings in double digits on top of the 30% earnings growth they experienced in fiscal 2010.
As a reminder, we generally do not give quarterly guidance due to the inherent variability in our business on a quarterly basis. However, remember that our fiscal 2010 first quarter EPS was up a phenomenal 44% due to an unusually large benefit from generic introductions, most notably, oxaliplatin. Accordingly, looking forward to fiscal '11, the December quarter is expected to be our toughest quarterly comparison, even with the planned mid-November launch of the two new specialty generic products, which we believe will have a limited impact on our first fiscal quarter results as our customers transition from their brand agreements.
Taking all of this into account, we would expect our first fiscal quarter results to be in line with those from last December.  I know that we've covered a lot of information, but let me summarize by once again reiterating that we had a solid quarter, which finished an incredible year with over 30% EPS growth, and our momentum going into fiscal 2011 remains very strong. And despite tough comparisons to fiscal 2010, especially in the first quarter, we expect a solid year once again.
Now let me turn it over to Barbara Brungess, our new Vice President of Corporate Investor and Investor Relations for Q&A."

I would expect total spend in '11 to drop down probably to the $80 million to $90 million range, which again includes that $30 million to $40 million of expense.

going to be the death knell for the wholesaler and maybe the retailer and anyone who their products, and we know how that story ends. In fact, we're living out the story right now.

As you probably know from our press release this morning, ABC had a strong fourth fiscal quarter ending in September that completed a record fiscal year that was extraordinary by almost any standard. Mike will",1890," Good morning, and thank you for joining us. As you probably know from our press release this morning, ABC had a strong fourth fiscal quarter ending in September that completed a record fiscal year that was extraordinary by almost any standard. Mike will drill down on the details, but let me note the fiscal year highlights.
 Revenues increased over 8% to $78 billion. Gross margin increased by 11%, while expenses increased 3%, driving operating margins up for the fifth consecutive year this year by a strong 19 basis points. We crossed the $1 billion threshold of pretax earnings for the first time.
 EPS was up a whopping 28%, excluding litigation benefits. We generated over $1 billion of cash in the year, and we did all this while we invest in our future by beginning the implementation of business transformation, our SAP-enhanced ERP system that when completed, will meet the future needs of our customers and suppliers for years to come.  This year's performance was delivered on top of last year's 17% increase in EPS. Our compounded EPS growth since the company was created in 2001 is also 17%.
 Strong performance in our September quarter speaks to the momentum we carry into our new fiscal year that began October 1. Our fourth quarter ending in September was a strong quarter in a series of strong quarters. Revenues increased $1 billion and over 5% to $19.7 billion. Gross profit increased over 10%, as we continue to benefit from our generic programs in both our Growth Company and Specialty Group.
 Our DSOs were down one day versus last year's 17 days. We are reporting a lot of strong performance metrics this quarter and year, and our DSO performance is one of the most powerful, because it speaks volumes about the strength of our customer base and the satisfaction of our customers with our total service and program package.  So lots to like about the year and the quarter in a series of strong quarters and fiscal years. The standby for ABC would be great performance in a resilient industry with positive momentum going into FY '11, driven by a solid customer mix featuring generics and specialty.
 Before I address some company specifics, a few industry insights. First, U.S. pharmaceutical industry revenue growth. The IMS forecast of 3% to 5% for calendar 2010 and 2011 seems to be in the right zip code to us.  Next, competitive pricing environment within our industry. I would continue to describe the environment as competitive but stable, with few billion dollar pieces of business in play in the next 12 months or so and a few pieces of business this size changing wholesalers historically.  We continue to spend significant time and effort in Washington looking after the interest of our customers and shareholder. And like all of you, we'll be closely watching today's election results.
 Now a little closer look at ABC. Among the big news items at ABC this quarter is that we went live with what we refer to as build one of our business transformation process that includes an eventual total conversion to SAP among other things. Build one includes our back-office functions for the  Growth Company and corporate. We expect to begin the next phase of business transformation, which we call build two, in the spring and this will entail converting each of the drug company distribution centers to the new system one by one.
 When completed, our BT implementation will provide us with insights, flexibility and operating efficiency, which will differentiate our offer to our current and potential customers and meet or exceed their information technology need for years to come.  It is important to note that during the phase-in period of business transformation, we will be operating two systems, both SAP and our legacy IT system, putting some pressure on cost containment efforts. The very good news is that when completed, we will get relief from the dual system expenses and have a state-of-the-art ERP system.  Our investment in business transformation is an important investment in our future just like our investment in new distribution centers several years ago that is now helping to drive down our operating cost.
 Another noteworthy news items for the company is that our growth company's Good Neighbor Pharmacy, our franchise-like retail program of over 3,700 independent and regional chain customers, received the highest ranking in customer satisfaction for chain store pharmacies by J.D. Power and Associates. The fact that Good Neighbor Pharmacy is recognized as a chain is a powerful statement of the role of independence in the health channel, and noteworthy that two other networks of independent pharmacies ranked higher than the national warehousing chains.  The GNP recognition is strong testimony that ABC is doing business with the right customers and providing them with the right tools.
 And with the drug company, the drug company has now anniversaried all the significant new business captured over the last year that accounted in part for a 10% revenue increase in FY '10. The revenue growth of 6% in the drug company this quarter includes about 1% from a large customer that began with us a year ago, August. The drug company had a very strong generic quarter again, with generics outpacing total revenue growth by a large margin.
 Our Specialty Group continues to set the standard of specialty distribution within the industry, with over $16 billion of annual revenue, about half of that in oncology products to oncologists, where we are rolling out our new suite of clinical and commercial solutions to oncologists called Nucleus. Our Nucleus solution is the most comprehensive commercial and clinical program in the market and features, among other elements, a new fully integrated dispensing cabinet. While the top line in oncology supply has been negatively impacted by generics, most notably oxaliplatin, generic Eloxatin. The bottom line has been very positively impacted.
 Though we are usually uncomfortable talking about specific item inventory levels, we have made an exception with oxaliplatin due to the magnitude of its impact. And as noted and consistent with our remarks last quarter, we currently have enough oxaliplatin on hand to meet the expected demand of our customers through March 2011, that is to our second fiscal quarter of FY '11.
 ASD, our blood plasma, nephrology and vaccine distributor had another strong quarter, benefiting from the early shipments of flu vaccine this quarter as the Besse Medical. ICS, our third-party logistics provider, also had a strong quarter. ICS discontinued serving U.S. oncology on a third-party logistics contract that moved to direct manufacturer distribution effective two months ago in September. While having a minimal impact on the bottom line of the Specialty Group and ABC, annual revenues will be impacted by about $800 million beginning October 1.
 It is important to remember this third-party logistic company loss when evaluating our year-over-year Specialty Group revenues and to remember that the lost revenues have not occurred in our mainstream distribution business of oncology supply, ASD and Besse Medical, and do not represent a loss of market share. It is important to note that only one customer does more than 10% of our total revenue, and after that one customer, the next largest is in the 5% range of total revenues. Our current revenues reflect the strength of our diversified customer base.
 So before I address our guidance for FY '11, let me recap FY '10, a very strong year, following a series of strong years, reflecting growth that continues to be a characteristic of ABC. EPS is up 28%, not including the gain from litigation, driven by Generics and Specialty, operating margin expansion, with cash generation outpacing after-tax earnings. For the past nine years, that is the entire history of AmerisourceBergen, our compound EPS growth rate of 17% is 20% for the last five years and 24% for the last three years.
 With our strong cash position, let me reiterate our position on acquisitions. Although none are contemplated in our guidance, we are receptive to acquisitions, and have spent over $1 billion in the last eight years on acquisitions. And acquisition and our basic business of pharmaceutical distribution or related business would have appealed to us, and we look to stay within our area of core competency.  We are in an excellent position for acquisitions, both financially and organizationally.
 Now we look at FY '11. We expect to grow our revenues with the market in the 2% to 4% range. We expect operating margin to increase in the low to mid-single-digit basis point range. We expect to continue our share repurchase program in the $400 million range. All of the above, we expect will drive our EPS to $2.31 to $2.41, a 7% to 12% increase on top of the extraordinary 28% increase in FY '10, excluding litigation gains. So the dead end is a strong performance continues.
 Beyond FY '11, I will offer the following perspective with a caveat that is very preliminary. Our FY '12 will feature the largest brand name to generic conversion in the history of the drug company. Beginning in November 2011, our first fiscal '12 quarter, when LIPITOR and Zyprexa are expected to go generic. The Specialty Group will have tough comparisons due to generics, including introductions that occurred in FY '10 and FY '11, but on balance, we look for FY '12 to be another good year.
 Our FY '13 will feature the carryover of the FY '12 generic conversions in the drug company, several of which will occur in our fourth or September quarter and the beginning of the benefit from the completion of our business transformation program when duplicate IT cost should be eliminated. Our FY '14 will feature positive impacts from BT and the entrants of some $32 million or so, maybe even as many as $40 million uninsured into the healthcare system as part of the healthcare reform legislation.
 It is our opinion that these uninsured will account in the market with a high demand for pharmaceutical services, which of course, is the most efficient element of healthcare. The new demand created by these newly insured will be a great boost to our FY '14 and carry into our FY '15, both years of which we expect to have solid generic introductions as well.  We are hopeful that somewhere along the way, the billions of dollars of research being expended annually by big pharma will yield some exciting new products and of course, at-risk launches can occur without warning.
 The takeaway here is that demand for the products we distribute is strong, well into the future and the ABC circle of life is as relevant today as it was a decade ago. We are comfortable with our 15% long-term EPS growth goal, particularly given our track record of 17% for the last nine years, under conditions that could easily be described as challenging, but the 15% goal for a specific year needs to be mitigated, following extraordinary years like the 28% increase year just reported.
 I continue to be very excited about the future role of the pharmaceutical distribution industry and the role that ABC will play in that industry with our drivers of specialty products and generics. I can tell you with the experience approaching four decades in the industry, our best years are yet to come.  Here is Mike.

24809,114307930,86576,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives"," Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone.

We had a great ending to what was already an incredible year with 14% EPS growth in the fourth quarter despite a tough comparison to our prior year fourth quarter, which grew EPS by 22%.
 Before I review our quarterly results followed by some more commentary on next year's guidance, I would like to take a few minutes to reflect on our full year fiscal 2010 performance and compare that performance to our original expectations for the year. As a reminder, our long-term financial model is based on revenue growth, operating margin expansion and significant cash generation, and we exceeded all of our original fiscal '10 financial targets in these areas.
 Our original revenue growth guidance for fiscal 2010 was in above market 5% to 7%, factoring in the significant new customers we added in fiscal 2009, and we finished the year well above that range with full year revenue growth of 8.6%. We expanded operating margins by a robust 19 basis points, far exceeding our original assumption of flat to low single-digit basis points operating margin expansion. This original assumption reflected headwinds from a significant customer repricing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, as well as incremental ERP spending in fiscal 2010.
 While both of these occurred, our actual performance benefited significantly from the at-risk launch of oxaliplatin in the Specialty Group and stronger than expected by-side performance from both brand name and generic pharmaceuticals, as well as stellar productivity gains in expense control in the drug company.
 From a historical perspective, our annual operating income exceeded $1 billion for the first time.  On top of our strong operating performance, we once again demonstrated very disciplined working capital management, highlighted by a year-over-year decline in accounts receivable balances despite the robust sales increases, resulting in free cash flow of $924 million for fiscal 2010, far exceeding our original estimate of free cash flow in a range of $500 million to $575 million. That strong free cash flow allowed us to accelerate certain internal projects, raise our dividend by 33% and expand our share repurchase program, where we brought back $470 million of our shares compared to our original $350 million guidance.
 All of these factors, combined to drive our GAAP diluted earnings per share to $2.22, a 31% increase over diluted EPS from continuing operations in fiscal 2009, and well above our original EPS guidance range for the year of $1.82 to $1.92. Excluding the special benefits we received from litigation gains, fiscal '10 diluted EPS would have been $2.16 or a 28% increase over fiscal '09.
 Also, very importantly, we strengthened our already strong balance sheet during the year, received the ratings upgrade, won awards for customer service and implemented the first phase of our ERP-enabled business transformation project. Truly, an exceptional all-around year for ABC, and we thank all of our associates who continue to deliver a superior level of customer service everyday.
 Now moving to our quarterly results and starting with our top line. Revenue increased by 5.3%, with almost 1% of that increase attributed to a large alternate site customer we added in August of 2009. The drug company increased its top line by 6%, benefited by that new customer, as well as by the above-market growth of certain of the drug company's largest customers.
 The Specialty Group grew 4% in the quarter, once again, driven by AST, our nephrology and blood plasma distributor and ICS, our third-party logistics company. As Dave mentioned, during the quarter, ICS has discontinued a large three PL contract that has moved to direct manufacturer distribution. The loss of this $800 million a year contract will impact Specialty Revenue growth by about 5% in fiscal 2011 and overall ABC revenue growth by about 1%. But importantly, we'll only have a minimal net earnings impact.
 Gross profit increased by 10% in the quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter in which we achieved double-digit growth. The growth in gross profit this quarter is particularly impressive, as we have now anniversaried the August 2009 oxaliplatin launch, as well as the 2009 new customer additions. Oxaliplatin gross profit contributed $0.04 to the current quarter earnings, exceeding our expectation of $0.03 and was down sequentially and from our prior year quarter levels as anticipated.
 Accordingly, most of the quarterly gross profit growth has come from the drug company were double-digit generic sales growth, including the impact of new launches and performance under branded fee-for-service agreements, more than offset normal competitive pressures on margin. Our LIFO charge in the quarter was $400,000 compared to a credit of $5.7 million last year. And for the year, our LIFO charge was $30 million compared to a charge of $15 million last year.
 Moving to operating expenses. I mentioned last quarter that expenses would increase significantly sequentially between the third and fourth quarters, and that has occurred as expected. Part of that fourth quarter increase as discussed last quarter was the commencement in the quarter of duplicate IT infrastructure cost, as a result of our Go-Live with the first phase of our ERP implementation.  We will continue to incur approximately $10 million of duplicate IT cost per quarter, as we fully transition away from our legacy system, which is expected to occur by the end of fiscal '12.
 Also contributing to the expense increase in the quarter, we wrote off about $7 million of software cost and incurred $2.5 million of intangible asset impairments. In addition, we incurred quarterly increases in incentive compensation, as well as bad debt expense, which while still higher than average, was down sequentially from last quarter.
 Our double-digit growth in gross profit led to an impressive 11% increase in operating profit, and our operating margin of 126 basis points in the quarter increased by six basis points over the prior year period. For the year, once again, our operating margin of 142 basis points increased by an outstanding 19 bps.
 Moving below operating income, net interest expense of $18 million in the quarter increased to 21%, consistent with prior quarterly trends due to our bond offering earlier in the fiscal year. Our effective income tax rate of 38% in the quarter was in line with last year's rate. Our diluted EPS in the quarter of $0.50 increased by $0.06 or 14% from a year ago. Our EPS growth exceeded our 8.5% increase in net income due to the reduction in average diluted shares outstanding, primarily as a result of our share repurchase program over the last 12 months.  Average diluted outstanding shares in the quarter were just under 284 million, down 4% from last year.
 Now let's turn to our cash flow in the balance sheet, where we continue to demonstrate excellent performance. Cash generated from operations in the September quarter was an extremely strong $549 million, bringing our full year cash flow from operations to $1.1 billion.
 Our free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $924 million for the year, well above our increased guidance of $525 million to $600 million, primarily due to better-than-expected working capital management and the year-end timing of payments to manufacturers.  Inventory days on hand averaged 25 days during fiscal 2010, consistent with last year, and average DSO for the year of 17.3 days was down almost a full day compared to 2009. DPOs were up on average but about a half day, reflecting product mix shifts to more generics and timing.
 Our gross total debt and capital ratio at the end of September was 31.3%, within our target range of 30% to 35%. We bought $120 million of our shares during the quarter, bringing our full year share repurchases to $470 million, and our board authorized a new $500 million share buyback program in September. And as of the end of our fiscal year, we have $598 million remaining under board-authorized repurchase programs. Our cash balance at the end of September exceeded $1.6 billion, leaving us with great financial flexibility as we enter fiscal 2011.
 Now let's turn to our guidance for the coming year. Our fiscal 2011 guidance for diluted earnings per share is a range of $2.31 to $2.41, an increase of 7% to 12% over our fiscal 2010 diluted EPS of $2.16, which excludes our $0.05 benefit from fiscal 2010 litigation gains.  The assumptions behind this guidance includes revenue growth of 2% to 4%, operating margin expansion in the low to mid-single-digit basis point range, and free cash flow in the $625 million to $700 million range, which is in line with our long-term goal of free cash flow approximating net income. Our guidance assume share repurchases of approximately $400 million depending, of course, on market conditions.  We would also expect net interest expense to be up to 20% higher in fiscal 2011, as we anticipate fee increases upon renewals of our liquidity facilities and less capitalized interest, now that we are live with our ERP platform.
 In addition, we expect our effective income tax rate to be in the 38.4% range, above the 38% we experienced in fiscal 2010, which benefited from certain adjustments, primarily from tax audits. We should also see our capital expenditures decline from the $185 million level back to the $150 million range.
 To drill down a little more on our revenue and margin assumptions, we expect the drug company to grow with overall market growth, which we believe is in the 3% to 5% range. As we stated last quarter, this assumes the transfer of the Duane Reade business at the end of our first quarter and the expiration of the volume-base along the CVS contract at the end of our third fiscal quarter. On the specialty side, we expect revenue growth to be flat to slightly down, reflecting the 5% impact from the third-party logistics customer I mentioned earlier that is now going direct. In addition, we expect some top line moderation from new generics.
 Importantly, however, we should have significant operating margin expansion in specialty despite tough comparables, as we expect the impact from generic Gemzar and Taxotere, along with the continued availability of oxaliplatin for at least half of the year to more than offset the contribution we received from oxaliplatin in fiscal 2010. That contribution was approximately $0.25 of earnings.
 Within the drug company, we expect relatively flat operating margins as positive product mix trends should offset the incremental IT expenses discussed earlier. It's important to note that even with the incremental IT expenses, total operating expense growth for ABC as a whole should be less than revenue growth, as we expect continued productivity gains in our distribution network.  The Packaging Group, while very small to ABC at less than 1/2 of 1% of total revenue, is expected to grow earnings in double digits on top of the 30% earnings growth they experienced in fiscal 2010.
 As a reminder, we generally do not give quarterly guidance due to the inherent variability in our business on a quarterly basis. However, remember that our fiscal 2010 first quarter EPS was up a phenomenal 44% due to an unusually large benefit from generic introductions, most notably, oxaliplatin. Accordingly, looking forward to fiscal '11, the December quarter is expected to be our toughest quarterly comparison, even with the planned mid-November launch of the two new specialty generic products, which we believe will have a limited impact on our first fiscal quarter results as our customers transition from their brand agreements.
 Taking all of this into account, we would expect our first fiscal quarter results to be in line with those from last December.  I know that we've covered a lot of information, but let me summarize by once again reiterating that we had a solid quarter, which finished an incredible year with over 30% EPS growth, and our momentum going into fiscal 2011 remains very strong. And despite tough comparisons to fiscal 2010, especially in the first quarter, we expect a solid year once again.
 Now let me turn it over to Barbara Brungess, our new Vice President of Corporate Investor and Investor Relations for Q&A.

As I mentioned, it was $0.04, and we expect that range to continue for the next couple of quarters. And then in combination with the atmosphere is solidifying some amongst the other generic introductions, I think we're confident that we should have a slight increase over the contribution we received in fiscal '10 for oxy.

And from an expense standpoint, we expect to have project expenses in the $30 million to $40 million range in fiscal '11, and that's very much consistent with fiscal '10. Total spending, however, I would expect to be down in 2011. 2010 was really our peak year for capital spending, where we, in total, spend over $120 million, including the expense. I would expect total spend in '11 to drop down probably to the $80 million to $90 million range, which again, includes that $30 million to $40 million of expense. And then just to distinguish that from the duplicate IT infrastructure cost, that simply the cost of having two systems live essentially for the next two fiscal years, 2011 and 2012. And in total, that's going to be about $10 million a quarter of duplicate cost that should go away as we enter fiscal '13. So we should have both the duplicate cost go away, as well as the project expenses. And as Dave said, be left with a very state-of-the-art system that's going to serve us and our customers very well.

I guess it's fair to say, when you guys have run businesses outside your core competency for America, Bridge Medical, I can't say that the results have been spectacular. And then on the other hand, it appears to me like there's a scarcity of good maybe supply chain opportunities. So how do you square that circle?

You're right. We have not done very well outside our core competency, and that's why this management team doesn't feel very comfortable going far field and wanted to just focus on our core competency. The way we've kind of just growing it in the past is by simply returning money to our shareholders by buying our share stock and increasing our dividend. And we only do that in the absence of having the opportunity to make acquisitions or invest within our own business, with capital projects and the like, but we will continue to not be tempted to go far field. Now we think the countryside is littered with people who do one thing well and think they can do a lot of things well. So we're going to stay within our core competencies as we go forward. And if we don't have the properties don't show up, John, that we think are attractive, we'll do as we did this year with a lack of acquisitions, and that is we'll buy our shares back and reexamine our dividend.

But again, we're very comfortable with the space we've got, which is providing programs and services to that oncologist, the provider.

It's out there, two, three years, or even longer. We think it represents a great opportunity for us here because of the large marketshare we have in the specialty space. And that it may very well, represent the same kind of opportunity for us the generics represented some years ago. For those of you who followed the industry for a long time, you may recall that when generics came in the market, there was a large -- the focus is going to be definitely for the wholesale and maybe the retailer and anyone who touched products, and we know that story ends. In fact, we're living up the story right now. It's a great story to participate in. Generics have been very, very attractive to us. And we think the same thing will happen as biosimilars or whatever they are called, enter the market, and then a large marketshare will benefit it. Whatever happens with those products, they're still going to need the kinds of services and the distribution capability that we bring to the party. And in fact, they made need it in an intensified fashion, because they may be unfamiliar with the marketing. So they may have a great appetite for the services that we provide, not only in our traditional Specialty business, but also with the people like Lash, who have a very large reimbursement counseling business, our extended business which helps with REMS-type evaluations and the like. So it's one of the things that makes our business attractive. And why we think that specialty space is still important for us to have a very large marketshare, going forward, because we do think there's a lot of opportunities coming down the road.
