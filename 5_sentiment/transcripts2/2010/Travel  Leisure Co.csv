Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on this snowy Wednesday morning in Northern New Jersey. As you saw from our press release, we had another great quarter, and overall, a terrific year despite the tough economy. We continue to demonstrate strong execution against our strategic initiatives and delivered fourth quarter EPS of $0.40, compared with guidance of $0.35 to $0.38. Our full year adjusted EBITDA of $830 million was also ahead of our guidance.Today, I will talk with you about our 2009 achievements, our exciting plans for 2010 and some major decisions we've made regarding how we'll deploy free cash flow going forward. Then, Tom Conforti will review results and walk you through 2010 guidance. Overall, we see some signs that the economic and operating environments are stabilizing. Like others, we are seeing improvement in the Upper Upscale segment with Wyndham brand same-store managed portfolio RevPAR  in the U.S. up over 12% in January. At the same time, unemployment in the U.S. combined with ongoing consumer concerns about the economy continued to pressure consumer spending and RevPAR  in our primary economy in Midscale Industry segments.The Lower Price segments were not impacted as much during the downturn and will probably follow the Upper segment out of the recovery. However, we're confident that our resilient business model, our proven ability to execute and our growing free cash flow position us well strategically and financially for 2010 and beyond. We continue to make great progress in transforming our businesses to maximize free cash flow. In 2009, consistent with our strategic decision to cap the size of our Traditional Timeshare business, we reduced inventory spend and reduced receivables in this business. These actions combined with other cost-control efforts drove free cash flow of $541 million in 2009, a turnaround of over $600 million from 2008.For 2010, we've also introduced additional disciplined balance sheet reviews into our budgeting and forecasting process, and a balance sheet efficiency component into our executive compensation programs. This will help maintain our focus on maximizing free cash flow across the organization.  Our transformation positions the company well for future growth, profitability and cash flow. We expect sustainable annual free cash flow of $500 million to $600 million in the coming years, and we are committed to deploying the cash flow to drive shareholder value.We expect to reinvest the portion of our free cash flow in our Fee-for-service businesses when he we have opportunities that are attractive from a strategic and financial perspective. We also intend to return a greater portion of it to our shareholders to increase dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. In fact, we made two significant announcements today that address our capital allocation plans.First, we've tripled the dividend, which puts us at a payout ratio of approximately 30% and a current yield of approximately 2%. This decision demonstrates our strong confidence in our business prospects, as well as the sustainability of our free cash flow going forward. We expect to generate over $2.5 billion in free cash flow over the next five years, which enables us to make this commitment now while maintaining a sharp focus on our credit metrics in continuing to strengthen and grow our businesses. Tom will walk you through our dividend policy shortly. Second, we intend to resume our share repurchase program on an opportunistic basis. We have $157 million remaining under our current authorization. Now let me take you through some of the highlights of our strategic initiatives and results. As a reminder, our mission is to be the leader in travel accommodation, welcoming our guests to iconic brands and vacation destinations through our signature Count On Me! service. And of course, our primary objective as a public company is to increase shareholder value.Our key strategies to support these goals are to increase market share by delivering excellent service, grow cash flow and operating margins through superior execution and emphasize our Fee-for-service business models, which accounted for 65% of our EBITDA in 2009. I'll start with Wyndham Exchange and Rental, which increased adjusted EBITDA by 9% excluding the net effects of foreign currency in 2009. Our team's superbly executed their business plan, demonstrating their technology and marketing leadership across the global exchange business in expanding our vacation rental brands while growing operating margin.The exchange side of the business, RCI, culminated a fantastic year with an annual affiliate meeting last month in New York City, which drew record attendance. The theme of the event was the innovative value-added services we provide. RCI continues to dominate on the technology front, providing new functionality not only through its 3.8 million members, but also through its over 4,000 affiliated resorts. For example, RCI.com is now available to our club affiliates as a transparent online booking tool. So for example, Hilton Grand Vacation Club owners can book within the Hilton Club or transact in RCI exchange, all through our portal. Developer affiliates using this new web interface have achieved significant gains in online transaction penetration rate in a matter of months.On the consumer front, we successfully completed a significant RCI.com upgrade in November, which expanded our cutting-edge and enhanced search technology to our over 1 million points members, giving them complete and easy access to the tremendous breadth and depth of our global portfolio. We also initiated automatic electronic status updates on pending requests, which historically have accounted for approximately 12% of our call volume. Our efforts to date have resulted in 24% penetration of online transactions in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with 13% in 2008, and resulted in $5 million of sustainable costs center savings throughout 2009.Our European Rental businesses delivered solid results despite the difficult economic environment. These businesses demonstrated strong resiliency during this downturn as leisure travelers throughout Europe remain committed to their vacations. Our U.K. Cottage Rental business had an especially stellar year, aided in part by a weak pound sterling, resulting in increased domestic travel. This business annually serves over 1 million leisure travelers through exclusive listings of 17,000 rental properties.Excluding the net effect of foreign currency, revenue increased by 5% and contribution margin increased by over 30% compared with 2008. Ongoing investment in e-commerce is also yielding results. In 2009, 73% of bookings were made online, up from 59% in 2008, supported in part by a 21% increase in Google clickthrough rates. Additionally, the U.K. Cottage Rental business reduced marketing costs by applying enhanced analytics to the 4 million customers in our database, as well as focusing efforts on the most effective marketing channels, resulting in higher marketing conversion rates.We have a scalable, efficient infrastructure supporting these two great business models, vacation exchange and vacation rentals. We completed restructuring and other cost-savings initiatives in 2009 that eliminated over $50 million annually in costs. We focused primarily on increasing efficiency rather than eliminating headcount, resulting in sustainable cost savings and better-run businesses, which will support margin expansion in future years.Moving to the Hotel Group, we believe that strong well-supported brands and increasing reservation contribution are paramount to our ability to retain and attract new franchisees. As I said earlier, historically, the Economy and Midscale segments compared to Higher-end segments have been more resilient during economic downturns and exhibited slower recovery. So we'll use what we believe will be a transition year to heighten our focus on executing on the blocking and tackling in this business. We are launching a series of strategic initiatives with the goal of strengthening our brands and delivering a reservation experience that maximizes value for both franchisees and consumers. Our efforts will focus on the following areas: First, we will drive bookings through online channels by improving consumer shopping experience on our brand websites, by enhancing connectivity to online travel agents and by increasing product exposure on OTAs websites. Next, we'll increase occupancy and allow for better pricing opportunities by ensuring all our rate plans are consistently available across all channels and by equipping franchisees with more competitive rate information to enable them to make better rate setting decisions, and we will continue to invest in our international platform with a keen focus on priority markets.We expect the multi-wave implementation effort on these and other strategic initiatives over the next few years as we continue to build capabilities that enable future growth. We continue to make great progress on building the Wyndham brand also. We opened over 2,000 Wyndham rooms in the fourth quarter and nearly 4,200 rooms during the year. The majority of which were international with approximately 1,200 rooms in China, including the Wyndham Grand Plaza Royale in Hangzhou, 1,000 rooms in Mexico including four oceanfront properties and 225 rooms at the Wyndham Apollo Hotel Amsterdam. On the domestic front, we opened the 255-room Graves 601 Hotel, Wyndham Grand, which is the largest upscale meeting facility in downtown Minneapolis and has earned numerous accolades. Wyndham Vacation Ownership had another solid quarter, wrapping up a year of transformation for that business, reducing the size of our business from $2 billion in Vacation Ownership sales to $1.3 billion while maintaining high levels of business momentum. We're in the process of transforming this business to move from a growth orientation to a dramatically improved cash flow and return profile. And we're seeing great success. We reduced our inventory spend from $414 million in 2008 to $189 million in 2009. Cash down payments for the quarter were 22%, up from 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, for the full year, we reduced the percentage of sales financed from 66% in 2008 to 55% in 2009. In addition, FICO scores for the full year 2009 were 724 compared with 694 in 2008.We are also making great progress on our alternative business model for timeshare. With product in Myrtle Beach now registered under our Asset Affiliation Model, we expect to begin sales this month. While we remain in the early planning phases for this offering, we are confident this will be a very successful model going forward. Overall, we believe there is plenty of product available with over 5,000 units in our deal pipeline. To take full advantage of the opportunity, we are exploring various programmatic approaches for this business. And finally, for Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which had a great quarter, we started the year strong as well. And on January 26 of this year, we hosted the grand opening of Wyndham Vacation Resorts at National Harbor, our newest resort located in the heart of National Harbor and just minutes from the snow-covered nation's capital. This is our second property in the market joining Wyndham Old Town Alexandria, which opened in 1999 and remains one of the most popular resorts in our portfolio. This resort will cater to the growing travel trend among timeshare owners to visit major metropolitan centers, and is just one more way we're keeping ahead of the curve for those looking to get maximum value for the vacation dollars.In summary, I'm pleased with our results, strong balance sheet and enhanced cash flow. Tripling the dividend and resuming our share repurchase program reflect our confidence in our ability to continue to execute and to deliver significant returns to shareholders now and in years to come. And now I'll turn the call over to Tom to go through our results and guidance in more detail. Tom?"
31063165,97509281,52727,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb-10-2010",2010-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Steve.

I'll walk you through the details of the quarter, talk about 2010 guidance and cover some additional topics.Company-wide revenues, which included a $46 million roll-in of previously-deferred sales related to the percentage-of-completion accounting were flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. As Steve noted, we exceeded our EPS guidance for the quarter and our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year.The company's balance sheet is in great shape. We had approximately $870 million of capacity on the corporate revolver at the end of the year, compared with approximately $290 million at the end of 2008. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio as defined by the rating agencies is at 3.1x. We have no significant near-term maturities, and we have significant room under our covenants. Overall, we believe we have an investment-grade profile. Cash from operations was approximately $690 million in 2009, compared to just $109 million in 2008, resulting in a breakthrough year in the company's generation of free cash flow, which we define as cash from operations less CapEx and hotel development advances. With the free cash flow turnaround of over $600 million, our results were transformational. Based on these results, as Steve noted, our Board of Directors has authorized a threefold increase in the dividend, and we will resume our share repurchase program. These decisions were based on our belief that the company will sustainably deliver $500 million to $600 million in free cash flow well into the future, that our current capital structure is an investment-grade profile and that we have sufficient flexibility to make value-enhancing investments in our Fee-for-service businesses. Our dividend payout is now about 30% with a yield of approximately 2% at our current stock price. When we came out of the box with the increase, we wanted to target a 2% dividend yield. Going forward, our dividend policy will be to at least mirror the rate of growth of our business. In addition on share repurchase, we are reactivating our current authorization with the balance of $157 million.Now moving to segment performance beginning with Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, it once again delivered excellent results, ending the year ahead of our guidance. For the quarter, excluding the net effect of foreign currency, revenue and adjusted EBITDA were flat. On a similar full year basis, adjusted margins increased almost 300 basis points to 28%, reflecting resilient top-line performance in a difficult economic environment, efficiencies from our migration to the Web and cost-reduction efforts associated with streamlining our organization, a remarkable achievement given the economic conditions over the last 12 months.Exchange revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 was up 2% on a constant-currency basis. Member growth was up 2%, reflecting in part the addition of the Disney Vacation Club earlier this year. Fourth quarter 2009 annual dues and exchange revenue per member in constant currency was consistent with the fourth quarter of 2008, reflecting higher transaction fees for call center transaction, offset by lower exchange transactions.Vacation rental revenues in the fourth quarter were up 2% on a constant-currency basis. Transaction volume was relatively flat, reflecting higher volumes at our Landal GreenParks in Holland and our U.K. Cottage Rentals business, offset by fewer vacation rentals by our RCI members. In constant currency, average net price per rental was up 3% in the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily reflecting mix from higher volume at Landal GreenParks. Ancillary revenues in the fourth quarter were $30 million, a 17% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2008, due primarily to lower fees generated from programs with affiliated resorts and our termination of low-margin travel service contract.As part of my ongoing education with the company, I recently had the opportunity to visit three of our European Rental businesses. I was impressed with the energy, enthusiasm and focus of the teams, as well as their well-thought-out growth plans. These are excellent businesses with a great consumer base. They operate, for the most part, on a fee-for-service model. I was also impressed by the quality of the rental properties in the parks. As Steve noted, 2009 proved the resiliency of European vacation rentals in a difficult economic environment, and the Cottage businesses are scalable with no additional CapEx requirements. We believe there is great exportability of this model throughout Europe.At Wyndham Hotel Group, revenues and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter were down 12% and 41%, respectively, due in part to expected industry-wide RevPAR  declines and lower other franchise fees. In addition, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $6 million related to a joint venture that manages international four- and five-star properties, which have been hit hard by the global economic downturn, affecting profitability estimates. Now this charge was not contemplated in our most recent guidance.We also recorded incremental bad debt expense in the quarter of approximately $6 million, principally related to three properties in our managed portfolio, which experienced occupancy declines similar to the rest of the industry. Now please note, these managed properties comprise less than 2% of our systems portfolio in total. And as Steve noted, RevPAR significantly improved at our managed properties in January. Overall, we're beginning to see less stress across the entire system. We lost only two franchise properties to foreclosure in 2010, January of 2010, compared with nine franchise properties in January of 2009. Domestic RevPAR decreased 14% from a year ago. Worldwide and international RevPAR declined 13% and 15%, respectively, in constant currency. Our Days Inn and Super 8 brands continue to outperform the Economy segment, primarily due to stronger pricing than the competition. It's encouraging that these brands, which account for over 50% of our rooms, had held rate above their segment. In addition, while a small piece of our business, advance bookings do signal that rate continues to hold, all of which provides a strong base for outperformance when occupancy returns. Internationally, we are seeing some signs of industry improvement. Fourth quarter RevPAR was down only 1.6% in China. In Mexico, in constant currency, fourth quarter RevPAR  increased 3% for the Wyndham brand and 2.2% for all brands.Exhibiting great momentum in a difficult environment, we ended the quarter with approximately 597,700 rooms worldwide, opening over 46,000 rooms in the year but terminating for 41,000 rooms. Now our ability to reach our long-term room growth rate of 2% to 4% requires that we make retaining the right rooms a top priority. The strategies Steve mentioned earlier address this objective.Now moving to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. Revenues in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter were up 3% and 45%, respectively. Our results reflect the benefit of a roll-in of percentage-of-completion deferred revenue, continued efficiencies in sales and marketing which I'll discuss in a moment, and a decline in the provision for loan loss as signs of some stability appear.Gross VOI revenues exceeded our expectations again in the fourth quarter. Sales efficiencies were once up again significantly, reflecting the resizing of our business with volume per guest of over 36% from the fourth quarter of 2008 and up over 22% for the year compared to 2008. Close rates remain strong, and transaction sizes in pricing remained stable.On the consumer financing front, we saw a significant improvement in write-offs in the fourth quarter, which were 3% relative to the overall portfolio, down from 3.3% at the end of Q4 of 2008. Accordingly, the provision for loan loss was $103 million or 26% of VOI sales, down from 31% on a similar basis from the fourth quarter of 2008. The securitizations continued to perform within their expected tolerances. And overall, we continue to see good trends in the portfolio as delinquency and default rates are improving.Now let's turn to 2010 guidance. Note that we'll post the guidance to the Investor Relations portion of our website immediately following the call. We are maintaining our previous guidance for 2010 revenue and EBITDA and free cash flow for the company. Let's look at each business unit.Starting with Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. Drivers are generally flat, reflecting continued economic uncertainty in the U.S. and Europe. Specifically, in Exchange, we expect the average number of members as well as the annual dues and exchange revenue per member to be flat. In Rentals, we expect transactions to be flat and we expect average net price per vacation rental to increase between 2% and 5%.Finally, we expect Wyndham Exchange and Rentals revenue of $1.125 billion to $1.225 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of $290 million to $310 million. Given our expectations that members' annual dues and exchange revenue per member and rental transactions will be relatively flat as a result of the economic conditions, we are keeping our EBITDA range consistent with 2009, although we do anticipate a positive FX impact in 2010.Regarding FX sensitivity, in Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, it operates in approximately 100 countries with many currencies. A rule of thumb, a 10% change in the dollar against a representative basket of currencies would result in a $14 million impact on Exchange and Rentals' full year EBITDA. Now moving to the Hotel Group. As we mentioned earlier, we expect RevPAR be flat to down 3% with some improvement in the second half of the year, but with the first half still challenged and the 1% to 3% increase in system size. We expect revenues to be between 620 and 670, and adjusted EBITDA in a range of $180 million to $200 million, increased somewhat assuming that the continued weakness in RevPAR will be offset by moderating bad debt expense and prudent expense control. At Wyndham Vacation Ownership, remember that we are deliberately capping the traditional model for this business to concentrate on cash flow generation and the return profile of the business. Now based on these objectives, we expect gross VOI sales to be flat. We're planning a 3% to 6% decline in tours as we target higher-efficiency marketing channels and a 5% to 8% increase in volume per guest.We expect GAAP revenue to be between $1.7 billion and $2 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of $360 million to $390 million, reflecting our expectation that there will be no impact from percentage-of-completion deferred revenue this year. Now this negative impact is offset by the anticipated continued improvement in sales efficiency and lower loan loss reserves.Remember that we took steps to eliminate deferred revenue and expect no impact from percentage-of-completion deferred revenue this year. The absence of this revenue will result in headwinds of $187 million in revenues and $89 million in EBITDA for 2010 relative to 2009.The effect will be particularly strong in the first quarter since we had a $67 million revenue benefit from deferred revenue in Q1 2009. Based on the improvements we've made to credit standards and the improved performance of the portfolio, we are hopeful that the provision for loan losses will come down this year.We expect depreciation and amortization company-wide of approximately $180 million to $185 million. Interest expense based on our current capitalization is expected to be between $130 million and $140 million. Now please note that while we have no significant debt maturities in 2010, we're evaluating alternatives to take advantage of the current improved debt market and refinance some of our debt ahead of schedule, possibly early in the year and that we could incur additional interest expense and related expenses currently not considered in this guidance. Any change would relate to replacement debt, we will not increase our outstanding debt this year. We will keep you posted as these potential transactions develop. The ABS market is continuing to gradually improve. We anticipate that we'll be executing a term transaction within the next few months. Our cash flow guidance assumes pricing and advanced rates similar to our deals last fall, but we believe that the environment could be slightly better. We expect our tax rate for the year to be 38% compared with 40% in 2009, reflecting certain corporate initiatives related to some Wyndham Exchange and Rentals non-U.S. operations. In addition, we are making very good progress on the resolution of our legacy contingent liability for taxes related to periods prior to our separation from Cendant. We are in active settlement discussions with the IRS, and those discussions are progressing well. We expect any settlement to be within our reserves. We expect that the vast majority of this issue will be resolved no later than the third quarter and possibly before. We expect to spend $175 million to $200 million in CapEx and hotel development advances. We expect spending for Timeshare development to be between $120 million and  $130 million, somewhat higher than the $100 million we previously communicated. And that's really based on the timing of our spend that we anticipated in 2009.We expect a diluted share count of approximately 189 million shares, which assumes some share appreciation but no share buybacks. We expect earnings per share for the year to be between $1.48 and $1.69 per share. For the first quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.27 to $0.32, reflecting a RevPAR decline of between 10% and 13% and the absence of $31 million of EBITDA contribution related to deferred revenue. Now with that, I'll turn it back to Steve."

Before we open the line for questions, I'd like to make a few closing comments.The economic crisis of the past few years and the impact that it has had on the hospitality industry caused Wyndham Worldwide and many other companies to make tough decisions on a number of fronts. Now as the crisis recedes and the economy recovers, I feel very good about the decisions we made and the way we executed against our strategies. We are well-positioned for continued success in our markets, and we are transforming our business model to maximize free cash flow. In good times and in bad, free cash flow is the great enabler. Our strategic priorities for capital allocation are to invest prudently in our businesses and to return cash to shareholders. We announced a significant step in our strategy today, tripling our dividend and resuming our share repurchase program, demonstrating confidence in our ability to maximize and sustain free cash flow in the $500 million to $600 million range and our optimism regarding our businesses going forward.Most importantly, I'm proud and pleased with how our associates have responded to the challenges of the past few years. In our business, it's all about the people. You can have a great strategy and a strong balance sheet, but you need your people engaged, focused and enthusiastic to provide outstanding service to customers. Our most recent associate survey showed that they are more engaged and motivated than ever. They have a clear understanding of and commitment to our signature Count On Me! customer service. This continues to be a significant source of competitive advantage for Wyndham Worldwide. I want to thank all of our associates for their hard work and commitment. With that, Shirley, we'll open the call for questions."

And they really have put up some tremendous results and we're obviously looking and guiding towards even a greater improvement in 2010. I would",505,"Sure. Thanks, Steve. Well, I'll take the first one first and talk about the VPG or efficiency increases at WVO. And they really have put up some tremendous results and we're obviously looking and guiding towards even a greater improvement in 2010. I would focus probably on two things, Steve, relative to continued improvement in VPG or volume per guest. One is the marketing programs. We have continually innovative and have been creative in our marketing programs at WVO. And during the downturn, that didn't take a break. We continued to be creative and we continued to work on ways to lever the Wyndham brand, to lever our ability to touch new consumers not just our existing consumers. So the one aspect of it and I've said this in the past, really marketing is so key to the process. We clearly have the best sales force in the industry, but they need to have the tools generated for them, and that's where the process starts. Now we're projecting tour flow down and part of the reason we're projecting that is that our marketing programs are even becoming more focused. So we think we can generate the kind of revenue that we've projected, which is similar to 2009, with actually a lower level of tour flow. So that's number one. Number two is when it comes to the -- when you get to the sales table, you're then selling the product, whatever that product is. In our case, it's a very, very flexible points-based product. We talked about it last year, that we are rolling out a new program called Club Wyndham Access, and that is the next generation or  a next transformation of the product, the points-based product we sell to consumer. It is even a better, more fixable product than we've sold for the last five years. And so we do expect to be able to take that product to the table and have a positive impact on our close rates. So it's really a -- and it may sound basic, Steve, but it's really a fashion of really staying ahead of the game and ahead of the curve, having the best innovative products in the marketplace with the best marketing programs and then executing it on that very well. So it may sound basic, but I tell you, the guys down there are doing a phenomenal job in Orlando. On the acquisition front, we've kind of continually said that we can't model opportunity per acquisitions. We don't know when the right opportunities will come up. We continue to look. We're looking at kind of what I would call a strategic tuck-in acquisitions, things that fit our profile right now.

We really have modified the behavior of the RCI customer to expect more from us online, and we're delivering more to them online. And it's really a credit to the team in RCI that has gotten on this and made it a top priority over the last couple of years. We increased our penetration from about 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 to about a 24% penetration rate in 2009, and that means that almost a quarter of the people who are doing transactions with us are doing them online. Now we think there's still great opportunity to grow that. We're continuing adding more functionality to RCI.com. And as you may have heard me say on the Rental business in Europe, we're above 75% online. So we got long ways to go to get us to even a greater level of online-transaction capability.

China is our second biggest international market and China as I've said in my comments actually performed nicely in the fourth quarter.

I think we were reacting frankly to the fact that we saw at that time. It's a very systematic approach we take to determine what our loan loss provision should be, and we respond to whatever we see as the trends at that time. Now there are some things that have happened during 2009 that certainly have improved the outlook for that portfolio. One is we've continually talked about the fact that our FICO scores have been improving. That's FICO scores of new sales, as well as the portfolio overall. So certainly, that is a good dynamic to have. The second thing is that, I think, we really weathered the toughest part of the storm last year. And we do not see the kind of trends that we saw at the end of 2008 or 2009 continuing today. That does not mean that it's easy to collect. It never is easy. People wait longer to pay, that's the general nature of the consumer right now.

I think that how do we bring that product on? Well, it's a function of timing of where we think product would best fit into our system.

We prefer to see RevPAR pick up at the beginning of the year immediately, but the fact is we don't expect to see that. We don't -- we're expecting a more gradual recovery than a quick snap-back recovery, particularly in the economy in Mid-scale segments. So the good news is that a 3% decline is a lot less than a 12% decline. So what they're seeing hopefully is an improving environment on a relative basis. It still is down, but it's not down as much. And through the year, we expect to see it improve sort of the second half of the year better than the first. So I just kind of restated the fact there, what we laid out before, but we work very closely with our franchisees. We want to see their operations improve. It's important to us. We don't share in their bottom line, but we absolutely want them to be successful, and that's very important and a priority of ours.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on this snowy Wednesday morning in Northern New Jersey. As you saw from our press release, we had another great quarter, and overall, a terrific year despite the tough economy. We continue to demonstrate strong execution against our strategic initiatives and delivered fourth quarter EPS of $0.40, compared with guidance of $0.35 to $0.38. Our full year adjusted EBITDA of $830 million was also ahead of our guidance.Today, I will talk with you about our 2009 achievements, our exciting plans for 2010 and some major decisions we've made regarding how we'll deploy free cash flow going forward. Then, Tom Conforti will review results and walk you through 2010 guidance. Overall, we see some signs that the economic and operating environments are stabilizing. Like others, we are seeing improvement in the Upper Upscale segment with Wyndham brand same-store managed portfolio RevPAR  in the U.S. up over 12% in January. At the same time, unemployment in the U.S. combined with ongoing consumer concerns about the economy continued to pressure consumer spending and RevPAR  in our primary economy in Midscale Industry segments.The Lower Price segments were not impacted as much during the downturn and will probably follow the Upper segment out of the recovery. However, we're confident that our resilient business model, our proven ability to execute and our growing free cash flow position us well strategically and financially for 2010 and beyond. We continue to make great progress in transforming our businesses to maximize free cash flow. In 2009, consistent with our strategic decision to cap the size of our Traditional Timeshare business, we reduced inventory spend and reduced receivables in this business. These actions combined with other cost-control efforts drove free cash flow of $541 million in 2009, a turnaround of over $600 million from 2008.For 2010, we've also introduced additional disciplined balance sheet reviews into our budgeting and forecasting process, and a balance sheet efficiency component into our executive compensation programs. This will help maintain our focus on maximizing free cash flow across the organization.  Our transformation positions the company well for future growth, profitability and cash flow. We expect sustainable annual free cash flow of $500 million to $600 million in the coming years, and we are committed to deploying the cash flow to drive shareholder value.We expect to reinvest the portion of our free cash flow in our Fee-for-service businesses when he we have opportunities that are attractive from a strategic and financial perspective. We also intend to return a greater portion of it to our shareholders to increase dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. In fact, we made two significant announcements today that address our capital allocation plans.First, we've tripled the dividend, which puts us at a payout ratio of approximately 30% and a current yield of approximately 2%. This decision demonstrates our strong confidence in our business prospects, as well as the sustainability of our free cash flow going forward. We expect to generate over $2.5 billion in free cash flow over the next five years, which enables us to make this commitment now while maintaining a sharp focus on our credit metrics in continuing to strengthen and grow our businesses. Tom will walk you through our dividend policy shortly. Second, we intend to resume our share repurchase program on an opportunistic basis. We have $157 million remaining under our current authorization. Now let me take you through some of the highlights of our strategic initiatives and results. As a reminder, our mission is to be the leader in travel accommodation, welcoming our guests to iconic brands and vacation destinations through our signature Count On Me! service. And of course, our primary objective as a public company is to increase shareholder value.Our key strategies to support these goals are to increase market share by delivering excellent service, grow cash flow and operating margins through superior execution and emphasize our Fee-for-service business models, which accounted for 65% of our EBITDA in 2009. I'll start with Wyndham Exchange and Rental, which increased adjusted EBITDA by 9% excluding the net effects of foreign currency in 2009. Our team's superbly executed their business plan, demonstrating their technology and marketing leadership across the global exchange business in expanding our vacation rental brands while growing operating margin.The exchange side of the business, RCI, culminated a fantastic year with an annual affiliate meeting last month in New York City, which drew record attendance. The theme of the event was the innovative value-added services we provide. RCI continues to dominate on the technology front, providing new functionality not only through its 3.8 million members, but also through its over 4,000 affiliated resorts. For example, RCI.com is now available to our club affiliates as a transparent online booking tool. So for example, Hilton Grand Vacation Club owners can book within the Hilton Club or transact in RCI exchange, all through our portal. Developer affiliates using this new web interface have achieved significant gains in online transaction penetration rate in a matter of months.On the consumer front, we successfully completed a significant RCI.com upgrade in November, which expanded our cutting-edge and enhanced search technology to our over 1 million points members, giving them complete and easy access to the tremendous breadth and depth of our global portfolio. We also initiated automatic electronic status updates on pending requests, which historically have accounted for approximately 12% of our call volume. Our efforts to date have resulted in 24% penetration of online transactions in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with 13% in 2008, and resulted in $5 million of sustainable costs center savings throughout 2009.Our European Rental businesses delivered solid results despite the difficult economic environment. These businesses demonstrated strong resiliency during this downturn as leisure travelers throughout Europe remain committed to their vacations. Our U.K. Cottage Rental business had an especially stellar year, aided in part by a weak pound sterling, resulting in increased domestic travel. This business annually serves over 1 million leisure travelers through exclusive listings of 17,000 rental properties.Excluding the net effect of foreign currency, revenue increased by 5% and contribution margin increased by over 30% compared with 2008. Ongoing investment in e-commerce is also yielding results. In 2009, 73% of bookings were made online, up from 59% in 2008, supported in part by a 21% increase in Google clickthrough rates. Additionally, the U.K. Cottage Rental business reduced marketing costs by applying enhanced analytics to the 4 million customers in our database, as well as focusing efforts on the most effective marketing channels, resulting in higher marketing conversion rates.We have a scalable, efficient infrastructure supporting these two great business models, vacation exchange and vacation rentals. We completed restructuring and other cost-savings initiatives in 2009 that eliminated over $50 million annually in costs. We focused primarily on increasing efficiency rather than eliminating headcount, resulting in sustainable cost savings and better-run businesses, which will support margin expansion in future years.Moving to the Hotel Group, we believe that strong well-supported brands and increasing reservation contribution are paramount to our ability to retain and attract new franchisees. As I said earlier, historically, the Economy and Midscale segments compared to Higher-end segments have been more resilient during economic downturns and exhibited slower recovery. So we'll use what we believe will be a transition year to heighten our focus on executing on the blocking and tackling in this business. We are launching a series of strategic initiatives with the goal of strengthening our brands and delivering a reservation experience that maximizes value for both franchisees and consumers. Our efforts will focus on the following areas: First, we will drive bookings through online channels by improving consumer shopping experience on our brand websites, by enhancing connectivity to online travel agents and by increasing product exposure on OTAs websites. Next, we'll increase occupancy and allow for better pricing opportunities by ensuring all our rate plans are consistently available across all channels and by equipping franchisees with more competitive rate information to enable them to make better rate setting decisions, and we will continue to invest in our international platform with a keen focus on priority markets.We expect the multi-wave implementation effort on these and other strategic initiatives over the next few years as we continue to build capabilities that enable future growth. We continue to make great progress on building the Wyndham brand also. We opened over 2,000 Wyndham rooms in the fourth quarter and nearly 4,200 rooms during the year. The majority of which were international with approximately 1,200 rooms in China, including the Wyndham Grand Plaza Royale in Hangzhou, 1,000 rooms in Mexico including four oceanfront properties and 225 rooms at the Wyndham Apollo Hotel Amsterdam. On the domestic front, we opened the 255-room Graves 601 Hotel, Wyndham Grand, which is the largest upscale meeting facility in downtown Minneapolis and has earned numerous accolades. Wyndham Vacation Ownership had another solid quarter, wrapping up a year of transformation for that business, reducing the size of our business from $2 billion in Vacation Ownership sales to $1.3 billion while maintaining high levels of business momentum. We're in the process of transforming this business to move from a growth orientation to a dramatically improved cash flow and return profile. And we're seeing great success. We reduced our inventory spend from $414 million in 2008 to $189 million in 2009. Cash down payments for the quarter were 22%, up from 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, for the full year, we reduced the percentage of sales financed from 66% in 2008 to 55% in 2009. In addition, FICO scores for the full year 2009 were 724 compared with 694 in 2008.We are also making great progress on our alternative business model for timeshare. With product in Myrtle Beach now registered under our Asset Affiliation Model, we expect to begin sales this month. While we remain in the early planning phases for this offering, we are confident this will be a very successful model going forward. Overall, we believe there is plenty of product available with over 5,000 units in our deal pipeline. To take full advantage of the opportunity, we are exploring various programmatic approaches for this business. And finally, for Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which had a great quarter, we started the year strong as well. And on January 26 of this year, we hosted the grand opening of Wyndham Vacation Resorts at National Harbor, our newest resort located in the heart of National Harbor and just minutes from the snow-covered nation's capital. This is our second property in the market joining Wyndham Old Town Alexandria, which opened in 1999 and remains one of the most popular resorts in our portfolio. This resort will cater to the growing travel trend among timeshare owners to visit major metropolitan centers, and is just one more way we're keeping ahead of the curve for those looking to get maximum value for the vacation dollars.In summary, I'm pleased with our results, strong balance sheet and enhanced cash flow. Tripling the dividend and resuming our share repurchase program reflect our confidence in our ability to continue to execute and to deliver significant returns to shareholders now and in years to come. And now I'll turn the call over to Tom to go through our results and guidance in more detail. Tom?"

I'll walk you through the details of the quarter, talk about 2010 guidance and cover some additional topics.Company-wide revenues, which included a $46 million roll-in of previously-deferred sales related to the percentage-of-completion accounting were flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. As Steve noted, we exceeded our EPS guidance for the quarter and our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year.The company's balance sheet is in great shape. We had approximately $870 million of capacity on the corporate revolver at the end of the year, compared with approximately $290 million at the end of 2008. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio as defined by the rating agencies is at 3.1x. We have no significant near-term maturities, and we have significant room under our covenants. Overall, we believe we have an investment-grade profile. Cash from operations was approximately $690 million in 2009, compared to just $109 million in 2008, resulting in a breakthrough year in the company's generation of free cash flow, which we define as cash from operations less CapEx and hotel development advances. With the free cash flow turnaround of over $600 million, our results were transformational. Based on these results, as Steve noted, our Board of Directors has authorized a threefold increase in the dividend, and we will resume our share repurchase program. These decisions were based on our belief that the company will sustainably deliver $500 million to $600 million in free cash flow well into the future, that our current capital structure is an investment-grade profile and that we have sufficient flexibility to make value-enhancing investments in our Fee-for-service businesses. Our dividend payout is now about 30% with a yield of approximately 2% at our current stock price. When we came out of the box with the increase, we wanted to target a 2% dividend yield. Going forward, our dividend policy will be to at least mirror the rate of growth of our business. In addition on share repurchase, we are reactivating our current authorization with the balance of $157 million.Now moving to segment performance beginning with Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, it once again delivered excellent results, ending the year ahead of our guidance. For the quarter, excluding the net effect of foreign currency, revenue and adjusted EBITDA were flat. On a similar full year basis, adjusted margins increased almost 300 basis points to 28%, reflecting resilient top-line performance in a difficult economic environment, efficiencies from our migration to the Web and cost-reduction efforts associated with streamlining our organization, a remarkable achievement given the economic conditions over the last 12 months.Exchange revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 was up 2% on a constant-currency basis. Member growth was up 2%, reflecting in part the addition of the Disney Vacation Club earlier this year. Fourth quarter 2009 annual dues and exchange revenue per member in constant currency was consistent with the fourth quarter of 2008, reflecting higher transaction fees for call center transaction, offset by lower exchange transactions.Vacation rental revenues in the fourth quarter were up 2% on a constant-currency basis. Transaction volume was relatively flat, reflecting higher volumes at our Landal GreenParks in Holland and our U.K. Cottage Rentals business, offset by fewer vacation rentals by our RCI members. In constant currency, average net price per rental was up 3% in the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily reflecting mix from higher volume at Landal GreenParks. Ancillary revenues in the fourth quarter were $30 million, a 17% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2008, due primarily to lower fees generated from programs with affiliated resorts and our termination of low-margin travel service contract.As part of my ongoing education with the company, I recently had the opportunity to visit three of our European Rental businesses. I was impressed with the energy, enthusiasm and focus of the teams, as well as their well-thought-out growth plans. These are excellent businesses with a great consumer base. They operate, for the most part, on a fee-for-service model. I was also impressed by the quality of the rental properties in the parks. As Steve noted, 2009 proved the resiliency of European vacation rentals in a difficult economic environment, and the Cottage businesses are scalable with no additional CapEx requirements. We believe there is great exportability of this model throughout Europe.At Wyndham Hotel Group, revenues and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter were down 12% and 41%, respectively, due in part to expected industry-wide RevPAR  declines and lower other franchise fees. In addition, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $6 million related to a joint venture that manages international four- and five-star properties, which have been hit hard by the global economic downturn, affecting profitability estimates. Now this charge was not contemplated in our most recent guidance.We also recorded incremental bad debt expense in the quarter of approximately $6 million, principally related to three properties in our managed portfolio, which experienced occupancy declines similar to the rest of the industry. Now please note, these managed properties comprise less than 2% of our systems portfolio in total. And as Steve noted, RevPAR significantly improved at our managed properties in January. Overall, we're beginning to see less stress across the entire system. We lost only two franchise properties to foreclosure in 2010, January of 2010, compared with nine franchise properties in January of 2009. Domestic RevPAR decreased 14% from a year ago. Worldwide and international RevPAR declined 13% and 15%, respectively, in constant currency. Our Days Inn and Super 8 brands continue to outperform the Economy segment, primarily due to stronger pricing than the competition. It's encouraging that these brands, which account for over 50% of our rooms, had held rate above their segment. In addition, while a small piece of our business, advance bookings do signal that rate continues to hold, all of which provides a strong base for outperformance when occupancy returns. Internationally, we are seeing some signs of industry improvement. Fourth quarter RevPAR was down only 1.6% in China. In Mexico, in constant currency, fourth quarter RevPAR  increased 3% for the Wyndham brand and 2.2% for all brands.Exhibiting great momentum in a difficult environment, we ended the quarter with approximately 597,700 rooms worldwide, opening over 46,000 rooms in the year but terminating for 41,000 rooms. Now our ability to reach our long-term room growth rate of 2% to 4% requires that we make retaining the right rooms a top priority. The strategies Steve mentioned earlier address this objective.Now moving to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. Revenues in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter were up 3% and 45%, respectively. Our results reflect the benefit of a roll-in of percentage-of-completion deferred revenue, continued efficiencies in sales and marketing which I'll discuss in a moment, and a decline in the provision for loan loss as signs of some stability appear.Gross VOI revenues exceeded our expectations again in the fourth quarter. Sales efficiencies were once up again significantly, reflecting the resizing of our business with volume per guest of over 36% from the fourth quarter of 2008 and up over 22% for the year compared to 2008. Close rates remain strong, and transaction sizes in pricing remained stable.On the consumer financing front, we saw a significant improvement in write-offs in the fourth quarter, which were 3% relative to the overall portfolio, down from 3.3% at the end of Q4 of 2008. Accordingly, the provision for loan loss was $103 million or 26% of VOI sales, down from 31% on a similar basis from the fourth quarter of 2008. The securitizations continued to perform within their expected tolerances. And overall, we continue to see good trends in the portfolio as delinquency and default rates are improving.Now let's turn to 2010 guidance. Note that we'll post the guidance to the Investor Relations portion of our website immediately following the call. We are maintaining our previous guidance for 2010 revenue and EBITDA and free cash flow for the company. Let's look at each business unit.Starting with Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. Drivers are generally flat, reflecting continued economic uncertainty in the U.S. and Europe. Specifically, in Exchange, we expect the average number of members as well as the annual dues and exchange revenue per member to be flat. In Rentals, we expect transactions to be flat and we expect average net price per vacation rental to increase between 2% and 5%.Finally, we expect Wyndham Exchange and Rentals revenue of $1.125 billion to $1.225 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of $290 million to $310 million. Given our expectations that members' annual dues and exchange revenue per member and rental transactions will be relatively flat as a result of the economic conditions, we are keeping our EBITDA range consistent with 2009, although we do anticipate a positive FX impact in 2010.Regarding FX sensitivity, in Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, it operates in approximately 100 countries with many currencies. A rule of thumb, a 10% change in the dollar against a representative basket of currencies would result in a $14 million impact on Exchange and Rentals' full year EBITDA. Now moving to the Hotel Group. As we mentioned earlier, we expect RevPAR be flat to down 3% with some improvement in the second half of the year, but with the first half still challenged and the 1% to 3% increase in system size. We expect revenues to be between 620 and 670, and adjusted EBITDA in a range of $180 million to $200 million, increased somewhat assuming that the continued weakness in RevPAR will be offset by moderating bad debt expense and prudent expense control. At Wyndham Vacation Ownership, remember that we are deliberately capping the traditional model for this business to concentrate on cash flow generation and the return profile of the business. Now based on these objectives, we expect gross VOI sales to be flat. We're planning a 3% to 6% decline in tours as we target higher-efficiency marketing channels and a 5% to 8% increase in volume per guest.We expect GAAP revenue to be between $1.7 billion and $2 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of $360 million to $390 million, reflecting our expectation that there will be no impact from percentage-of-completion deferred revenue this year. Now this negative impact is offset by the anticipated continued improvement in sales efficiency and lower loan loss reserves.Remember that we took steps to eliminate deferred revenue and expect no impact from percentage-of-completion deferred revenue this year. The absence of this revenue will result in headwinds of $187 million in revenues and $89 million in EBITDA for 2010 relative to 2009.The effect will be particularly strong in the first quarter since we had a $67 million revenue benefit from deferred revenue in Q1 2009. Based on the improvements we've made to credit standards and the improved performance of the portfolio, we are hopeful that the provision for loan losses will come down this year.We expect depreciation and amortization company-wide of approximately $180 million to $185 million. Interest expense based on our current capitalization is expected to be between $130 million and $140 million. Now please note that while we have no significant debt maturities in 2010, we're evaluating alternatives to take advantage of the current improved debt market and refinance some of our debt ahead of schedule, possibly early in the year and that we could incur additional interest expense and related expenses currently not considered in this guidance. Any change would relate to replacement debt, we will not increase our outstanding debt this year. We will keep you posted as these potential transactions develop. The ABS market is continuing to gradually improve. We anticipate that we'll be executing a term transaction within the next few months. Our cash flow guidance assumes pricing and advanced rates similar to our deals last fall, but we believe that the environment could be slightly better. We expect our tax rate for the year to be 38% compared with 40% in 2009, reflecting certain corporate initiatives related to some Wyndham Exchange and Rentals non-U.S. operations. In addition, we are making very good progress on the resolution of our legacy contingent liability for taxes related to periods prior to our separation from Cendant. We are in active settlement discussions with the IRS, and those discussions are progressing well. We expect any settlement to be within our reserves. We expect that the vast majority of this issue will be resolved no later than the third quarter and possibly before. We expect to spend $175 million to $200 million in CapEx and hotel development advances. We expect spending for Timeshare development to be between $120 million and  $130 million, somewhat higher than the $100 million we previously communicated. And that's really based on the timing of our spend that we anticipated in 2009.We expect a diluted share count of approximately 189 million shares, which assumes some share appreciation but no share buybacks. We expect earnings per share for the year to be between $1.48 and $1.69 per share. For the first quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.27 to $0.32, reflecting a RevPAR decline of between 10% and 13% and the absence of $31 million of EBITDA contribution related to deferred revenue. Now with that, I'll turn it back to Steve."

Before we open the line for questions, I'd like to make a few closing comments.The economic crisis of the past few years and the impact that it has had on the hospitality industry caused Wyndham Worldwide and many other companies to make tough decisions on a number of fronts. Now as the crisis recedes and the economy recovers, I feel very good about the decisions we made and the way we executed against our strategies. We are well-positioned for continued success in our markets, and we are transforming our business model to maximize free cash flow. In good times and in bad, free cash flow is the great enabler. Our strategic priorities for capital allocation are to invest prudently in our businesses and to return cash to shareholders. We announced a significant step in our strategy today, tripling our dividend and resuming our share repurchase program, demonstrating confidence in our ability to maximize and sustain free cash flow in the $500 million to $600 million range and our optimism regarding our businesses going forward.Most importantly, I'm proud and pleased with how our associates have responded to the challenges of the past few years. In our business, it's all about the people. You can have a great strategy and a strong balance sheet, but you need your people engaged, focused and enthusiastic to provide outstanding service to customers. Our most recent associate survey showed that they are more engaged and motivated than ever. They have a clear understanding of and commitment to our signature Count On Me! customer service. This continues to be a significant source of competitive advantage for Wyndham Worldwide. I want to thank all of our associates for their hard work and commitment. With that, Shirley, we'll open the call for questions."

And they really have put up some tremendous results and we're obviously looking and guiding towards even a greater improvement in 2010. I would",505,"Sure. Thanks, Steve. Well, I'll take the first one first and talk about the VPG or efficiency increases at WVO. And they really have put up some tremendous results and we're obviously looking and guiding towards even a greater improvement in 2010. I would focus probably on two things, Steve, relative to continued improvement in VPG or volume per guest. One is the marketing programs. We have continually innovative and have been creative in our marketing programs at WVO. And during the downturn, that didn't take a break. We continued to be creative and we continued to work on ways to lever the Wyndham brand, to lever our ability to touch new consumers not just our existing consumers. So the one aspect of it and I've said this in the past, really marketing is so key to the process. We clearly have the best sales force in the industry, but they need to have the tools generated for them, and that's where the process starts. Now we're projecting tour flow down and part of the reason we're projecting that is that our marketing programs are even becoming more focused. So we think we can generate the kind of revenue that we've projected, which is similar to 2009, with actually a lower level of tour flow. So that's number one. Number two is when it comes to the -- when you get to the sales table, you're then selling the product, whatever that product is. In our case, it's a very, very flexible points-based product. We talked about it last year, that we are rolling out a new program called Club Wyndham Access, and that is the next generation or  a next transformation of the product, the points-based product we sell to consumer. It is even a better, more fixable product than we've sold for the last five years. And so we do expect to be able to take that product to the table and have a positive impact on our close rates. So it's really a -- and it may sound basic, Steve, but it's really a fashion of really staying ahead of the game and ahead of the curve, having the best innovative products in the marketplace with the best marketing programs and then executing it on that very well. So it may sound basic, but I tell you, the guys down there are doing a phenomenal job in Orlando. On the acquisition front, we've kind of continually said that we can't model opportunity per acquisitions. We don't know when the right opportunities will come up. We continue to look. We're looking at kind of what I would call a strategic tuck-in acquisitions, things that fit our profile right now.

We really have modified the behavior of the RCI customer to expect more from us online, and we're delivering more to them online. And it's really a credit to the team in RCI that has gotten on this and made it a top priority over the last couple of years. We increased our penetration from about 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 to about a 24% penetration rate in 2009, and that means that almost a quarter of the people who are doing transactions with us are doing them online. Now we think there's still great opportunity to grow that. We're continuing adding more functionality to RCI.com. And as you may have heard me say on the Rental business in Europe, we're above 75% online. So we got long ways to go to get us to even a greater level of online-transaction capability.

Your second question had to do with some color around international markets. Two of our biggest markets are Canada and the U.K. And Canada was down significantly. China is our second biggest international market and China as I've said in my comments actually performed nicely in the fourth quarter.

Joe, it's hard to -- I haven't heard anybody call us harsh on anything in a while so, but maybe we were harsh on our loan loss provision. But I don't think we were. I think we were reacting frankly to the fact that we saw at that time. It's a very systematic approach we take to determine what our loan loss provision should be, and we respond to whatever we see as the trends at that time. Now there are some things that have happened during 2009 that certainly have improved the outlook for that portfolio. One is we've continually talked about the fact that our FICO scores have been improving. That's FICO scores of new sales, as well as the portfolio overall. So certainly, that is a good dynamic to have. The second thing is that, I think, we really weathered the toughest part of the storm last year. And we do not see the kind of trends that we saw at the end of 2008 or 2009 continuing today. That does not mean that it's easy to collect. It never is easy. People wait longer to pay, that's the general nature of the consumer right now.

I think that how do we bring that product on? Well, it's a function of timing of where we think product would best fit into our system.

We prefer to see RevPAR pick up at the beginning of the year immediately, but the fact is we don't expect to see that. We don't -- we're expecting a more gradual recovery than a quick snap-back recovery, particularly in the economy in Mid-scale segments. So the good news is that a 3% decline is a lot less than a 12% decline. So what they're seeing hopefully is an improving environment on a relative basis. It still is down, but it's not down as much. And through the year, we expect to see it improve sort of the second half of the year better than the first. So I just kind of restated the fact there, what we laid out before, but we work very closely with our franchisees. We want to see their operations improve. It's important to us. We don't share in their bottom line, but we absolutely want them to be successful, and that's very important and a priority of ours.

We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.34 above the high end of our $0.27 to $0.32 range.Remember that we are comparing with first quarter",2180,"As you saw from the press release, we had a terrific quarter with each of the businesses performing at or ahead of plan. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.34 above the high end of our $0.27 to $0.32 range.
Remember that we are comparing with first quarter 2009 which benefited from a roll in of $67 million of previously deferred vacation ownership revenues and approximately $31 million of associated EBITDA. Considering that headwind, first quarter 2009 comparisons are especially impressive. Excluding the 2009 roll in of deferred revenues and the favorable impact of foreign exchange, adjusted EBITDA increased by almost 20%.
Our continued strong execution and the momentum of the business give us confidence to raise our revenue, EBITDA and EPS guidance for the year.
Much of the upside is being driven by vacation ownership. As you know, beginning in the third quarter of 2008, we underwent a substantial restructuring to rightsize the vacation ownership business. We closed lower margin sales offices and cut less efficient marketing programs. Our focus is to optimize cash flow and efficiency rather than double-digit top-line growth.
The magnitude of the change was driven by the upheaval in the capital markets and our desire to be masters of our destiny by reducing our reliance on the ABS market. But the strategic intent, which we outlined in late 2007, was driven by our desire to focus more investment in our fee-for-service businesses.
The results are impressive. We had the best timeshare business in the world before the downturn, and the business we have today is even better. It's more profitable, more resilient, and it generates more cash. We have dramatically improved the quality of the consumer loans that we underwrite, resulting in a stronger portfolio. And we've made operational changes that simplify the accounting by eliminating the deferred revenue that make tracking the business difficult for some investors.
On this exceptionally strong base, we are building an add-on business model that will further improve the return profile of the business. Combine this with our fantastic fee-for-service business models, and I think you'll agree that Wyndham Worldwide is well positioned for growth.
In addition, the overall economy is clearly improving. The decline in RevPAR is moderating. And despite with the doomsday profits predicted, leisure travelers are active. The credit in ABS markets also continued to improve.
Throughout the downturn, we've proved the resiliency of our business models as well as our ability to execute. And we are confident that we'll capture more than our fair share of the recovery.
But we're more than a recovery story. We transformed our businesses to generate free cash flow in a sustainable range of $500 million to $600 million annually or about $3 per share per year. That's at least $2.5 billion of free cash flow over the next five years, and we are committed to using that cash to drive shareholder value.
We will return a portion directly to shareholders through increased dividends, and we'll use the remainder to supplement our earnings per share growth by first investing in the businesses for organic growth; second, making acquisitions of fee-for-service businesses in our industries; and finally, repurchasing stock, which is already underway.
Now I'd like to discuss the progress we're making in our strategic initiatives, starting with the Hotel Group. Our vision is to be the world's leading hotel company in size, customer value and performance. We believe that strong, well-supported brands and highly-motivated franchisees are a key to achieving our vision.
As I mentioned last quarter, we are sharpening our focus on execution to take this business to the next level. Similar to our efforts to transform the Exchange business over the last few years with RCI.com, the Hotel Group is launching a series of strategic initiatives, which we refer collectively to as Apollo, with the goal of driving incremental revenue to our franchisees and strengthening the value of our brands.
We will launch our first four missions in the near term, which involve: number one, improving the overall content of our hotel brands across all channels; number two, improving consumer conversion on our brand websites by enhancing navigation, content, rate availability and technology; three, enhancing and consolidating our reservation system; and four, optimizing rate information for our hotel owners through all distribution channels. I look forward to updating you on our progress as we proceed over the next 18 months.
We're seeing substantial momentum in the Wyndham brand, gaining great traction, especially in critical major urban and key destination markets. Overall, we've increased the number of rooms by over 16%, adding 12 properties over the past year. We opened 1,115 Wyndham rooms in the first quarter.
In addition, we recently signed an agreement for the 1,011-room Parc 55 Hotel in San Francisco, which converts today to a Wyndham Hotel. Located near Union Square, this hotel and other recent announcements signify a resurgent presence of the Wyndham brand in major center-city markets.
The Wyndham Parc 55 recently completed a $30 million top-to-bottom renovation and redesigned that included upgrades for all guest rooms, a reconfiguration of the lobby and front desk and expansion of the hotel's meeting and events facilities to 30,000 square feet. We're thrilled to have this hotel in our Wyndham family.
And on April 13, we opened a newly constructed 280-room Wyndham Hotel located on 26th Street in New York City.
Internationally, we continued our expansion in Mexico with the opening of the 198-room Wyndham Casa Grande Monterrey and executed a three-hotel deal in China. Other notable international findings include four new Ramada franchise agreements in China, our fourth management agreement in Bangkok and four new Ramada franchise agreements in India.
And we continue to in accolades here in the U.S. in the economy segment. Super 8 and Days Inn were recently named two of the top 10 most popular franchises on CNNMoney.com.
Moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, the business continues to increase EBITDA through superior execution and the strength in the segment's two phenomenal business models. These models are characterized by great brands, strong distribution networks and significant market positions with loyal customer bases and high barriers to entry. From a financial perspective, these businesses are substantially fee-for-service revenue streams with modest capital requirements.
Last month, I attended timeshare's annual convention known as the ARDA Conference. It was clear to me and I think to everyone there that RCI continues to be the leader in the timeshare exchange industry. Year-after-year, RCI proves its leadership by providing the most innovative technology, marketing and product solutions to both timeshare developers and consumers.
The 2010 event was no exception. At ARDA, RCI further expanded its reputation as a technology leader with another first in the timeshare industry by announcing its debut into the mobile marketing world of two new apps, the RCI TV application and the RCI SnapBook application. Both are available for free download at the Apple app store.
In addition, for the first time in its history, RCI launched a premium membership product, RCI Points Platinum, which will begin sales in June and has already attracted several large developers who have signed up to offer this to their existing owners. Priced as a premium to RCI Points, RCI Points Platinum will offer a plethora of lifestyle benefits, including last minute upgrades for larger units, along with a first look at specialty premium inventory.
Coming off of a very successful 2009, RCI celebrated the affiliation of more than 100 resorts added last year, including a new affiliation agreement with Fiesta Hotel Group that welcomes five properties from the Grand Palladium Travel Club to RCI's global network and the affiliation of two resorts with SkiStar, one of the one of the Nordic region's strongest hospitality brands.
Already this year, RCI renewed its 17-year affiliation and relationship with Hilton Grand Vacations, which includes 50 affiliated resorts and more than 150,000 members. And additionally, RCI renewed its affiliation with Bluegreen Vacations, which includes 45 affiliated resorts and more than 180,000 members.
Last month, we announced RCI's newest agreement with InnSeason Resorts, one of the most world-known vacation brands in the New England with seven properties in the region. And just last week, RCI announced nine new resort affiliations across Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam at its 2010 Asia Leisure Real Estates Symposium where over 100 of RCI's Asian affiliates and industry leaders gathered to network and discuss growth opportunities within this important part of RCI's world.
Our European rental businesses delivered solid results once again, supported by the newest member of the Wyndham Worldwide family of brands, Hoseasons, one of the U.K.'s most recognized holiday brands. We closed this strategic acquisition on March 1 and the integration is moving along on schedule and according to plan.
Hoseasons is an excellent strategic fit with its fee-for-service model, strong U.K. brand presence and the additional skill that it provides to our U.K. cottage rental business. It offers a wide range of holiday offerings in over 15,000 lodges, cottages, villas, caravans and boats across seven European countries.
The addition of Hoseasons to our existing portfolio of exceptional vacation brands expands our wide range of holiday rental expenses in Europe from caravans to castles.
Turning to Wyndham vacation ownership who again had an extremely strong quarter with gross VOI sales of 10% and volume per guest up over 25%. As I discussed earlier, these results reflect the benefit of the transformational changes we've put in place over the last 18 months. The business is more efficient and has dramatically improved its cash flow profile.
Our performance in 2009, which continued into the first quarter of this year, demonstrated the resiliency in this business model in difficult economic times, and I believe we've proven that it's a highly manageable, predictable business. So we are excited about the sound fundamentals of our business model in good times and in bad, and I'm confident that this business will continue to deliver superior results both in the short and the long term.
We've spoken before about our new fee-for-service Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model or what we call WAAM. As a reminder, this model offers turnkey solutions for developers or banks in possession of newly developed, nearly completed or recently finished condo or hotel inventory. We will sell this unused or unsold inventory as timeshare points for a fee through our extensive distribution channels.
WAAM enables us to expand our resort portfolio with little or no capital deployment, while providing additional channels for new owner acquisition and growth for our fee-for-service resort management business.
As you may now, we began selling our first Wyndham asset affiliation product in Myrtle Beach in March, and sales are ahead of plan. The sales force is enthusiastic about the product offering and so are our customers.
In fact, average transactions on these sales are running perfectly comparative to our traditional inventory, indicating a seamless transition into our product mix. In short, our customers describe the same value to new resorts enabled by Wyndham as those which we would otherwise develop in finance ourselves.
We are building a solid runway to allow this part of the business to take off once we work through the bulk of the inventory on our balance sheet. With approximately three years of inventory on our balance sheet and with an additional investment of $100 million to $125 million each year over the next three years, we believe we have sufficient inventory for the next four to five years. At the end of that period, we would like to see the asset affiliation model contributing a meaningful portion of our timeshare revenue.
Over the next five years, sales from the asset affiliation may augment growth somewhat, but would largely be a trade-off with the company-sourced inventory. It is at the end of the period when this inventory will provide its greatest benefit and that it would significantly alter the return profile of the business.
Over the long term, we would expect EBITDA growth in vacation ownership in the mid-single digits with an improving return profile. Also, let me remind you that this will include opportunities to grow property management as it fits well with our fee-for-service strategy.
Before I turn over the call over to our CFO, Tom Conforti, let me say how proud I am of our continued strong results, which demonstrate great business models and committed teams of talented individuals delivering superior execution. We will maintain our sharp focus on maximizing cash flow to drive shareholder value.
We are about to enter our annual strategic planning process where we will be identifying many of the opportunities to grow the business both organically and inorganically. Since we've established quite clearly the sustainable cash profiles of business, our management team's focus now would be on how to best deploy that cash to maximize growth.
I will give you additional perspective on our thoughts about growth and how you should expect a clear picture from us over the next three to six months.
Now, I'll turn over the call over to Tom to go through our results and outlook in more detail.

First quarter revenues and adjusted EBITDA were relatively flat, a significant achievement given the benefit in the first quarter 2009 from the roll in of deferred revenue and associated EBITDA in our vacation ownership business.
Now I'm going to come back to detailed quarter results in a bit, but first I'd like to follow-up on Steve's point about our growth prospects. As Steve said on the last call, cash is the great enabler. So the critical, strategic question is, what effect will all this cash have on the growth profile of our company?
We've been working through some hypothetical, what we believe, realistic per share growth scenarios for the next several years. We start with organic growth, which we project at mid-single digits. If we apply the available free cash flow to either share repurchase or acquisition of fee-for-service businesses, we find that the contribution to overall company growth is equal to or greater than the growth from our base business.
The growth contribution above baseline growth we estimate could add approximately 700 basis points of growth, yielding overall growth of 12 to 15%. We will be working on solidifying our growth plan during our upcoming strategic planning process and will share our more detailed course with you in the upcoming months.
So let's shift now to look at capital markets' activity in quarter one. We completed a number of transactions including refinancing some debt well ahead of schedule, locking in reasonable rates and pushing out some maturities. We believe these actions strengthened our balance sheet and improved our liquidity position in overall investment grade credit profile.
We issued $250 of ten-year senior unsecured notes at a rate of 7.38%, and renewed our revolver at a level of $950 million. We were over seven times oversubscribed on the senior unsecured notes, demonstrating strong investor interest. And 18 banks participated in the revolver renewal, again, underscoring the banking community's confidence in our company.
We used a portion of the senior notes proceeds to repay and terminate our Australian credit facility, with the remainder applied to retiring the $300 million term loan. Now the balance of the term loan was repaid with new revolver borrowings, and as a result, we ended the quarter with $199 million drawn on the new facility.
We incurred early extinguishment fees of approximately $10 million after tax, and we expect to incur approximately $45 million pre-tax in additional interest expense annually as a result of these transactions.
Our outstanding debt levels were unchanged. Our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio is three times. We have no significant near term maturities, we have abundant liquidity, and we have significant room under our covenants. Overall, we have an investment grade profile. 
We also completed a term securitization transaction involving the issuance of $300 million of investment-grade asset-backed notes. The single A rated vacation ownership loan backed notes carries an advance rate of 72.25%, and a coupon of 4.48%, reflecting significant improvement in the asset-backed securities market over the past year, as well as Wyndham's elevated position in the market.
Net cash from operations was approximately $205 million in the first quarter 2010, relatively flat compared to the first quarter of 2009.
Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operations less CapEx, equity investments and development advances, increased over 7% to $166 million in the quarter compared with $155 million during the first quarter of 2009.
Our transformational actions have put us solidly on track in our base business to sustain annual free cash flow of $500 million to $600 million over the next several years, excluding cash payments of course related to contingent tax liabilities. That's $2.65 to $3.17 per share this year.
We believe that cash is the great enabler and will fuel our growth above and beyond the benefits of the economic recovery. As we look to acquire fee-for-service businesses in our core lodging and exchange and rental segments over time, our free cash flow target could be augmented in the future.
In addition, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders. In the first quarter, we trebled our dividend. Our overall dividend policy calls for growth in the dividend to at least mirror earnings growth. And as you saw from the press release, we have resumed share repurchases at a pace consistent with our activity prior to the downturn, purchasing 1.2 million shares through April 27 at an average price of $25.10.
Now moving to segment performance, let's begin with the hotel group. Revenue declined $10 million, reflecting moderating but continued pressure on RevPAR, which was partially offset in EBITDA by disciplined expense management.
System wide RevPAR declined 6.8% compared with our first quarter guidance of 10% to 13% decline. Now in constant currency, RevPAR declined 8.7% compared to the first quarter. We are cautiously optimistic that we have seen the worse of the RevPAR declines.
We ended the quarter with approximately 593,300 hotel rooms worldwide, opening over 9,300 rooms in the quarter and terminating approximately 13,700 rooms. Over 20% of the terminations, or 3,145 rooms were related to the exploration of a low-margin contract for ungranted affiliated rooms, which we chose not to renew.
Now as we discussed on the last call, our ability to reach our long-term room growth rate of 2% to 4% requires that we make retaining the right rooms a top priority, and we are making progress in this area. We've implemented an early warning intervention program that routes termination notices to a special retention group, which has helped us reduce our attrition rate for the quarter.
System growth trends are improving from last year's first quarter, and the pipeline is holding up well from the end of last year, with approximately 106,500 rooms. We saw an increase in new construction activity domestically in the first quarter, with 13 contract executions in 2010, compared with only eight during the same period in 2009.
Overall, the new construction pipeline increased 4% based on rooms, since the end of 2009, with over 60% of the increase coming from the Wyndham brand, another indication of accelerating brand momentum. While we believe it's too early to call it a trend, these signs are nonetheless encouraging.
Wyndham Exchange and Rentals once again delivered excellent results. For the quarter, excluding the net effect of foreign currency, revenue was flat, and adjusted EBITDA increased 3%, primarily reflecting Hoseasons March results, and continued cost reduction programs.
Exchange revenues in the first quarter of 2010 were flat on a constant currency basis, and up two percent on a reported basis. Now prior to detailing these results, I must call your attention to a change in our Exchange and Rentals drivers, to better reflect revenues in the two pieces of our business.
Specifically, RCI-member related rentals are now captured in the exchange drivers, whereas we used to include those revenues in the rental drivers. We believe this presentation better captures the full value of RCI members, and aligns with exchange peer practices. So with this realignment, our vacation rentals and average fee for vacation rental drivers will be focused on our European rentals business.
Now looking at the drivers; the average number of members was consistent with the first quarter of 2009. Exchange revenue per member in constant currency was also flat compared with the first quarter of 2009, and up 4% on a reported basis.
Higher exchange in member-related rental transaction fees were offset by lower exchange in rental transactions, subscription fees, and travel services. By the way, web penetration for rci.com was 29% in quarter one 2010, compared to 20% in the first quarter of 2009.
Rental revenues in the first quarter were up 2% on a constant currency basis and up 9% on a reported basis. The acquisition of Hoseasons in March contributed $3 million of incremental revenues.
Excluding the impact of the Hoseasons acquisition, transaction volumes in the first quarter of 2010 were consistent with the first quarter of 2009, reflecting higher volumes at our Novasol business, offset by a decline in volumes at our Landal GreenParks business.
In constant currency, and excluding the impact of the Hoseasons acquisition, average net price per rental was up 1% in the first quarter of 2010, primarily reflecting a favorable impact of higher commissions on new properties added to our network in 2010 by our U.K. cottages business.
Now moving to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, revenues were down 4%, and adjusted EBIDTA was up 4%, reflecting the absence of the previously mentioned roll-in of $67 million in deferred revenue. That was the benefit in 2009. This was substantially offset by exceptionally strong execution and performance in the business, resulting in a 71% increase in adjusted EBIDTA, excluding the 2009 deferred revenue benefit and restructuring from 2009 results.
Close rates remain stable, and transaction sizes and pricing are strong. Tours were down 10% year-over-year, slightly better than planned, and VPG, which increased 25% significantly exceeded our plan.
Our strong sales efficiencies reflect our ongoing focus on tour quality, as we continue to refine the database to target only the most qualified prospects as well as the efforts of the best sales team in the industry. It's important to note that we expect VPG growth to moderate as we move through the year and further adjust our tour mix to include greater frontline tour flow to support the long-term growth of the business. 
Property management revenues increased 10%, and merely reflecting a higher number of managed units. Consumer finance revenues declined 4%, primarily reflecting a reduction in the size of our receivables portfolio, while consumer finance interest expense declined 25%, reflecting a decline in average borrowings and improved rates on our most recent securitization transactions.
As you know, we're transforming this business and continuing to make great progress in terms of improving cash flow and our return profile. The percent of sales financed through the quarter averaged 54%, down from 58% a year ago, and 64% two years ago.
On the consumer financing front, we saw significant improvement in the first quarter in write-offs, which declined to a rate of 2.8% of the overall portfolio from 3.4% during quarter 1 of 2009. Overall, delinquency and default rates in the portfolio continue to improve.
Considering these and other factors, the provision for loan losses was $86 million, or 28% of gross realized sales, down from 31% on a similar basis from the first quarter 2009.
And note, as we continue to write higher quality loans, and as the economy begins to stabilize, the earnings upside from lowering provisioning could be significant over the next 18 months. We gained approximately $8 million in full year EBITDA to every 100 basis point decline in the provision, as a percent of gross realized sales.
Now turning to guidance, as Steve mentioned and as you saw from the press release, we're bringing up the bottom of our revenue guidance slightly with a new range of 3.6 to $3.9 billion. We've increased adjusted EBITDA guidance to 805 to $840 million, up from the previous guidance of 775 to 825.
Adjusted interest expense based on the new capital structure is expected to be 135 to $145 million. And we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $1.56 to $1.71 per share.
We expect diluted adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter of $0.38 to $0.42. Remember that second quarter 2009 results benefited from a roll-in of deferrred revenue of $37 million resulting in $17 millions of additional EBITDA.
At the hotel group, our current desk view is that RevPAR could be flat or down slightly at the upper end of the guidance that we provided in February. Bear in mind that some of the immediate turnaround in industry RevPAR is through the luxury in upper upscale segments, which are typically the first to show positive growth coming out of the downturn.
We primarily operate in the economy in mid-scale without food and beverage segments, which are historically more resilient in a declining RevPAR environment, but slow to improve in an increasing RevPAR environment.
Travel patterns during spring break were encouraging, and if this trend carries over to the summer months when we derive 30% of our annual royalties, we are optimistic that we could se an improvement in our full year RevPAR performance. However, for now we are leaving hotel guidance unchanged.
Exchange in rentals revenue and EBITDA guidance remain unchanged. However, we are updating the driver guidance based on the new methodology which moves RCI member related revenues to the exchange drivers, And the whole season's acquisition, which excluding the acquisition-related cost, will be accretive.
Aside from these changes, our underlying assumptions for the business remain unchanged. Taking the methodology change and the acquisition into account, the new driver guidance is first in exchange. We expect the average number of members as well as exchange revenue per member to be flat
However, in rentals, we expect transactions to increase 20% to 23%, and average net price for vacation rental to decrease 12% to 15%, primarily reflecting increased volumes at lower rental yields for our new Hoseasons business.
As Steve mentioned, the guidance increase overall is due to strong vacation ownership performance, and we are upping our revenue guidance to $1.8 billion to $2 billion, and EBITDA guidance to $380 million $405 million. Tour guidance remains unchanged, and VPG guidance will be increased by 100 basis points to a range of 6% to 9% growth. We also expect continued improvements in the loan lost provision.
Finally, we continue to make very good progress on the resolution of our legacy contingent liability for taxes related to periods prior to our separation from Cendant. We are in active settlement discussions with the IOS, and those discussions are progressing well. We expect any settlement to be within our reserve amount of $274 million, and the vast majority of this issue to be resolved no later than the third quarter and possibly before.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Steve.

And as the economy improves and the ground beneath us gets more solid, then our belief is that the loan loss provision will improve. And we shared that for every 100-basis points of improvement in loan loss, its $8 million of EBITDA. So that's a big swing factor, and we're constantly assessing where we should be with that loan loss provision.

We've done that before, we know we can do it, but what we're really managing that business for is to maximize cash flow and maximize efficiency. And that's why you see in the results for this quarter, 25% in volume (progress) is phenomenal.
I mean the sales force did a remarkable job. Now between marketing and sales, they delivered more than we thought they could for the quarter.
The first quarter is always a heavily in-house quarter because you don't have as many people out traveling for summer vacation. So you tend to see more in-house sales, and the over-exceed would be more easily achieved maybe in the first quarter versus let's say the third quarter, when you've got the summer months included. But we do not plan on ramping that business up back to double-digit growers.
So to answer your question, we don't have the sales force sitting on the sidelines waiting to launch in. There's a lot of sales people out on the street, we could probably ramp that up. But that's not our goal. Our goal is to continue to improve the efficiency of the business and to produce cash flow. And on those two areas, that business is in A++.

We're very focused on increasing our retention rate. Keeping somebody on is easier than having to go on and find a new hotel.

So we have the two levers. We basically did a reasonably simple exercise and said we're solidly brought into the fact that we're going to generate between $500 million and $600 million a year baseline in free cash flow. So the question is what do you do with the free cash flow?
And so in one scenario, we made certain assumptions about share price appreciation and assumed that all of that cash would be used to buy back. This is again a hypothetical exercise. All of that cash would be used to buy back stock at various levels over the next five years. So we came out to sort of the incremental per share growth of x.
And then we made an assumption that said if took all of that same cash flow and, as another side of the equation, we purchase EBITDA what we consider to be a reasonable target multiple, we came out with another growth number.
Now the likely scenario is going to be a hybrid scenario where we buy back stocks and we buy EBITDA over time. And so we basically went through that exercise and came out with that number of around 700 basis points of growth on a per share basis.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today.  As you saw from the press release we had a terrific quarter with operating results in each of the business units better than our expectations.  We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.51",1803,"Thank you, Margo.  Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today.  As you saw from the press release we had a terrific quarter with operating results in each of the business units better than our expectations.  We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.51, significantly above the high end of our $0.38 to $0.42 range, reflecting continued strength in growth across the three businesses as well as a change in our tax rate and some favorable impact of foreign currency.
When evaluating 2010 Q2 comparisons to 2009, remember that last year’s results included approximately $37 million roll-in of previously deferred time share revenue which contributed approximately $17 million in EBIDTA.  Excluding that, as well as excluding the favorable net impact of foreign currency, Q2 2010 adjusted EBIDTA increased by 14%.  
We continue to see improving business momentum, especially in North America which accounts for over 80% of our EBIDTA.  Domestic rev par was flat for the quarter, turned positive in June and is stronger yet in July.  This improvement is being led by occupancy gains over last year. Vacation exchange remains within our expectations and quarterly close rates and Vacation Owenership have never been higher. 
In Europe, which has been an area of investor focus over the recent months, remains stable.  These trends, coupled with continued strong execution by our businesses and a favorable tax rate give us confidence to raise our full year revenue, EBIDTA, and EPS guidance.  Tom will cover the details a little bit later.
We recently completed the formal stage of what is essentially an ongoing strategic planning process.  Our five main strategic initiatives remain the same, with the top three being to increase market share, grow cash flow, and rebalance our portfolio to emphasize our fee for services business.  Since we established these strategic initiatives in 2009 we have remained on course and have delivered, again, each of them.
Let me highlight some of the improvements coming from our strategic planning process.  In addition to our core organic growth, cash flow will continue to be an enabler for incremental growth.  In that regard I am pleased to share that our free cash flow projections beyond 2010 have us in the neighborhood of $600 million to $700 million annually, instead of the $500 million to $600 million we’ve previously shared with you. This increased cash flow is a result of growth in EBIDTA, the favorable flow-through characteristics of our fee for services business models, and lower cash taxes.  It will be applied to growing our business and increasing shareholder value.
Next I want to spend a few moments to update you on what WAM, our alternative timeshare business model, will look like in the future.  We have shared previously that over the next few years as we streamline our timeshare balance sheet we will limit the size of our WAM business to approximately 15% to 20% of total Vacation Owenership revenue. Moreover, once our balance sheet reached our desired level we would explore expanding the WAM business model to a higher level.  As we examine the various impacts on returns, free cash flow, and EBIDTA of different levels of WAM activity, we have concluded that WAM should continue to be viewed as a complementary business to our traditional timeshare business.  
By the way, we continue to gain traction with WAM.  Sales in Myrtle Beach, our first WAM project, remain robust and ahead of plan.  In addition we will begin sales next week on our second WAM deal, as we become the exclusive sales and marketing agent for the sale of Vacation Owenership interest of up to 275 recently-constructed units at the Reunion Resort in Orlando.  
Finally, I would like to spend a couple of minutes discussing our growth plans, which were a key focus during our strategic planning process.  We discussed during our last quarterly call that we are expecting EBIDTA in our core business to grow at a compound annual rate of 7% to 9%.  That was confirmed in the strategic planning process.  If we simply keep our free cash flow and our balance sheet, EPS would grow at 12% to 14%.  With a more active deployment of cash through share repurchases, additional investment in our core business, and acquisition of fee for service businesses, we can yield total earnings growth approaching 20%.  Our management team is focused on finding the right opportunities to complement and enhance our organic growth and through the action of our board of directors we now have additional capacity to repurchase our shares. 
These growth levels will be achieved while dramatically reducing our leverage ratios and enchain our credit profiles.  Our specific credit objectives are to maintain a DDD- investment grade profile.  As our credit profile continues to improve we will have the opportunity to further drive earnings growth by increasing our debt while maintaining a DDD- credit rating.  If you add our commitment that we made regarding our dividend policy, which is basically that we said our dividend increase would track our earnings growth, the opportunity for further improvement to total shareholder return is enhanced.
Now let me take a moment to share some current business unit highlights.  The Hotel Group is making significant progress on a number of fronts.  We acquired the Tryp Hotel brand from Sol Meliá Hotels and Resorts comprising license agreements for 92 hotels located throughout Europe and South America.  The brand, to be renamed Tryp by Wyndham, is a select service, mid market brand catering to business and leisure travelers in center-city locations including Madrid, Barcelona, and Paris.  While this acquisition increases our internal platform we also plan to pursue an aggressive growth strategy in North America for this Tryp brand.
We continue to make significant progress in growing the Wyndham brand as well organically, increasing rooms 23% year-over-year.  Grand openings in the Q2, 2010, were at the highest level in two years.  In fact, we’ve added more rooms to the Wyndham system so far this year than we did in all of 2009.  Significant additions include Wyndham hotels in San Francisco and Tampa, Florida, and Wyndham Gardens in Philadelphia and South Beach, Miami.  We also signed an agreement for our first Wyndham Grand in Hawaii, a 322-room new build luxury resort.
  Yesterday JD Powers released the results of its annual guest satisfaction survey, and Microtel was ranked the highest among economy chains for the 9th consecutive year.  This is unprecedented for any brand in any segment.  As Microtel continues to dominate the economy segment, Day’s Inn and Super 8 maintained leading potions.
As I discussed on the last call, the Hotel Group launched a series of initiatives called APOLLO, which are aimed at improving the value proposition for our hotel owners, predominantly through improved system contribution from technology enhancements.  Through the Q2 we built a strong foundation organizationally and through the establishment of formalized project management processes we are preparing to deliver the many benefits that APOLLO offers over the next 12 to 18 months.
Now moving to Exchange and Rentals.  RCI continued to demonstrate its ability to grow by signing more than a dozen new long-term affiliations in the quarter.  RCI welcomed 15 resorts from new affiliates and added seven additional resorts from existing affiliates, bringing our year-to-date new resort affiliation total to 58 resorts.  This increase further strengthens our industry-leading exchange network and reflects our commitment to offer our members the best new vacation product choices around the world.
In June, Wyndham Exchange and Rentals rolled out its latest round of RCI.com innovations, which were designed to continue to drive more transactions to the web and improve customer experience by creating first a simpler yet more robust online members search capability; second, expanding new automatic email member notification functionality on pending vacation searches to our European region; and third, continued expansion of our club enablement program to major club affiliates.  
Developer affiliates using the new web interface have achieved significant gains in online transaction penetration rates in a matter of months.  Web penetration at RCI.com was 27% in the Q2 of 2010, compared with 21% in the Q2 of 2009.  
Within our rental business, the integration of Host Seasons, our recently acquired UK vacation rental company, is progressing on budget and on schedule.  The holiday cottages grew and Host Seasons’ management teams continued to integrate their very similar businesses and have renamed their combined companies the Host Seasons Group.  While this has provided tremendous engagement and buy-in from our 700 new Host Season associates, the name change also provides us the opportunity to leverage the well-known Host Seasons brand.
Our Vacation Owenership business continued to perform exceptionally well during the Q2.  Having fully lapped the adjustments made in late 1008 and early 2009, our results this quarter provide a clear view into the health and stability of this business.  As you may recall, I first discussed our intention to slow the growth of our Vacation Owenership base during our 2008 Q2 earnings call.  This was months ahead of the financial crisis and the subsequent collapse of the credit markets.  While our primary goal at that time was to free up more capital in our fee for service businesses, we also believed that slowing growth in Vacation Owenership would afford us the opportunity to gain greater efficiency and improve the margins of this business.  We’ve accomplished those goals in our new view of the traditional Vacation Owenership model, which moderates growth to streamline the balance sheet, significantly increases the ROIC of this business especially with the ABS market stabilizing.
This business continues to perform better than our expectations, lustrating our ability to execute.  We are pleased that occupancy levels in Vacation Owenership remained consistent throughout the downturn and are currently running at about 85% across our system, proving the value proposition of the product.
One final note before turning to Tom.  We have a strong, resilient, predictable business and we are confident that it can deliver superior returns in good as well as in challenging economic times.  And as noted in the press release this morning, our Board shares our confidence, approving an increase in the share repurchase authorization of $300 million.  With approximately $90 million remaining within the previous program we have a commitment to invest directly in our company.
In addition, and as I said before, our policy it to grow our dividend at least in line with earnings, and we’ll allocate the necessary cash to achieve that objective.  Finally, through prudent acquisitions of fee for service businesses we’ll compound the effect of an excellent business model, further increasing EBIDTA and cash flow. We intend to use every tool available to us to grow our business and enhance shareholder value.
I’ll now turn the call over to Tom who will provide you with additional perspective and details on our results and our outlook.  Tom?

As you saw from the press release this morning as well as in recent announcements from us over the past week, we have much good news to share on this call. We beat our expectations by a wide margin, coming in $0.09 above the top end of our range.  A little over $0.02 of the beat came from prudent cost management in Exchange and Rentals and an additional $0.02 from favorable foreign currency impacts.  Approximately $0.04 came from a lower tax rate, reflecting our ability to utilize foreign tax credits based on certain changes we made to our tax profile.
The results of the quarter, which reflected the current utilization of cumulative credits taken in the quarter, was a 32% effective tax rate. We expect our full year tax rate for 2010 to be approximately 35.5%.  The longer-tem effects of the change will be less evident on GAAP tax basis, as we expect our tax rate next year to be close to 37.5% and then approach a Moe normalized rate of 39% in 2012.
Wher we expect to see a meaningful and sustainable pick up is in our cash taxes, increasing to approximately $100 million over the next five to seen years.  This is one of the facts that allowed us to raise our future free cash flow guidance that Steve mentioned earlier.
Before going through the results for quarter let me touch upon some of our recent news.  We announced the resolution with the IRS of our legacy contingent tax liability, related to periods prior to our separation from Cendant.  The settlement was well within our reserve.  We are pain g total of $145 million against an IRS reserve of $185 million.  We will reflect this settlement and the $40 million gain in our Q3 financial statement.
In addition to settling the contingent liability, this agreement also settled $190 million of deferred tax liabilities related to timeshare receivables on our balance sheet.  Approximately $125 million of the $145 million payment reflects an accelerated payment of this deferred tax liability.  So our cash taxes over the next three to six years will be reduced by the amount of the $125 million payment and the deferred tax liability will be reduced by the $190 million, and result in an increase in shareholders’ equity.  We look at the settlements of these two issues as a package settlement and a very positive development for the company.
Turning to capital markets.  Earlier this week we announced an ABS deal with advanced rates and cost characteristics very close to those of deals we did prior to the economic downturn.  We securitized $350 million in timeshare receivable notes at an advanced rate of 83% and an all-in yield of 4.15%.  This was the first senior and subordinated deal structure in the market since 2008.  The transaction was over subscribed and we don’t be happier with the execution.
In addition, in June we closed a $185 million premium yield securitization.  Premium yield securitizations, which consist primarily of notes that are ineligible for the conduit due to certain borrower or loan characteristics, represent more expensive financing than normal term deals but significantly enhance our liquidity and cash flow.  
Net cash from operations was approximately $557 million for the first six months of 2010, a 21% increase compared with the first half of 2009.  Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operations less CAPEX, equity investments, and development advances, increased over 32% to $486 million for the first six months, compared with $368 million for the same period in 2009.  As you know, we believe that cash is the great enabler for our company and will build our growth above and beyond the growth associated with our core businesses.
We now expect our free cash flow in 2010 to be at the upper end of the $500 million to $600 million range, excluding the upcoming payment of the $145 million related to the IRS contingent tax liability.  And as Steve mentioned earlier, we are now projecting steady state free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million in 2011 and beyond.
We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders, and as you saw from the press release, we have continued our share repurchases, buying 3.4 million shares through July 27th at an average price of $23.85.  These actors have prompted the Board to increase our overall share repurchase authorization by $300 million.
Now moving to operating performance for the quarter, let’s begin the segment reviews starting with our Hotel Group.  Revenues were up slightly while adjusted EBIDTA was flat, reflecting an increase in bad debt expense which we attribute to some lingering ripple effects of the recession.  System wide rev par was flat ahead of our expectations for the quarter.  As we expected, the economy segment return is lagging the turnaround in upscale and luxury.  We have continued to see meaningful improvements in rev par throughout the first three weeks of July.
Domestic rev par for Wyndham Hotel and Resort brand was up 13% in the Q2 2010 compared with Smith Travel Data for the upscale segment of 6.9% during the same period.  We ended the quarter with close to 606,800 hotel rooms worldwide.   Excluding the Tryp acquisition which added approximately 13,200 rooms, system growth was flat, in line with our expectations.  So far this year we’ve executed 209 new hotel contracts, which is 15% above last year.  The pipeline is essentially flat, reflecting good franchise contract execution and several large Wyndham openings during the quarter.  The new conversion pipeline is up 6% since December 31, 2009, with much of the momentum coming internationally, and conversion activity is consistent with last year.
Wyndham Exchange and Rentals once again delivered solid results.  For the quarter, excluding the net effect of foreign currency, revenue was up 3% and adjusted EBIDTA increased 17%, primarily reflecting Host Seasons Q2 results and continued strong management by our team.  Host Seasons contributed $10 million to revenue and as Steve said we’re very pleased with the integration and performance of this business.  Our Exchange and Rentals management team continue to drive efficiencies in the business to reduce costs.  The overall foreign currency impact in the Q2 was positive, resulting in favorable EBIDTA impact of $10 million, primarily from lower losses than 2009 on FX transactions.
Wyndham Exchange and Rentals performance drivers were consistent with our expectations, demonstrating again the stability of this business. Annual number of Exchange members and exchange revenue per member were relatively flat.  Vacation rentals transactions were up and average net price per vacation rental was down, reflecting the impact of the Host Seasons acquisition.  
Now moving to Wyndham Vacation Owenership, revenues were up 8% despite the absence of the roll-in of $37 million of deferred revenue that was a benefit in 2009.  Revenue increases reflect $35 million in lower provision for a loan loss, while WAM commissions were $8 million.  EBIDTA increased 14% from the Q2 of 2009 excluding the prior year period EBIDTA benefit associated with the deferred revenue roll-in and restructuring costs.  The increase reflected exceptionally strong execution and performance in the business, some of which was slightly offset by higher commission costs.  We will be working to bring commissions back to historic levels in the future.
Our key performance business driver, volume per guest, was up 16% above 2009’s Q2 results, reflecting strong pricing and lower rates.  Property management's revues increased 6%, primary reflecting an increase in managed units, and consumer finance revenues delivered 3%, primarily reflecting a slightly smaller receivables portfolio.  We continue to make great progress in improving our cash flow and return profile in our Vacation Owenership business. The percent of sales financed for the quarter averaged 54%, down from 56% a year ago and 68% two years ago.
On the consumer financing front, overall delinquency and default rates in the portfolio continue to improve.  Write-offs during the Q2 declined to 2.7% of the overall portfolio from 3.4% during the Q2 of 2009.  The provision for loan losses aws $87 million or 24% of gross DOI sales, down from 34% in the Q2 of 2009.  
Now turning to guidance.  As Steve mentioned and as you saw from the press release, we’re increasing revenue guidance $100 million to a new range of $3.7 billion to $4 billion. We’ve increased adjusted EBIDTA guidance $20 million to $825 million to $860 million.  We are also bringing adjusted earnings per share guidance to $1.78 to $1.88 per share, reflecting a 35.5% tax rate and a share count of 186,000,000.  Now note that as usual we have excluded future share repurchase assumptions from our guidance today.  We expect diluted adjusted earnings per share for the Q3 of $0.60 to $0.64 per share. 
Now drilling down to the business units.  At the Hotel Group new rev par guidance is flat to a positive 3% increase, and room guidance reflecting the Tryp acquisition is now 3% to 5%.  We are increasing lodging revenues slightly to a new range of $640 million to $680 million, but are keeping EBIDTA flat reflecting the higher bad debt expense in the Q2 as well as increased investment in APOLLO and IT securities.
Exchange and Rentals drivers and revenue remain unchanged, but we’re bringing up EBIDTA by $5 million, reflecting Host Seasons and continued cost management.
Finally, we’re raising Vacation Owenership revenues by $100 million and bringing EBIDTA up by $20 million, reflecting an increase in volume per guest to 10% to 14% and a reduction in our flow improvement by 1% to 3% from last year, which is a slight improvement from our prior guidance.  We expect the provision for loan losses to be approximately 24% for the remainder of the year.  NAS with that, I’ll turn the call back over to Steve.

We had indicated that for the next four years as we’re burning though our inventory the WAM model would probably be somewhere between 15% and 20%.  So that is consistent with what we’ve said in the past.  We get a lot of questions about the WAM model because it’s new and it’s kind of an innovative product that we have that we can offer up.  What we’ve been doing as we went through the strategic plan is we said “Okay, now beyond the four years, looking out five through ten, what could it conceivably look like?  And should we be gearing ourselves towards 100% WAM or 0% WAM?  What should it look like?”
And what we’re doing is we’re balancing both the return that we get on the invested capital as well as cash flow and EBIDTA generation from the traditional model and the new WAM model.  And what we think is that going forward-   Now going forward is five years out so we’re just trying to give people a picture because there’s been a lot of questions about it.  Going five years out it could be 15% to 20% still, it could be more, it could be less.  But we don’t want to make it appear that we’re going to turn the switch completely over and only do the WAM products.
We've always said it’s probably complementary, there’s probably a hybrid approach where we’ll own some of the real estate or some of the inventory and we’ll use some WAM.  And we think that looking out five years and beyond it probably will continue to be a hybrid model and it’s probably not 100% WAM; it’s probably something less than that and it could be somewhere around the level that we’re running at right now.
So it’s hard to predict that far out exactly what the mix will look like, but because we had questions on it we thought we’d give our latest thinking after our strategic planning process.  And one of the tings that’s driving us in looking at all of this is the ROIC that we see and how that plays out beyond the next four years for that particular business unit.
Now with respect to inventory, we have about four years of inventory on the balance sheet right now, and so that, and that’s assuming a mix of you know, 15%, 20% of WAM.  And so it could be four, five years, somewhere in that range.  And it really isn’t impacted by the level of sales that we’re increasing timeshare by. I don’t know if I got all the answers.

If I might just add a couple of other thoughts to what Steve just said.  You know, number one we have said consistently, recently that we ‘re goin to have to spend $100 million to $125-ish million each year on inventory over the next few years and that inventory investment would be adequate to get us trough 2014.  So it takes us through 2014 comfortably.
Now just to touch on a point that Steve made about ROIC.  We’ve been looking at the return profile of the business, balancing it against EBIDTA, and what we saw is that if we streamline our balance sheet and get our inventory levels to a much tighter level than we’ve had historically because of our growth goals for this business, that we can drive a ROIC that’s in the low 20’s, which we expect to be a dramatic improvement from how this business has been profiled historically as we’ve built up the balance sheet to chase this growth.  And so the interim period, the next five years which we describe as our balance sheet streamlining period, will get us to a higher ROIC; and then we looked at various scenarios of WAM and decided that at least at this point that the best balance of EBIDTA growth with an attractive ROIC and positive free cash flow characteristics, at this point in time, would have us as Steve said view this as a complementary source.
I want to also point out one other statement that Steve made, Bob, which is this business now will be generating our company $600 million to $700 million a year in free cash flow over the next four or five years, and beyond then we believe.  And even if we were to invest a bit more in inventory in our timeshare business - let’s say we had to invest another $100 million in inventory into our timeshare business - we would still be generating $600 million to $700 million a year in free cash flow.  And so you know, as Steve said, it’s too early to call for sure but we did want to kind of draw a bit of a line in the sand and suggest that this is going to be a complementary business as we go forward.

Well, let me, I’ll take the first whack at it and then Tom can weigh in as well.

Well, let me, I’ll take the first whack at it and then Tom can weigh in as well.  I don't think that our member numbers, I mean they, I’m just looking at the press release here - down by 5000 members off a base of 3.7 million is meaningful at all.  So I would say that that’s relatively flat, and that’s what we were predicting is that we’d be relatively fat.  And as you know with that business, people can come and go as they want. If they sign up or in our stand membership for one year they may deiced not to sign up and then the next year they come back and they sign up.
So one of the advantages of some of the technology that we've rolled out is we think we can incite people to come back.  So there's a larger base than 3.7 million people out there that own timeshares affiliated with RCI.  One of our jobs is to try to entice those people and reignite them to come back can renew their RCI membership and start doing transactions with us.  So I don’t think there’s anything to be read from that. I think that we’re still very confident with that number and where the member growth will go in the future.
With respect to EPS and the selling of products, I think I’ll point out two things. One is that part of the reason our commission were up this quarter was that we had more new sales because we put more focus on that and we put an incentive on that than we did last year and that was in our original forecast.  So we had a little bit more commission but again, that's not a bad ting in our mind because we were driving new sales.  We want to make sure that we keep that mix going.  So we are focused on bringing in new customers. 
We’ve got a base of I guess 850,000 members who own our product right now, so we’ve got a pretty deep pool that we can think of selling to we believe on the upgrade side.  And bear in mind that about 40%, 50% of the people do upgrade, so it’s a very large population that will continue to upgrade.  So we don’t see a slowdown at all.  And also bear in mind, and then I'll stop and Tom can add anything he wants to add, bear in mind we have added products and we’re adding new product continually.  That new product is something new and exciting for our 850,000 customers so when we added Reunion Resort in Orlando or when we add another product in Myrtle Beach for some of these other WAM projects as well as our own projects that we’re doing, it’s giving more and more reason for people to want to travel, want to stay with us and want to buy more points.

Just a couple quick questions for you on Vacation Owenership.  I think first it would be helpful if you could give us any color on where you think run rate margins are going to look like on the Vacation Owenership business.  Obviously things have jumped around a little bit; you guys have taken a lot of costs out of the stream and margins look like they’re going to be pretty good this year.  Do you think this year’s margins are going to be in line with what you would say run rate over the next several years would look like?  And then the second question I had was as you know, Marriott, one of your competitors in the Vacation Owenership business launched a points-based program.  You guys have been strong advocates of your points-based program and the value it adds to your customers.  I just want to know if you have seen any impact yet on what Marriot’s doing, trying to really conform to part of your business model in timeshare.  If you're seeing any impact at all yet and anything you might be doing to try to combat that would be also helpful.  Thank you.

Most of the costs that we took out frankly was when we downsized that business during the credit crisis and took down the number of offices and sales offices we had.  Now our goal over time with that as well as all the businesses is to improve margins, so basically that is a focus point because we want to continue to drive our profit and drive margins.  
With respect to the second question about Marriott’s points-based system, I did hear that they had launched a points-based system.  They already have one I believe internationally and with that they now are converting to a points-based system.  We applaud them for it; we think points-based systems are more powerful tools. We don’t see any impact on our sales from them just like we didn’t see any impact when we were competing in a particular market and we were both selling weeks 20 years ago.  It’s a bit marketplace.  The sales is made on a one-on-one basis when the consumer is in front of the sales organization, so it’s not like walking down an aisle of a supermarket and deciding which cans of beans to buy. It’s a much more personalized sales approach.  So we don’t see an impact from them having points now, so we are not doing anything to combat it.
We’re consistently improving our points program that we’ve had for a decade as we add improvements, enhancements to make it even more powerful and stronger for our owners.   And that’s another reason that people continually are buying more and more of our products.

Profitability of WAM versus traditional, Mike, is there’s three basic components to it that we were evaluating. One was the return on invested capital; one was the EBIDTA driven by that business; and then the third is the cash flow.  And so we’re looking at all three of those when we try to look at and see what the mix of the business should be.  You’re correct with the WAM model because it’s a simple fee for service model, the ROIC is infinite.  However the EBIDTA would be smaller if all we did was WAM over a long period of time because obviously if you do pure WAM where somebody else is providing the financing, you'll ultimately lose that interest income spread over time unless we’re incentivized to put more business towards WAM and we’re getting a piece of that spread from our partner.
So there’s a lot of moving parts relative to how you want to evaluate it.  But from a straight ROIC you’re correct - WAM would be the best cause it’s infinite, but we think that it ends up being the best to have a mix of the business going forward.  So hopefully that was clear, Mike, as to how we kind of came to that decision process.

So the measure that we use to gauge the profitability of a buyer is what we call VPG, as you know - volume per guest.  And so just to give you a sense of it, the approximate volume per guest of a front-line buyer, a first-time buyer, is around $1400, which is, we probably are break even to making slightly some money on the front-line buyer. 
Now the upgrade, the in-house buyer is almost $1100 higher than that. And so you can see that the profitability formula increases significantly.  So it’s important that we bring in first-time buyers which may cost us more marketing dollars to identity and a higher cost to secure for ultimately a much higher sales down the road. And I think we shared in the past around 60% of our revenue in a given year comes from these in-house, these upgrade buyers.  So having a constant flow of people coming in, which may appear to be less profitable initially, translates ultimately into higher sales through upgrades.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As you saw from the press release, we had another terrific quarter.

As you saw from the press release, we had another terrific quarter. Revenues were up close to 5% and EBITDA increased over 27%, or actually 36% excluding the positive impact of deferred revenue in the third quarter last year. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.68. These results reflect continued superior execution across all of our businesses.
The third quarter is an important one for us, this includes the heavy summer travel months and we saw a great traction across our product offerings around the world. We are encouraged to see a rebound in lodging RevPAR, particularly in the U.S. economy segments, which comprised 2/3 of our hotel portfolio. This contributed to overall RevPAR growth of approximately 7% led by broad-based occupancy gains. As importantly, we're starting to see average daily rates stabilization.
Sales of vacation ownership continue to show strong momentum. As you know, the satisfaction with our Timeshare product was widely demonstrated during the downturn as evidenced by consistent occupancy. We continue to see great traction in sales to new owners as well, bringing 17,000 first-time buyers into the Wyndham family in the first 9 months this year.
In the European Rentals business, Hoseasons, which we acquired in March of this year, added capacity to its 2010 program to address the demand for last minute U.K. holidays during the summer and delivered great results.
In travel industry growth in Asia continues to be promising. Our team recently returned from HICAP, a regional investment conference that's held in Hong Kong. The mood in Asia is bullish. RevPAR increases in China are among those leading the world in the development pace is consistent. China outbound travel is increasingly important to the arrivals in other parts of the region and our leading market presence there should help our awareness and growth in other Asian markets.
Against the backdrop of improving economic conditions, we have continued our focus on superior execution, which is translated to strong financial performance. As a result, we have once again raised our 2010 EBITDA and EPS guidance, which Tom will detail later on the call.
Our preliminary guidance for 2011 points to revenue growth of approximately 5% to 7% and EBITDA growth of 8% to 10% with continued strong free cash flow generation. On our last call, we outlined the framework for how over time disciplined deployment of cash through share repurchases, additional investment on our core businesses and acquisitions of fee-for-service businesses could even double our growth rate. We will continue to pursue these growth initiatives.
We remain keenly focused on cash generation. We expect to generate approximately $600 million in free cash flow this year, excluding the legacy IRS payment that we made and are firmly on track to deliver sustainable annual free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million again next year and beyond.
We intend to use a large portion of that cash to support dividends and share buybacks. We believe our shares represent a great value and offer significant return potential. We acted on this lease in the third quarter, committing $120 million to repurchase 4.8 million shares, a significant step up in our program activity. We also reduced significant future dilution by repurchasing approximately 40% of our convertible bonds in the open market and retiring the call options and warrants tied to those bonds. Tom will walk you through to details a little bit later.
We are also deploying cash to achieve an important strategic imperative, rebalancing our portfolio to emphasize fee-for-service businesses. We have completed 3 acquisitions of this year toward this goal. Hoseasons, which added meaningful inventory to our highly successful U.K. vacation rental business, the Trip brand, a tuck-in opportunity for the Wyndham hotel group that significantly enhance our international presence and in the third quarter, ResortQuest, a leading provider of full service tradition rentals in the U.S., with a portfolio approximately 6,000 rental properties. We will leverage ResortQuest sales organization, market relationships and geographic reach with best practices from our rental operations in Europe to build a meaningful U.S. vacation rentals business.
The U.S. full service rental market is a highly fragmented $10 billion industry with 5,000 companies representing about 550,000 homes and condos and represents a major growth opportunity for us. We welcome the ResortQuest employees to the Wyndham Worldwide family and look forward to serving ResortQuest homeowners and leisure travelers.
An important component of rebalancing the portfolio is our commitment to moderate spending and growth in the vacation ownership business.
We are emphasizing investment in our fee-for-service businesses but we remain committed to the vacation ownership business, which we expect to generate significant free cash flow in mid-single digit EBITDA growth going forward. The business today is stronger and better than it's ever been and the team continues to meet or exceed expectations on every measure.
Tom will share some additional insights on this business in a moment. One of the important insights he will share will address an improving returns profile for the business as we streamline our balance sheet and evolve our alternative business model WAAM, our Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model. We are making good progress in developing WAAM with sales in Myrtle Beach, our first WAAM project ahead of schedule. And sales in Orlando, which we launched in July, tracking to plan. These successes serves to guide project structuring discussions with financial partners.
We have a strategic imperative to grow market share, which we'll achieve by continuing to offer great brands and great service. For almost 2 years now, we've shared with you the great progress RCI is making on driving transactions online. Continued technology enhancements are improving customer service and satisfaction while driving transactions, margin and ultimately market share.
In November, we will release the most significant series of technology enhancements to our members yet. These include improving online search capabilities for more than 1 million RCI points members that will allow them to see more vacation options during additional search criteria. And this new technology will include significant program enhancements for our RCI weeks members that will provide complete training power transparency, allowing members to better understand the training power value of the Timeshare base deposited with RCI and the Timeshare interval they want to exchange into.
Members will have the ability to combine Timeshare intervals they have deposited with RCI to increase trading power and get change back if the training power value of their deposit interval is greater than the interval they are trading into. We believe that as our members become comfortable with these new trading capabilities, we will generate more exchange transactions and also great opportunities for our affiliates and developers to sell more timeshare to owners looking to trade up for higher value vacations.
At the hotel group, we continue to leverage the scale of the largest hotel franchise system in the world to offer consumers a wide range of iconic brands.
We recently added one such brand to our offering when we signed into agreement to license the Planet Hollywood hotel brand. This 20-year master franchise agreement will add an upscale flag for our asset owners looking for a more unique hotel experience that's young, trendy and hip. Another iconic brand, Days In, recently expanded its U.K. portfolio with the opening of 15 hotels, bringing the total numbers of Days In in the U.K. to nearly 60 and establishing a clear presence for us in the U.K. budget hotel sector.
And of course, we remain sharply focused on building the Wyndham Hotel and Resorts brand. A central strategy since our formation as an independent public company has been the lever synergies between our business units, particularly between the hotel group and vacation ownership.
In may 2006, we announced development of a Wyndham Grand Hotel to be built adjacent to our Bonnet Creek Vacation Ownership Resort, a unique opportunity to establish a world-class Wyndham hotel just outside the Gates of Disney World.
We broke ground in that project in April 2008 but decided soon or after to slow development. Like everyone else in the world, we were unsure as to how long the downturn would last and what profile the recovery would take. We have now decided to resume our original plans and will finish the project, which is half complete. And we'll make it and own and managed Wyndham Grand Hotel, which we expect to open late next year. We believe the benefit of having a flagship Wyndham hotel at this location and the expected returns justify the commitment of capital in this case, a rare but appropriate exception to our asset-light business model.
We continue to gain traction in Asia, most notably with the Wyndham brand. We recently signed 3 new luxury hotels in China, strengthening our position as the largest U.S.-based hotel company in China with 270 hotels representing over 400,000 rooms. With these new signings, there are now 12 Wyndham-branded hotels currently open or under development in China.
Great brands and great service are the cumulative result of day-to-day actions by our highly engaged employees. In September, we had an opportunity to celebrate our success in building great brands and providing great service. We had our first ever Wyndham hotel group global conference in Las Vegas, bringing together all of our owners and general managers, as well as employees and over 150 suppliers.
We had over 5,000 attendees, far above our expectation and the atmosphere was absolutely energized. There was heavy emphasis on our policy strategies, which are designed to enhance each of our 12 brands value propositions and to help our owners run their businesses more effectively and profitably.
Our franchisees benefited from 40 unique educational sessions with a focus on revenue generation, customer experience and leadership. All told, we delivered over 8,000 training impressions. It was a great celebration of our brands and the value we bring to our franchisees, as well as to consumers.
Before turning the call over to Tom, I want to discuss another celebration that included our customers, employees and our communities. The restoration of our Wyndham Timeshare Resort in Nashville, which was seriously impacted by regional flooding in early May, was the embodiment of our Count on Me service philosophy. As planning began, Wyndham Associates responded to the crisis putting their safety and well-being behind those of nearly 500 owners and guests. Some waded through 4 feet of water to help move those affected to higher level units while others worked with electrical equipment in wet conditions to minimize potential injury or damage to the resort. All of this before knowing what the impact of flooding had on their own homes and families.
Throughout the renovation, we made every effort to use local businesses, aiding the local economy and employing many residents who may otherwise have been without a job. We also recognized the need to support Nashville's long-term recovery and through wishes by Wyndham made a donation to the community foundation of Middle Tennessee. The reopening of our 252-unit resort came earlier than expected. And on September 30, we celebrated with a grand reopening event with nearly 90% occupancy, delivering a great experience to the many owners who were delighted to return to the resort.
We are very proud of our response and accomplishments during this challenge and know that we lived up to our core values. I will now turn the call over to Tom who will provide you with additional perspective and details our results and outlook. Tom?"
31063165,113970356,163249,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thank you, Steve. As you saw from the press release this morning and as Steve noted, we posted another strong quarter. Adjusted earnings per share increased 17%, reflecting strength in our Hotel and Vacation Ownership businesses, a lower tax rate and high",2079,"Thank you, Steve. As you saw from the press release this morning and as Steve noted, we posted another strong quarter. Adjusted earnings per share increased 17%, reflecting strength in our Hotel and Vacation Ownership businesses, a lower tax rate and higher RevPAR. We beat our earnings expectations coming in $0.04 above of the top end of the range.
Adjusted EPS excludes a $38 million after-tax gain related to the settlement of the contingent tax liability, which we discussed last quarter. Partially offset by a $6 million after-tax loss associated with the repurchase of 40% of our convertible notes and related warrants. Now turning to our capital markets activity in quarter 3. As you know, our convertible bond structure generates increasing share dilution for share prices above $20. In the quarter, we purchased 40% of the notes and related warrants for $467 million net, eliminating in what could been significant future dilution.
In addition, this effort led to a direct reduction in diluted shares outstanding of 1.4 million shares, of which we will see the full effect in the fourth quarter. Now beyond the accounting benefits, we believe this process will also enable us to create true economic value, as we believe our share price will exceed the total cost of buying these warrants.
We also issued $250 million of senior notes in September, capitalizing on historically low rates and primarily used the proceeds to pay down the balance of our corporate revolver. Our overall debt balance at quarter end was essentially unchanged from year end 2009 and well within our targeted investment grade range.
Turning to the ABS capital markets, last week, we announced and ABS deal with advance rates and cost characteristics in line with those deals we did prior to the economic downturn. We issued $300 million in Timeshare receivable notes at an advanced rate of 88% and an all-in yield of 3.7%. The transaction was oversubscribed and we couldn't be happier with the execution. In addition, earlier in the month, we renewed our $600 million ABS conduit facility. The spread tightened by 200 basis points compared to the 2009 facility and the advance rate improved slightly to 51.5%.
Net cash from operations was approximately $528 million for the first 9 months of 2010, a 7% decrease compared with the prior-year period, reflecting the $145 million net payment to the IRS with legacy tax issues.
Now free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities, less CapEx, equity investments and development advances and excluding cash payments related to contingent IRS tax liabilities increased over 24% to $564 million for the first 9 months, compared with $454 million for the same period in 2009.
As you know, we believe that cash is the great enabler for many of our companies' goals and will help to accelerate our EPS growth with share buybacks and tuck-in acquisitions. As a reminder, we now expect our free cash flow in 2010 to be at the upper end of the $500 million to $600 million range excluding the payment related to the contingent IRS tax liability. And we are projecting sustainable free cash flow of $600 to $700 million in 2011 and beyond.
As Steve said, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. As you saw from the press release, we continue to repurchase shares, buying 8.3 million shares since we reinstated the program in February through yesterday at an average price of $25.06. We have $285 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.
Now moving to operating performance for the quarter, let's begin the segment review starting with Wyndham Vacation Ownership. We recently embarked upon an effort to help educate insert investors about our vacation ownership business. We've posted a presentation on our website, which we encourage you to review. It makes some very important points about this business.
Our first point is that the Wyndham Vacation Ownership business has higher-than-perceived business qualities and an improving return profile, specifically the business will enjoy improving returns as the company streamlines its balance sheet. The business will generate significant amounts of recurring free cash flow, recurring income associated with property management fees, recurring interest income associated with our large pool of receivables and recurring sales driven by upgrades from a deeply loyal customer base.
Our second point is while this business is strong, we are taking steps to further strengthen the financial profile of this business through the development of our asset-light business model,  WAAM and the rightsizing of our business, which has led to a superior buyer profile.
Third, improvement in the financial market will further support and enhance business profitability. Fourth, from an accounting perspective, our Vacation Ownership business has been simplified and is transparent. Fifth, we believe we have the best management team in the industry. And finally, we understand the vacation ownership buyer and believe that the demand profile for this business will be strong for many years to come.
Now, we are going to be aggressively rolling out this message at conferences and meetings in the coming months and we look forward to engaging many of you in a dialogue about these very important points. In the meantime, this business once again delivered excellent results in the quarter. Revenues were up 5% despite the benefit of $36 million in deferred revenue in 2009. The revenue increase reflects a $32 million reduction in the provision for loan losses and $12 million in WAAM commissions. EBITDA increased 41% from the third quarter and I know excluding the prior year EBITDA benefit associated with the deferred revenue rolling. The increase reflected exceptionally strong execution in the business and the lower provision for loan loss. Our key performance business driver, volume per guest, was up 7% from third quarter 2009, reflecting continued strong pricing and close rates. Tours in the third quarter increased 8% from the same period last year, reflecting better penetration into the existing owner base and stronger outreach to new owners. 
These achievements resulted in a 260 basis point improvement in margin for this business unit. It's our goal to continue to build our new ownership base to develop a larger pool of lifetime buyers of vacation ownership. We expect to acquire over 20,000 new owners this year, which is the targeted level we need to replenish our group of potential future upgrades.
Property management revenues increased 8%, primarily reflecting an increase in managed units. Consumer finance revenues were relatively flat while interest expense declined 23%, reflecting lower interest rates on our securitized debt.
On the consumer financing front, delinquency and default rates in the portfolio continue to improve. Write-offs during the third quarter declined to 2.3% of the overall portfolio, from 3.4% in the third quarter of 2009. The provision for loan losses was $85 million or 22% of gross VOI sales, net of WAAM sales, down from 32% in the third quarter of 2009.
Now moving to the Wyndham Hotel group, revenues were up 11%, EBITDA increased 16% and margin improved 130 basis points, reflecting a RevPAR rebound, increased transfer in termination fees and some benefit from expense planning. Systemwide RevPAR increased 6.7%.
Our domestic economy segment was up 6% with days in, Super 8, Microtel and our other economy brands seeing positive RevPAR comparisons for the first time since 2007. Internationally, we are seeing pockets of dramatic improvement's, compared to the third quarter of last year, RevPAR in constant currency increased 11% and 22%, respectively, in the U.K. and Germany. And in China, RevPAR was up 23% reflecting occupancy gains of 15% and rate gains of 7%.
Gross room openings, excluding the trip acquisition, are up close to 20% for the year, but are being offset by terminations, which are up 28% year-to-date, reflecting financial difficulties for our franchisees consistent with our earlier signals on bad debt. These terminations could push us to the lower end of our room guidance despite our strong room openings.
The franchise sales team did a great job of replenishing the pipeline despite the strong opening, resulting in a pipeline of close to 108,000 rooms, flat sequentially. Year-to-date, contract signings were up 7% compared with last year and we have executed 254 conversion deals compared with 206 during the first 9 months of 2009, a 23% increase. Integration of the trip acquisition is progressing well. Last week, we signed an agreement for our first trip by Wyndham property in North America, a 173-room hotel in Midtown, Manhattan that we will manage. The hotel is under construction now and is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2011.
Moving on to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, this business once again delivered solid results in spite of $4 million in higher value-added taxes in response to recent legislation. Excluding the net effect of foreign currency, revenues were up 5% and adjusted EBITDA was flat in the third quarter 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Hoseasons contributed $9 million to revenues and we are very pleased with the integration and performance of this business. As Steve mentioned, the business performed very well through the summer. The Hoseasons group, which includes all of our U.K. rental brand and is the biggest operator of U.K. holidays added nearly 1,500 extra units of accommodation to its 2010 holiday parks and lodges program to address burgeoning demand for summer holidays at home. The company experienced a 21% lift in sales of U.K. Park and Lodge holidays in August compared with the same period in 2009.
Wyndham Exchange and Rental performance drivers were close as it with our expectations, demonstrating again the stability of this business. Average number of exchange members and exchange revenue per member were flat. Vacation rental transactions were up and average net price per vacation rental were down, reflecting the total for acquisition. 
As Steve spoke of the great progress we're making on online technology initiatives at RCI and I'm pleased to report that RCI online Web share with 30% in the third quarter 2010 compared to 23% in the third quarter 2009.
North America online web share for the weeks exchange program has reached 42% in the third quarter 2010, doubling our online share of 21% for the same period in 2008 when we began our initiative to enhance rci.com and increase online transactions.
Now moving to corporate, our effective tax rate was 33.6%, reflecting the tax credit that we discussed last quarter. Excluding legacy-related items, corporate expenses were up by $10 million, primarily reflecting increased data security and IT expenses and tax consulting charges. Turning to guidance, as you saw from the press release, we are increasing our full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance to $855 to $865 million, which reflects an increase in vacation ownership EBITDA to $425 to $445 million, partially offset by higher corporate costs.
We now expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.94 to $1.98. We are increasing vacation ownership tour guidance to 2% to 4% versus last year, as we seek to reach our new ownership target. We expect fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.40 to $0.44, assuming our quarter 3 diluted share count of 184 million shares and an approximate tax rate of 24%.
Now 2 notes on the fourth quarter. First, included in our guidance, Exchange and Rentals results will include approximately $6 million in EBITDA losses associated with ResortQuest. As the fourth quarter is a seasonally low revenue, high expense in the U.S. Rentals business. Second, there may be some additional movement of the tax rate as we work through the review of foreign tax credits we discussed in our last call. Our current best view is that full-year tax rate to be approximately 33% in 2010, about 38% next year and then approach a more normalized rate to 39% beginning in 2012. As Steve mentioned, and as you saw from the press release, we're giving you our first look at our 2011 outlook with revenue guidance of $4 billion to $4.2 billion, up approximately 5% to 7% from 2010 and EBITDA guidance of $925 million to $955 million, up 8% to 10% from 2010. 
Also, we expect free cash flow of $600 to $700 million in 2011 and beyond. And remember the compounding effect of that cash property deployed could double our baseline EBITDA and earnings growth on a per-share basis through 2014. Finally, we'll share P&L and business unit guidance with you in February. And with that, I'd like to turn the call back to Steve."

The FICO score is a bit higher but who we're selling to now, because of our marketing and our tightening of our credit statistics, that kind of gives you the demographic layout of the customer. From a mix of new customers versus upgrade sales, clearly over the last 18 months, we've seen an increase in the upgrade sales to our existing customers, but we've never lost focus on bringing in new customers. As Tom mentioned, we have a goal of 20,000 new customers to be brought in this year. We brought in 17,000 in the first 9 months, so we're right on track to meet or exceed that goal. And if you talk to the folks down in Orlando managing the business, they would say their own internal numbers are actually above what we've given them as a goal. So we will continue to focus on bringing in new customers. We need that new, fresh ownership base to be adding in our 820,000 customers that we have in our portfolio right now.

In other cases, we'll participate in one or the other portion of that. So clearly, the environment right now is very attractive for us to hit the ABS market, but we're building this business model, WAAM, to take down our balance sheet to provide a greater ROIC on that Timeshare business.

We've never, Mike, I think downplayed our fee-for-service businesses. Obviously that's been our focal point from day one. But I think what you maybe referring to is we kind of put a parameter about how large our WAAM business, our asset affiliation model and Timeshare might be, and we did that because we were trying to respond to a lot of questions we had gotten about how big will that business be, how much of our business will be the pure WAAM model going forward. So we weren't trying to downplay as much as we were trying to just give people a sense of what we thought it could be over the next few years, and we gave a parameter, I think, 20% to 25% -- 15% to 20%. Excuse me, 15% to 20%, is our parameter we think it will be fine -- 10% to 15% in 2011 and that it will grow in the out years. So the return profile, just going to that part of the question is a that business versus more of our more asset-heavy business, which we're actually have product that we've built and we're selling on the Timeshare side is really quite different. In the asset affiliation model, we have no capital at work in the pure model so our return is like our franchise business is pretty much infinite. With respect to our asset model, where we are actually are building product and selling it. Our returns are -- what we talked about in the past, 40% plus IRRs on those deals that we're doing but it requires -- obviously the capital be tied up in order to do those deals.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As you saw from the press release, we had another terrific quarter.

As you saw from the press release, we had another terrific quarter. Revenues were up close to 5%, and EBITDA increased over 27% or actually 36% excluding the positive impact of deferred revenue in the third quarter of last year. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.68. These results reflect continued superior execution across all of our businesses.
The third quarter is an important one for us. This includes the heavy summer travel months, and we saw a great traction across our product offerings around the world. We are encouraged to see a rebound in lodging RevPAR, particularly in the U.S. economy segments, which comprised 2/3 of our hotel portfolio. This contributed to overall RevPAR growth of approximately 7%, led by broad-based occupancy gains. As importantly, we're starting to see average daily rates stabilization.
Sales of vacation ownership continued to show strong momentum. As you know, the satisfaction with our timeshare product was widely demonstrated during the downturn as evidenced by consistent occupancy. We continue to see great traction in sales to new owners as well, bringing 17,000 first-time buyers into the Wyndham family in the first 9 months of this year.
In the European rentals business, Hoseasons, which we acquired in March of this year, added capacity to its 2010 program to address demand for last-minute U.K. holidays during the summer and delivered great results.
In travel industry growth in Asia continues to be promising. Our team recently returned from HICAP, a regional investment conference that's held in Hong Kong. The mood in Asia is bullish. RevPAR increases in China are among those leading the world, and the development pace is consistent. China outbound travel is increasingly important to the arrivals in other parts of the region, and our leading market presence there should help our awareness and growth in other Asian markets.
Against the backdrop of improving economic conditions, we have continued our focus on superior execution, which is translated to strong financial performance. As a result, we have once again raised our 2010 EBITDA and EPS guidance, which Tom will detail later on the call.
Our preliminary guidance for 2011 points to revenue growth of approximately 5% to 7% and EBITDA growth of 8% to 10%, with continued strong free cash flow generation. On our last call, we outlined the framework for how, over time, disciplined deployment of cash through share repurchases, additional investment on our core businesses and acquisitions of fee-for-service businesses could even double our growth rate. We will continue to pursue these growth initiatives.
We remain keenly focused on cash generation. We expect to generate approximately $600 million in free cash flow this year, excluding the legacy IRS payment that we made, and are firmly on track to deliver sustainable annual free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million again next year and beyond.
We intend to use a large portion of that cash to support dividends and share buybacks. We believe our shares represent a great value and offer significant return potential. We acted on this lease in the third quarter, committing $120 million to repurchase 4.8 million shares, a significant step-up in our program activity. We also reduced significant future dilution by repurchasing approximately 40% of our convertible bonds in the open market and retiring the call options and warrants tied to those bonds. Tom will walk you through the details a little bit later.
We are also deploying cash to achieve an important strategic imperative, rebalancing our portfolio to emphasize fee-for-service businesses. We have completed 3 acquisitions this year toward this goal: Hoseasons, which added meaningful inventory to our highly-successful U.K. vacation rental business; the TRYP brand, a tuck-in opportunity for the Wyndham Hotel Group that significantly enhanced our international presence; and in the third quarter, ResortQuest, a leading provider of full service vacation rentals in the U.S., with a portfolio of approximately 6,000 rental properties. We will leverage ResortQuest sales organization, market relationships and geographic reach with best practices from our rental operations in Europe to build a meaningful U.S. vacation rentals business.
The U.S. full service rental market is a highly fragmented $10 billion industry with 5,000 companies representing about 550,000 homes and condos and represents a major growth opportunity for us. We welcome the ResortQuest employees to the Wyndham Worldwide family and look forward to serving ResortQuest homeowners and leisure travelers.
An important component of rebalancing the portfolio is our commitment to moderate spending and growth in the vacation ownership business. We are emphasizing investment in our fee-for-service businesses, but we remain committed to the vacation ownership business, which we expect to generate significant free cash flow in mid single-digit EBITDA growth going forward. The business today is stronger and better than it's ever been, and the team continues to meet or exceed expectations on every measure.
Tom will share some additional insights on this business in a moment. One of the important insights he will share will address an improving returns profile for the business as we streamline our balance sheet and evolve our alternative business model WAAM, our Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model. We're making good progress in developing WAAM with sales in Myrtle Beach, our first WAAM project, ahead of schedule, and sales in Orlando, which we launched in July, tracking to plan. These successes serve to guide our multi-project structuring discussions with financial partners.
We have a strategic imperative to grow market share, which we'll achieve by continuing to offer great brands and great service. For almost 2 years now, we've shared with you the great progress RCI is making on driving transactions online. Continued technology enhancements are improving customer service and satisfaction while driving transactions, margin and ultimately, market share.
In November, we will release the most significant series of technology enhancements to our members yet. These include improving online search capabilities for our more than 1 million RCI Points members that will allow them to see more vacation options using additional search criteria. And this new technology will include significant program enhancements for our RCI Weeks members that will provide complete training power transparency, allowing members to better understand the training power value of the timeshare interval date deposited with RCI and the timeshare interval they want to exchange into.
Members will have the ability to combine timeshare intervals they have deposited with RCI to increase trading power and get change back if the training power value of their deposited interval is greater than the interval they are trading into. We believe that as our members become comfortable with these new trading capabilities, we will generate more exchange transactions and also create opportunities for our affiliates and developers to sell more timeshare to owners looking to trade up for higher value vacations.
At the hotel group, we continue to leverage the scale of the largest hotel franchise system in the world to offer consumers a wide range of iconic brands.  We recently added one such brand to our offering when we signed an agreement to license the Planet Hollywood hotel brand. This 20-year master franchise agreement will add an upscale flag for our asset owners looking for a more unique hotel experience that's young, trendy and hip. 
Another iconic brand, Days Inn, recently expanded its U.K. portfolio with the opening of 15 hotels, bringing the total numbers of Days Inn in the U.K. to nearly 60 and establishing a clear presence for us in the U.K. budget hotel sector.
And of course, we remain sharply focused on building the Wyndham Hotel and Resorts brand. A central strategy since our formation as an independent public company has been the leverage synergies between our business units, particularly between the hotel group and vacation ownership.
In May 2006, we announced development of a Wyndham Grand Hotel to be built adjacent to our Bonnet Creek Vacation Ownership Resort, a unique opportunity to establish a world-class Wyndham Hotel just outside the gates of Disney World.
We broke ground in that project in April 2008 but decided soon thereafter to slow development. Like everyone else in the world, we were unsure as to how long the downturn would last and what profile the recovery would take. We have now decided to resume our original plans and will finish the project, which is half complete. And we'll make it an owned and managed Wyndham Grand Hotel, which we expect to open late next year. We believe the benefit of having a flagship Wyndham Hotel at this location and the expected returns justify the commitment of capital in this case, a rare but appropriate exception to our asset-light business model.
We continue to gain traction in Asia, most notably with the Wyndham brand. We recently signed 3 new luxury hotels in China, strengthening our position as the largest U.S.-based hotel company in China with 270 hotels representing over 400,000 rooms. With these new signings, there are now 12 Wyndham-branded hotels currently open or under development in China.
Great brands and great service are the cumulative result of day-to-day actions by our highly-engaged employees. In September, we had an opportunity to celebrate our success in building great brands and providing great service. We held our first ever Wyndham Hotel Group Global Conference in Las Vegas, bringing together all of our owners and general managers, as well as employees and over 150 suppliers.
We had over 5,000 attendees, far above our expectation, and the atmosphere was absolutely energized. There was heavy emphasis on Apollo strategies, which are designed to enhance each of our 12 brands' value propositions and to help our owners run their businesses more effectively and profitably.
Our franchisees benefited from 40 unique educational sessions with a focus on revenue generation, customer experience and leadership. All told, we delivered over 8,000 training impressions. It was a great celebration of our brands and the value we bring to our franchisees, as well as to consumers.
Before turning the call over to Tom, I want to discuss another celebration that included our customers, employees and our communities. The restoration of our Wyndham Timeshare Resort in Nashville, which was seriously impacted by regional flooding in early May, was the embodiment of our Count on Me service philosophy. As flooding began, Wyndham associates responded to the crisis, putting their safety and well-being behind those of nearly 500 owners and guests. Some waded through 4 feet of water to help move those affected to higher level units, while others worked with electrical equipment in wet conditions to minimize potential injury or damage to the resort, all of this before knowing what the impact of flooding had on their own homes and families.
Throughout the renovation, we made every effort to use local businesses, aiding the local economy and employing many residents who may otherwise have been without a job. We also recognized the need to support Nashville's long-term recovery and through wishes by Wyndham, made a donation to the community foundation of Middle Tennessee. The reopening of our 252-unit resort came earlier than expected, and on September 30, we celebrated with a grand reopening event with nearly 90% occupancy, delivering a great experience to the many owners who were delighted to return to the resort.
We are very proud of our response and accomplishments during this challenge and know that we lived up to our core values. I'll now turn the call over to Tom who will provide you with additional perspective and details on our results and outlook. Tom?"
31063165,113970356,163311,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thank you, Steve. As you saw from the press release this morning and as Steve noted, we posted another strong quarter. Adjusted earnings per share increased 17%, reflecting strength in our hotel and vacation ownership businesses, a lower tax rate and high",2073,"Thank you, Steve. As you saw from the press release this morning and as Steve noted, we posted another strong quarter. Adjusted earnings per share increased 17%, reflecting strength in our hotel and vacation ownership businesses, a lower tax rate and higher RevPAR. We beat our earnings expectations coming in $0.04 above the top end of the range.
Adjusted EPS excludes a $38 million after-tax gain related to the settlement of the contingent tax liability, which we discussed last quarter, partially offset by a $6 million after-tax loss associated with the repurchase of 40% of our convertible notes and related warrants. 
Now turning to our capital markets activity in quarter 3. As you know, our convertible bond structure generates increasing share dilution for share prices above $20. In the quarter, we purchased 40% of the notes and related warrants for $167 million net, eliminating what could be significant future dilution.
In addition, this effort led to a direct reduction in diluted shares outstanding of 1.4 million shares, of which we will see the full effect in the fourth quarter. Now beyond the accounting benefits, we believe this process will also enable us to create true economic value, as we believe our share price will exceed the total cost of buying these warrants.
We also issued $250 million of senior notes in September, capitalizing on historically low rates and primarily used the proceeds to pay down the balance of our corporate revolver. Our overall debt balance at quarter end was essentially unchanged from year-end 2009 and well within our targeted investment grade range.
Turning to the ABS capital markets, last week, we announced an ABS deal with advance rates and cost characteristics in line with those of deals we did prior to the economic downturn. We issued $300 million in timeshare receivable notes at an advanced rate of 88% and an all-in yield of 3.7%. The transaction was oversubscribed, and we couldn't be happier with the execution. In addition, earlier in the month, we renewed our $600 million ABS conduit facility. The spread tightened by 200 basis points compared to the 2009 facility, and the advance rate improved slightly to 51.5%.
Net cash from operations was approximately $528 million for the first 9 months of 2010, a 7% decrease compared with the prior-year period, reflecting the $145 million net payment to the IRS for legacy tax issues.
Now free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities, less CapEx, equity investments and development advances and excluding cash payments related to contingent IRS tax liabilities, increased over 24% to $564 million for the first 9 months compared with $454 million for the same period in 2009.
As you know, we believe that cash is the great enabler for many of our company's goals and will help to accelerate our EPS growth with share buybacks and tuck-in acquisitions. As a reminder, we now expect our free cash flow in 2010 to be at the upper end of the $500 million to $600 million range, excluding the payment related to the contingent IRS tax liability. And we are projecting sustainable free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million in 2011 and beyond.
As Steve said, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. And as you saw from the press release, we continue to repurchase shares, buying 8.3 million shares since we reinstated the program in February through yesterday at an average price of $25.06. We have $285 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.
Now moving to operating performance for the quarter, let's begin the segment review starting with Wyndham Vacation Ownership. We have recently embarked upon an effort to help educate investors about our vacation ownership business. We've posted a presentation on our website which we encourage you to review. It makes some very important points about this business.
Our first point is that the Wyndham Vacation Ownership business has higher-than-perceived business qualities and an improving return profile. Specifically, the business will enjoy improving returns as the company streamlines its balance sheet. The business will generate significant amounts of recurring free cash flow, recurring income associated with property management fees, recurring interest income associated with our large pool of receivables and recurring sales driven by upgrades from a deeply loyal customer base.
Our second point is while this business is strong, we are taking steps to further strengthen the financial profile of this business through the development of our asset-light business model,  WAAM, and the rightsizing of our business, which has led to a superior buyer profile.
Third, improvement in the financial markets will further support enhanced business profitability. Fourth, from an accounting perspective, our vacation ownership business has been simplified and is transparent. Fifth, we believe we have the best management team in the industry. And finally, we understand the vacation ownership buyer and believe that the demand profile for this business will be strong for many years to come.
Now, we're going to be aggressively rolling this message out at conferences and meetings in the coming months, and we look forward to engaging many of you in a dialogue about these very important points. In the meantime, this business once again delivered excellent results in the quarter. Revenues were up 5% despite the benefit of $36 million in deferred revenue in 2009. The revenue increase reflects a $32 million reduction in the provision for loan losses and $12 million in WAAM commissions. EBITDA increased 41% from the third quarter of 2009, excluding the prior year EBITDA benefit associated with the deferred revenue rolling. The increase reflected exceptionally strong execution in the business and the lower provision for loan loss. 
Our key performance business driver, volume per guest, was up 7% from third quarter 2009, reflecting continued strong pricing and close rates. Tours in the third quarter increased 8% from the same period last year, reflecting better penetration into the existing owner base and stronger outreach to new owners. 
These achievements resulted in a 260-basis-point improvement in margin for this business unit. It's our goal to continue to build our new ownership base to develop a larger pool of lifetime buyers of vacation ownership. We expect to acquire over 20,000 new owners this year, which is the targeted level we need to replenish our group of potential future upgrades.
Property management revenues increased 8%, primarily reflecting an increase in managed units. Consumer finance revenues were relatively flat, while interest expense declined 23%, reflecting lower interest rates on our securitized debt.
On the consumer financing front, delinquency and default rates in the portfolio continue to improve. Write-offs during the third quarter declined to 2.3% of the overall portfolio from 3.4% in the third quarter of 2009. The provision for loan losses was $85 million or 22% of gross VOI sales, net of WAAM sales, down from 32% in the third quarter of 2009.
Now moving to the Wyndham Hotel Group. Revenues were up 11%, EBITDA increased 16% and margin improved 130 basis points, reflecting a RevPAR rebound, increased transfer in termination fees and some benefit from expense planning. Systemwide RevPAR increased 6.7%.
Our domestic economy segment was up 6% with Days Inn, Super 8, Microtel and our other economy brands, seeing positive RevPAR comparisons for the first time since 2007. Internationally, we're seeing pockets of dramatic improvement. Compared with the third quarter of last year, RevPAR in constant currency increased 11% and 22% respectively in the U.K. and Germany. And in China, RevPAR was up 23%, reflecting occupancy gains of 15% and rate gains of 7%.
Gross room openings, excluding the TRYP acquisition, are up close to 20% for the year but are being offset by terminations, which are up 28% year-to-date, reflecting financial difficulties for our franchisees, consistent with our earlier signals on bad debt. These terminations could push us to the lower end of our room guidance despite our strong room openings.
The franchise sales team did a great job of replenishing the pipeline despite the strong opening, resulting in a pipeline of close to 108,000 rooms, flat sequentially. Year-to-date, contract signings were up 7% compared with last year, and we have executed 254 conversion deals compared with 206 during the first 9 months of 2009, a 23% increase. Integration of the TRYP acquisition is progressing well. Last week, we signed an agreement for our first TRYP by Wyndham property in North America, a 173-room hotel in Midtown, Manhattan that we will manage. The hotel is under construction now and is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2011.
Moving on to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, this business once again delivered solid results in spite of $4 million in higher value-added taxes in response to recent legislation. Excluding the net effect of foreign currency, revenues were up 5%, and adjusted EBITDA was flat in the third quarter 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. 
Hoseasons contributed $9 million to revenues, and we're very pleased with the integration and performance of this business. As Steve mentioned, the business performed very well through the summer. The Hoseasons group, which includes all of our U.K. rental brands and is the biggest operator of U.K. holidays, added nearly 1,500 extra units of accommodation to its 2010 holiday parks and lodges program to address burgeoning demand for summer holidays at home. The company experienced a 21% lift in sales of U.K. park and lodge holidays in August compared with the same period in 2009.
Wyndham Exchange and Rentals performance drivers were consistent with our expectations, demonstrating again the stability of this business. Average number of exchange members and exchange revenue per member were flat. Vacation rental transactions were up, and average net price per vacation rental was down, reflecting the Hoseasons acquisition. 
As Steve spoke of the great progress we are making on technology initiatives at RCI, and I'm pleased to report that RCI online web share was 30% in the third quarter 2010 compared to 23% in the third quarter 2009. North America online web share for the weeks exchange program has reached 42% in the third quarter 2010, doubling our online share of 21% for the same period in 2008 when we began our initiative to enhance RCI.com and increase online transactions.
Now moving to corporate. Our effective tax rate was 33.6%, reflecting the tax credits that we discussed last quarter. Excluding legacy-related items, corporate expenses were up by $10 million, primarily reflecting increased data security and IT expenses and tax consulting charges. 
Turning to guidance, as you saw from the press release, we are increasing our full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance to $855 million to $865 million, which reflects an increase in vacation ownership EBITDA to $425 million to $445 million, partially offset by higher corporate costs.
We now expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.94 to $1.98. We are increasing vacation ownership tour guidance to 2% to 4% versus last year as we seek to reach our new ownership target. We expect fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.40 to $0.44, assuming our quarter 3 diluted share count of 184 million shares and an approximate tax rate of 24%.
Now 2 notes on the fourth quarter. First, included in our guidance, exchange and rentals results will include approximately $6 million in EBITDA losses associated with ResortQuest, as the fourth quarter is a seasonally low revenue high expense in the U.S. rentals business. Second, there may be some additional movement in the tax rate as we work through the review of foreign tax credits we discussed on our last call. 
Our current best view is that full-year tax rate to be approximately 33% in 2010, about 38% next year and then approach a more normalized rate of 39% beginning in 2012. As Steve mentioned and as you saw from the press release, we're giving you our first look at our 2011 outlook, with revenue guidance of $4 billion to $4.2 billion, up approximately 5% to 7% from 2010, and EBITDA guidance of $925 million to $955 million, up 8% to 10% from 2010. 
Also, we expect free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million in 2011 and beyond. And remember, the compounding effect of that cash properly deployed could double our baseline EBITDA and earnings growth on a per-share basis through 2014. Finally, we'll share a P&L and business unit guidance with you in February. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back to Steve."

The FICO score is a bit higher about who we're selling to now because of our marketing and our tightening of our credit statistics. That kind of gives you the demographic layout of the customer. From a mix of new customers versus upgrade sales, clearly, over the last 18 months, we've seen an increase in the upgrade sales to our existing customers, but we've never lost focus on bringing in new customers. As Tom mentioned, we have a goal of 20,000 new customers to be brought in this year. We brought in 17,000 in the first 9 months. So we're right on track to meet or exceed that goal. And if you talk to the folks down in Orlando managing the business, they would say their own internal numbers are actually above what we've given them as a goal. So we will continue to focus on bringing in new customers. We need that new, fresh ownership base to be adding to our 820,000 customers that we have in our portfolio right now.

As to doing financing of WAAM deals, I think from the beginning, we've said that it will probably a hybrid approach where in some cases, people will bring product and financing to the table. In other cases, we'll participate in one or the other portion of that. So clearly, the environment right now is very attractive for us to hit the ABS market.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As you saw from the press release, we had another terrific quarter.

As you saw from the press release, we had another terrific quarter. Revenues were up close to 5%, and EBITDA increased over 27% or actually 36% excluding the positive impact of deferred revenue in the third quarter of last year. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.68. These results reflect continued superior execution across all of our businesses.
The third quarter is an important one for us. This includes the heavy summer travel months, and we saw a great traction across our product offerings around the world. We are encouraged to see a rebound in lodging RevPAR, particularly in the U.S. economy segments, which comprised 2/3 of our hotel portfolio. This contributed to overall RevPAR growth of approximately 7%, led by broad-based occupancy gains. As importantly, we're starting to see average daily rates stabilization.
Sales of vacation ownership continued to show strong momentum. As you know, the satisfaction with our timeshare product was widely demonstrated during the downturn as evidenced by consistent occupancy. We continue to see great traction in sales to new owners as well, bringing 17,000 first-time buyers into the Wyndham family in the first 9 months of this year.
In the European rentals business, Hoseasons, which we acquired in March of this year, added capacity to its 2010 program to address demand for last-minute U.K. holidays during the summer and delivered great results.
In travel industry, growth in Asia continues to be promising. Our team recently returned from HICAP, a regional investment conference that's held in Hong Kong. The mood in Asia is bullish. RevPAR increases in China are among those leading the world, and the development pace is consistent. China outbound travel is increasingly important to the arrivals in other parts of the region, and our leading market presence there should help our awareness and growth in other Asian markets.
Against the backdrop of improving economic conditions, we have continued our focus on superior execution, which is translated to strong financial performance. As a result, we have once again raised our 2010 EBITDA and EPS guidance, which Tom will detail later on the call.
Our preliminary guidance for 2011 points to revenue growth of approximately 5% to 7% and EBITDA growth of 8% to 10%, with continued strong free cash flow generation. On our last call, we outlined the framework for how, over time, disciplined deployment of cash through share repurchases, additional investment in our core businesses and acquisitions of fee-for-service businesses could even double our growth rate. We will continue to pursue these growth initiatives.
We remain keenly focused on cash generation. We expect to generate approximately $600 million in free cash flow this year, excluding the legacy IRS payment that we made, and are firmly on track to deliver sustainable annual free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million again next year and beyond.
We intend to use a large portion of that cash to support dividends and share buybacks. We believe our shares represent a great value and offer significant return potential. We acted on this lease in the third quarter, committing $120 million to repurchase 4.8 million shares, a significant step-up in our program activity. We also reduced significant future dilution by repurchasing approximately 40% of our convertible bonds in the open market and retiring the call options and warrants tied to those bonds. Tom will walk you through the details a little bit later.
We are also deploying cash to achieve an important strategic imperative, rebalancing our portfolio to emphasize fee-for-service businesses. We have completed 3 acquisitions this year toward this goal: Hoseasons, which added meaningful inventory to our highly-successful U.K. vacation rental business; the TRYP brand, a tuck-in opportunity for the Wyndham Hotel Group that significantly enhanced our international presence; and in the third quarter, ResortQuest, a leading provider of full service vacation rentals in the U.S., with a portfolio of approximately 6,000 rental properties. We will leverage ResortQuest sales organization, market relationships and geographic reach with best practices from our rental operations in Europe to build a meaningful U.S. vacation rentals business.
The U.S. full service rental market is a highly fragmented $10 billion industry with 5,000 companies representing about 550,000 homes and condos and represents a major growth opportunity for us. We welcome the ResortQuest employees to the Wyndham Worldwide family and look forward to serving ResortQuest homeowners and leisure travelers.
An important component of rebalancing the portfolio is our commitment to moderate spending and growth in the vacation ownership business. We are emphasizing investment in our fee-for-service businesses, but we remain committed to the vacation ownership business, which we expect to generate significant free cash flow in mid single-digit EBITDA growth going forward. The business today is stronger and better than it's ever been, and the team continues to meet or exceed expectations on every measure.
Tom will share some additional insights on this business in a moment. One of the important insights he will share will address an improving returns profile for the business as we streamline our balance sheet and evolve our alternative business model WAAM, our Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model. We're making good progress in developing WAAM with sales in Myrtle Beach, our first WAAM project, ahead of schedule, and sales in Orlando, which we launched in July, tracking to plan. These successes serve to guide our multi-project structuring discussions with financial partners.
We have a strategic imperative to grow market share, which we'll achieve by continuing to offer great brands and great service. For almost 2 years now, we've shared with you the great progress RCI is making on driving transactions online. Continued technology enhancements are improving customer service and satisfaction while driving transactions, margin and ultimately, market share.
In November, we will release the most significant series of technology enhancements to our members yet. These include improving online search capabilities for our more than 1 million RCI Points members that will allow them to see more vacation options using additional search criteria. And this new technology will include significant program enhancements for our RCI Weeks members that will provide complete training power transparency, allowing members to better understand the training power value of the timeshare interval date deposited with RCI and the timeshare interval they want to exchange into.
Members will have the ability to combine timeshare intervals they have deposited with RCI to increase trading power and get change back if the training power value of their deposited interval is greater than the interval they are trading into. We believe that as our members become comfortable with these new trading capabilities, we will generate more exchange transactions and also create opportunities for our affiliates and developers to sell more timeshare to owners looking to trade up for higher value vacations.
At the hotel group, we continue to leverage the scale of the largest hotel franchise system in the world to offer consumers a wide range of iconic brands.  We recently added one such brand to our offering when we signed an agreement to license the Planet Hollywood hotel brand. This 20-year master franchise agreement will add an upscale flag for our asset owners looking for a more unique hotel experience that's young, trendy and hip. 
Another iconic brand, Days Inn, recently expanded its U.K. portfolio with the opening of 15 hotels, bringing the total number of Days Inn in the U.K. to nearly 60 and establishing a clear presence for us in the U.K. budget hotel sector.
And of course, we remain sharply focused on building the Wyndham Hotel and Resorts brand. A central strategy since our formation as an independent public company has been to leverage synergies between our business units, particularly between the hotel group and vacation ownership.
In May 2006, we announced development of a Wyndham Grand Hotel to be built adjacent to our Bonnet Creek Vacation Ownership Resort, a unique opportunity to establish a world-class Wyndham Hotel just outside the gates of Disney World.
We broke ground in that project in April 2008 but decided soon thereafter to slow development. Like everyone else in the world, we were unsure as to how long the downturn would last and what profile the recovery would take. We have now decided to resume our original plans and will finish the project, which is half complete. And we'll make it an owned and managed Wyndham Grand Hotel, which we expect to open late next year. We believe the benefit of having a flagship Wyndham Hotel at this location and the expected returns justify the commitment of capital in this case, a rare but appropriate exception to our asset-light business model.
We continue to gain traction in Asia, most notably with the Wyndham brand. We recently signed 3 new luxury hotels in China, strengthening our position as the largest U.S.-based hotel company in China with 270 hotels representing over 40,000 rooms. With these new signings, there are now 12 Wyndham-branded hotels currently open or under development in China.
Great brands and great service are the cumulative result of day-to-day actions by our highly-engaged employees. In September, we had an opportunity to celebrate our success in building great brands and providing great service. We held our first ever Wyndham Hotel Group Global Conference in Las Vegas, bringing together all of our owners and general managers, as well as employees and over 150 suppliers.
We had over 5,000 attendees, far above our expectation, and the atmosphere was absolutely energized. There was heavy emphasis on Apollo strategies, which are designed to enhance each of our 12 brands' value propositions and to help our owners run their businesses more effectively and profitably.
Our franchisees benefited from 40 unique educational sessions with a focus on revenue generation, customer experience and leadership. All told, we delivered over 8,000 training impressions. It was a great celebration of our brands and the value we bring to our franchisees, as well as to consumers.
Before turning the call over to Tom, I want to discuss another celebration that included our customers, employees and our communities. The restoration of our Wyndham Timeshare Resort in Nashville, which was seriously impacted by regional flooding in early May, was the embodiment of our Count on Me service philosophy. As flooding began, Wyndham associates responded to the crisis, putting their safety and well-being behind those of nearly 500 owners and guests. Some waded through 4 feet of water to help move those affected to higher level units, while others worked with electrical equipment in wet conditions to minimize potential injury or damage to the resort, all of this before knowing what impact the flooding had on their own homes and families.
Throughout the renovation, we made every effort to use local businesses, aiding the local economy and employing many residents who may otherwise have been without a job. We also recognized the need to support Nashville's long-term recovery and through Wshes by Wyndham, made a donation to the community foundation of Middle Tennessee. The reopening of our 252-unit resort came earlier than expected, and on September 30, we celebrated with a grand reopening event with nearly 90% occupancy, delivering a great experience to the many owners who were delighted to return to the resort.
We are very proud of our response and accomplishments during this challenge and know that we lived up to our core values. I'll now turn the call over to Tom who will provide you with additional perspective and details on our results and outlook. Tom?"
31063165,113970356,163410,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thank you, Steve. As you saw from the press release this morning and as Steve noted, we posted another strong quarter. Adjusted earnings per share increased 17%, reflecting strength in our hotel and vacation ownership businesses, a lower tax rate and high",2073,"Thank you, Steve. As you saw from the press release this morning and as Steve noted, we posted another strong quarter. Adjusted earnings per share increased 17%, reflecting strength in our hotel and vacation ownership businesses, a lower tax rate and higher RevPAR. We beat our earnings expectations coming in $0.04 above the top end of the range.
Adjusted EPS excludes a $38 million after-tax gain related to the settlement of the contingent tax liability, which we discussed last quarter, partially offset by a $6 million after-tax loss associated with the repurchase of 40% of our convertible notes and related warrants. 
Now turning to our capital markets activity in quarter 3. As you know, our convertible bond structure generates increasing share dilution for share prices above $20. In the quarter, we purchased 40% of the notes and related warrants for $167 million net, eliminating what could be significant future dilution.
In addition, this effort led to a direct reduction in diluted shares outstanding of 1.4 million shares, of which we will see the full effect in the fourth quarter. Now beyond the accounting benefits, we believe this process will also enable us to create true economic value, as we believe our share price will exceed the total cost of buying these warrants.
We also issued $250 million of senior notes in September, capitalizing on historically low rates and primarily used the proceeds to pay down the balance of our corporate revolver. Our overall debt balance at quarter end was essentially unchanged from year-end 2009 and well within our targeted investment grade range.
Turning to the ABS capital markets, last week, we announced an ABS deal with advance rates and cost characteristics in line with those of deals we did prior to the economic downturn. We issued $300 million in timeshare receivable notes at an advanced rate of 88% and an all-in yield of 3.7%. The transaction was oversubscribed, and we couldn't be happier with the execution. In addition, earlier in the month, we renewed our $600 million ABS conduit facility. The spread tightened by 200 basis points compared to the 2009 facility, and the advance rate improved slightly to 51.5%.
Net cash from operations was approximately $528 million for the first 9 months of 2010, a 7% decrease compared with the prior-year period, reflecting the $145 million net payment to the IRS for legacy tax issues.
Now free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities, less CapEx, equity investments and development advances and excluding cash payments related to contingent IRS tax liabilities, increased over 24% to $564 million for the first 9 months compared with $454 million for the same period in 2009.
As you know, we believe that cash is the great enabler for many of our company's goals and will help to accelerate our EPS growth with share buybacks and tuck-in acquisitions. As a reminder, we now expect our free cash flow in 2010 to be at the upper end of the $500 million to $600 million range, excluding the payment related to the contingent IRS tax liability. And we are projecting sustainable free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million in 2011 and beyond.
As Steve said, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. And as you saw from the press release, we continue to repurchase shares, buying 8.3 million shares since we reinstated the program in February through yesterday at an average price of $25.06. We have $285 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.
Now moving to operating performance for the quarter, let's begin the segment review starting with Wyndham Vacation Ownership. We have recently embarked upon an effort to help educate investors about our vacation ownership business. We've posted a presentation on our website which we encourage you to review. It makes some very important points about this business.
Our first point is that the Wyndham Vacation Ownership business has higher-than-perceived business qualities and an improving return profile. Specifically, the business will enjoy improving returns as the company streamlines its balance sheet. The business will generate significant amounts of recurring free cash flow, recurring income associated with property management fees, recurring interest income associated with our large pool of receivables and recurring sales driven by upgrades from a deeply loyal customer base.
Our second point is while this business is strong, we are taking steps to further strengthen the financial profile of this business through the development of our asset-light business model,  WAAM, and the rightsizing of our business, which has led to a superior buyer profile.
Third, improvements in the financial markets will further support enhanced business profitability. Fourth, from an accounting perspective, our vacation ownership business has been simplified and is transparent. Fifth, we believe we have the best management team in the industry. And finally, we understand the vacation ownership buyer and believe that the demand profile for this business will be strong for many years to come.
Now, we're going to be aggressively rolling this message out at conferences and meetings in the coming months, and we look forward to engaging many of you in a dialogue about these very important points. In the meantime, this business once again delivered excellent results in the quarter. Revenues were up 5% despite the benefit of $36 million in deferred revenue in 2009. The revenue increase reflects a $32 million reduction in the provision for loan losses and $12 million in WAAM commissions. EBITDA increased 41% from the third quarter of 2009, excluding the prior year EBITDA benefit associated with the deferred revenue rolling. The increase reflected exceptionally strong execution in the business and the lower provision for loan loss. 
Our key performance business driver, volume per guest, was up 7% from third quarter 2009, reflecting continued strong pricing and close rates. Tours in the third quarter increased 8% from the same period last year, reflecting better penetration into the existing owner base and stronger outreach to new owners. 
These achievements resulted in a 260-basis-point improvement in margin for this business unit. It's our goal to continue to build our new ownership base to develop a larger pool of lifetime buyers of vacation ownership. We expect to acquire over 20,000 new owners this year, which is the targeted level we need to replenish our group of potential future upgrades.
Property management revenues increased 8%, primarily reflecting an increase in managed units. Consumer finance revenues were relatively flat, while interest expense declined 23%, reflecting lower interest rates on our securitized debt.
On the consumer financing front, delinquency and default rates in the portfolio continue to improve. Write-offs during the third quarter declined to 2.3% of the overall portfolio from 3.4% in the third quarter of 2009. The provision for loan losses was $85 million or 22% of gross VOI sales, net of WAAM sales, down from 32% in the third quarter of 2009.
Now moving to the Wyndham Hotel Group. Revenues were up 11%, EBITDA increased 16% and margin improved 130 basis points, reflecting a RevPAR rebound, increased transfer in termination fees and some benefit from expense planning. Systemwide RevPAR increased 6.7%.
Our domestic economy segment was up 6% with Days Inn, Super 8, Microtel and our other economy brands, seeing positive RevPAR comparisons for the first time since 2007. Internationally, we're seeing pockets of dramatic improvement. Compared with the third quarter of last year, RevPAR in constant currency increased 11% and 22% respectively in the U.K. and Germany. And in China, RevPAR was up 23%, reflecting occupancy gains of 15% and rate gains of 7%.
Gross room openings, excluding the TRYP acquisition, are up close to 20% for the year but are being offset by terminations, which are up 28% year-to-date, reflecting financial difficulties for our franchisees, consistent with our earlier signals on bad debt. These terminations could push us to the lower end of our room guidance despite our strong room openings.
The franchise sales team did a great job of replenishing the pipeline despite the strong opening, resulting in a pipeline of close to 108,000 rooms, flat sequentially. Year-to-date, contract signings were up 7% compared with last year, and we have executed 254 conversion deals compared with 206 during the first 9 months of 2009, a 23% increase. Integration of the TRYP acquisition is progressing well. Last week, we signed an agreement for our first TRYP by Wyndham property in North America, a 173-room hotel in Midtown Manhattan that we will manage. The hotel is under construction now and is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2011.
Moving on to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, this business once again delivered solid results in spite of $4 million in higher value-added taxes in response to recent legislation. Excluding the net effect of foreign currency, revenues were up 5%, and adjusted EBITDA was flat in the third quarter 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. 
Hoseasons contributed $9 million to revenues, and we're very pleased with the integration and performance of this business. As Steve mentioned, the business performed very well through the summer. The Hoseasons group, which includes all of our U.K. rental brands and is the biggest operator of U.K. holidays, added nearly 1,500 extra units of accommodation to its 2010 holiday parks and lodges program to address burgeoning demand for summer holidays at home. The company experienced a 21% lift in sales of U.K. park and lodge holidays in August compared with the same period in 2009.
Wyndham Exchange and Rentals performance drivers were consistent with our expectations, demonstrating again the stability of this business. Average number of exchange members and exchange revenue per member were flat. Vacation rental transactions were up, and average net price per vacation rental was down, reflecting the Hoseasons acquisition. 
As Steve spoke of the great progress we are making on technology initiatives at RCI, and I'm pleased to report that RCI online web share was 30% in the third quarter 2010 compared to 23% in the third quarter 2009. North America online web share for the weeks exchange program has reached 42% in the third quarter 2010, doubling our online share of 21% for the same period in 2008 when we began our initiative to enhance RCI.com and increase online transactions.
Now moving to corporate. Our effective tax rate was 33.6%, reflecting the tax credits that we discussed last quarter. Excluding legacy-related items, corporate expenses were up by $10 million, primarily reflecting increased data security and IT expenses and tax consulting charges. 
Turning to guidance, as you saw from the press release, we are increasing our full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance to $855 million to $865 million, which reflects an increase in vacation ownership EBITDA to $425 million to $445 million, partially offset by higher corporate costs.
We now expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.94 to $1.98. We are increasing vacation ownership tour guidance to 2% to 4% versus last year as we seek to reach our new ownership target. We expect fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.40 to $0.44, assuming our quarter 3 diluted share count of 184 million shares and an approximate tax rate of 24%.
Now 2 notes on the fourth quarter. First, included in our guidance, exchange and rentals results will include approximately $6 million in EBITDA losses associated with ResortQuest, as the fourth quarter is a seasonally low revenue high expense in the U.S. rentals business. Second, there may be some additional movement in the tax rate as we work through the review of foreign tax credits we discussed on our last call. 
Our current best view is that full-year tax rate to be approximately 33% in 2010, about 38% next year and then approach a more normalized rate of 39% beginning in 2012. As Steve mentioned and as you saw from the press release, we're giving you our first look at our 2011 outlook, with revenue guidance of $4 billion to $4.2 billion, up approximately 5% to 7% from 2010, and EBITDA guidance of $925 million to $955 million, up 8% to 10% from 2010. 
Also, we expect free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million in 2011 and beyond. And remember, the compounding effect of that cash properly deployed could double our baseline EBITDA and earnings growth on a per-share basis through 2014. Finally, we'll share a P&L and business unit guidance with you in February. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back to Steve."

From a mix of new customers versus upgrade sales, clearly, over the last 18 months, we've seen an increase in the upgrade sales to our existing customers, but we've never lost focus on bringing in new customers. As Tom mentioned, we have a goal of 20,000 new customers to be brought in this year. We brought in 17,000 in the first 9 months. So we're right on track to meet or exceed that goal. And if you talk to the folks down in Orlando managing the business, they would say their own internal numbers are actually above what we've given them as a goal. So we will continue to focus on bringing in new customers. We need that new, fresh ownership base to be adding to our 820,000 customers that we have in our portfolio right now.

We would anticipate doing more deals in the future. We'll obviously hit the market as necessary. We upsized this deal impact because the market was so receptive. As to doing financing of WAAM deals, I think from the beginning, we've said that it will probably be a hybrid approach where in some cases, people will bring product and financing to the table. In other cases, we'll participate in one or the other portion of that. So clearly, the environment right now is very attractive for us to hit the ABS market. But we want to -- we're building this business model, WAAM, to take down our balance sheet to provide a greater ROIC on that timeshare business. So we'll probably have a little bit of both, Steve, going forward."

So the return profile, just going to that part of the question of that business versus our more asset-heavy business where we actually have product that we've built and we're selling on the timeshare side is really quite different. In the asset affiliation model, we have no capital at work in the pure model, so our return is like our franchise business is pretty much infinite. With respect to our asset model where we actually are building product and selling it, our returns are -- what we've talked about in the past, 40% plus IRRs on those deals that we're doing, but it requires, obviously, the capital to be tied up in order to do those deals. So your question was a little broad, so I tried to address a couple of different facets. Did I get it?"

It's since we're an economy mid-scale player, most of our business is the entrepreneur traveling and staying at a Days Inn or Super 8 along the road. So it's not kind of the traditional group booked business far in advance. We do have some group business within the Wyndham brand, and we have definitely seen improvement this year over what we saw last year. But again, it's such a small portion of our overall business that I think we're probably not the best litmus test to make on what the group business would look like. If Morgan Stanley is looking to book all their business with Wyndham, you can have somebody give me a call. We'll make sure that we give them a good rate, but it's not a huge part of our business just because of the distribution of our product and the size of the Wyndham brand versus the rest of our business.
