Good morning, everyone. In 2009, Anadarko delivered some of the strongest operational results in the company’s history and we view these results demonstrate the viability of Anadarko’s strategy and the capabilities of its people and portfolio.
In addition, we think, we’ve set the stage for continued success in 2010 and beyond. Specifically for the year, we delivered record sales volumes of 220 million barrels of oil equivalent, a 7% increase from 206 million barrels of oil equivalent previous year, nearly three times the growth rate of our guidance at the beginning of the year, all while spending about $1 billion less on near-term projects than we did in 2008.
We significantly improved our operating costs by reducing lease operating expense per BOE by more than 20% year-over-year. We added 314 million barrels of oil equivalent of proved reserves before the effects of price revisions and divestures, with costs incurred of about $4.7 billion.
Using the common definition of finding and development costs in the investment community, this calculates to a very competitive rate of less than $15 per barrel of oil equivalent.
Our deepwater exploration program delivered extraordinary results in 2009, with nine announced discoveries and an overall success rate of 50%. These discoveries coupled with the positive results from our follow-up appraisal activity provide confidence that we can deliver future material production and reserve additions from our growing list of mega projects.
For the three mega projects we’ve already sanctioned, we continue to make good progress, moving them closer to first production both on schedule and within budget. We expect Jubilee in Ghana to start producing late this year and the three projects combined should add about 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net to Anadarko by 2012.
Concurrently, our partners in the Marcellus, Haynesville, Eagleford and Pearsall shale programs, solidifies our view that these assets will play an expanded roll in our long-dated organic growth.
As I stated earlier, full year production for 2009 totaled a record 220 million barrels of oil equivalent. This was about 10 million barrels of oil equivalent higher than the midpoint of the original guidance that we provided at the beginning of 2009.
And again, the 7% year-over-year growth in sales volumes was accomplished while spending about 35% less on near-term projects year-over-year for a highly efficient capital yield.
Our sales volumes benefited from 14% year-over-year growth in the Rockies, steady performance in the southern region and improved run times in the Gulf of Mexico. We also continue to capture additional value and enhanced margins by focusing on areas of our portfolio that offer higher liquids yields, such as the Wattenberg field.
We’ve expanded these opportunities already this year as demonstrated by our recently announced transaction with TXCO that will add about 80,000 net acres to our existing 180,000 net acreage position in Maverick Basin.
We like the results we’re seeing in the Eagleford shale with its high liquids yield and felt this was a compelling opportunity. We also gained almost a full year’s benefit from the cryogenic expansion at the Chipeta processing plant in the Greater Natural Buttes area, which added more liquids to our product stream.
Turning back to Colorado, the Wattenberg production field contains about 40% liquids and also serves as a good segue to talk about our continued improvements and drilling efficiencies. We drilled nearly as many wells in 2009 as we did in 2008 in this field, with essentially half the rig count.
Our improved cycle time and cost savings were also achieved in other operating rigs. In the southern region about 30% of the wells drilled set cycle time records in the fourth quarter. More specifically, we set records in the Carthage, Chalk, Bone Spring and Marcellus shale areas.
Our exploration teams delivered a phenomenal result in 2009 by discovering approximately 360 million barrels of oil equivalent of net risk resources, more than 50% higher than our original estimates that we shared with you at our March Investor Conference in 2009.
We announced nine deepwater discoveries in some of the hottest exploration areas in the world, including the pre-salt in Brazil, Cretaceous fan play in West Africa and the subsalt Gulf of Mexico.
Two of these nine discoveries were announced during the fourth quarter. They were Lucius and Anadarko operated Pliocene and Miocene discovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
The discovery well encountered more than 200 net feet of pay. We’ve since drilled an up-dip sidetrack appraisal well, which we announced last week that had almost 600 net feet of oil pay and very strong reservoir characteristics.
The second major discovery in the quarter occurred at the pre-salt Itaipu prospect offshore Brazil in blocked BMC-32, where we have a 33% working interest. The well encountered more than 90 feet of net pay in a high quality carbonate reservoir. And a recent successful sidetrack is estimated to have added another 60 feet to this pay count. Itaipu, like our neighboring Wahoo discovery appears to cover a very wide aerial extent.
The remaining seven announced deepwater discoveries were Heidelberg, Shenandoah, Samurai and Vito in the Gulf of Mexico; Tweneboa and Mahogany Deep offshore Ghana and Venus in Sierra Leone, which was the first deepwater well ever drilled in the Liberian basin.
We are currently drilling the first of four consecutive deepwater wells offshore Mozambique. The currently drilling Rovuma Basin prospect is called Windjammer. Upon completion, we plan to move the rig to drill the deepwater Collier prospect, about 50 miles south-southeast of the Windjammer well. We operate both with a 43% working interest.
Offshore Ghana will continue to be very active and plan to spud the Dahoma exploration prospect soon. This lies to the southeast of the Jubilee unit boundary in the West Cape Three Points Block.
The success we’ve achieved in exploration has led to significant appraisal activity, which we then plan to transition into development projects. Offshore West Africa, our appraisal drilling activities confirmed the extent of the productive area of Jubilee field south and east of the current unit boundary.
In Brazil, the Wahoo #2 well gives us confidence that this area has all the ingredients to become one of our next mega projects. The Wahoo #2 well encountered more than 90 feet of net pay and high quality sands and the recently completed sidetrack of this well brought the total closer to 135 net feet of pay. The results confirmed the extension of the Wahoo field 5 miles to the north and down-dip in the discovery well in block BMC-30 in the Campos Basin. We operate the block with a 30% working interest.
After we’re finished sidetracking Wahoo #2, we plan to perform drillstem tests at both Wahoo and Wahoo #2 before drilling at Wahoo south exploration prospect later this year on the same block.
Just in the past two weeks, we’ve announced two additional successful appraisal wells. The first off the coast of Ghana was the Tweneboa-2 well, which encountered more than 105 net feet of hydrocarbon pay, including about 56 net feet of oil pay. By drilling this well 4 miles south and down-dip of the original discovery well, we confirmed our pre-drill expectations of finding significant oil accumulation with a large aerial extent.
The second was at Lucius sidetrack well in the Gulf of Mexico in Keathley Canyon block 875 that I mentioned earlier. This is a major discovery where we have a 50% working interest. We plan to be in the area later this year doing one or two additional appraisal wells and will be working with our partners on potential development options.
As I mentioned, we also continue to advance our current mega projects on time and on budgets. In Ghana the Jubilee Phase 1 development is on track to achieve first oil later this year. The FPSO conversion work is almost complete and the vessel is expected to leave the yard in Singapore sometime in the second quarter.
At Caesar-Tonga in the Gulf of Mexico development activities continued during the fourth quarter, as we drilled the third of four planned Phase 1 producers. One of these wells, Green Canyon 683 number 1 sidetrack 2 encountered about 400 net feet of pay, some 1,200 feet up-dip from the original Caesar discovery well. Construction and insulation work at our host facility, the Constitution spar, is progressing well and the project remains on track to deliver first production in the first half of 2011.
In Algeria, at El Merk, we drilled three wells during the fourth quarter and this major project also remains on schedule with first oil expected in late 2011. We’ve also made good progress and achieved positive results in our shale plays. We continue to develop our fairway positions and ramp up production in the Marcellus, Haynesville, Eagleford and Pearsall Shales.
On a gross basis, we are currently producing more than 75 million cubic feet per day and about 1,000 barrels per day with another 50 wells awaiting completion.
In addition to acquiring the Eagleford acreage I mentioned earlier, we’ve also enhanced our acreage in the Marcellus shale by adding about 35,000 net acres to our prior net position of about 315,000 acres.
Turning to the financials during the fourth quarter, we reported earnings of about $0.46 per diluted share. As with previous quarters, we provided a breakout in the earnings release of certain items affecting comparability, which increased fourth quarter net income by about $0.42 per share. Discretionary cash flow totaled approximately $869 million for the quarter and more than $4.36 billion for the full year.
Our balance sheet remains strong with substantial liquidity. We ended the year with more than $3.5 billion of cash on hand, reduced our net debt to capital ratio to approximately 31% from about 34% at year-end 2008 and maintained access to our undrawn $1.3 billion committed credit facility.
Our capital expenditures were in line with full year guidance when adjusting for our decision to purchase the Anadarko corporate headquarters building in Houston in the fourth quarter for approximately $215 million rather than renew a less economically advantaged lease.
We exceeded our 2009 G&A guidance for a good reason. Our employees and portfolio delivered an outstanding year, as I’ve already highlighted. These accomplishments contributed to the creation of an additional $13.5 billion of market capitalization for our shareholders during 2009 and $6.5 billion of incremental value relative to the average of our peer group.
By delivering this relative outperformance, our non-officer employees qualified to receive a prescribed supplemental bonus plan. This plan has a very high hurdle and this is the first time that the company’s total shareholder return has warranted rewards of this magnitude. I’m proud of the team’s performance in surpassing this hurdle.
This non-officer program accounted for the vast majority of our increased G&A. However, our all employee annual incentive plan accrual was also increased to reflect the successful attainment of cost savings initiatives, enhanced margins, production records and reserve additions above targeted levels.
Going forward, we fully expect G&A to return to less than $4 per barrel of oil equivalent, except for exceptional performance years.
Turning to reserves. As stated in the earnings release, we added approximately 314 million barrels of oil equivalent of proved reserves during 2009, before the effect of price revisions and divestures, equating to a production replacement ratio of approximately 140%.
In line with most of our peers, we chose not to report probables and possibles and reported only proved reserves this year. Utilization and the new average price rules did have some effect, reflected by the 39 million barrels of negative price provisions that we had, due to the approximate 33% drop in market gas prices period-to-period. Other than that, there was a minimal impact on our reserve bookings.
With the first year of implementation we felt approaching this in a more conservative manner was the best way to go. It is interesting to note that if we were able to use year-end prices, our reserves would have increased an incremental 63 million barrels of oil equivalent from the estimated 2.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent of total year-end proved reserves.
As of year-end 2009, about 75 -- 70% of our proved reserves were developed and 30% undeveloped, the same percentage of undeveloped reserves as last year. The product mix also transitioned more towards liquids during the year. At year-end, an estimated 44% of our proved reserves were liquids, compared to 40% in the prior year.
2009 set the foundation for a lot of positive events in the future and we look forward to providing with more detail about our 2010 plan once it receives board approval. And we’ll shed more light on our outlook for this year and well into the future at our March 2nd Investor Conference in New York.
With that, I’m joined by our executive team and we’re happy to take your questions. So Jeri, if you’re ready, we can open up the lines.

On the acreage position, it’s intermixed in our overall acreage position that we’ve already established, so we didn’t step out of that. Part of it is in our JV with Chesapeake and part of it was through a lease sale that the state held. But that combination just picked up a nice swathe of acreage at infilled to the position we already have that we like a lot. So it took us up to about 715,000 gross acres through there. 
We have talked about adding rigs through the year, I think we’re going to try to ramp up to about six, five to seven running through next year at this point and that would not be a rig a week, but a staged plan of bringing those rigs in to start exploring the activity out there. We like exploring the area out there, we like what we’re seeing with our activity to date.
We’ve got a couple wells, now that we operated, we announced that we’re over 7 million a day, we’re drilling our first well in Lycoming County and testing it right now, and we like the results of that, what we’re seeing in the way of rates and pressures. So everything seems to be working well in the Marcellus and we’re real pleased to be able to pick up some additional acreage in there.

But we want to make sure on a few of these that we have all the right appraisal activity, all the right science done before we come to you and say we’re ready to sanction this thing tomorrow.
So we don’t want to start giving dates out until we’re absolutely sure what that timeline would be, I think you should take some confidence from the fact that when we decide to do something, we tend to get it done on time and within budget and part of that is, making sure that we do the right upfront science. As you may know, that’s why Ghana was a little bit slower going because we wanted to make sure all of that science was done and now we’re of courses on the cusp of that.
The big issue for I think for all of us is, you know, kind of have you got the capital and have you got the people to execute these things and the way that these discoveries are occurring gives us a lot of confidence that the phasing in of these projects for new sanctioning are going to work out really well with regard to the capital flows that we have in the existing mega projects, where those will start dropping down significantly by the time we’ll start to ramp some of these others up. And that looks good from both a production perspective for our investors but also looks good from a project management and capital spending perspective.
So it’s a general kind of overview, we don’t see ourselves at this point in a position where we have challenges that are overly daunting and of course, as you can, readily realize this is high cotton in terms of even thinking about this issue. So we’ve got plenty to go have fun with and deliver value from.

I think Tweneboa is probably the biggest learning in that, when we drilled Tweneboa, the results for Tweneboa-1 weren’t that much different than what we saw at Venus 1. But with Tweneboa, we had a real high quality 3D data set that allowed us to tie that data into it and extrapolate away from the well bore and see that we had a very good thicker band section, lateral to us and we could go down-dip and test it and prove up a thicker sand section, better reservoir quality and get into the oil leg.
Venus is exactly the same, except we don’t have the quality of the seismic data right now and that’s why we’re reprocessing it. So we think when we get that data in, we’ll be able to immediately tie the well bore in and see, we are in the best part of it or is there something lateral to it that needs to be appraised.
Additionally, the CI-105 well gave us a good indication on what we need to be doing to high grade the prospects. So what we’ve done now is gone back into our Liberian Basin data set, which is a new data set we acquired and high graded those prospects. We think we’ll be back drilling in West Africa outside of Ghana later this year and drilling two to three additional wells, probably one in Sierra Leone, one in Liberia and maybe one down in CI, but we’ll finalize that all up and we’re out discussing rig options right now.

We’ll take all that data in, learn from it and we’re currently evaluating the different, the different development options that we might have for the Lucius program, inclusive of working with our neighbors at Hadrian and they go from a range of subsea developments tied back to a host of standalone projects.

Now, in the Greater Natural Buttes area, as you recall, we brought on a cryo plant earlier this year, yield off of that is substantially better than the refrigeration plant we had there previously and as we potentially increase production in the coming years from the Greater Natural Buttes, you can anticipate seeing more cryo potentially being built by us as a part of that in order to improve the liquids yields from that gas.

Of course, we look at that all the time because it’s one of the skill sets we have internally. We do see potential around the world in that type of play.
The real difficulty right now is the fiscal terms and the cost structure in these other more remote locations. You have to have a market to sell the gas into and you have to have infrastructure because these are kind of manufacturing type activities and you have to have fiscal terms from the state that are quite different than what they are used to.
And so there’s a lot of work that’s going to have to be done on all of those fronts to find an area that really works. But it’s one of those things we keep our eye on for the future but at this point, it’s not something that we’re actively pursuing and think that we’ll be drilling wells in next year by any means.

I’m pretty sure it won’t come out the way it’s been proposed, just like it didn’t last year. I think the independents are in a good place with regard to arguing on IDCs, which is the biggest issue there by far. But particularly if we can get the administration to support natural gas, the two things that were notable that followed that meeting for whatever reasons is the mention of offshore oil and gas leasing in the State of the Union, but also his comments about we need to do more for natural gas in the GOP meeting that happened after the State of the Union, which is the first time that natural gas domestically was mentioned separately by the President.
And I might mention that we have some follow-up in that regard that is good from the messages that were delivered. So I think it was nothing but productive, the meeting, and I have some confidence that as we play offense with natural gas, we may be playing some defense too with the independents.

In 2009, Anadarko delivered some of the strongest operational results in the company's history. And we believe these results demonstrate the viability of Anadarko's strategy and the capabilities of its people and portfolio. In addition, we think we've set the stage for continued success in 2010 and beyond. Specifically for the year, we delivered record sales volumes of 220 million barrels of oil equivalent, a 7% increase from 206 million barrels of oil equivalent the previous year, and nearly three times the growth rate in our guidance since the beginning of the year, all while spending about $1 billion less on near-term projects than we did in 2008. We significantly improved our operating costs by reducing lease operating expense for BOE by more than 20% year-over-year. We added 314 million barrels of oil equivalent of proved reserves before the effects of price revisions and divestitures, the cost incurred of about $4.7 billion. Using the common definition of Finding & Development costs in the investment community, this calculates to a great competitive rate of less than $15 per barrel of oil equivalent. Our deepwater exploration program delivered extraordinary results in 2009, with nine announced discoveries and an overall success rate of 50%. These discoveries, coupled with the positive results from our follow-up appraisal activity, provide confidence that we could deliver future material production and reserve additions from our growing list of mega-projects. For the three mega-projects we've already sanctioned, we continue to make good progress. Moving them closer to first production, both on schedule and within budget. We expect Jubilee in Ghana to start producing late this year, and the three projects combined should add about 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, net to Anadarko by 2012. Concurrently, our progress in the Marcellus, Haynesville, Eagleford and Pearsall shale programs solidifies our view that these assets will play an expanded role in our long-dated organic growth.As I stated earlier, full year production for 2009 totaled a record 220 million barrels of oil equivalent. This was about 10 million barrels of oil equivalent higher than the mid point of the original guidance that we provided at the beginning of 2009. And again, this 7% year-over-year growth in sales volumes was accomplished while spending about 35% less on near-term projects year-over-year, for a highly-efficient capital yield. Our sales volumes benefited from 14% year-over-year growth and the Rockies' steady performance in the Southern region, and improved run times in the Gulf of Mexico. We also continue to capture additional value and enhanced margins by focusing on the areas of our portfolio that offer higher liquid yield such as the Wattenberg field. We've expanded these opportunities already this year as demonstrated by our recently announced transaction with TXCO that will add about 80,000 net acres to our existing 180,000 net acres positioned in Maverick Basin. We like the results we're seeing in the Eagleford Shale with its high liquids yield and felt this was a compelling opportunity.We also gained almost a full year's benefit from the cryogenic expansion at the Chapita processing plant in the greater Natural Buttes area, which added more liquids to our product stream. Turning back to Colorado, the Wattenberg production field contains about 40% liquids, and also serves as a good segue to talk about our continued improvements in drilling efficiencies. We drove nearly as many well as in 2009 as we did in 2008 in this field, with essentially half the rig count. Our improved cycle time and cost savings were also achieved in other operating increase. In the Southern region, about 30% of the well is drilled at cycle time records in the fourth quarter. More specifically, we've set records in the Carthage, Chalk, Bone Spring and Marcellus Shale areas. Our exploration teams delivered phenomenal results in 2009 by discovering approximately 360 million barrels of oil equivalent of net risk resources, more than 50% higher than our original estimate that we shared with you at our March investor conference in 2009. We announced nine deepwater discoveries in some of the hottest exploration areas in the world, including the pre-salt in Brazil, Cretaceous Fan play in West Africa and the subsalt Gulf of Mexico. Two of these nine discoveries were announced during the fourth quarter. They are Lucius and Anadarko-operated Pliocene and Miocene discovery in deepwater of Gulf of Mexico. The discovery well encountered more than 200 net feet of pay. We since drilled an uptick sidetrack appraisal well, which we announced last week that almost 600 net feet of oil pay and very strong reservoir characteristics. The second major discovery in the quarter for the pre-salt type of prospect offshore Brazil and block BMC-32 where we have a 33% working interest. We well encountered more than 90 feet of net pay in a high-quality carbonated reservoir. And a recent successful sidetrack is estimated to add another 60 feet of this pay count. Itaipu, like our neighboring Wahoo discovery, appears to cover a very wide aerial extent. The remaining seven announced deepwater discoveries were Heidelberg, Shenandoah, Samurai and Vito in the Gulf of Mexico, Tweneboa and Mahogany Deep off the shore of Ghana and Venus in Sierra Leone, which was the first deepwater well ever drilled in Liberian Basin. We are currently drilling the first of four consecutive deepwater wells offshore Mozambique. The currently drilling Rovuma Basin prospect is called Windjammer. Upon completion, we plan to move the rig to drill deepwater collier prospect about 50 miles south southeast of the Windjammer well. We operate both with a 43% working interest. Offshore Ghana will continue to be very active and plan to spud the home exploration prospects soon. This lies to the Southeast of the Jubilee Unit boundary in the West Cape Three Points Block. The success we've achieved in exploration has led to significant appraisal activity, which we then plan to transition into development projects. Offshore West Africa, our appraisal drilling activities confirmed then extended the productive area of the Jubilee field, South and East of the current unit boundary. And in Brazil, the Wahoo #2 well gives us confidence that this area has all of the ingredients to become one of our next mega-projects. The Wahoo #2 well encountered more than 90 feet of net pay in high quality sands, and the recently completed sidetrack of this well brought the total closer to 135 net feet of pay. The results confirmed the extension of Wahoo field, five miles to the North and down the discovery well on block BM-C-30 in the Campos Basin. We operate the block with a 30% working interest. After we finish sidetracking Wahoo #2, we plan to perform drillstem test to both Wahoo and Wahoo #2 before drilling at Wahoo South exploration prospect later this year on the same block.Just in the past two weeks, we've announced two additional successful appraisals. The first off the coast of Ghana was the Tweneboa-2 well, which encountered more than 105 net feet of hydrocarbon pay, including about 56 net feet of oil pay. By drilling this well four miles of south and down-dip from the original discovery well, we confirmed our pre-drill expectation of finding a significant oil accumulation with a large aerial extent. The second was at the Lucius sidetrack well in the Gulf of Mexico in Keathley Canyon block 875 that I mentioned earlier. This is a major discovery where we have a 50% working interest. We plan to be in the area later this year, drilling one or two additional appraisal wells, and we'll be working with our partners on potential development options. As I mentioned, we also continued to advance our current mega-price on-time and on-budget. In Ghana, the Jubilee Phase I development is on track to achieve first oil later this year. The FPSO conversion work is almost complete and the basil is expected to leave the yard in Singapore sometime in the second quarter. At Caesar and Tonga in the Gulf of Mexico, development activities continued during the fourth quarter as we drilled the third and fourth plants' Phase I producers. One of these wells is the Green Canyon 683 #1 sidetrack 2, encountered about 400 net feet of pay, some 1,200 feet up from the original Caesar discovery well.Construction and installation work at our host facility, the Constitution spar, is progressing well, and the project remains on track to deliver first production in the first half of 2011.In Algeria and Almark, we drilled three wells during the fourth quarter, and this major project also remains on schedule with first well expected in late 2011. We've also made good progress and achieved positive results in our shale place. We continue to develop our fairway positions from ramped up productions in the Marcellus, Haynesville, Eagleford and Pearsall shales. On a gross basis, we are currently producing more than 75 million cubic feet per day and about 1,000 barrels per day, with another 50 wells awaiting completion. In addition to acquiring the Eagleford acreage I mentioned earlier, we've also enhanced our acreage in the Marcellus shale by adding about 35,000 net acres to our prior net position of about 315,000 acres.Trade and financials during the fourth quarter, we reported earnings of about $0.46 per diluted share. As with previous quarters, we provided a breakout in the earnings release to certain items affecting comparability, which increased fourth quarter net income by about $0.42 per share. Discretionary cash flow totaled approximately $869 million for the quarter and more than $4.36 billion for the full year. Our balance sheet remains strong with substantial liquidity. We ended the year with more than $3.5 billion of cash on hand, reduced our net debt-to-capital ratio to approximately 31% from about 34% at year end 2008, and maintained access to our undrawn $1.3 billion committed credit facility.Our capital expenditures were in line with full year guidance when adjusting for our decision to purchase the Anadarko Corporate Headquarters building in Houston in the fourth quarter for approximately $215 million rather than renew a less economically advantaged lease. We exceeded our 2009 G&A guidance for a good reason. Our employees and portfolio have delivered an outstanding years I've already highlighted. These accomplishments contributed to the creation of an additional $13.5 billion of market capitalization for our shareholders during 2009 and $6.5 billion of incremental value relative to the average of our peer group. By delivering this relative outperformance, our non-officer employees qualify to receive a prescribed supplemental bonus plan. This plan has a very high hurdle and this is the first time that the company's total shareholder return has warranted rewards of this magnitude. I'm proud of the team's performance in surpassing this hurdle. This non-officer program accounted for the vast majority of increased G&A. However, our all-employee annual incentive plan accrual has also increased to reflect the successful attainment of cost savings initiatives, enhanced margins, production records and reserve additions above targeted levels.  Going forward, we fully expect G&A to return to less than $4 per barrel of oil equivalent except for exceptional performance use.Turning to reserves, as stated in the earnings release, we added approximately 314 million barrels of oil equivalent of proved reserve during 2009 before the effective price revisions and divestitures, equating to a production replacement ratio of approximately 140%. In line with most of our peers, we chose not to report probables and possible and reported only proved reserves this year. Utilization of the new average price rules did have some effect reflected by the 39 million barrels of negative provisions that we had due to the approximate 33% drop in market gas prices period to period. Other than that, there was a minimal impact on our reserve bookings. With the first year of implementation, we felt approaching this in a more conservative manner was the best way to go. It is interesting to note that if we were able to use year end prices, our reserves would have increased an incremental 63 million barrels of oil equivalent from the estimated 2.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent of total year-end proved reserves. As of year-end 2009, about 70% of our proved reserves were and 30% undeveloped, the same percentage of undeveloped reserves as last year. The product mix also transitioned more towards liquids during the year. At year end, an estimated 44% of our proved reserves were liquids compared to 40% in the prior year.2009 set the foundation for a lot of positive events in the future and we look forward to providing you with more detail of our 2010 plan once it receives Board approval. And we'll shed more light in our outlook for this year and well into the future at our March 2 investor conference in New York.With that, I'm joined by our executive team and we're happy to take your questions.

But that combination just picked up a nice swap of acres at in-field to the position we already have that we like a lot. So it takes up about 715,000 gross acres through there. We have talked about adding rigs through the year. I think we're going to try to ramp up to about six, five to seven running through next year at this point, and that would not be a rig a week but a staged plan of bringing those rigs in to start exploring the activity out there. We like go first exploring the area up there. We like what we're seeing with our activity to date. We've got a couple of wells now that we've operated. We announced that we're over 7 million a day. We're drilling our first well in Lycoming County and testing it right now. And we like the results of that. What we're seeing the way of rates and pressures. So everything seems to be working well in the Marcellus and we're really pleased to be able to pick up some additional acreage in there."

So we don't want to start giving dates out until we're absolutely sure where that time line will be. I think you should taste some confidence from the fact that when we decide to do something, we tend to get it done on time and within budget. And part of that is making sure that we do the right up front science. As you may now, that's why Ghana was a little bit slower going because we wanted to make sure all that science was done, and now we're of course on the cost of that. The big issue for, I think all of us, is kind of have you got the capital and have you got the people to execute these things? And the way that these discoveries are occurring gives us a lot of confidence that the phasing in of these projects for new sanctioning are going to work out really well with regard to the capital flows that we have in existing mega-projects where those will start dropping down significantly by the time we'll start to ramp some of these others up. And that looks good from both the production perspective for our investors but also looks good from a project management and capital spending perspective. So as a general kind of overview, we don't see ourselves at this point in a position where we have challenges that are overly daunting. And of course, as you readily realize, this is high cotton in terms of even thinking about this issue. So we've got plenty to go have fun with than deliver value from."

Venus is exactly the same except we don't have the quality of the seismic data right now and that's why we're reprocessing it.

Good morning, everyone. Before we get into results for the quarter, I want to first express the sadness we feel and extend our sincere condolences to the families of those who were lost in the Deepwater Horizon accident about two weeks ago.",2511,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Before we get into results for the quarter, I want to first express the sadness we feel and extend our sincere condolences to the families of those who were lost in the Deepwater Horizon accident about two weeks ago. As a non-operating partner, we want to answer questions regarding the cause as much as anyone in resolution as quickly as possible. We understand this event is foremost in everyone's mind and we will discuss it in more detail with you later in the call. But before we do, I'll spend a few minute moments reviewing the results of our first quarter. 
As you saw in the press release, our producing assets delivered a record quarter, with total volumes of 62 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our E&P organization accomplished this, while also continuing to reduce our lease operating expense per unit. With strong run rates and minimal work over us in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, lease operating expense improved by about 19% sequentially over the fourth quarter of 2009 and by 32% year-over-year.
Through these efforts to reduce LOE, we are now among the lowest cost producers in our peer group. Other summary highlights during the quarter are that we made good progress in our shale plays, announced the new deepwater discovery in the frontier basin and drilled three successful appraisal wells that confirmed the resource potential and the ability of several emerging megaprojects. We also closed a $1.5 billion joint venture agreement with Mitsui in the Marcellus Shale and retired or refinanced near-term debt to further strengthen our balance sheet.
Our reported quarterly sales volume increased by about 15% relative to the first quarter of 2009. Of note, sales volumes for the quarter included about 1.9 million barrels of oil equivalent from a royalty price threshold adjustment related to our 2009 Gulf of Mexico natural gas sales. Adjusting volumes for these factors still leaves above the high-end of our volume metric guidance for the quarter and represents an 11% increase over the first quarter of 2009. 
Due to the strong performance of our producing assets, we are increasing the midpoint of our full year sales volume guidance by 3.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. A major contributor to our production growth was a 35% increase in our total liquids production to almost 26 million barrels compared to 19 million barrels in the first quarter of 2009. This is a direct result of the actions we took at the beginning of 2009 to focus on liquids-rich areas within our U.S. onshore portfolio. Liquids for the quarter comprised 42% of our overall reported sales, directly contributing to our enhanced cash flow margin per barrel of oil equivalent. 
As I mentioned to you moments ago, our E&P organization did an outstanding job in the quarter of managing our assets. As a result of these efforts, we're now reducing our annual guidance for LOE by $0.25 per barrel of oil equivalent. We are and have been focused on investing in areas of our portfolio that offer the strongest economics. Given the current market conditions for oil and natural gas prices, this involves focusing on areas with high liquids yields. 
The Marcellus Shale, given its strong economics, is currently the only area of pure natural gas drilling, in which we are prudently increasing our activity levels. The increased investments are being carried by Mitsui through the joint venture agreement that we closed in the first quarter. Currently, we are producing approximately 120 million cubic feet of natural gas per day on a gross basis from the Marcellus from about 30 wells with about 80 wells in various stages of completion, as three folds to our 2009 exit rate of about 40 million cubic feet per day gross. 
In another major shale play, the Eagleford in Southwest Texas, we continue to see strong results with very good liquids production, which compromises about 50% of the product stream and 75% of the production value. We expanded our position during the first quarter by acquiring more than 80,000 net acres from TXCO. This acquisition also increased our working interest to 75% across all of our Eagleford acreage.
The cost of this acquisition was approximately $1,100 per acre, which is a very competitive both to the higher or recent industry cost for acreage year. We ended the first quarter with four rigs running and have drilled more than 20 wells in this play and are driving down drilling times, reducing our cost per well and seeing good economics with EURs of over 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per well. We've identified hundreds of potential well locations in this play, are in the process of adding two more rigs in the coming weeks and pursuing plans to significantly expand the midstream infrastructure to capture the value we see over our 300,000 net acreage position. 
One of the new areas in which we are actively drilling is the Bone Spring play in the Delaware Basin of West Texas where we control 170,000 net acres. Like the Eagleford in Wattenberg areas, Bone Spring is a high-liquid composition. We are currently running four rigs in the play with one recent completion flowing at a maximum rate of almost 1,200 barrels per day. We also anticipate that our partner in this play will be increasing their rig count, thereby providing for an active program throughout the year. 
In Iraqi's region, we expect to be drilling by the end of the quarter in the oil-focused horizontal Niobrara play, where we have 500,000 net acres. By virtue of several modest-sized firm ups that we completed over the last several years within our mineral interest, we have had access to industry information on the recent drilling in the shale, which allows us to better derisk the play with other people's money as we prepared for our own drilling program this year.
In addition to meaningful growth that we are demonstrating with our onshore assets, we can currently remain on track and on budget to deliver first oil from Jubilee Phase I in offshore Ghana beginning later this year. Caesar/Tonga in the Gulf of Mexico beginning in the first half of 2011 and El Merk in Algeria beginning in late 2011. The partnership has nearly completed the construction work on the 120 barrel per day FPSO for the Jubilee Phase I development, and we expect to mobilize the vessel to Ghana in the coming week. Tags to infrastructures are being installed and completions work has been initiated. 
At the Caesar/Tonga complex in deepwater Gulf of Mexico, construction activities are progressing as planned. In Algeria at El Merk, the partnership has drilled almost half of the 140 planned wells and the facilities construction is on track. 
Meanwhile, our global deepwater drilling programs continues to proves successful in advancing the next wave of megaprojects. During the quarter, we announced successful appraisal wells of Lucius and Vito in the Gulf of Mexico and at Tweneboa offshore Ghana. We announce that the Lucius appraisal on the Gulf encountered almost 600 net feet of high-quality oil pay in the subsalt Pliocene and Miocene sands. 
The appraisal well was an up-dip sidetrack approximately 3,200 feet south of discovery well in Keathley Canyon Block 875. The reservoirs of Lucius have excellent porosity and permeability based on the core and log data recovered. We recently spud our second appraisal well and plans to drill a third immediately thereafter as we evaluate development options for this discovery. We operate Lucius with a 50% working interest.
In the first quarter, we also announced the successful appraisal well at Vito in Mississippi Canyon Block 940 in the Gulf of Mexico. The appraisal well, which is more than a mile from the Vito discovery well encountered more than 600 feet of high-quality oil in thick subsalt Miocene sands. We are currently drilling our second appraisal well at Vito as we work with our partners to transition this large discovery to development. 
We hold a 20% working interest in Vito which is operated by Shell. Also in the Gulf, we are currently appraising our Heidelberg discovery. The original well encountered mechanical issues about 10,000 feet above the reservoir section and will now be redrilled with a projected total depth of 31,500 feet to test middle to lower Miocene objectives, similar to the Heidelberg discovery well in Green Canyon Block 903. 
Moving to Ghana at Tweneboa in #2 well located about four miles southeast to the original discovery well confirmed our expectations of finding a down-dip oil accumulation and thicker sand section. The well encountered about 105 net feet of pay, which is over half of the pay count being oil in the remainder of gas condensate. The partnership expects to drill two additional appraisal wells in Tweneboa later this year as well as an exploration well at the neighboring El Wol [ph](38:50) prospect. 
In Brazil, another of our emerging megaprojects, we announced last month the successful drillstem test at the pre-salt Wahoo#1 well. It voted an unstimulated and equipment limited rate of about 7,500 barrels of oil per day. Test results indicate this well will be able to produce in a sustained rate of more than 15,000 barrels per day of high-quality crude oil. 
We've already moved the rigs to the Wahoo#2 well location to conduct the drillstem test there and expect to have results later this month. Once the drillstem test is competed at Wahoo#2, we expect to move the rig to drill the Wahoo South exploration prospect, approximately five miles south of the original Wahoo discovery. We operate this BMC 30 block why would discovery. We operate this BMC-30 block with a 30% working interest.
Shifting to exploration, we announced the first deepwater discovery in Rovuma Basin offshore of Mozambique in the first quarter. The Windjammer exploration well encountered more than 555 net feet of natural gas pay, and most importantly established the presence of an active hydrocarbon system. We operate Windjammer with a paying interest of about 43%. Our second deepwater exploration well in the basin was located approximately 50 miles south of the Windjammer discovery at the Collier prospects. 
Drilling was stopped and the well abandoned because we reached the rigs designed framers at the top of the reservoir objective. We will continue to evaluate this and the numerous process in play types across our 2.6 million acres in this offshore block and had move the rig to another location called the Ironclad prospect, which will be followed by another exploration well in our Barquentine prospect. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, as everyone is most certainly aware of the events involving the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig and the BP-operated Macondo prospect resulted in the loss of life, a release of oil into the Gulf and a large-scale response effort. As a 25% non-operating partner in the well, we have offered assistance to BP in our support of the unified commands role and coordinating the necessary resources to address the situation. 
As we outlined in last night's news release, we maintained insurance policies that are designed to protect against the portion of potential financial losses occurring as a result of such events. Our share of cost recovered up to an aggregate level of approximately $710 million less deductibles. This insurance is designed to cover costs associated with stopping the hydrocarbon release, drilling relief wells, cleanup and other liabilities and associated costs. Based on our 25% non-operated interest, we estimate our deductibles will total about $15 million and our insurance will cover net cost to APC's working interest 25%, up to approximately $178 million.
It is still early in the response, back to gathering and investigation process. As a non-operator, we are in a position today to speculate on the ultimately outcomes of the root cause of the accident. We remain focused on managing through this event and based on what we know today, we are not currently making any major changes or interruptions to our capital spending programs or strategic objectives. However, we will not hesitate to take actions if necessary to protect the company and its financial health. We will, of course, continue to communicate with you as greater clarity is obtained throughout the year. 
Turning to our financial results for the first quarter, we reported net income of $1.43 per diluted share. As with previous quarters, we've included the items affecting comparability in the tables attached to last night's earnings release. In total, these items increased our reported net income by $0.62 per diluted share. 
We generated more than $1.5 billion of discretionary cash flow during the first three months of the year and ended the quarter with approximately $3.7 billion of cash on hand. Free cash flow totaled almost $300 million, with capital expenditures of about $1.2 billion for the quarter. At current strip prices, our projected discretionary cash flow for the year should be sufficient to cover our announced 2010 capital program.
During the quarter, we further strenghtened the balance sheet by issuing $750 million of 30-year bonds to fund a substantial portion of the tender offers for our 2011 and 2012 maturing debt. We retired a total of $0.25 billion during the first and early second quarters, approximately $920 million of which was scheduled to mature in 2011. To further support our ability to deliver upon our exploration programs and megaprojects developments, we've augmented our 2011 hedge positions from the schedules we provided in March. A full description of these are available in the attachments to last night's news release. 
As I mentioned earlier on the call, we are raising our sales volume guidance for the full year to a range of 230 to 234 million barrels of oil equivalent from the previous range of 226 to 231 million barrels of oil equivalent, for an increase of 3.5 million barrels of oil equivalent at the midpoint. 
At our recent Investor Conference in March, we laid out bold long-term objectives for the future when we began delivering upon those expectations during the quarter. To recap, we enhanced our margins by continuing to focus capital on areas with higher liquids production, managing costs and improving efficiencies. We confirmed the market value of our Marcellus Shale position of approximately $4.5 billion gross via a joint venture agreement. 
We maintained time and cost schedules for bringing our sanctioned megaprojects online, and so far this year, five of the seven deepwater wells drilled have either been discoveries or successful appraisals. We expect to be active during the remainder of 2010 with approximately 20 deepwater well as planned. 
As a result, we can reaffirm our expectation to deliver approximately 400 million barrels of oil equivalent of net discovered resource of this year from our exploration programs. We also remain committed to allocating our capital dollars towards the most value-accretive projects within our portfolio going forward, and to make adjustments as necessary based on further developments in the Gulf.
At this time, I'm joined by our executive team and we welcome your questions. So Jerry, I might ask you to open up the lines."

And we're going to have to have some good legal minds to figure this out. We're on that process now. But it's not going to be immediate, it's going to take a little time. One comment I wanted to make about the Oil Pollution Act is that it was designed by Congress, in our opinion, to handle exactly the situation that has occurred now. The Congress imposed upon all the Gulf of Mexico oil producers to pay into the trust fund amount of every barrel that we produce. That protects Anadarko and its shareholders and we've done that.

So in our view, it wasn't going to change our strategy or tactics for the next four or five years. And therefore, we see all of these as very long dated, and we weren't absolutely sure how helpful either piece of legislation would be for the natural gas toward the end of the day. We still are trying to press for that or we're going to press for that prior to Senator Graham walking away from the bill. We now hear that Senator Reid may put it back up for consideration.

This is a short-term issue, I think more than a long-term issue. So I'm still very hopeful about even the direction that Kerry-Graham-Lieberman was taking was much more pro-natural gas for the first time.

And while we do have a rig targeted at this point, we're also evaluating other rig options to make sure that this is the best rig to come over there.

We have got the th code 702 coming in June, going slow with the oil well [ph] (01:12:04) exploratory prospect, which is a prospect just to the west of Tweneboa. It's a mirror image to Tweneboa back to maybe said from the same sound system. Then we'll move over to either Tweneboa appraisal or to the El Niño prospect.

Then you asked about Mozambique, the drilling campaign there, we publicly said about before we do have a drilling commitment that's beyond that and with, of course, the Windjammer success, we do plan to continue with that activity. Our partnership has been in discussion about which prospects we would drill. We took the rig over to the East Africa and we would like to keep it there to make sure that we get all of the play types evaluated, that we get any discoveries that we make appraised and that we learn as much as we can about that block.

So I would ask you to elaborate on that when you get the chance here. Regarding the macro, we still stay cautiously optimistic the inventory situation is shaping up to be a little bit like last year, which caused us to hedge a fair portion of 2010 but the difference is we did that last year thinking that we're going to be determined as inflows of an LNG into the U.S. and we haven't seen enough of that this year to date to be consistent with that view that we had last year. And I think there's some dynamics internationally that are helping us in that regard, but I think at the end of the day, all of us on the phone and elsewhere need to make sure that we're putting the right pressure to the industry to say that the next piece of growth is not as important as getting returns. There may be selected plays like Marcellus that work really well at low prices but that's also part of what causes the issue. So we want -- we're being very careful on any gas drillings just like we were last year and on pure gas drilling and we're pursuing liquids, which we're fortunate to have in our portfolio. And we just got to show the discipline and then it will correct itself from what would be in a good place."

Good morning, everyone. Before we get into results for the quarter, I want to first express the sadness we feel and extend our sincere condolences to the families of those who were lost in the Deepwater Horizon accident about two weeks ago.",2511,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Before we get into results for the quarter, I want to first express the sadness we feel and extend our sincere condolences to the families of those who were lost in the Deepwater Horizon accident about two weeks ago. As a non-operating partner, we want to answer questions regarding the cause as much as anyone in resolution as quickly as possible. We understand this event is foremost in everyone's mind and we will discuss it in more detail with you later in the call. But before we do, I'll spend a few minute moments reviewing the results of our first quarter. 
As you saw in the press release, our producing assets delivered a record quarter, with total volumes of 62 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our E&P organization accomplished this, while also continuing to reduce our lease operating expense per unit. With strong run rates and minimal work over us in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, lease operating expense improved by about 19% sequentially over the fourth quarter of 2009 and by 32% year-over-year.
Through these efforts to reduce LOE, we are now among the lowest cost producers in our peer group. Other summary highlights during the quarter are that we made good progress in our shale plays, announced the new deepwater discovery in the frontier basin and drilled three successful appraisal wells that confirmed the resource potential and the ability of several emerging megaprojects. We also closed a $1.5 billion joint venture agreement with Mitsui in the Marcellus Shale and retired or refinanced near-term debt to further strengthen our balance sheet.
Our reported quarterly sales volume increased by about 15% relative to the first quarter of 2009. Of note, sales volumes for the quarter included about 1.9 million barrels of oil equivalent from a royalty price threshold adjustment related to our 2009 Gulf of Mexico natural gas sales. Adjusting volumes for these factors still leaves above the high-end of our volume metric guidance for the quarter and represents an 11% increase over the first quarter of 2009. 
Due to the strong performance of our producing assets, we are increasing the midpoint of our full year sales volume guidance by 3.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. A major contributor to our production growth was a 35% increase in our total liquids production to almost 26 million barrels compared to 19 million barrels in the first quarter of 2009. This is a direct result of the actions we took at the beginning of 2009 to focus on liquids-rich areas within our U.S. onshore portfolio. Liquids for the quarter comprised 42% of our overall reported sales, directly contributing to our enhanced cash flow margin per barrel of oil equivalent. 
As I mentioned to you moments ago, our E&P organization did an outstanding job in the quarter of managing our assets. As a result of these efforts, we're now reducing our annual guidance for LOE by $0.25 per barrel of oil equivalent. We are and have been focused on investing in areas of our portfolio that offer the strongest economics. Given the current market conditions for oil and natural gas prices, this involves focusing on areas with high liquids yields. 
The Marcellus Shale, given its strong economics, is currently the only area of pure natural gas drilling, in which we are prudently increasing our activity levels. The increased investments are being carried by Mitsui through the joint venture agreement that we closed in the first quarter. Currently, we are producing approximately 120 million cubic feet of natural gas per day on a gross basis from the Marcellus from about 30 wells with about 80 wells in various stages of completion, as three folds to our 2009 exit rate of about 40 million cubic feet per day gross. 
In another major shale play, the Eagleford in Southwest Texas, we continue to see strong results with very good liquids production, which compromises about 50% of the product stream and 75% of the production value. We expanded our position during the first quarter by acquiring more than 80,000 net acres from TXCO. This acquisition also increased our working interest to 75% across all of our Eagleford acreage.
The cost of this acquisition was approximately $1,100 per acre, which is a very competitive both to the higher or recent industry cost for acreage year. We ended the first quarter with four rigs running and have drilled more than 20 wells in this play and are driving down drilling times, reducing our cost per well and seeing good economics with EURs of over 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per well. We've identified hundreds of potential well locations in this play, are in the process of adding two more rigs in the coming weeks and pursuing plans to significantly expand the midstream infrastructure to capture the value we see over our 300,000 net acreage position. 
One of the new areas in which we are actively drilling is the Bone Spring play in the Delaware Basin of West Texas where we control 170,000 net acres. Like the Eagleford in Wattenberg areas, Bone Spring is a high-liquid composition. We are currently running four rigs in the play with one recent completion flowing at a maximum rate of almost 1,200 barrels per day. We also anticipate that our partner in this play will be increasing their rig count, thereby providing for an active program throughout the year. 
In Iraqi's region, we expect to be drilling by the end of the quarter in the oil-focused horizontal Niobrara play, where we have 500,000 net acres. By virtue of several modest-sized firm ups that we completed over the last several years within our mineral interest, we have had access to industry information on the recent drilling in the shale, which allows us to better derisk the play with other people's money as we prepared for our own drilling program this year.
In addition to meaningful growth that we are demonstrating with our onshore assets, we can currently remain on track and on budget to deliver first oil from Jubilee Phase I in offshore Ghana beginning later this year. Caesar/Tonga in the Gulf of Mexico beginning in the first half of 2011 and El Merk in Algeria beginning in late 2011. The partnership has nearly completed the construction work on the 120 barrel per day FPSO for the Jubilee Phase I development, and we expect to mobilize the vessel to Ghana in the coming week. Tags to infrastructures are being installed and completions work has been initiated. 
At the Caesar/Tonga complex in deepwater Gulf of Mexico, construction activities are progressing as planned. In Algeria at El Merk, the partnership has drilled almost half of the 140 planned wells and the facilities construction is on track. 
Meanwhile, our global deepwater drilling programs continues to proves successful in advancing the next wave of megaprojects. During the quarter, we announced successful appraisal wells of Lucius and Vito in the Gulf of Mexico and at Tweneboa offshore Ghana. We announce that the Lucius appraisal on the Gulf encountered almost 600 net feet of high-quality oil pay in the subsalt Pliocene and Miocene sands. 
The appraisal well was an up-dip sidetrack approximately 3,200 feet south of discovery well in Keathley Canyon Block 875. The reservoirs of Lucius have excellent porosity and permeability based on the core and log data recovered. We recently spud our second appraisal well and plans to drill a third immediately thereafter as we evaluate development options for this discovery. We operate Lucius with a 50% working interest.
In the first quarter, we also announced the successful appraisal well at Vito in Mississippi Canyon Block 940 in the Gulf of Mexico. The appraisal well, which is more than a mile from the Vito discovery well encountered more than 600 feet of high-quality oil in thick subsalt Miocene sands. We are currently drilling our second appraisal well at Vito as we work with our partners to transition this large discovery to development. 
We hold a 20% working interest in Vito which is operated by Shell. Also in the Gulf, we are currently appraising our Heidelberg discovery. The original well encountered mechanical issues about 10,000 feet above the reservoir section and will now be redrilled with a projected total depth of 31,500 feet to test middle to lower Miocene objectives, similar to the Heidelberg discovery well in Green Canyon Block 903. 
Moving to Ghana at Tweneboa in #2 well located about four miles southeast to the original discovery well confirmed our expectations of finding a down-dip oil accumulation and thicker sand section. The well encountered about 105 net feet of pay, which is over half of the pay count being oil in the remainder of gas condensate. The partnership expects to drill two additional appraisal wells in Tweneboa later this year as well as an exploration well at the neighboring El Wol [ph](38:50) prospect. 
In Brazil, another of our emerging megaprojects, we announced last month the successful drillstem test at the pre-salt Wahoo#1 well. It voted an unstimulated and equipment limited rate of about 7,500 barrels of oil per day. Test results indicate this well will be able to produce in a sustained rate of more than 15,000 barrels per day of high-quality crude oil. 
We've already moved the rigs to the Wahoo#2 well location to conduct the drillstem test there and expect to have results later this month. Once the drillstem test is competed at Wahoo#2, we expect to move the rig to drill the Wahoo South exploration prospect, approximately five miles south of the original Wahoo discovery. We operate this BMC 30 block why would discovery. We operate this BMC-30 block with a 30% working interest.
Shifting to exploration, we announced the first deepwater discovery in Rovuma Basin offshore of Mozambique in the first quarter. The Windjammer exploration well encountered more than 555 net feet of natural gas pay, and most importantly established the presence of an active hydrocarbon system. We operate Windjammer with a paying interest of about 43%. Our second deepwater exploration well in the basin was located approximately 50 miles south of the Windjammer discovery at the Collier prospects. 
Drilling was stopped and the well abandoned because we reached the rigs designed framers at the top of the reservoir objective. We will continue to evaluate this and the numerous process in play types across our 2.6 million acres in this offshore block and had move the rig to another location called the Ironclad prospect, which will be followed by another exploration well in our Barquentine prospect. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, as everyone is most certainly aware of the events involving the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig and the BP-operated Macondo prospect resulted in the loss of life, a release of oil into the Gulf and a large-scale response effort. As a 25% non-operating partner in the well, we have offered assistance to BP in our support of the unified commands role and coordinating the necessary resources to address the situation. 
As we outlined in last night's news release, we maintained insurance policies that are designed to protect against the portion of potential financial losses occurring as a result of such events. Our share of cost recovered up to an aggregate level of approximately $710 million less deductibles. This insurance is designed to cover costs associated with stopping the hydrocarbon release, drilling relief wells, cleanup and other liabilities and associated costs. Based on our 25% non-operated interest, we estimate our deductibles will total about $15 million and our insurance will cover net cost to APC's working interest 25%, up to approximately $178 million.
It is still early in the response, back to gathering and investigation process. As a non-operator, we are in a position today to speculate on the ultimately outcomes of the root cause of the accident. We remain focused on managing through this event and based on what we know today, we are not currently making any major changes or interruptions to our capital spending programs or strategic objectives. However, we will not hesitate to take actions if necessary to protect the company and its financial health. We will, of course, continue to communicate with you as greater clarity is obtained throughout the year. 
Turning to our financial results for the first quarter, we reported net income of $1.43 per diluted share. As with previous quarters, we've included the items affecting comparability in the tables attached to last night's earnings release. In total, these items increased our reported net income by $0.62 per diluted share. 
We generated more than $1.5 billion of discretionary cash flow during the first three months of the year and ended the quarter with approximately $3.7 billion of cash on hand. Free cash flow totaled almost $300 million, with capital expenditures of about $1.2 billion for the quarter. At current strip prices, our projected discretionary cash flow for the year should be sufficient to cover our announced 2010 capital program.
During the quarter, we further strenghtened the balance sheet by issuing $750 million of 30-year bonds to fund a substantial portion of the tender offers for our 2011 and 2012 maturing debt. We retired a total of $0.25 billion during the first and early second quarters, approximately $920 million of which was scheduled to mature in 2011. To further support our ability to deliver upon our exploration programs and megaprojects developments, we've augmented our 2011 hedge positions from the schedules we provided in March. A full description of these are available in the attachments to last night's news release. 
As I mentioned earlier on the call, we are raising our sales volume guidance for the full year to a range of 230 to 234 million barrels of oil equivalent from the previous range of 226 to 231 million barrels of oil equivalent, for an increase of 3.5 million barrels of oil equivalent at the midpoint. 
At our recent Investor Conference in March, we laid out bold long-term objectives for the future when we began delivering upon those expectations during the quarter. To recap, we enhanced our margins by continuing to focus capital on areas with higher liquids production, managing costs and improving efficiencies. We confirmed the market value of our Marcellus Shale position of approximately $4.5 billion gross via a joint venture agreement. 
We maintained time and cost schedules for bringing our sanctioned megaprojects online, and so far this year, five of the seven deepwater wells drilled have either been discoveries or successful appraisals. We expect to be active during the remainder of 2010 with approximately 20 deepwater well as planned. 
As a result, we can reaffirm our expectation to deliver approximately 400 million barrels of oil equivalent of net discovered resource of this year from our exploration programs. We also remain committed to allocating our capital dollars towards the most value-accretive projects within our portfolio going forward, and to make adjustments as necessary based on further developments in the Gulf.
At this time, I'm joined by our executive team and we welcome your questions. So Jerry, I might ask you to open up the lines."

Let me put a little perspective on this and kind of put a package around it for some of you. Remember that Anadarko is a non-operator here. The BP is the operator here -- is really focused appropriately all their attention on the response right now in initial investigation. Anybody that's been involved in a situation like this knows that it is extremely complicated. The investigation will hopefully give us some indication on what happened here, what the cause of the accident was, and then there are very complicated contracts involved here, indemnities, insurance coverage, the possible application of Oil Pollution Act of 1990 or other laws that really have a puzzle here that has to be figured out. And we're going to have to have some good legal minds to figure this out. We're on that process now. But it's not going to be immediate, it's going to take a little time. One comment I wanted to make about the Oil Pollution Act is that it was designed by Congress, in our opinion, to handle exactly the situation that has occurred now. The Congress imposed upon all the Gulf of Mexico oil producers to pay into the trust fund amount of every barrel that we produce. That protects Anadarko and its shareholders and we've done that. We believe it's going to be applicable. We don't know the ultimate potential outcome here. And it's not appropriate for us to speculate further. But I wanted you to know that it's not an immediate assessment that we'll be able to make. It will take some time."

Of course, it was 50 miles south of our Windjammer prospect, a little bit different play type, certainly a different seismic character which lead us to that. We designed the well to handle the anticipated pressures that we would see in our total depth. And we've reached those design parameters and we have to stop right at the very top of our objective. So what we're going to do is take all of the data that we have acquired from the wellbore, tied in to our seismic and make a decision is there another location either on this prospect or adjacent to it on a look-alike prospect that we may want to come back and test. But right now, we're just tying all that data into a regional understanding. Meanwhile, we're taking a big F and we topset the Barquentine prospect and then moved over to the Ironclad and we disbud the Ironclad prospect. They're very different plate types. They're both kind of big strap plays, similar to what we're seeing over in the West Africa side. Again, they do have particularly the ironclad one, has more potential for liquids as you move to the southeast [ph] (59:20). It's even further south than the Collier well.

On Sierra Leone and Liberia, the West African campaign, there's a lot of information in the offshore but we publicly told folks that we would like to be back in the Sierra Leone and Liberia and are planning that. For the second half of the year, it will probably be October timeframe before we get over there. We're looking at one well in Liberia, an exploratory well and an exploratory well at Sierra Leone. We have to work up all of the data and make sure that we get the partner approvals for that. And while we do have a rig targeted at this point, we're also evaluating other rig options to make sure that this is the best rig to come over there. But all of that is coming together and we do have the prospects identified. Of course, the Liberia 3D that we acquired, we've got file product in. We've got multiple prospects that come out of that. And then the Sierra Leone 3D that we're reprocessing for the Venus appraisal is good enough to identify prospects for exploratory work and so we do anticipate that it will be drawn affected wells there. Additionally in Ghana, we have passes the appraisail and exploration work they're going to be this year. We have got the th code 702 coming in June, going slow with the oil well [ph] (01:12:04) exploratory prospect, which is a prospect just to the west of Tweneboa. It's a mirror image to Tweneboa back to maybe said from the same sound system. Then we'll move over to either Tweneboa appraisal or to the El Niño prospect. But overall, in Ghana, we're going to drill at least four more wells exploratory and appraisal wells that can be two Tweneboa well, oil well [ph] (01:12:27) and El Niña this year with the 702. Then you asked about Mozambique, the drilling campaign there, we publicly said about before we do have a drilling commitment that's beyond that and with, of course, the Windjammer success, we do plan to continue with that activity. Our partnership has been in discussion about which prospects we would drill. We took the rig over to the East Africa and we would like to keep it there to make sure that we get all of the play types evaluated, that we get any discoveries that we make appraised and that we learn as much as we can about that block.

I think that you may have heard from Bob Gwin is that, if we found ourselves needing to adjust capital spending, we might look at things across the board or in some areas where capital spending could be delayed and some of our development projects onshore.

Regarding the macro, we still stay cautiously optimistic the inventory situation is shaping up to be a little bit like last year, which caused us to hedge a fair portion of 2010 but the difference is we did that last year thinking that we're going to be determined as inflows of an LNG into the U.S. and we haven't seen enough of that this year to date to be consistent with that view that we had last year. And I think there's some dynamics internationally that are helping us in that regard, but I think at the end of the day, all of us on the phone and elsewhere need to make sure that we're putting the right pressure to the industry to say that the next piece of growth is not as important as getting returns. There may be selected plays like Marcellus that work really well at low prices but that's also part of what causes the issue. So we want -- we're being very careful on any gas drillings just like we were last year and on pure gas drilling and we're pursuing liquids, which we're fortunate to have in our portfolio.

Good morning, everyone. Before we get into results for the quarter, I want to first express the sadness we feel and extend our sincere condolences to the families of those who were lost in the Deepwater Horizon accident about two weeks ago.",2511,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Before we get into results for the quarter, I want to first express the sadness we feel and extend our sincere condolences to the families of those who were lost in the Deepwater Horizon accident about two weeks ago. As a non-operating partner, we want to answer questions regarding the cause as much as anyone in resolution as quickly as possible. We understand this event is foremost in everyone's mind and we will discuss it in more detail with you later in the call. But before we do, I'll spend a few minute moments reviewing the results of our first quarter. 
As you saw in the press release, our producing assets delivered a record quarter, with total volumes of 62 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our E&P organization accomplished this, while also continuing to reduce our lease operating expense per unit. With strong run rates and minimal work over us in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, lease operating expense improved by about 19% sequentially over the fourth quarter of 2009 and by 32% year-over-year.
Through these efforts to reduce LOE, we are now among the lowest cost producers in our peer group. Other summary highlights during the quarter are that we made good progress in our shale plays, announced the new deepwater discovery in the frontier basin and drilled three successful appraisal wells that confirmed the resource potential and the ability of several emerging megaprojects. We also closed a $1.5 billion joint venture agreement with Mitsui in the Marcellus Shale and retired or refinanced near-term debt to further strengthen our balance sheet.
Our reported quarterly sales volume increased by about 15% relative to the first quarter of 2009. Of note, sales volumes for the quarter included about 1.9 million barrels of oil equivalent from a royalty price threshold adjustment related to our 2009 Gulf of Mexico natural gas sales. Adjusting volumes for these factors still leaves above the high-end of our volume metric guidance for the quarter and represents an 11% increase over the first quarter of 2009. 
Due to the strong performance of our producing assets, we are increasing the midpoint of our full year sales volume guidance by 3.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. A major contributor to our production growth was a 35% increase in our total liquids production to almost 26 million barrels compared to 19 million barrels in the first quarter of 2009. This is a direct result of the actions we took at the beginning of 2009 to focus on liquids-rich areas within our U.S. onshore portfolio. Liquids for the quarter comprised 42% of our overall reported sales, directly contributing to our enhanced cash flow margin per barrel of oil equivalent. 
As I mentioned to you moments ago, our E&P organization did an outstanding job in the quarter of managing our assets. As a result of these efforts, we're now reducing our annual guidance for LOE by $0.25 per barrel of oil equivalent. We are and have been focused on investing in areas of our portfolio that offer the strongest economics. Given the current market conditions for oil and natural gas prices, this involves focusing on areas with high liquids yields. 
The Marcellus Shale, given its strong economics, is currently the only area of pure natural gas drilling, in which we are prudently increasing our activity levels. The increased investments are being carried by Mitsui through the joint venture agreement that we closed in the first quarter. Currently, we are producing approximately 120 million cubic feet of natural gas per day on a gross basis from the Marcellus from about 30 wells with about 80 wells in various stages of completion, as three folds to our 2009 exit rate of about 40 million cubic feet per day gross. 
In another major shale play, the Eagleford in Southwest Texas, we continue to see strong results with very good liquids production, which compromises about 50% of the product stream and 75% of the production value. We expanded our position during the first quarter by acquiring more than 80,000 net acres from TXCO. This acquisition also increased our working interest to 75% across all of our Eagleford acreage.
The cost of this acquisition was approximately $1,100 per acre, which is a very competitive both to the higher or recent industry cost for acreage year. We ended the first quarter with four rigs running and have drilled more than 20 wells in this play and are driving down drilling times, reducing our cost per well and seeing good economics with EURs of over 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per well. We've identified hundreds of potential well locations in this play, are in the process of adding two more rigs in the coming weeks and pursuing plans to significantly expand the midstream infrastructure to capture the value we see over our 300,000 net acreage position. 
One of the new areas in which we are actively drilling is the Bone Spring play in the Delaware Basin of West Texas where we control 170,000 net acres. Like the Eagleford in Wattenberg areas, Bone Spring is a high-liquid composition. We are currently running four rigs in the play with one recent completion flowing at a maximum rate of almost 1,200 barrels per day. We also anticipate that our partner in this play will be increasing their rig count, thereby providing for an active program throughout the year. 
In Iraqi's region, we expect to be drilling by the end of the quarter in the oil-focused horizontal Niobrara play, where we have 500,000 net acres. By virtue of several modest-sized firm ups that we completed over the last several years within our mineral interest, we have had access to industry information on the recent drilling in the shale, which allows us to better derisk the play with other people's money as we prepared for our own drilling program this year.
In addition to meaningful growth that we are demonstrating with our onshore assets, we can currently remain on track and on budget to deliver first oil from Jubilee Phase I in offshore Ghana beginning later this year. Caesar/Tonga in the Gulf of Mexico beginning in the first half of 2011 and El Merk in Algeria beginning in late 2011. The partnership has nearly completed the construction work on the 120 barrel per day FPSO for the Jubilee Phase I development, and we expect to mobilize the vessel to Ghana in the coming week. Tags to infrastructures are being installed and completions work has been initiated. 
At the Caesar/Tonga complex in deepwater Gulf of Mexico, construction activities are progressing as planned. In Algeria at El Merk, the partnership has drilled almost half of the 140 planned wells and the facilities construction is on track. 
Meanwhile, our global deepwater drilling programs continues to proves successful in advancing the next wave of megaprojects. During the quarter, we announced successful appraisal wells of Lucius and Vito in the Gulf of Mexico and at Tweneboa offshore Ghana. We announce that the Lucius appraisal on the Gulf encountered almost 600 net feet of high-quality oil pay in the subsalt Pliocene and Miocene sands. 
The appraisal well was an up-dip sidetrack approximately 3,200 feet south of discovery well in Keathley Canyon Block 875. The reservoirs of Lucius have excellent porosity and permeability based on the core and log data recovered. We recently spud our second appraisal well and plans to drill a third immediately thereafter as we evaluate development options for this discovery. We operate Lucius with a 50% working interest.
In the first quarter, we also announced the successful appraisal well at Vito in Mississippi Canyon Block 940 in the Gulf of Mexico. The appraisal well, which is more than a mile from the Vito discovery well encountered more than 600 feet of high-quality oil in thick subsalt Miocene sands. We are currently drilling our second appraisal well at Vito as we work with our partners to transition this large discovery to development. 
We hold a 20% working interest in Vito which is operated by Shell. Also in the Gulf, we are currently appraising our Heidelberg discovery. The original well encountered mechanical issues about 10,000 feet above the reservoir section and will now be redrilled with a projected total depth of 31,500 feet to test middle to lower Miocene objectives, similar to the Heidelberg discovery well in Green Canyon Block 903. 
Moving to Ghana at Tweneboa in #2 well located about four miles southeast to the original discovery well confirmed our expectations of finding a down-dip oil accumulation and thicker sand section. The well encountered about 105 net feet of pay, which is over half of the pay count being oil in the remainder of gas condensate. The partnership expects to drill two additional appraisal wells in Tweneboa later this year as well as an exploration well at the neighboring El Wol [ph](38:50) prospect. 
In Brazil, another of our emerging megaprojects, we announced last month the successful drillstem test at the pre-salt Wahoo#1 well. It voted an unstimulated and equipment limited rate of about 7,500 barrels of oil per day. Test results indicate this well will be able to produce in a sustained rate of more than 15,000 barrels per day of high-quality crude oil. 
We've already moved the rigs to the Wahoo#2 well location to conduct the drillstem test there and expect to have results later this month. Once the drillstem test is competed at Wahoo#2, we expect to move the rig to drill the Wahoo South exploration prospect, approximately five miles south of the original Wahoo discovery. We operate this BMC 30 block why would discovery. We operate this BMC-30 block with a 30% working interest.
Shifting to exploration, we announced the first deepwater discovery in Rovuma Basin offshore of Mozambique in the first quarter. The Windjammer exploration well encountered more than 555 net feet of natural gas pay, and most importantly established the presence of an active hydrocarbon system. We operate Windjammer with a paying interest of about 43%. Our second deepwater exploration well in the basin was located approximately 50 miles south of the Windjammer discovery at the Collier prospects. 
Drilling was stopped and the well abandoned because we reached the rigs designed framers at the top of the reservoir objective. We will continue to evaluate this and the numerous process in play types across our 2.6 million acres in this offshore block and had move the rig to another location called the Ironclad prospect, which will be followed by another exploration well in our Barquentine prospect. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, as everyone is most certainly aware of the events involving the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig and the BP-operated Macondo prospect resulted in the loss of life, a release of oil into the Gulf and a large-scale response effort. As a 25% non-operating partner in the well, we have offered assistance to BP in our support of the unified commands role and coordinating the necessary resources to address the situation. 
As we outlined in last night's news release, we maintained insurance policies that are designed to protect against the portion of potential financial losses occurring as a result of such events. Our share of cost recovered up to an aggregate level of approximately $710 million less deductibles. This insurance is designed to cover costs associated with stopping the hydrocarbon release, drilling relief wells, cleanup and other liabilities and associated costs. Based on our 25% non-operated interest, we estimate our deductibles will total about $15 million and our insurance will cover net cost to APC's working interest 25%, up to approximately $178 million.
It is still early in the response, back to gathering and investigation process. As a non-operator, we are in a position today to speculate on the ultimately outcomes of the root cause of the accident. We remain focused on managing through this event and based on what we know today, we are not currently making any major changes or interruptions to our capital spending programs or strategic objectives. However, we will not hesitate to take actions if necessary to protect the company and its financial health. We will, of course, continue to communicate with you as greater clarity is obtained throughout the year. 
Turning to our financial results for the first quarter, we reported net income of $1.43 per diluted share. As with previous quarters, we've included the items affecting comparability in the tables attached to last night's earnings release. In total, these items increased our reported net income by $0.62 per diluted share. 
We generated more than $1.5 billion of discretionary cash flow during the first three months of the year and ended the quarter with approximately $3.7 billion of cash on hand. Free cash flow totaled almost $300 million, with capital expenditures of about $1.2 billion for the quarter. At current strip prices, our projected discretionary cash flow for the year should be sufficient to cover our announced 2010 capital program.
During the quarter, we further strenghtened the balance sheet by issuing $750 million of 30-year bonds to fund a substantial portion of the tender offers for our 2011 and 2012 maturing debt. We retired a total of $0.25 billion during the first and early second quarters, approximately $920 million of which was scheduled to mature in 2011. To further support our ability to deliver upon our exploration programs and megaprojects developments, we've augmented our 2011 hedge positions from the schedules we provided in March. A full description of these are available in the attachments to last night's news release. 
As I mentioned earlier on the call, we are raising our sales volume guidance for the full year to a range of 230 to 234 million barrels of oil equivalent from the previous range of 226 to 231 million barrels of oil equivalent, for an increase of 3.5 million barrels of oil equivalent at the midpoint. 
At our recent Investor Conference in March, we laid out bold long-term objectives for the future when we began delivering upon those expectations during the quarter. To recap, we enhanced our margins by continuing to focus capital on areas with higher liquids production, managing costs and improving efficiencies. We confirmed the market value of our Marcellus Shale position of approximately $4.5 billion gross via a joint venture agreement. 
We maintained time and cost schedules for bringing our sanctioned megaprojects online, and so far this year, five of the seven deepwater wells drilled have either been discoveries or successful appraisals. We expect to be active during the remainder of 2010 with approximately 20 deepwater well as planned. 
As a result, we can reaffirm our expectation to deliver approximately 400 million barrels of oil equivalent of net discovered resource of this year from our exploration programs. We also remain committed to allocating our capital dollars towards the most value-accretive projects within our portfolio going forward, and to make adjustments as necessary based on further developments in the Gulf.
At this time, I'm joined by our executive team and we welcome your questions. So Jerry, I might ask you to open up the lines.

So we're looking at it as based on what we see today in insurance to cover the next few months. And as Jim mentioned, there's a lot of uncertainty around how far this will go into the future and what the ultimate remediation cause will be.

We've got $1.3 billion all of a revolver that's committed through 2013. In addition, we generated a lot of discretionary cash flow over $1.5 billion in the first quarter. If it was necessary, we could chose in the future to redirect or reduce our spending, selectively sell our farm down assets. We obviously have a broad and a deep portfolio attractive assets and I think we'd be more inclined to look in that direction rather than to the capital markets. And as everyone saw in our investor conference in March, we have a five-year plan that delivers some very good results and a series of discoveries, recent discoveries, they're not a part of that five-year plan that start to kick in to provide accelerated growth well into the future. So we think we've got the types of flexibility with our investment opportunities in our existing assets to deal with the size of the costs, even if some of the very,very high levels of the media is tossing around out there.

Of course, it was 50 miles south of our Windjammer prospect, a little bit different play type, certainly a different seismic character which lead us to that. We designed the well to handle the anticipated pressures that we would see in our total depth. And we've reached those design parameters and we have to stop right at the very top of our objective. So what we're going to do is take all of the data that we have acquired from the wellbore, tied in to our seismic and make a decision is there another location either on this prospect or adjacent to it on a look-alike prospect that we may want to come back and test. But right now, we're just tying all that data into a regional understanding. Meanwhile, we're taking a big F and we topset the Barquentine prospect and then moved over to the Ironclad and we disbud the Ironclad prospect. They're very different plate types. They're both kind of big strap plays, similar to what we're seeing over in the West Africa side. Again, they do have particularly the ironclad one, has more potential for liquids as you move to the southeast [ph] (59:20). It's even further south than the Collier well. So I guess the overall result of Collier is that we recognize now that we've got from pressure regime that we got to design for. We also have a lot of data from it that we need to tie into our overall regional understanding and we need to continue to test these play concepts as we continue to evaluate the block there.

This is a short-term issue, I think more than a long-term issue. So I'm still very hopeful about even the direction that Kerry-Graham-Lieberman was taking was much more pro-natural gas for the first time. We saw a proposed Senate legislation at least our reading of it or understanding of it, that was going to be very positive about electric generation uses of natural gas.

And while we do have a rig targeted at this point, we're also evaluating other rig options to make sure that this is the best rig to come over there.

And then the Sierra Leone 3D that we're reprocessing for the Venus appraisal is good enough to identify prospects for exploratory work and so we do anticipate that it will be drawn affected wells there.

We have got the th code 702 coming in June, going slow with the oil well [ph] (01:12:04) exploratory prospect, which is a prospect just to the west of Tweneboa. It's a mirror image to Tweneboa back to maybe said from the same sound system. Then we'll move over to either Tweneboa appraisal or to the El Niño prospect.

We took the rig over to the East Africa and we would like to keep it there to make sure that we get all of the play types evaluated, that we get any discoveries that we make appraised and that we learn as much as we can about that block.

As we move over to southeast channel, they're the same age fans but they're totally not tied into the Jubilee van complex. So we'll be more like testing Tweneboa or Jubilee originally before we go out and test either the Southeast Number one or two. We'll roll the Tahoma well into our risking.

So I would ask you to elaborate on that when you get the chance here. Regarding the macro, we still stay cautiously optimistic the inventory situation is shaping up to be a little bit like last year, which caused us to hedge a fair portion of 2010 but the difference is we did that last year thinking that we're going to be determined as inflows of an LNG into the U.S. and we haven't seen enough of that this year to date to be consistent with that view that we had last year. And I think there's some dynamics internationally that are helping us in that regard, but I think at the end of the day, all of us on the phone and elsewhere need to make sure that we're putting the right pressure to the industry to say that the next piece of growth is not as important as getting returns. There may be selected plays like Marcellus that work really well at low prices but that's also part of what causes the issue. So we want -- we're being very careful on any gas drillings just like we were last year and on pure gas drilling and we're pursuing liquids, which we're fortunate to have in our portfolio. And we just got to show the discipline and then it will correct itself from what would be in a good place.

And then later in the call, we'll provide an overview of our financial results. I'll also express our thoughts regarding the tragic Deepwater Horizon events in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Anadarko delivered strong results consistent with its business objectives during the second quarter. We increased quarterly sales volumes by about 6% year-over-year, continued to focus on our margins and achieved significantly lower lease operating expenses, expanded the success of our onshore shales and unconventional assets, set production records in many of our major asset areas while increasing capital efficiencies, achieved further drilling success in deepwater with positive appraisals at Lucius and Vito in the Gulf of Mexico and a Jubilee area in Ghana, and reached significant milestones with our sanctioned mega projects with all three remaining on schedule and on budget. 
As reported in last night's earnings release, our producing assets delivered total sales volumes of 59 million barrels of oil equivalent for the quarter, including a 16% increase in liquid volumes year-over-year. This growth was driven by our shales and unconventional place both in the Rockies and in the Southern and Appalachia regions. The Rockies delivered sales growth of about 10% relative to the second quarter of 2009, with NGL sales increasing about 70% and crude sales about 20%. The Greater Natural Buttes area, Wattenberg, Salt Creek, Monell and the Wamsutter field all reported operating production records during the quarter. 
With a focus we have in liquids-rich plays, Anadarko is taking steps to ensure its ability to fractionate and transport NGLs by entering into a six-year 62,000 barrel a day agreement. This provides firm capacity for NGL production from the Rockies in Texas, as well as access to the Gulf Coast markets. 
Focusing upon the shale plays they experienced significant growth in average daily net sales volumes from 7,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter of this year to 13,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. 
We continue to effectively manage the cost structure across the company as well. Lease operating expenses of $3.32 per BOE was a 15% improvement over the second quarter of 2009. As I mentioned in our last conference call, these efforts to reduce LOE have made us one of the most efficient producers in our peer group. On to our efforts to safely improve spud-to-spud cycle times have led to many field setting new drilling time records, including seven different asset areas just in the Southern and Appalachia region. 
I want to especially highlight the tremendous progress the E&P teams have made in our shale plays. Starting in the Maverick Basin in South Texas, we've transitioned the Eagle Ford play from an exploration effort to a full scale development project. Our wells have a high liquids content, comprising about 75% of the revenue stream and due to the high capital returns it delivers, this has become an area for increased capital deployment. The cost to drill these wells is about $4.5 million per well, with estimated ultimate recoveries of more than 300,000 barrels. 
In addition, we're starting to see drilling and completion costs trending downward, as we move to multi-well pad drilling and optimizing our completion configuration. Based on these results, we've ramped up our development program to six rigs. There is significant running room in this preferred portion of the play with a potential to drill more than 2,000 Eagle Ford wells on the 400,000 gross acres that we control in the Maverick Basin. 
In the same acreage, we are also evaluating the deeper Pearsall Shale, which is a dry gas play and represents additional option value. Our Eagle Ford activity will allow us to hold these Pearsall opportunities and enable us to capitalize in the future when this natural gas investment option becomes more competitive within our portfolio. Given the tremendous value we see for the Eagle Ford/Pearsall play, Anadarko is evaluating another joint venture similar to the one we completed in the first quarter in the Marcellus. And we anticipate having something to announce before year end. 
Our Marcellus pace continues to accelerate as well. We're currently running six operated rigs, and 15 non-operated rigs and the 760,000 gross acres in which we participate or have control of in this play. We're seeing significantly improved cycle time and excellent estimated ultimate recoveries consistently above four BCF per well. 
Peak production during the quarter reached about 140 million cubic feet a day, gross from 35 wells, with another 100-plus wells awaiting either completion or connection to the gathering system. We expect to have taps in place for about 1.2 BCF per day and total gathering capacity of more than 700 million cubic feet per day within the next year. 
With consistent results today across this large acreage position, we estimate the captured resource potential on our Marcellus acreage at well over 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent, on a risk basis net to our interests. We're continuing to pursue several other opportunities with a liquids focus, which have produced very encouraging results and are worth highlighting as well. 
In the Bone Spring play of West Texas, we are now running four rigs and our 540,000 gross acre position in the area. We're early in this play and are already seeing some initial production rates of more than 1,000 barrels of oil per day, with natural gas that has a high BTU content as well as good market taxes. This play also offers significant running room when combined with the potential for the overlying Avalon Shale where we should have our first results by the end of this month. 
Another emerging area for Anadarko is the Horizontal Niobrara, another oil-focused play in Northeastern Colorado and Southeastern Wyoming. We plan to drill six to 10 operated wells beginning in the third quarter, now that we have gleaned important information in our greater than 500,000 gross acreage position from prior farm-outs. Much of this acreage is in the land grant where we hold the mineral rights and perpetuity. We've been shooting seismic and acquiring leases that give us a commanding acreage position that is incremental to our 550,000 acre position in the Wattenberg field, where we have been producing in the Niobrara formation for many years. 
Our sanctioned mega projects continue to progress on schedule and on budget. During the quarter, we reached some major milestone in Ghana where the FPSO arrived in late June. It was moored on location over the Jubilee field. Completions in subsea installations are underway, and we expect first production by the end of this year. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, we expect to achieve first production at Caesar/Tonga by the middle of 2011, after completing all the heavy topside list during the quarter and continuing the subsea installations. We're hopeful to receive the necessary permits to perform completions on our three wells later this year. 
In Algeria, the El Merk project is approximately 50% complete. During the quarter, we drilled five additional wells and construction continued to progress. The construction project is entering an important stage where on-site activity is accelerating. First production is scheduled around the end of 2011. In total, we expect these three projects to add approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, net to Anadarko by 2012. 
In addition, these three sanctioned mega projects we are hard at work through exploration and appraisal drilling to bring the next generation of mega projects to development. This includes the Lucius field in the Gulf of Mexico where we announced that the appraisal well encountered more than 650 net feet of pay in the Pliocene. Drilling had to be stopped as a result of the deepwater drilling moratorium before penetrating the Miocene, which had between 125 and 215 net feet of oil pay in the two previous Lucius wells. With the information gathered to date, we have initiated preliminary front-end engineering and design work that will continue during the moratorium. We operate Lucius with a 50% working interest. 
Also, in the Gulf at Vito, we were very encouraged by the interim results of a second appraisal well, which encountered approximately 250 net feet of pay and a shallower Miocene reservoir which was not hydrocarbon bearing in the previous wells.  Operations to evaluate the main Miocene pay section of this location were also suspended as a result of the moratorium. The Vito appraisal program is operated by Shell, and we hold a 20% working interest. 
During the quarter, we also completed two wells at the Independence Hub facility. The first, the Merganser #3 sidetrack, was brought online in July, and we expect to bring the second Callisto online toward the end of the year. We remain ready to resume an active and safe deepwater to Gulf of Mexico drilling program once we receive the necessary authorization and operational clarity from the federal government. In the meantime, we've continued our deepwater drilling program internationally and achieved appraisal success in Ghana where the M-5 well encountered about 75 net feet of pay and extended the Jubilee field further to the south and east. 
Last week, we announced an additional exploration discovery in Ghana at the Owo prospect. The Owo-1 well is located approximately four miles west of the previous Tweneboa discovery and encountered approximately 174 net feet of high-quality oil pay. Preliminary data indicates that this is light oil with a gravity of between 33 and 36 API. 
Now the partnership will expand its already active appraisal program at Tweneboa to include Owo as we work to mature both of these fields towards sanction early next year. Additionally, the Owo discovery provides even more validation of the quality of our geologic models and the prospectivity of Anadarko's 8 million acre position in the West African Cretaceous Fan play, where we've identified more than 30 prospects and leads with size and geological characteristics similar to Jubilee. As part of our ongoing program in Africa, we are planning to mobilize the deepwater millennium drill shift from Brazil to West Africa in order to drill our second test offshore, Sierra Leone, and then the rig will assist with the appraisal programs with Tweneboa and Owo. 
During the quarter in Brazil, we successfully flow tested the Wahoo#1 well and based on the results of this test, we believe the well is capable of flowing in a sustained rate of more than 15,000 barrels per day. However, our efforts to flow test the Wahoo#2 well yielded inconclusive results. We elected to move the drill shift five miles to the south of the Wahoo#1 discovery well to drill the Wahoo South exploration well, which is our third test in the BM-C-30 block, where we operate with a 30% working interest. 
Also, in Brazil, we recently spud a post- and pre-salt test at the Itauna prospect on BM-C-29. Anadarko operates this prospect with a 50% working interest. In addition, Devon has also notified us that the first appraisal well, the Itaipu, in BM-C-32 is expected to spud in the third quarter. We hold a 33% working interest in Itaipu. 
In Mozambique, we are currently drilling the Ironclad prospect, which is approximately 70 miles of our Windjammer discovery in the Offshore Area 1 of the Rovuma Basin. Once the activity is concluded, Ironclad rig will move back to the Barquentine prospect for an Oligocene test as well as an appraisal of the Paleocene accumulation identified at the Windjammer discovery. 
We also continue joint activities at the Badik prospect from the Tarakan Basin of Indonesia. The well is being drilled toward a proposed depth of approximately 17,400 feet in order to test a large three-way fault closure in the Miocene. Anadarko operates Badik with a 35% working interest. 
As you can tell, we expect to continue the active exploration and appraisal program during the second half of the year and remain confident in reaching our stated goal of discovering more than 400 million barrels of net resources during the year from exploration activities. 
Turning to our financial results for the quarter, we reported a net loss of $0.08 per diluted share with certain items affecting comparability to decrease net income by $0.57 per share. Absent these items which are typically excluded by the investment community, our net income would have been $0.49 per diluted share as reconciled on Page 7 of last night's earnings release. We have not recorded a contingent liability associated with the Deepwater Horizon event based on applying accounting guidelines to the facts as they are known today. We expanded the disclosures in our second quarter 10-Q release yesterday and encourage you to use this document for a detailed description. 
I know that the Anadarko team feels a profound sense of sorrow over the Deepwater Horizon tragedy. We've all gained a measure of guarded hope this morning that last night's static kill operation is reported to have been successful. And we, along with others in the industry, continued to support the recovery efforts of Unified Area Command. 
During the second quarter, we issued a news release clearly stating our position with regard to the liabilities for the Deepwater Horizon tragedy under our joint operating agreement. There are numerous ongoing inquiries and independent investigations that must be brought to conclusion. However, the information and findings that have been made public to date continue to reinforce our belief that serious errors in judgment occurred that have direct implications on the obligations of parties under the operating agreement. 
As I told you at Senate subcommittee two weeks ago, any actions we have taken or may take under the joint operating agreement to protect our rights, shall in no way affect our commitment to meet our obligations under applicable laws. To its credit, BP has continued to make good at its commitment to pay all legitimate claims and we expect that to continue. It is in the best interest of all stakeholders in this tragic event. We also reassured the subcommittee that our balance sheet remains strong. 
During the quarter, we generated approximately $1.3 billion of discretionary cash flow while spending a little less than $1.4 billion on our capital programs. The company ended the quarter with approximately $3.4 billion of cash on hand. Subsequent to quarter end, Anadarko sold its Wattenberg gathering system and related facilities to Western Gas Partners for approximately $500 million, providing net cash proceeds of approximately $450 million to Anadarko. 
In an abundance of caution yesterday, we also announced that we've taken steps to further enhance our long-term liquidity position by obtaining firm commitments for a new secure $5 billion five-year committed credit facility and for a secured $1.5 billion six-year term loan. Upon closing, this will replace our shorter-term credit facility with a substantially larger and longer-dated facility and will refinance our existing midstream note that is currently scheduled to mature in 2012. 
In closing, the strong results of the second quarter demonstrated that the moratorium does not impact at current production or near-term guidance. We have continued to redirect capital from the Gulf to other areas of the portfolio such as the Eagle Ford Shale and the Bone Spring areas in our onshore portfolio. Primarily as a result of the strong operational performance from these and other liquids-rich assets, we are increasing our full year sales volume guidance and now expect to produce between 232 million and 236 million barrels of oil equivalent. This represents a 5% to 7% increase over 2009 production without increasing the capital spending projections from our March Investor Meetings. 
As in the past, we are providing a risk production profile and correspondingly our third and fourth quarter sales volumes guidance is reflective of historical weather and facility-related downtime. We also remain focused on achieving our longer-term objectives that we outlined for you at the March Investor Conference. I'm very proud of the results are employees delivered in the second quarter and pleased with the way this performance has set the stage for additional growth from our mega projects and continue the E&P success in the future. 
And now I look forward to answering your questions.  So Michael, if you could open up the phone lines."

And when we looked at it, actually, this is a far more mature than some of the areas we've been in, in West African and East Africa where we've had success. So what we try to do is, as explorers, is look at what we think the potential is with the data that's out there and not take any preconceived notions into it, but do take the learnings that we've had around the world. And particularly in the deepwater, when we look at what we see in New Zealand, we see a lot of potential, both in the Canterbury Basin off of the South Island where the well would be drilled, and then in the deepwater of the Taranaki Basin where the new acreage that we just acquired and we're shooting seismic on, we see quite a bit of potential. But we'll continue to do our evaluation, and then when the time is right, drill a well out there. The main prospect that we've seen, and it's under 3D and it's tied into a well that was drilled on the shelf, is 40,000-acre, four-way closure. And the well on the shelf tested 10 million a day and 2,000 barrels of condensate back in the late 70s or early 80s. So it's a real high quality prospect, and we'll get to it when the time is right."

Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share with you the second quarter operational achievements. And then later in the call, we'll provide an overview of our financial results.

And then later in the call, we'll provide an overview of our financial results. I'll also express our thoughts regarding the tragic Deepwater Horizon events in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Anadarko delivered strong results consistent with its business objectives during the second quarter. We increased quarterly sales volumes by about 6% year-over-year, continued to focus on our margins and achieved significantly lower lease operating expenses, expanded the success of our onshore shales and unconventional assets, set production records in many of our major asset areas while increasing capital efficiencies, achieved further drilling success in deepwater with positive appraisals at Lucius and Vito in the Gulf of Mexico and a Jubilee area in Ghana, and reached significant milestones with our sanctioned mega projects with all three remaining on schedule and on budget. 
As reported in last night's earnings release, our producing assets delivered total sales volumes of 59 million barrels of oil equivalent for the quarter, including a 16% increase in liquid volumes year-over-year. This growth was driven by our shales and unconventional place both in the Rockies and in the Southern and Appalachia regions. The Rockies delivered sales growth of about 10% relative to the second quarter of 2009, with NGL sales increasing about 70% and crude sales about 20%. The Greater Natural Buttes area, Wattenberg, Salt Creek, Monell and the Wamsutter field all reported operating production records during the quarter. 
With a focus we have in liquids-rich plays, Anadarko is taking steps to ensure its ability to fractionate and transport NGLs by entering into a six-year 62,000 barrel a day agreement. This provides firm capacity for NGL production from the Rockies in Texas, as well as access to the Gulf Coast markets. 
Focusing upon the shale plays they experienced significant growth in average daily net sales volumes from 7,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter of this year to 13,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. 
We continue to effectively manage the cost structure across the company as well. Lease operating expenses of $3.32 per BOE was a 15% improvement over the second quarter of 2009. As I mentioned in our last conference call, these efforts to reduce LOE have made us one of the most efficient producers in our peer group. On to our efforts to safely improve spud-to-spud cycle times have led to many field setting new drilling time records, including seven different asset areas just in the Southern and Appalachia region. 
I want to especially highlight the tremendous progress the E&P teams have made in our shale plays. Starting in the Maverick Basin in South Texas, we've transitioned the Eagle Ford play from an exploration effort to a full scale development project. Our wells have a high liquids content, comprising about 75% of the revenue stream and due to the high capital returns it delivers, this has become an area for increased capital deployment. The cost to drill these wells is about $4.5 million per well, with estimated ultimate recoveries of more than 300,000 barrels. 
In addition, we're starting to see drilling and completion costs trending downward, as we move to multi-well pad drilling and optimizing our completion configuration. Based on these results, we've ramped up our development program to six rigs. There is significant running room in this preferred portion of the play with a potential to drill more than 2,000 Eagle Ford wells on the 400,000 gross acres that we control in the Maverick Basin. 
In the same acreage, we are also evaluating the deeper Pearsall Shale, which is a dry gas play and represents additional option value. Our Eagle Ford activity will allow us to hold these Pearsall opportunities and enable us to capitalize in the future when this natural gas investment option becomes more competitive within our portfolio. Given the tremendous value we see for the Eagle Ford/Pearsall play, Anadarko is evaluating another joint venture similar to the one we completed in the first quarter in the Marcellus. And we anticipate having something to announce before year end. 
Our Marcellus pace continues to accelerate as well. We're currently running six operated rigs, and 15 non-operated rigs and the 760,000 gross acres in which we participate or have control of in this play. We're seeing significantly improved cycle time and excellent estimated ultimate recoveries consistently above four BCF per well. 
Peak production during the quarter reached about 140 million cubic feet a day, gross from 35 wells, with another 100-plus wells awaiting either completion or connection to the gathering system. We expect to have taps in place for about 1.2 BCF per day and total gathering capacity of more than 700 million cubic feet per day within the next year. 
With consistent results today across this large acreage position, we estimate the captured resource potential on our Marcellus acreage at well over 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent, on a risk basis net to our interests. We're continuing to pursue several other opportunities with a liquids focus, which have produced very encouraging results and are worth highlighting as well. 
In the Bone Spring play of West Texas, we are now running four rigs and our 540,000 gross acre position in the area. We're early in this play and are already seeing some initial production rates of more than 1,000 barrels of oil per day, with natural gas that has a high BTU content as well as good market taxes. This play also offers significant running room when combined with the potential for the overlying Avalon Shale where we should have our first results by the end of this month. 
Another emerging area for Anadarko is the Horizontal Niobrara, another oil-focused play in Northeastern Colorado and Southeastern Wyoming. We plan to drill six to 10 operated wells beginning in the third quarter, now that we have gleaned important information in our greater than 500,000 gross acreage position from prior farm-outs. Much of this acreage is in the land grant where we hold the mineral rights and perpetuity. We've been shooting seismic and acquiring leases that give us a commanding acreage position that is incremental to our 550,000 acre position in the Wattenberg field, where we have been producing in the Niobrara formation for many years. 
Our sanctioned mega projects continue to progress on schedule and on budget. During the quarter, we reached some major milestone in Ghana where the FPSO arrived in late June. It was moored on location over the Jubilee field. Completions in subsea installations are underway, and we expect first production by the end of this year. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, we expect to achieve first production at Caesar/Tonga by the middle of 2011, after completing all the heavy topside list during the quarter and continuing the subsea installations. We're hopeful to receive the necessary permits to perform completions on our three wells later this year. 
In Algeria, the El Merk project is approximately 50% complete. During the quarter, we drilled five additional wells and construction continued to progress. The construction project is entering an important stage where on-site activity is accelerating. First production is scheduled around the end of 2011. In total, we expect these three projects to add approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, net to Anadarko by 2012. 
In addition, these three sanctioned mega projects we are hard at work through exploration and appraisal drilling to bring the next generation of mega projects to development. This includes the Lucius field in the Gulf of Mexico where we announced that the appraisal well encountered more than 650 net feet of pay in the Pliocene. Drilling had to be stopped as a result of the deepwater drilling moratorium before penetrating the Miocene, which had between 125 and 215 net feet of oil pay in the two previous Lucius wells. With the information gathered to date, we have initiated preliminary front-end engineering and design work that will continue during the moratorium. We operate Lucius with a 50% working interest. 
Also, in the Gulf at Vito, we were very encouraged by the interim results of a second appraisal well, which encountered approximately 250 net feet of pay and a shallower Miocene reservoir which was not hydrocarbon bearing in the previous wells.  Operations to evaluate the main Miocene pay section of this location were also suspended as a result of the moratorium. The Vito appraisal program is operated by Shell, and we hold a 20% working interest. 
During the quarter, we also completed two wells at the Independence Hub facility. The first, the Merganser #3 sidetrack, was brought online in July, and we expect to bring the second Callisto online toward the end of the year. We remain ready to resume an active and safe deepwater to Gulf of Mexico drilling program once we receive the necessary authorization and operational clarity from the federal government. In the meantime, we've continued our deepwater drilling program internationally and achieved appraisal success in Ghana where the M-5 well encountered about 75 net feet of pay and extended the Jubilee field further to the south and east. 
Last week, we announced an additional exploration discovery in Ghana at the Owo prospect. The Owo-1 well is located approximately four miles west of the previous Tweneboa discovery and encountered approximately 174 net feet of high-quality oil pay. Preliminary data indicates that this is light oil with a gravity of between 33 and 36 API. 
Now the partnership will expand its already active appraisal program at Tweneboa to include Owo as we work to mature both of these fields towards sanction early next year. Additionally, the Owo discovery provides even more validation of the quality of our geologic models and the prospectivity of Anadarko's 8 million acre position in the West African Cretaceous Fan play, where we've identified more than 30 prospects and leads with size and geological characteristics similar to Jubilee. As part of our ongoing program in Africa, we are planning to mobilize the deepwater millennium drill shift from Brazil to West Africa in order to drill our second test offshore, Sierra Leone, and then the rig will assist with the appraisal programs with Tweneboa and Owo. 
During the quarter in Brazil, we successfully flow tested the Wahoo#1 well and based on the results of this test, we believe the well is capable of flowing in a sustained rate of more than 15,000 barrels per day. However, our efforts to flow test the Wahoo#2 well yielded inconclusive results. We elected to move the drill shift five miles to the south of the Wahoo#1 discovery well to drill the Wahoo South exploration well, which is our third test in the BM-C-30 block, where we operate with a 30% working interest. 
Also, in Brazil, we recently spud a post- and pre-salt test at the Itauna prospect on BM-C-29. Anadarko operates this prospect with a 50% working interest. In addition, Devon has also notified us that the first appraisal well, the Itaipu, in BM-C-32 is expected to spud in the third quarter. We hold a 33% working interest in Itaipu. 
In Mozambique, we are currently drilling the Ironclad prospect, which is approximately 70 miles of our Windjammer discovery in the Offshore Area 1 of the Rovuma Basin. Once the activity is concluded, Ironclad rig will move back to the Barquentine prospect for an Oligocene test as well as an appraisal of the Paleocene accumulation identified at the Windjammer discovery. 
We also continue joint activities at the Badik prospect from the Tarakan Basin of Indonesia. The well is being drilled toward a proposed depth of approximately 17,400 feet in order to test a large three-way fault closure in the Miocene. Anadarko operates Badik with a 35% working interest. 
As you can tell, we expect to continue the active exploration and appraisal program during the second half of the year and remain confident in reaching our stated goal of discovering more than 400 million barrels of net resources during the year from exploration activities. 
Turning to our financial results for the quarter, we reported a net loss of $0.08 per diluted share with certain items affecting comparability to decrease net income by $0.57 per share. Absent these items which are typically excluded by the investment community, our net income would have been $0.49 per diluted share as reconciled on Page 7 of last night's earnings release. We have not recorded a contingent liability associated with the Deepwater Horizon event based on applying accounting guidelines to the facts as they are known today. We expanded the disclosures in our second quarter 10-Q release yesterday and encourage you to use this document for a detailed description. 
I know that the Anadarko team feels a profound sense of sorrow over the Deepwater Horizon tragedy. We've all gained a measure of guarded hope this morning that last night's static kill operation is reported to have been successful. And we, along with others in the industry, continued to support the recovery efforts of Unified Area Command. 
During the second quarter, we issued a news release clearly stating our position with regard to the liabilities for the Deepwater Horizon tragedy under our joint operating agreement. There are numerous ongoing inquiries and independent investigations that must be brought to conclusion. However, the information and findings that have been made public to date continue to reinforce our belief that serious errors in judgment occurred that have direct implications on the obligations of parties under the operating agreement. 
As I told you at Senate subcommittee two weeks ago, any actions we have taken or may take under the joint operating agreement to protect our rights, shall in no way affect our commitment to meet our obligations under applicable laws. To its credit, BP has continued to make good at its commitment to pay all legitimate claims and we expect that to continue. It is in the best interest of all stakeholders in this tragic event. We also reassured the subcommittee that our balance sheet remains strong. 
During the quarter, we generated approximately $1.3 billion of discretionary cash flow while spending a little less than $1.4 billion on our capital programs. The company ended the quarter with approximately $3.4 billion of cash on hand. Subsequent to quarter end, Anadarko sold its Wattenberg gathering system and related facilities to Western Gas Partners for approximately $500 million, providing net cash proceeds of approximately $450 million to Anadarko. 
In an abundance of caution yesterday, we also announced that we've taken steps to further enhance our long-term liquidity position by obtaining firm commitments for a new secure $5 billion five-year committed credit facility and for a secured $1.5 billion six-year term loan. Upon closing, this will replace our shorter-term credit facility with a substantially larger and longer-dated facility and will refinance our existing midstream note that is currently scheduled to mature in 2012. 
In closing, the strong results of the second quarter demonstrated that the moratorium does not impact at current production or near-term guidance. We have continued to redirect capital from the Gulf to other areas of the portfolio such as the Eagle Ford Shale and the Bone Spring areas in our onshore portfolio. Primarily as a result of the strong operational performance from these and other liquids-rich assets, we are increasing our full year sales volume guidance and now expect to produce between 232 million and 236 million barrels of oil equivalent. This represents a 5% to 7% increase over 2009 production without increasing the capital spending projections from our March Investor Meetings. 
As in the past, we are providing a risk production profile and correspondingly our third and fourth quarter sales volumes guidance is reflective of historical weather and facility-related downtime. We also remain focused on achieving our longer-term objectives that we outlined for you at the March Investor Conference. I'm very proud of the results are employees delivered in the second quarter and pleased with the way this performance has set the stage for additional growth from our mega projects and continue the E&P success in the future.

We were drilling an exploratory, a truly exploratory play where we're testing some Miocene targets outboard of some existing gas production, and that play didn't work. And so we know that, that area doesn't work on the block. The inboard portion of it where we do have the gas prospects still looks to be prospective. And then up in the Tarakan Basin where we're drilling Badik, we'll be drilling Borago later. And the Borago exploratory test will be on the block that has the Aster and Tulip discoveries on it. And what we're trying to do there is get into more continuous sands. Both of the previous discoveries were in the slope deposits and so we had discontinuous sands. We can get downdip to get the continuous sands, probably Borago, and updip to get the shale full sands in Badik. And so we'll see how that all plays out.

The drilling windows is usually from about December through April, and so you could see potentially, at the earliest, a 2011 December spud. The potential that we see out there -- well, you see, is mixed. The Taranaki Basin is an oil and gas-producing province and has been for many years, have got some very significant discoveries. And when we looked at it, actually, this is a far more mature than some of the areas we've been in, in West African and East Africa where we've had success. So what we try to do is, as explorers, is look at what we think the potential is with the data that's out there and not take any preconceived notions into it, but do take the learnings that we've had around the world. And particularly in the deepwater, when we look at what we see in New Zealand, we see a lot of potential, both in the Canterbury Basin off of the South Island where the well would be drilled, and then in the deepwater of the Taranaki Basin where the new acreage that we just acquired and we're shooting seismic on, we see quite a bit of potential. But we'll continue to do our evaluation, and then when the time is right, drill a well out there. The main prospect that we've seen, and it's under 3D and it's tied into a well that was drilled on the shelf, is 40,000-acre, four-way closure. And the well on the shelf tested 10 million a day and 2,000 barrels of condensate back in the late 70s or early 80s. So it's a real high quality prospect, and we'll get to it when the time is right.

Good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, the company delivered strong reported sales volumes of approximately 58 million barrels of oil equivalent, marking the 15th consecutive quarter in our portfolio met or surpassed the guidance that we provide to the investment community. This third quarter sales number was at the high end of our guidance and included the effects of tanker scheduling in Algeria and both planned and unplanned downtime in certain onshore and offshore facilities. 
There are several other highlights in the quarter to mention. First, positive results from our ongoing shale development activities in the U.S. and onshore enabled us to enhance the net risk captured resources in our Marcellus and Eagleford shale plays. Second, our exploration programs continued to deliver additional world-class discoveries. And third, the portfolio generated considerable cash flow during the quarter, while we saw a success in significantly strengthening our balance sheet.
Now I'll walk through some of the more significant operational accomplishments during the quarter. Our U.S. onshore drilling activities remain focused on liquid-rich opportunities. As a result, liquids comprise about 41% of our total third quarter sales volumes. We also continue to drive down operating costs, with a 17% improvement in lease-operating expenses for BOE year-to-date relative to 2009. 
In the Rockies, sales volumes for the quarter increased by about 10% over the third quarter 2009, primarily from liquids-focused production growth in Wattenberg and Greater Natural Buttes. The Wattenberg and Greater Natural Buttes teams set new production records during the quarter. In the liquids-rich Wattenberg field, we achieved record oil delivery of nearly 3,000 barrels in a 24-hour period. On the Greater Natural Buttes area, the teams set a daily gross production record of more than 412 million cubic feet equivalent per day during the quarter. 
In Laramie County, Wyoming, we spud our first operated horizontal well in the oil-focused portion of the Niobrara play. The completion activity is expected to commence in the next couple of weeks. We've also drilled four vertical test wells in the play. We drilled about 500,000 gross acres, and enjoy very attractive economics due to our ownership of the minerals in perpetuity by virtue of our land grant position. 
We also completed the acquisition of 160 square miles of 3D seismic here, and we expect to increase our activity in the play by adding additional rigs in 2011. In the Southern and Appalachia region, our teams increased third quarter sales volumes by about 9% over the third quarter of 2009, led by the Eagleford and Marcellus Shale plays. For EMP development in these two shale plays, we have better plans to substantial net risk capture resource potential for each asset. 
We'll talk about the Marcellus first, where we've now identified estimated net risk captured resources of more than 6 trillion cubic feet. We're consistently seeing wells of IPs of better than 7 million cubic feet per day across our entire core position, encompassed within 750,000 gross acres in North-Central Pennsylvania. 
During the last week of September, the Marcellus team also achieved an all-time weekly production high of 174 million cubic feet per day gross from 46 producing wells. We're expecting a significant increase in the number of producing wells and overall production as we continue to build infrastructure in the field. 
With recent start of our 200 million cubic feet a day Grugan gathering system and pipeline and other expansions, we are expecting to increase takeaway capacities of just under 600 million cubic feet per day in the third quarter and more than 1.15 Bcf per day by the end of the fourth quarter. 
Shifting to the Maverick Basin in South Texas, our development activities and positive results from the liquids-rich Eagleford shale indicates that this asset holds more than 450 million barrels of oil equivalent of net risk captured resources. Additionally, in the Eagleford, we have everything in place from gathering to takeaway to processing capacity in water management system. This provides efficient running room and addresses the infrastructure needs to enable us to continue growing our production for years to come. 
We're now producing on an ADS basis of more than 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with seven rigs running on our 400,000 acres. They're primarily located in Dimmitt and Webb counties. We plan to increase to nine rigs in the first quarter of 2011. With average EURs of 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent combined with today's commodity price environment, we're currently realizing robust rates of returns of approximately 65%. 
In the Delaware Basin of West Texas, where we began to see two more oil-focused opportunities in the Bone Spring and Avalon Shale, where we hold about 550,000 gross acres. We, along with our partners, are now running seven rigs in the area. In the Bone Spring, we continue to see IPs of more than 1,000 barrels of oil per day, with natural gas that has 10:10 PM a high Btu content and good market access. We're also seeing encouraging results from our first two operated Avalon Shale wells. They're each approaching 700 barrels of oil equivalent per day. By the end of the year, we expect to have completed about eight exploration test wells in the Avalon Shale.
The substantial net risk resources in our shale plays and the performance of these assets bolsters our confidence in the capability of these onshore U.S. fields, generate a significant value and contribute material volumes and reserve growth to our overall portfolio. 
Switching to geography. We're getting closer to achieving first oil from the Jubilee field in Ghana, the first of our three sanctioned mega projects. Once this project and the others in Caesar/Tonga and El Merk are complete, we expect these three mega projects to add about 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net to Anadarko in 2012. 
At the Jubilee project during the third quarter, the partnership was in the final steps of commissioning the FPSO and also finished about 90% of the subsea work. This project remains on schedule and on budget, and we look forward to first production prior to the end of the year. 
We've surpassed the halfway point in the construction of the El Merk in Algeria, which remains on schedule and on budget as well. In the Gulf of Mexico, our project team has proven nimble in keeping the Caesar/Tonga mega project moving forward during the government-mandated deepwater moratorium. 
During the quarter, topside modifications continued in the first riser and flow lines were successfully installed. We expect to advance subsea work, including the installation of jumpers and umbilicals in the fourth quarter and to achieve first production on schedule by the middle of next year. Also, while the moratorium was in place, we continue to advance development planning for both our operated Lucius project and the Shell-operated Vito project in the Gulf of Mexico. We also advanced projects in the Gulf for which we have permits. This includes the Callisto tieback at the Independence Hub where the pipeline permit was approved, and where we expect to achieve first production in the fourth quarter.  
In addition, during the quarter,  we also received a workover permit at the K2 field. Lifting of the moratorium last month was a positive step for the industry in the Gulf Coast region. And though we are ready to safely resume our deepwater exploration and appraisal activity, we, along with other deepwater operators, must have greater clarity around the regulatory process. We're hopeful the government will soon begin to process and issue the permits  that will allow the industry to put people back to work. 
While activity in the Gulf remains limited, we maintained a very active international exploration program throughout the quarter. In West Africa, our partnership announced the third major discovery offshore Ghana at the Owo prospect in the Deepwater Tano block, where we hold an 18% working interest. This discovery is adjacent to the Tweneboa discovery, both of which lie in the west of the Jubilee field. The Owo discovery well and subsequent sidetrack encountered a total of more than 225 net feet of high-quality oil play and stacked Turonian-age reservoir sands. We're excited about the Owo and Tweneboa discoveries and plan to return adjures to see an active exploration, seeking out an active appraisal program once we complete drilling the Mercury well offshore Sierra Leone. Mercury, which spud in early October, is our second deepwater test in the Liberian Basin. 
In Mozambique, we recently announced a world-class natural gas discovery at the Barquentine prospect. The discovery well, located about 2 miles southeast of our previously announced Windjammer discovery, encountered more than 416 net feet of natural gas pay. These two successful wells confirm to the presence of a large accumulation in this frontier basin. We're currently designing an appraisal program that will enable us to determine the areal extent of this new field. And we've begun preliminary evaluation of the potential natural gas commercialization options. 
We've mobilized the drillship approximately 16 miles to the south of the Rovuma Basin. The drill will address the prospect, which would be followed by an exploration well at Tubarão. Based on the success of Mozambique to-date, we anticipate keeping a rig in the basin with an active exploration and appraisal program for the foreseeable future. As operator of the Rovuma base in Offshore Area 1, we hold a 36.5% working interest and approximately 2.6 million acres, with more than 50 identified prospects and leads. 
As we announced in the yesterday's news release, we encountered 133 net feet of oil and natural gas pay at the Badik prospect in offshore Indonesia. The well is located in 230 feet of water and was drilled to a total depth just under 13,000 feet. And it's the first significant discovery on the shelf in the Tarakan Basin. We operate Badik with a 35% working interest and are evaluating appraisal programs and obtaining 3D seismic data on the block. 
In Brazil, drilling is ongoing at the Itauna prospect where we encountered oil with accompanying logs, indicating hydrocarbons and the buildup wasn't one of our primary targets. We are encouraged by what we've seen so far. We're continuing to drill towards both post- and pre-salt objectives and expect to have results in coming weeks. We are operating Itauna with a 50% working interest. With the positive results for our worldwide exploration program, we remain on track to deliver the 400 million barrels of oil equivalent of net discovered resources that we have committed to during our March investor conference. 
Turning to financial results for the quarter. We reported a net loss of $0.05 per diluted share with certain items affecting comparability that increased net income by $0.26 per share. Absent these items, which are typically excluded by the investment community, our net income would have been $0.21 per diluted share as reconciled on Page 7 of last night's earnings release. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.2 billion of cash on hand and also completed a number of actions that have significantly enhanced liquidity. 
First, we entered into a five-year $5 billion undrawn secured revolving credit facility that replaced and upsized our previous $1.3 billion revolving credit agreement. This is due to mature in 2013. Second, we completed the issuance of $2 billion of 6.375% seven-year senior notes and used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to retire $1.3 billion of debt maturing in 2012. 
Subsequent to quarter end, we used a portion of the drawn proceeds to retire an additional $422 million of 2011 debt maturities. As a result of these actions, we have significantly increased our access to capital, while reducing our near-term debt maturity. And we've extended our average debt tenure to more than 14 years. These actions strengthen the company and further protects the interest of all of our stakeholders by providing ample access to capital and liquidity to deliver upon our strategy. 
In an update to our previous comments regarding the Macondo well, we remain confident in our publicly stated position.  And therefore, in applying accounting guidelines to the facts that they are known today, we have not recorded a contingent liability associated with this event. As we did in last quarter, we began including expanded disclosures in our third quarter 10-Q filed yesterday, and we encourage you to review that document for more information. 
Related to Macondo, early in the past quarter, we implemented a one-time supplemental retention program for all nonexecutive employees, for which we recorded a charge of $30 million during the quarter. This program is linked directly to our performance goal for this year and was implemented to keep our teams focused on delivering results during the perceived uncertainty surrounding the Macondo event. We're pleased that this has been effective, as turnover is lower than now than before the event. And we continue to deliver the results we had targeted. Again, this is performance-based and retentive. 
Now to summarize my remarks, the performance of our teams and our portfolio was solid. It enabled us to, again, raise our full year guidance. As detailed in the attachments to last night's earnings release, we are increasing our full year sales volume guidance to a range of 233 to 236 million barrels of oil equivalent. This equates to year-over-year volume growth of 7%. We have also reduced our capital guidance, as we now expect capital expenditures including expense G&G [geology and geophysics] to be in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion for the year.
Beyond these updates to guidance, as I mentioned earlier, we continue to improve our status as one of the lowest cost operators in our peer group, with a 17% year-to-date improvement in LOE per unit. And we are well positioned to achieve our reserve replacement targets at a competitive cost of less than $17 per barrel of oil equivalent. The recent the success of our exploration teams will allow us to meet our commitment to discover more than 400 million barrels of oil equivalent of net resources during 2010 despite the Gulf moratorium. 
Our balance sheet is in good shape. And as we discussed today, we've taken a number of steps to enhance liquidity and reduce near-term debt maturities. These actions plus the continued performance of the portfolio provides for the financial strength and flexibility to continue delivery of our strategic plans and expectations this year and well into the future. 
In the new year, we plan to update you on our full year results and then at a later date, to provide details on our 2011 capital and operating program. At this point, I can tell you that we expect our 2011 volumes to be well within the estimated range we provided in our March 2010 investor conference. And importantly, we expect to keep the capital expenditures in line with cash flow based on the current strip. 
Now we'll happy to take your questions. So Veronica, if I could turn it back over to you."

I'll give you some assessment on the activities and maybe my view on what we're going to do there. But in Brazil, we did move the rig after Wahoo South over to West Africa to drill the Mercury prospect and then to move on down to Ghana to take care of some activities there. And we have appraisal on exploration work. As I mentioned, the Itaipu appraisal will be done early 2011. That will be a Devon-operated rig that they have bringing in, to bring in. And we'll learn a lot from that. Of course, we've tested Wahoo#1. That was very successful. Wahoo#2 was not as successful. We had a lot of mechanical issues. And really right now, we're trying to incorporate all the information that we've got from the Wahoo#1 and #2 wells. We're waiting on the Itaipu appraisal so that we can get a sense for how big that is and meanwhile, working conceptual development planning. Itauna is kind of an independent entity. It's up on the shelf. And while it does have a pre-salt and post-salt objectives, it does not roll into the thinking there on the Wahoo Itaipu complex. So right now, it's acquire the data, incorporate it all into our planning, see what it means to us. And then the way we typically do it is how it stacks up in our portfolio and what it means to Anadarko going forward versus what the market for it may be. And we constantly do that, and we feel like having the information and a good assessment of what that information tells us that allows us to make the best decision. The Indonesia well, while you mentioned it was an obligation well, this was a well we've been wanting to drill for a long time. So it was not something that we are forced into. We do have two blocks there. The shallow water block, which is the Nunukan block where the discovery was made. And then we have the deepwater block immediately adjacent to it to the east, the Bokep block. We operate the shallow water and Eni operates the deepwater one. We've got the discovery. We'll be shooting 3D on that block because we see a lot more like it, a lot more features like it on the block. So we like to again understand what this means to the overall assessment of the block. And meanwhile, we'll be drilling, or ENI as the operator, will be drilling the Borago prospect, which will be outward on the Bokep block, and that should happen at the end of the year or very early 2011.

I'm not sure we actually look at it quite the way you've asked the question. So I'll probably stumble through the answer a little bit. When you consider the fact that we've got three mega projects that are all oil and they are by themselves about $1 billion of CapEx.

So as you can see as we move from where we were a year ago, well, most of 40% on our liquids plants to being above 40%, we see that trend in the overall mix continue to go up over the next few years, primarily because of these mega projects coming online and coupled with the redirection that we've had over the last couple of years has brought the industry towards gas with liquids components.

I think the field's probably got enough history and if the plays got enough. It's not a uniform shale development as we all know at this point. It's a pretty complicated play. Ours has extremely attractive EURs relative to our drilling and completion costs. As a result, we have from our perspective a very attractive, from an investment perspective, case for why somebody would want to come in. So I would say, today, if someone were to meet our terms, we'd probably by anyone's estimation would have enough data to be able to support that.

When we started with it, we thought the resource opportunity was around a Tcf, so you would expect by now it we'd be on the decline as we stated. We thought early on it would see a production plateau in the order of 18 months. We extended that quite a bit based upon the work that we've done. What you're seeing now is many of the smaller fields that make up Independence Hub have begun a very steep decline or watered out. In the bigger fields and those fields that typically Anadarko has as a larger working interest in, have been the ones that have maintained their production through time.

So you have very good rates of return with better cycle time. One of the things that we always have to manage because Bob Daniels has so much exploration success that he's had now for several years, is that we have to be mindful of how that longer-cycle stuff can be brought forward is through monetizations, which we've done a lot of since 2006, about $18 billion worth after-tax. We're not really looking at clearly to sell because that's not particularly tax efficient. So as you think about how we're looking onshore, we always like to improve cycle times even when they're short. So again, that promoted aspect of being able to do something that's tax efficient is very important to us.

Good morning, everyone.

Good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, the company delivered strong reported sales volumes of approximately 58 million barrels of oil equivalent, marking the 15th consecutive quarter in our portfolio met or surpassed the guidance that we provide to the investment community. This third quarter sales number was at the high end of our guidance and included the effects of tanker scheduling in Algeria and both planned and unplanned downtime in certain onshore and offshore facilities. 
There are several other highlights in the quarter to mention. First, positive results from our ongoing shale development activities in the U.S. and onshore enabled us to enhance the net risk captured resources in our Marcellus and Eagleford shale plays. Second, our exploration programs continued to deliver additional world-class discoveries. And third, the portfolio generated considerable cash flow during the quarter, while we saw a success in significantly strengthening our balance sheet.
Now I'll walk through some of the more significant operational accomplishments during the quarter. Our U.S. onshore drilling activities remain focused on liquid-rich opportunities. As a result, liquids comprise about 41% of our total third quarter sales volumes. We also continue to drive down operating costs, with a 17% improvement in lease-operating expenses for BOE year-to-date relative to 2009. 
In the Rockies, sales volumes for the quarter increased by about 10% over the third quarter 2009, primarily from liquids-focused production growth in Wattenberg and Greater Natural Buttes. The Wattenberg and Greater Natural Buttes teams set new production records during the quarter. In the liquids-rich Wattenberg field, we achieved record oil delivery of nearly 3,000 barrels in a 24-hour period. On the Greater Natural Buttes area, the teams set a daily gross production record of more than 412 million cubic feet equivalent per day during the quarter. 
In Laramie County, Wyoming, we spud our first operated horizontal well in the oil-focused portion of the Niobrara play. The completion activity is expected to commence in the next couple of weeks. We've also drilled four vertical test wells in the play. We drilled about 500,000 gross acres, and enjoy very attractive economics due to our ownership of the minerals in perpetuity by virtue of our land grant position. 
We also completed the acquisition of 160 square miles of 3D seismic here, and we expect to increase our activity in the play by adding additional rigs in 2011. In the Southern and Appalachia region, our teams increased third quarter sales volumes by about 9% over the third quarter of 2009, led by the Eagleford and Marcellus Shale plays. For EMP development in these two shale plays, we have better plans to substantial net risk capture resource potential for each asset. 
We'll talk about the Marcellus first, where we've now identified estimated net risk captured resources of more than 6 trillion cubic feet. We're consistently seeing wells of IPs of better than 7 million cubic feet per day across our entire core position, encompassed within 750,000 gross acres in North-Central Pennsylvania. 
During the last week of September, the Marcellus team also achieved an all-time weekly production high of 174 million cubic feet per day gross from 46 producing wells. We're expecting a significant increase in the number of producing wells and overall production as we continue to build infrastructure in the field. 
With recent start of our 200 million cubic feet a day Grugan gathering system and pipeline and other expansions, we are expecting to increase takeaway capacities of just under 600 million cubic feet per day in the third quarter and more than 1.15 Bcf per day by the end of the fourth quarter. 
Shifting to the Maverick Basin in South Texas, our development activities and positive results from the liquids-rich Eagleford shale indicates that this asset holds more than 450 million barrels of oil equivalent of net risk captured resources. Additionally, in the Eagleford, we have everything in place from gathering to takeaway to processing capacity in water management system. This provides efficient running room and addresses the infrastructure needs to enable us to continue growing our production for years to come. 
We're now producing on an ADS basis of more than 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with seven rigs running on our 400,000 acres. They're primarily located in Dimmitt and Webb counties. We plan to increase to nine rigs in the first quarter of 2011. With average EURs of 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent combined with today's commodity price environment, we're currently realizing robust rates of returns of approximately 65%. 
In the Delaware Basin of West Texas, where we began to see two more oil-focused opportunities in the Bone Spring and Avalon Shale, where we hold about 550,000 gross acres. We, along with our partners, are now running seven rigs in the area. In the Bone Spring, we continue to see IPs of more than 1,000 barrels of oil per day, with natural gas that has 10:10 PM a high Btu content and good market access. We're also seeing encouraging results from our first two operated Avalon Shale wells. They're each approaching 700 barrels of oil equivalent per day. By the end of the year, we expect to have completed about eight exploration test wells in the Avalon Shale.
The substantial net risk resources in our shale plays and the performance of these assets bolsters our confidence in the capability of these onshore U.S. fields, generate a significant value and contribute material volumes and reserve growth to our overall portfolio. 
Switching to geography. We're getting closer to achieving first oil from the Jubilee field in Ghana, the first of our three sanctioned mega projects. Once this project and the others in Caesar/Tonga and El Merk are complete, we expect these three mega projects to add about 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net to Anadarko in 2012. 
At the Jubilee project during the third quarter, the partnership was in the final steps of commissioning the FPSO and also finished about 90% of the subsea work. This project remains on schedule and on budget, and we look forward to first production prior to the end of the year. 
We've surpassed the halfway point in the construction of the El Merk in Algeria, which remains on schedule and on budget as well. In the Gulf of Mexico, our project team has proven nimble in keeping the Caesar/Tonga mega project moving forward during the government-mandated deepwater moratorium. 
During the quarter, topside modifications continued in the first riser and flow lines were successfully installed. We expect to advance subsea work, including the installation of jumpers and umbilicals in the fourth quarter and to achieve first production on schedule by the middle of next year. Also, while the moratorium was in place, we continue to advance development planning for both our operated Lucius project and the Shell-operated Vito project in the Gulf of Mexico. We also advanced projects in the Gulf for which we have permits. This includes the Callisto tieback at the Independence Hub where the pipeline permit was approved, and where we expect to achieve first production in the fourth quarter.  
In addition, during the quarter,  we also received a workover permit at the K2 field. Lifting of the moratorium last month was a positive step for the industry in the Gulf Coast region. And though we are ready to safely resume our deepwater exploration and appraisal activity, we, along with other deepwater operators, must have greater clarity around the regulatory process. We're hopeful the government will soon begin to process and issue the permits  that will allow the industry to put people back to work. 
While activity in the Gulf remains limited, we maintained a very active international exploration program throughout the quarter. In West Africa, our partnership announced the third major discovery offshore Ghana at the Owo prospect in the Deepwater Tano block, where we hold an 18% working interest. This discovery is adjacent to the Tweneboa discovery, both of which lie in the west of the Jubilee field. The Owo discovery well and subsequent sidetrack encountered a total of more than 225 net feet of high-quality oil play and stacked Turonian-age reservoir sands. We're excited about the Owo and Tweneboa discoveries and plan to return adjures to see an active exploration, seeking out an active appraisal program once we complete drilling the Mercury well offshore Sierra Leone. Mercury, which spud in early October, is our second deepwater test in the Liberian Basin. 
In Mozambique, we recently announced a world-class natural gas discovery at the Barquentine prospect. The discovery well, located about 2 miles southeast of our previously announced Windjammer discovery, encountered more than 416 net feet of natural gas pay. These two successful wells confirm to the presence of a large accumulation in this frontier basin. We're currently designing an appraisal program that will enable us to determine the areal extent of this new field. And we've begun preliminary evaluation of the potential natural gas commercialization options. 
We've mobilized the drillship approximately 16 miles to the south of the Rovuma Basin. The drill will address the prospect, which would be followed by an exploration well at Tubarão. Based on the success of Mozambique to-date, we anticipate keeping a rig in the basin with an active exploration and appraisal program for the foreseeable future. As operator of the Rovuma base in Offshore Area 1, we hold a 36.5% working interest and approximately 2.6 million acres, with more than 50 identified prospects and leads. 
As we announced in the yesterday's news release, we encountered 133 net feet of oil and natural gas pay at the Badik prospect in offshore Indonesia. The well is located in 230 feet of water and was drilled to a total depth just under 13,000 feet. And it's the first significant discovery on the shelf in the Tarakan Basin. We operate Badik with a 35% working interest and are evaluating appraisal programs and obtaining 3D seismic data on the block. 
In Brazil, drilling is ongoing at the Itauna prospect where we encountered oil with accompanying logs, indicating hydrocarbons and the buildup wasn't one of our primary targets. We are encouraged by what we've seen so far. We're continuing to drill towards both post- and pre-salt objectives and expect to have results in coming weeks. We are operating Itauna with a 50% working interest. With the positive results for our worldwide exploration program, we remain on track to deliver the 400 million barrels of oil equivalent of net discovered resources that we have committed to during our March investor conference. 
Turning to financial results for the quarter. We reported a net loss of $0.05 per diluted share with certain items affecting comparability that increased net income by $0.26 per share. Absent these items, which are typically excluded by the investment community, our net income would have been $0.21 per diluted share as reconciled on Page 7 of last night's earnings release. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.2 billion of cash on hand and also completed a number of actions that have significantly enhanced liquidity. 
First, we entered into a five-year $5 billion undrawn secured revolving credit facility that replaced and upsized our previous $1.3 billion revolving credit agreement. This is due to mature in 2013. Second, we completed the issuance of $2 billion of 6.375% seven-year senior notes and used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to retire $1.3 billion of debt maturing in 2012. 
Subsequent to quarter end, we used a portion of the drawn proceeds to retire an additional $422 million of 2011 debt maturities. As a result of these actions, we have significantly increased our access to capital, while reducing our near-term debt maturity. And we've extended our average debt tenure to more than 14 years. These actions strengthen the company and further protects the interest of all of our stakeholders by providing ample access to capital and liquidity to deliver upon our strategy. 
In an update to our previous comments regarding the Macondo well, we remain confident in our publicly stated position.  And therefore, in applying accounting guidelines to the facts that they are known today, we have not recorded a contingent liability associated with this event. As we did in last quarter, we began including expanded disclosures in our third quarter 10-Q filed yesterday, and we encourage you to review that document for more information. 
Related to Macondo, early in the past quarter, we implemented a one-time supplemental retention program for all nonexecutive employees, for which we recorded a charge of $30 million during the quarter. This program is linked directly to our performance goal for this year and was implemented to keep our teams focused on delivering results during the perceived uncertainty surrounding the Macondo event. We're pleased that this has been effective, as turnover is lower than now than before the event. And we continue to deliver the results we had targeted. Again, this is performance-based and retentive. 
Now to summarize my remarks, the performance of our teams and our portfolio was solid. It enabled us to, again, raise our full year guidance. As detailed in the attachments to last night's earnings release, we are increasing our full year sales volume guidance to a range of 233 to 236 million barrels of oil equivalent. This equates to year-over-year volume growth of 7%. We have also reduced our capital guidance, as we now expect capital expenditures including expense G&G [geology and geophysics] to be in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion for the year.
Beyond these updates to guidance, as I mentioned earlier, we continue to improve our status as one of the lowest cost operators in our peer group, with a 17% year-to-date improvement in LOE per unit. And we are well positioned to achieve our reserve replacement targets at a competitive cost of less than $17 per barrel of oil equivalent. The recent the success of our exploration teams will allow us to meet our commitment to discover more than 400 million barrels of oil equivalent of net resources during 2010 despite the Gulf moratorium. 
Our balance sheet is in good shape. And as we discussed today, we've taken a number of steps to enhance liquidity and reduce near-term debt maturities. These actions plus the continued performance of the portfolio provides for the financial strength and flexibility to continue delivery of our strategic plans and expectations this year and well into the future. 
In the new year, we plan to update you on our full year results and then at a later date, to provide details on our 2011 capital and operating program. At this point, I can tell you that we expect our 2011 volumes to be well within the estimated range we provided in our March 2010 investor conference. And importantly, we expect to keep the capital expenditures in line with cash flow based on the current strip. 
Now we'll happy to take your questions. So Veronica, if I could turn it back over to you.

I'll give you some assessment on the activities and maybe my view on what we're going to do there. But in Brazil, we did move the rig after Wahoo South over to West Africa to drill the Mercury prospect and then to move on down to Ghana to take care of some activities there. And we have appraisal on exploration work. As I mentioned, the Itaipu appraisal will be done early 2011. That will be a Devon-operated rig that they have bringing in, to bring in. And we'll learn a lot from that. Of course, we've tested Wahoo#1. That was very successful. Wahoo#2 was not as successful. We had a lot of mechanical issues. And really right now, we're trying to incorporate all the information that we've got from the Wahoo#1 and #2 wells. We're waiting on the Itaipu appraisal so that we can get a sense for how big that is and meanwhile, working conceptual development planning. Itauna is kind of an independent entity. It's up on the shelf. And while it does have a pre-salt and post-salt objectives, it does not roll into the thinking there on the Wahoo Itaipu complex. So right now, it's acquire the data, incorporate it all into our planning, see what it means to us. And then the way we typically do it is how it stacks up in our portfolio and what it means to Anadarko going forward versus what the market for it may be. And we constantly do that, and we feel like having the information and a good assessment of what that information tells us that allows us to make the best decision. The Indonesia well, while you mentioned it was an obligation well, this was a well we've been wanting to drill for a long time. So it was not something that we are forced into. We do have two blocks there. The shallow water block, which is the Nunukan block where the discovery was made. And then we have the deepwater block immediately adjacent to it to the east, the Bokep block. We operate the shallow water and Eni operates the deepwater one. We've got the discovery. We'll be shooting 3D on that block because we see a lot more like it, a lot more features like it on the block. So we like to again understand what this means to the overall assessment of the block. And meanwhile, we'll be drilling, or ENI as the operator, will be drilling the Borago prospect, which will be outward on the Bokep block, and that should happen at the end of the year or very early 2011. So a lot of information to be gathered, then we'll put it into our portfolio and decide how it fits with us or perhaps somebody else.

I'm not sure we actually look at it quite the way you've asked the question. So I'll probably stumble through the answer a little bit. When you consider the fact that we've got three mega projects that are all oil and they are by themselves about $1 billion of CapEx. And you look at the fact that we historically talk about our onshore or development program being around $2 billion to replace production, I think if you look at just those two in isolation and you exclude exploration from the equation, which is a longer-cycle investment opportunity for us, and we're well above 50% with our capital spend related to oil and liquids-related projects. So as you can see as we move from where we were a year ago, well, most of 40% on our liquids plants to being above 40%, we see that trend in the overall mix continue to go up over the next few years, primarily because of these mega projects coming online and coupled with the redirection that we've had over the last couple of years has brought the industry towards gas with liquids components. I hope that's helpful. I can't give you a whole lot more specificity than that. I just not quite looked at it the way you asked the question.

And probably for that reason and also while it gives us very good rates of return, our ability to take what we we'll say is well-above average rates to return within our portfolio and turn then into exceptional rates of return is the motivator. Because of the portfolio, we had the ability to look for production growth, reserve replacement without being dependent about any particular play and being able to capital efficient. And so as a result, if we can get the terms, as Bob made reference to, if we get terms that are acceptable to us, we can take and significantly improve what we believe is the rate of return for the capital deployed into that play. And that's the motivator. It's just almost as singular as that.

We're not really looking to take capital off the table to your point about the balance sheet.

When we started with it, we thought the resource opportunity was around a Tcf, so you would expect by now it we'd be on the decline as we stated. We thought early on it would see a production plateau in the order of 18 months. We extended that quite a bit based upon the work that we've done. What you're seeing now is many of the smaller fields that make up Independence Hub have begun a very steep decline or watered out. In the bigger fields and those fields that typically Anadarko has as a larger working interest in, have been the ones that have maintained their production through time. And so that's gives you that dynamic of gross volumes falling, net  volumes essentially falling some, but not near to the degree that the others have.

One of the things that we always have to manage because Bob Daniels has so much exploration success that he's had now for several years, is that we have to be mindful of how that longer-cycle stuff can be brought forward is through monetizations, which we've done a lot of since 2006, about $18 billion worth after-tax. We're not really looking at clearly to sell because that's not particularly tax efficient. So as you think about how we're looking onshore, we always like to improve cycle times even when they're short. So again, that promoted aspect of being able to do something that's tax efficient is very important to us.

Good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, the company delivered strong reported sales volumes of approximately 58 million barrels of oil equivalent, marking the 15th consecutive quarter that our portfolio met or surpassed the guidance that we provide to the investment community. This third quarter sales number was at the high end of our guidance and included the effects of tanker scheduling in Algeria and both planned and unplanned downtime in certain onshore and offshore facilities. 
There are several other highlights from the quarter to mention. First, positive results from our ongoing shale development activities in the U.S. and onshore enabled us to enhance the net risk captured resources in our Marcellus and Eagleford shale plays. Second, our exploration programs continued to deliver additional world-class discoveries. And third, the portfolio generated considerable cash flow during the quarter, while we saw a success in significantly strengthening our balance sheet.
Now I'll walk through some of the more significant operational accomplishments during the quarter. Our U.S. onshore drilling activities remain focused on liquid-rich opportunities. As a result, liquids comprise about 41% of our total third quarter sales volumes. We also continue to drive down operating costs, with a 17% improvement in lease-operating expenses for BOE year-to-date relative to 2009. 
In the Rockies, sales volumes for the quarter increased by about 10% over the third quarter 2009, primarily from liquids-focused production growth in Wattenberg and Greater Natural Buttes. The Wattenberg and Greater Natural Buttes teams set new production records during the quarter. In the liquids-rich Wattenberg field, we achieved record oil delivery of nearly 30,000 barrels in a 24-hour period. On the Greater Natural Buttes area, the teams set a daily gross production record of more than 412 million cubic feet equivalent per day during the quarter. 
In Laramie County, Wyoming, we spud our first operated horizontal well in the oil-focused portion of the Niobrara play. The completion activity is expected to commence in the next couple of weeks. We've also drilled four vertical test wells in the play. We hold about 500,000 gross acres, and enjoy very attractive economics due to our ownership of the minerals in perpetuity by virtue of our land grant position. 
We also completed the acquisition of 160 square miles of 3D seismic here, and we expect to increase our activity in the play by adding additional rigs in 2011. In the Southern and Appalachia region, our teams increased third quarter sales volumes by about 9% over the third quarter of 2009, led by the Eagleford and Marcellus Shale plays. For EMP development in these two shale plays, we have better plans to substantial net risk capture resource potential for each asset. 
We'll talk about the Marcellus first, where we've now identified estimated net risk captured resources of more than 6 trillion cubic feet. We're consistently seeing wells of IPs of better than 7 million cubic feet per day across our entire core position, encompassed within 750,000 gross acres in North-Central Pennsylvania. 
During the last week of September, the Marcellus team also achieved an all-time weekly production high of 174 million cubic feet per day gross from 46 producing wells. We're expecting a significant increase in the number of producing wells and overall production as we continue to build infrastructure in the field. 
With the recent start of our 200 million cubic feet a day Grugan gathering system and pipeline and other expansions, we are expecting to increase takeaway capacities of just under 600 million cubic feet per day in the third quarter and more than 1.15 Bcf per day by the end of the fourth quarter. 
Shifting to the Maverick Basin in South Texas, our development activities and positive results from the liquids-rich Eagleford shale indicates that this asset holds more than 450 million barrels of oil equivalent of net risk captured resources. Additionally, in the Eagleford, we have everything in place from gathering to takeaway to processing capacity in water management system. This provides sufficient running room and addresses the infrastructure needs to enable us to continue growing our production for years to come. 
We're now producing on an ADS basis of more than 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with seven rigs running on our 400,000 acres. They're primarily located in Dimmitt and Webb counties. We plan to increase to nine rigs in the first quarter of 2011. With average EURs of 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent combined with today's commodity price environment, we're currently realizing robust rates of returns of approximately 65%. 
In the Delaware Basin of West Texas, where we began to see two more oil-focused opportunities in the Bone Spring and Avalon Shale, where we hold about 550,000 gross acres. We, along with our partners, are now running seven rigs in the area. In the Bone Spring, we continue to see IPs of more than 1,000 barrels of oil per day, with natural gas that has 10:10 PM a high Btu content and good market access. We're also seeing encouraging results from our first two operated Avalon Shale wells. They're each approaching 700 barrels of oil equivalent per day. By the end of the year, we expect to have completed about eight exploration test wells in the Avalon Shale.
The substantial net risk resources in our shale plays and the performance of these assets bolsters our confidence in the capability of these onshore U.S. fields, generate a significant value and contribute material volumes and reserve growth to our overall portfolio. 
Switching to geography. We're getting closer to achieving first oil from the Jubilee field in Ghana, the first of our three sanctioned mega projects. Once this project and the others in Caesar/Tonga and El Merk are complete, we expect these three mega projects to add about 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net to Anadarko in 2012. 
At the Jubilee project during the third quarter, the partnership was in the final steps of commissioning the FPSO and also finished about 90% of the subsea work. This project remains on schedule and on budget, and we look forward to first production prior to the end of the year. 
We've surpassed the halfway point in the construction of the El Merk in Algeria, which remains on schedule and on budget as well. In the Gulf of Mexico, our project team has proven nimble in keeping the Caesar/Tonga mega project moving forward during the government-mandated deepwater moratorium. 
During the quarter, topside modifications continued in the first riser and flow lines were successfully installed. We expect to advance subsea work, including the installation of jumpers and umbilicals in the fourth quarter and to achieve first production on schedule by the middle of next year. Also, while the moratorium was in place, we continue to advance development planning for both our operated Lucius project and the Shell-operated Vito project in the Gulf of Mexico. We also advanced projects in the Gulf for which we have permits. This includes the Callisto tieback at the Independence Hub where the pipeline permit was approved, and where we expect to achieve first production in the fourth quarter.  
In addition, during the quarter, we also received a workover permit at the K2 field. Lifting of the moratorium last month was a positive step for the industry in the Gulf Coast region. And though we are ready to safely resume our deepwater exploration and appraisal activity, we, along with other deepwater operators, must have greater clarity around the regulatory process. We're hopeful the government will soon begin to process and issue the permits that will allow the industry to put people back to work. 
While activity in the Gulf remains limited, we maintained a very active international exploration program throughout the quarter. In West Africa, our partnership announced the third major discovery offshore Ghana at the Owo prospect in the Deepwater Tano block, where we hold an 18% working interest. This discovery is adjacent to the Tweneboa discovery, both of which lie in the west of the Jubilee field. The Owo discovery well and subsequent sidetrack encountered a total of more than 225 net feet of high-quality oil play and stacked Turonian-age reservoir sands. We're excited about the Owo and Tweneboa discoveries and plan to return to the area to continue an active appraisal program once we complete drilling the Mercury well offshore Sierra Leone. Mercury, which spud in early October, is our second deepwater test in the Liberian Basin. 
In Mozambique, we recently announced a world-class natural gas discovery at the Barquentine prospect. The discovery well, located about 2 miles southeast of our previously announced Windjammer discovery, encountered more than 416 net feet of natural gas pay. These two successful wells have proven the presence of a large accumulation in this frontier basin. We're currently designing an appraisal program that will enable us to determine the areal extent of this new field. And we've begun preliminary evaluations of the potential natural gas commercialization options. 
We've mobilized the drillship approximately 16 miles to the south of the Rovuma Basin. The drill will address the prospect, which would be followed by an exploration well at Tubarão. Based on the success of Mozambique to-date, we anticipate keeping a rig in the basin with an active exploration and appraisal program for the foreseeable future. As operator of the Rovuma basin Offshore Area 1, we hold a 36.5% working interest and approximately 2.6 million acres, with more than 50 identified prospects and leads. 
As we announced in the yesterday's news release, we encountered 133 net feet of oil and natural gas pay at the Badik prospect offshore Indonesia. The well is located in 230 feet of water and was drilled to a total depth just under 13,000 feet. And it's the first significant discovery on the shelf in the Tarakan Basin. We operate Badik with a 35% working interest and are evaluating an appraisal program and obtaining 3D seismic data on the block. 
In Brazil, drilling is ongoing at the Itauna prospect where we encountered oil with accompanying logs, indicating hydrocarbons in a zone that wasn't one of our primary targets. We are encouraged by what we've seen so far. We're continuing to drill towards both post- and pre-salt objectives and expect to have results in coming weeks. We are operating Itauna with a 50% working interest. With the positive results for our worldwide exploration program, we remain on track to deliver the 400 million barrels of oil equivalent of net discovered resources that we have committed to during our March investor conference. 
Turning to financial results for the quarter. We reported a net loss of $0.05 per diluted share with certain items affecting comparability that decreased net income by $0.26 per share. Absent these items, which are typically excluded by the investment community, our net income would have been $0.21 per diluted share as reconciled on Page 7 of last night's earnings release. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.2 billion of cash on hand and also completed a number of actions that have significantly enhanced liquidity. 
First, we entered into a five-year $5 billion undrawn secured revolving credit facility that replaced and upsized our previous $1.3 billion revolving credit agreement. This was due to mature in 2013. Second, we completed the issuance of $2 billion of 6.375% seven-year senior notes and used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to retire $1.3 billion of debt maturing in 2012. 
Subsequent to quarter end, we used a portion of the drawn proceeds to retire an additional $422 million of 2011 debt maturities. As a result of these actions, we have significantly increased our access to capital, while reducing our near-term debt maturities. And we've extended our average debt tenure to more than 14 years. These actions strengthen the company and further protects the interest of all of our stakeholders by providing ample access to capital and liquidity to deliver upon our strategy. 
In an update to our previous comments regarding the Macondo well, we remain confident in our publicly stated position.  And therefore, in applying accounting guidelines to the facts as they are known today, we have not recorded a contingent liability associated with this event. As we did in the last quarter, we began including expanded disclosures in our third quarter 10-Q filed yesterday, and we encourage you to review that document for more information. 
Related to Macondo, early in the past quarter, we implemented a one-time supplemental retention program for all nonexecutive employees, for which we recorded a charge of $30 million during the quarter. This program is linked directly to our performance goal for this year and was implemented to keep our teams focused on delivering results during the perceived uncertainty surrounding the Macondo event. We're pleased that this has been effective, as turnover is lower now than before the event. And we continue to deliver the results we had targeted. Again, this is performance-based and retentive. 
Now to summarize my remarks, the performance of our teams and our portfolio was solid. It enabled us to, again, raise our full year guidance. As detailed in the attachments to last night's earnings release, we are increasing our full year sales volume guidance to a range of 233 to 236 million barrels of oil equivalent. This equates to year-over-year volume growth of 7%. We have also reduced our capital guidance, as we now expect capital expenditures including expense G&G [geology and geophysics] to be in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion for the year.
Beyond these updates to guidance, as I mentioned earlier, we continue to improve our status as one of the lowest cost operators in our peer group, with a 17% year-to-date improvement in LOE per unit. And we are well positioned to achieve our reserve replacement targets at a competitive cost of less than $17 per barrel of oil equivalent. We believe the success of our exploration teams will allow us to meet our commitment to discover more than 400 million barrels of oil equivalent of net resources during 2010 despite the Gulf moratorium. 
Our balance sheet is in good shape. And as we discussed today, we've taken a number of steps to enhance liquidity and reduce near-term debt maturities. These actions plus the continued performance of the portfolio provides for the financial strength and flexibility to continue delivery on our strategic plans and expectations this year and well into the future. 
In the new year, we plan to update you all on our full year results and then at a later date, to provide details on our 2011 capital and operating program. At this point, I can tell you that we expect our 2011 volumes to be well within the estimated range we provided in our March 2010 investor conference. And importantly, we expect to keep the capital expenditures in line with cash flow based on the current strip. 
Now we'll happy to take your questions. So Veronica, if I could turn it back over to you."

But in Brazil, we did move the rig after Wahoo South over to West Africa to drill the Mercury prospect and then to move on down to Ghana to take care of some activities there in the way of appraisal and exploration work. As I mentioned, the Itaipu appraisal will be done early 2011. That will be a Devon-operated rig that they have bringing in, to bring in. And we'll learn a lot from that. Of course, we've tested Wahoo#1. That was very successful. Wahoo#2 was not as successful. We had a lot of mechanical issues. And really right now, we're trying to incorporate all the information that we've got from the Wahoo#1 and #2 wells. We're waiting on the Itaipu appraisal so that we can get a sense for how big that is and meanwhile, working conceptual development planning. Itauna is kind of an independent entity. It's up on the shelf. And while it does have pre-salt and post-salt objectives, it does not roll into the thinking there on the Wahoo Itaipu complex. So right now, it's acquire the data, incorporate it all into our planning, see what it means to us. And then the way we typically do it is how it stacks up in our portfolio and what it means to Anadarko going forward versus what the market for it may be. And we constantly do that, and we feel like having the information and a good assessment of what that information tells us that allows us to make the best decision. The Indonesia well, while you mentioned it was an obligation well, this was a well we've been wanting to drill for a long time. So it was not something that we were forced into. We do have two blocks there. The shallow water block, which is the Nunukan block where the discovery was made. And then we have the deepwater block immediately adjacent to it to the east, the Boot Camp block. We operate the shallow water and Eni operates the deepwater one. We've got the discovery. We'll be shooting 3D on that block because we see a lot more like it, a lot more features like it on the block. So we like to again understand what this means to the overall assessment of the block. And meanwhile, we'll be drilling, or ENI as the operator, will be drilling the Borago prospect, which will be outward on the Boot Camp block, and that should happen at the end of the year or very early 2011. So a lot of information to be gathered, then we'll put it into our portfolio and decide how it fits with us or perhaps somebody else."

So as you can see as we move from where we were a year ago, well, below 40% on our liquids blend to being above 40%, we see that trend in the overall mix continue to go up over the next few years, primarily because of these mega projects coming online and coupled with the redirection that we've had over the last couple of years has brought the industry towards gas with a liquids component.

One of the things that we always have to manage because Bob Daniels has so much exploration success that he's had now for several years, is that we have to be mindful of how that longer-cycle stuff can be brought forward either through monetizations, which we've done a lot of since 2006, about $18 billion worth after-tax. We're not really looking necessarily to sell because that's not particularly tax efficient.

So we're getting good information. We can assimilate that maybe, at least as good as anybody else because of our position.

251349,114168489,86578,"Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Anadarko Petroleum Corporation","Executives"," Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone.

Good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, the company delivered strong reported sales volumes of approximately 58 million barrels of oil equivalent, marking the 15th consecutive quarter in our portfolio met or surpassed the guidance that we provide to the investment community. This third quarter sales number was at the high end of our guidance and included the effects of tanker scheduling in Algeria and both planned and unplanned downtime in certain onshore and offshore facilities.
 There are several other highlights in the quarter to mention. First, positive results from our ongoing shale development activities in the U.S. and onshore enabled us to enhance the net risk captured resources in our Marcellus and Eagleford shale plays. Second, our exploration programs continued to deliver additional world-class discoveries. And third, the portfolio generated considerable cash flow during the quarter, while we saw a success in significantly strengthening our balance sheet.
 Now I'll walk through some of the more significant operational accomplishments during the quarter. Our U.S. onshore drilling activities remain focused on liquid-rich opportunities. As a result, liquids comprise about 41% of our total third quarter sales volumes. We also continue to drive down operating costs, with a 17% improvement in lease-operating expenses for BOE year-to-date relative to 2009.
 In the Rockies, sales volumes for the quarter increased by about 10% over the third quarter 2009, primarily from liquids-focused production growth in Wattenberg and Greater Natural Buttes. The Wattenberg and Greater Natural Buttes teams set new production records during the quarter. In the liquids-rich Wattenberg field, we achieved record oil delivery of nearly 3,000 barrels in a 24-hour period. On the Greater Natural Buttes area, the teams set a daily gross production record of more than 412 million cubic feet equivalent per day during the quarter.
 In Laramie County, Wyoming, we spud our first operated horizontal well in the oil-focused portion of the Niobrara play. The completion activity is expected to commence in the next couple of weeks. We've also drilled four vertical test wells in the play. We drilled about 500,000 gross acres, and enjoy very attractive economics due to our ownership of the minerals in perpetuity by virtue of our land grant position.
 We also completed the acquisition of 160 square miles of 3D seismic here, and we expect to increase our activity in the play by adding additional rigs in 2011. In the Southern and Appalachia region, our teams increased third quarter sales volumes by about 9% over the third quarter of 2009, led by the Eagleford and Marcellus Shale plays. For EMP development in these two shale plays, we have better plans to substantial net risk capture resource potential for each asset.
 We'll talk about the Marcellus first, where we've now identified estimated net risk captured resources of more than 6 trillion cubic feet. We're consistently seeing wells of IPs of better than 7 million cubic feet per day across our entire core position, encompassed within 750,000 gross acres in North-Central Pennsylvania.
 During the last week of September, the Marcellus team also achieved an all-time weekly production high of 174 million cubic feet per day gross from 46 producing wells. We're expecting a significant increase in the number of producing wells and overall production as we continue to build infrastructure in the field.
 With recent start of our 200 million cubic feet a day Grugan gathering system and pipeline and other expansions, we are expecting to increase takeaway capacities of just under 600 million cubic feet per day in the third quarter and more than 1.15 Bcf per day by the end of the fourth quarter.
 Shifting to the Maverick Basin in South Texas, our development activities and positive results from the liquids-rich Eagleford shale indicates that this asset holds more than 450 million barrels of oil equivalent of net risk captured resources. Additionally, in the Eagleford, we have everything in place from gathering to takeaway to processing capacity in water management system. This provides efficient running room and addresses the infrastructure needs to enable us to continue growing our production for years to come.
 We're now producing on an ADS basis of more than 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with seven rigs running on our 400,000 acres. They're primarily located in Dimmitt and Webb counties. We plan to increase to nine rigs in the first quarter of 2011. With average EURs of 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent combined with today's commodity price environment, we're currently realizing robust rates of returns of approximately 65%.
 In the Delaware Basin of West Texas, where we began to see two more oil-focused opportunities in the Bone Spring and Avalon Shale, where we hold about 550,000 gross acres. We, along with our partners, are now running seven rigs in the area. In the Bone Spring, we continue to see IPs of more than 1,000 barrels of oil per day, with natural gas that has 10:10 PM a high Btu content and good market access. We're also seeing encouraging results from our first two operated Avalon Shale wells. They're each approaching 700 barrels of oil equivalent per day. By the end of the year, we expect to have completed about eight exploration test wells in the Avalon Shale.
 The substantial net risk resources in our shale plays and the performance of these assets bolsters our confidence in the capability of these onshore U.S. fields, generate a significant value and contribute material volumes and reserve growth to our overall portfolio.
 Switching to geography. We're getting closer to achieving first oil from the Jubilee field in Ghana, the first of our three sanctioned mega projects. Once this project and the others in Caesar/Tonga and El Merk are complete, we expect these three mega projects to add about 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net to Anadarko in 2012.
 At the Jubilee project during the third quarter, the partnership was in the final steps of commissioning the FPSO and also finished about 90% of the subsea work. This project remains on schedule and on budget, and we look forward to first production prior to the end of the year.
 We've surpassed the halfway point in the construction of the El Merk in Algeria, which remains on schedule and on budget as well. In the Gulf of Mexico, our project team has proven nimble in keeping the Caesar/Tonga mega project moving forward during the government-mandated deepwater moratorium.
 During the quarter, topside modifications continued in the first riser and flow lines were successfully installed. We expect to advance subsea work, including the installation of jumpers and umbilicals in the fourth quarter and to achieve first production on schedule by the middle of next year. Also, while the moratorium was in place, we continue to advance development planning for both our operated Lucius project and the Shell-operated Vito project in the Gulf of Mexico. We also advanced projects in the Gulf for which we have permits. This includes the Callisto tieback at the Independence Hub where the pipeline permit was approved, and where we expect to achieve first production in the fourth quarter.
 In addition, during the quarter,  we also received a workover permit at the K2 field. Lifting of the moratorium last month was a positive step for the industry in the Gulf Coast region. And though we are ready to safely resume our deepwater exploration and appraisal activity, we, along with other deepwater operators, must have greater clarity around the regulatory process. We're hopeful the government will soon begin to process and issue the permits  that will allow the industry to put people back to work.
 While activity in the Gulf remains limited, we maintained a very active international exploration program throughout the quarter. In West Africa, our partnership announced the third major discovery offshore Ghana at the Owo prospect in the Deepwater Tano block, where we hold an 18% working interest. This discovery is adjacent to the Tweneboa discovery, both of which lie in the west of the Jubilee field. The Owo discovery well and subsequent sidetrack encountered a total of more than 225 net feet of high-quality oil play and stacked Turonian-age reservoir sands. We're excited about the Owo and Tweneboa discoveries and plan to return adjures to see an active exploration, seeking out an active appraisal program once we complete drilling the Mercury well offshore Sierra Leone. Mercury, which spud in early October, is our second deepwater test in the Liberian Basin.
 In Mozambique, we recently announced a world-class natural gas discovery at the Barquentine prospect. The discovery well, located about 2 miles southeast of our previously announced Windjammer discovery, encountered more than 416 net feet of natural gas pay. These two successful wells confirm to the presence of a large accumulation in this frontier basin. We're currently designing an appraisal program that will enable us to determine the areal extent of this new field. And we've begun preliminary evaluation of the potential natural gas commercialization options.
 We've mobilized the drillship approximately 16 miles to the south of the Rovuma Basin. The drill will address the prospect, which would be followed by an exploration well at Tubarão. Based on the success of Mozambique to-date, we anticipate keeping a rig in the basin with an active exploration and appraisal program for the foreseeable future. As operator of the Rovuma base in Offshore Area 1, we hold a 36.5% working interest and approximately 2.6 million acres, with more than 50 identified prospects and leads.
 As we announced in the yesterday's news release, we encountered 133 net feet of oil and natural gas pay at the Badik prospect in offshore Indonesia. The well is located in 230 feet of water and was drilled to a total depth just under 13,000 feet. And it's the first significant discovery on the shelf in the Tarakan Basin. We operate Badik with a 35% working interest and are evaluating appraisal programs and obtaining 3D seismic data on the block.
 In Brazil, drilling is ongoing at the Itauna prospect where we encountered oil with accompanying logs, indicating hydrocarbons and the buildup wasn't one of our primary targets. We are encouraged by what we've seen so far. We're continuing to drill towards both post- and pre-salt objectives and expect to have results in coming weeks. We are operating Itauna with a 50% working interest. With the positive results for our worldwide exploration program, we remain on track to deliver the 400 million barrels of oil equivalent of net discovered resources that we have committed to during our March investor conference.
 Turning to financial results for the quarter. We reported a net loss of $0.05 per diluted share with certain items affecting comparability that increased net income by $0.26 per share. Absent these items, which are typically excluded by the investment community, our net income would have been $0.21 per diluted share as reconciled on Page 7 of last night's earnings release. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.2 billion of cash on hand and also completed a number of actions that have significantly enhanced liquidity.
 First, we entered into a five-year $5 billion undrawn secured revolving credit facility that replaced and upsized our previous $1.3 billion revolving credit agreement. This is due to mature in 2013. Second, we completed the issuance of $2 billion of 6.375% seven-year senior notes and used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to retire $1.3 billion of debt maturing in 2012.
 Subsequent to quarter end, we used a portion of the drawn proceeds to retire an additional $422 million of 2011 debt maturities. As a result of these actions, we have significantly increased our access to capital, while reducing our near-term debt maturity. And we've extended our average debt tenure to more than 14 years. These actions strengthen the company and further protects the interest of all of our stakeholders by providing ample access to capital and liquidity to deliver upon our strategy.
 In an update to our previous comments regarding the Macondo well, we remain confident in our publicly stated position.  And therefore, in applying accounting guidelines to the facts that they are known today, we have not recorded a contingent liability associated with this event. As we did in last quarter, we began including expanded disclosures in our third quarter 10-Q filed yesterday, and we encourage you to review that document for more information.
 Related to Macondo, early in the past quarter, we implemented a one-time supplemental retention program for all nonexecutive employees, for which we recorded a charge of $30 million during the quarter. This program is linked directly to our performance goal for this year and was implemented to keep our teams focused on delivering results during the perceived uncertainty surrounding the Macondo event. We're pleased that this has been effective, as turnover is lower than now than before the event. And we continue to deliver the results we had targeted. Again, this is performance-based and retentive.
 Now to summarize my remarks, the performance of our teams and our portfolio was solid. It enabled us to, again, raise our full year guidance. As detailed in the attachments to last night's earnings release, we are increasing our full year sales volume guidance to a range of 233 to 236 million barrels of oil equivalent. This equates to year-over-year volume growth of 7%. We have also reduced our capital guidance, as we now expect capital expenditures including expense G&G [geology and geophysics] to be in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion for the year.
 Beyond these updates to guidance, as I mentioned earlier, we continue to improve our status as one of the lowest cost operators in our peer group, with a 17% year-to-date improvement in LOE per unit. And we are well positioned to achieve our reserve replacement targets at a competitive cost of less than $17 per barrel of oil equivalent. The recent the success of our exploration teams will allow us to meet our commitment to discover more than 400 million barrels of oil equivalent of net resources during 2010 despite the Gulf moratorium.
 Our balance sheet is in good shape. And as we discussed today, we've taken a number of steps to enhance liquidity and reduce near-term debt maturities. These actions plus the continued performance of the portfolio provides for the financial strength and flexibility to continue delivery of our strategic plans and expectations this year and well into the future.
 In the new year, we plan to update you on our full year results and then at a later date, to provide details on our 2011 capital and operating program. At this point, I can tell you that we expect our 2011 volumes to be well within the estimated range we provided in our March 2010 investor conference. And importantly, we expect to keep the capital expenditures in line with cash flow based on the current strip.
 Now we'll happy to take your questions. So Veronica, if I could turn it back over to you.

But in Brazil, we did move the rig after Wahoo South over to West Africa to drill the Mercury prospect and then to move on down to Ghana to take care of some activities there. And we have appraisal on exploration work. As I mentioned, the Itaipu appraisal will be done early 2011. That will be a Devon-operated rig that they have bringing in, to bring in. And we'll learn a lot from that. Of course, we've tested Wahoo#1. That was very successful. Wahoo#2 was not as successful. We had a lot of mechanical issues. And really right now, we're trying to incorporate all the information that we've got from the Wahoo#1 and #2 wells. We're waiting on the Itaipu appraisal so that we can get a sense for how big that is and meanwhile, working conceptual development planning. Itauna is kind of an independent entity. It's up on the shelf. And while it does have a pre-salt and post-salt objectives, it does not roll into the thinking there on the Wahoo Itaipu complex. So right now, it's acquire the data, incorporate it all into our planning, see what it means to us. And then the way we typically do it is how it stacks up in our portfolio and what it means to Anadarko going forward versus what the market for it may be. And we constantly do that, and we feel like having the information and a good assessment of what that information tells us that allows us to make the best decision. The Indonesia well, while you mentioned it was an obligation well, this was a well we've been wanting to drill for a long time. So it was not something that we are forced into. We do have two blocks there. The shallow water block, which is the Nunukan block where the discovery was made. And then we have the deepwater block immediately adjacent to it to the east, the Bokep block. We operate the shallow water and Eni operates the deepwater one. We've got the discovery. We'll be shooting 3D on that block because we see a lot more like it, a lot more features like it on the block. So we like to again understand what this means to the overall assessment of the block. And meanwhile, we'll be drilling, or ENI as the operator, will be drilling the Borago prospect, which will be outward on the Bokep block, and that should happen at the end of the year or very early 2011. So a lot of information to be gathered, then we'll put it into our portfolio and decide how it fits with us or perhaps somebody else.

I'm not sure we actually look at it quite the way you've asked the question. So I'll probably stumble through the answer a little bit. When you consider the fact that we've got three mega projects that are all oil and they are by themselves about $1 billion of CapEx.

So as you can see as we move from where we were a year ago, well, most of 40% on our liquids plants to being above 40%, we see that trend in the overall mix continue to go up over the next few years, primarily because of these mega projects coming online and coupled with the redirection that we've had over the last couple of years has brought the industry towards gas with liquids components. I hope that's helpful. I can't give you a whole lot more specificity than that. I just not quite looked at it the way you asked the question.

Now, it's pushing almost 800 Bcf of cumulative production. We've had a great run. When we started with it, we thought the resource opportunity was around a Tcf, so you would expect by now it we'd be on the decline as we stated. We thought early on it would see a production plateau in the order of 18 months. We extended that quite a bit based upon the work that we've done. What you're seeing now is many of the smaller fields that make up Independence Hub have begun a very steep decline or watered out. In the bigger fields and those fields that typically Anadarko has as a larger working interest in, have been the ones that have maintained their production through time. And so that's gives you that dynamic of gross volumes falling, net  volumes essentially falling some, but not near to the degree that the others have.

I think what you can take from that is that -- and we're generally look at taking things that would have been longer-cycle investing for us and in reinvesting that same capital into shorter cycle, largely liquids, to in some cases very liquids-rich opportunities. So you have very good rates of return with better cycle time. One of the things that we always have to manage because Bob Daniels has so much exploration success that he's had now for several years, is that we have to be mindful of how that longer-cycle stuff can be brought forward is through monetizations, which we've done a lot of since 2006, about $18 billion worth after-tax. We're not really looking at clearly to sell because that's not particularly tax efficient. So as you think about how we're looking onshore, we always like to improve cycle times even when they're short. So again, that promoted aspect of being able to do something that's tax efficient is very important to us. So as we move onshore from an offshore spend, if you think about it moving around that way, we're both enhancing the short-term cycle of the investment as well as moving in into things that we believe onshore gives extremely good wellhead rates of return.

How long it takes us to get drilling permits, and how long it takes to actually got exploration permits is a real unknown. So as it relates to 2011 capital spending, we'll talk more about that after the first year. And hope between here and there, we'll have a little more clarity around it.
