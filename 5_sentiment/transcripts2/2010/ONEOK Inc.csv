As our news release has indicated, both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners had solid fourth quarter and year to date performances in a challenging industry and economic environment.
At ONEOK, all three segments performed well. Our Distribution segment turned into solid performance, benefiting from new rate mechanisms in all three states and from additional revenues in the fourth quarter from capital recovery mechanisms.
During 2009, the Distribution segment essentially closed the gap between allowed and earned returns on equity, as a result of the successful execution of multi-year innovative rate strategies. And in 2010, the segment will benefit from the new rates in Oklahoma that went into affect late last year.
Energy Services had an exceptional fourth quarter and year, as we continue to successfully implement our strategy to reduce earnings volatility. At ONEOK Partners, higher natural gas and natural gas liquids throughput, benefited results during the fourth quarter and the year. Although lower realized commodity prices compared with 2008 more than offset those benefits for the year.
In the fourth quarter however, the impact of lower realized commodity prices was more than offset by higher volumes in both the natural gas liquids and natural gas businesses, resulting in a 15% quarter-over-quarter operating income increase, driven in part from earning associated with the completion of more than $2 billion in capital investments that began 2006. These completed projects drove volume growth primarily in the natural gas liquids business and benefited not only the fourth quarter, but also the full year.
In fact, the expected contribution of these completed projects gave us enough confidence earlier this year to project a penny per quarter increase in ONEOK Partners distributions in 2010.
The distribution increases will benefit not only ONEOK Partners unit holders but also ONEOK shareholders. Since two-thirds of every incremental EBITDA dollar generated at the partnership is returned to ONEOK as cash.
Importantly, we are well positioned for continued growth at the partnership’s, as previously announced we have identified between 300 million and 500 million per year of additional projects through 2015, depending of course, on market needs and producer commitments.
In early February of this year, ONEOK Partners took advantage of receptive capital markets and issued more than $320 million of equity, which will be more than adequate to fund our 2010 investments. While ONEOK did not participate in this offering, primarily because of the demand for our units in the public market, the company still believes an investment in the partnership’s has beneficial to shareholders.
Now, at this time, Curtis Dinan will provide a more detailed look at ONEOK Partners’ financial highlights and then Terry will review the partnership’s operating highlights. Curtis?

In the fourth quarter, ONEOK Partners’ reported net income of $116 million or $0.93 per unit, compared with last year's fourth quarter net income of $122 million or $1.09 per unit.For 2009, net income was $434",689,"Thanks, John. And good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, ONEOK Partners’ reported net income of $116 million or $0.93 per unit, compared with last year's fourth quarter net income of $122 million or $1.09 per unit.
For 2009, net income was $434 million or $3.60 per unit, compared with $626 million or $6.01 per unit in 2008. John has already provided a high level summary of the drivers of fourth quarter and full year performance, and Terry will provide additional detail in a moment.
Distributable cash flow in the fourth quarter was $149 million, a 35% increase compared with fourth 2008. For the year, distributable cash flow decreased $79 million to $558 million, but was more than adequate to cover a $1.10 per unit fourth quarter distribution, and maintain a 1.13 times coverage ratio for the year, towards the high-end of our 1.05 to 1.15 target.
We issued the partnership’s 2010 guidance in January and expect net income to be in the range of $450 to $490 million for the year. Preliminary estimates for the partnership’s 2010 distributable cash flow are in the range of $580 to $620 million. Adjusted for the recent equity offering our average units outstanding for 2010 are approximately $101.4 million.
Pending board approval, the partnership’s anticipate increasing the distribution a penny per quarter, building from the fourth quarter 2009 distribution increase to $1.10 per unit, which marked the 13 distribution increase since ONEOK become sole general partner of the partnership’s and represents a cumulative 38% increase over that time.
Capital expenditures for the partnership’s are expected to be approximately $362 million comprised of $278 million in growth capital and $84 million in maintenance capital. Terry will provide additional details on the projects we are targeting with these investments.
We have increased our hedges to lock in margins on our expected equity volumes in the partnership’s natural gas gathering and processing segment, which has the most sensitivity to the commodity price changes.
While current 2010 prices for certain commodities are higher than the hedges in place, these hedges provided us the opportunity to lock in margins and to help ensure the distributable cash flow to support our forecast distribution increases for 2010.
For 2010, we have hedged 75% of our expected NGL and condensate equity volumes at an average price of $1.21 per gallon and 75% of our expected natural gas equity volumes at $5.55 per MMBtu.
For 2011, approximately 16% of our expected NGL and condensate equity volumes are hedged at an average price of $1.65 per gallon and 43% of our expected natural gas equity volumes are hedged to $6.29 per MMBtu.
As is our practice, we continually monitor the commodity markets and to mitigate our overall risk we will place additional hedges as conditions warrant.
Earlier this month, we issued $5.5 million common units including the underwriters exercise of a portion of the over-allotment option generating net proceeds of approximately $323 million, which were used to reduce the amount outstanding under our revolving credit agreement and for general partnership purposes.
At the end of 2009, the partnership had $523 million outstanding and $367 million available under the $1 billion revolving credit agreement that expires in 2012. Following completion of the equity offering, the partnership now has $260 million outstanding and a debt-to-capital ratio of 50%. We are also forecasting our debt-to-EBITDA ratio to be below 4 to 1 by the third quarter of this year.
The partnership’s next long-term debt maturities are very manageable $250 million due this June, which we expect to refinance with our short-term revolver and another $225 million due in 2011.
Over the past three years, the partnership has issued $1.1 billion of long-term debt and raised more than $1 billion of equity and has now funded its more than $2 billion growth capital program. At this time, the partnership does not anticipate any additional financing need this year, but we will continue to monitor the capital markets and take advantage of opportunities as they are presented.
Now, Terry Spencer -- now Terry Spencer will provide you with an overview of the operating performance of the partnership.

293889,85213626,51215,"ONEOK Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb-23-2010",2010-02-23,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Curtis, and good morning. The partnership had a solid operating performance in the fourth and the full year, driven primarily by volume increases in both the natural gas and natural gas liquids businesses. Lower commodity prices primarily for t",1713,"Thank you, Curtis, and good morning. The partnership had a solid operating performance in the fourth and the full year, driven primarily by volume increases in both the natural gas and natural gas liquids businesses. Lower commodity prices primarily for the full year offset the impact of these volume increases.
The gathering and processing segment's fourth quarter and year-end financial results were lower than in 2008, due primarily to significantly lower commodity prices offset somewhat by higher natural gas volumes process and by selling our Lehman Brothers bankruptcy claims.
In addition to lower prices, we also experienced a 3% decline in natural gas gathered in both the fourth quarter and year-end periods, due primarily to production declines and curtailments by producers of dry natural gas from coalbed methane wells in the Powder River Basin.
We have certainly seen a drop off in drilling and natural gas production in this region compared with prior years, due to lower natural gas prices. Powder River production generally is not processed since it does not contain natural gas liquids, and it’s some of our lowest margin throughput.
However, our natural gas volumes processed increased nearly 3% for the quarter and for the year, and remain strong because of our presence in the growing natural gas liquids rich Bakken Shale in the Williston Basin in North Dakota and the Woodford Shale in Oklahoma.
These areas continue to be very active development areas driven by favorable drilling economics due in large part to the natural gas liquids content and associated crude oil and condensate production.
In 2009, we connected approximately 300 new wells, down 35% from 2008 levels. But over half of this well connects were located in the crude oil producing NGL rich Bakken Shale and contributed to our growing process volumes. If rig counts remain at current levels the new well development on acreage dedicated to us under existing contracts could exceed 16,00 through 2014.
We plan to invest $115 million in growth capital this year including $32 million for well connects and remaining $83 million for system expansions and upgrades within our operating footprint.
In 2009, we had approximately 190 Williston Basin well connects and expect that number to increase to nearly 300 this year. For the entire segment, across our entire operating footprint, we expect the total number well connects to be north of 400 compared with 476 in 2008.
With this growth in the Bakken Shale, our recently expanded Grasslands gathering and processing facilities are well positioned and we are evaluating the possible construction of more processing capacity and system expansions there as well as in Oklahoma.
Our Western Oklahoma systems are at or near capacity because of the increase drilling activity in the Cana Woodford Shale and the Colony Wash development. Well, more of a natural gas driven play, the natural gas produce there does contain considerable natural gas liquids. We have contractual commitments with producers to provide gathering and processing services and are well positioned for a continued growth.
Our 2010 operating income guidance reflect higher anticipated processing volumes that are expected to be 6% higher than 2009, and gathering volumes leveled with last year.
As Curtis mentioned, we have 75% of our equity volumes hedged for 2010 and have already placed some hedges for 2011, and will continue to look for more hedging opportunities as the year progresses.
In the news release, you will notice that we have adjusted realized net sales process to reflect hedge gains or losses on only the equity volumes we retained as opposed to averaging gains or losses across total sales volumes. We believe it was resulting realized prices will better reflect the impact of hedging on the equity volumes we retained from producers for our services.
Now, moving to our natural gas pipeline segment. This predominantly fee-based segment had another exceptional quarter and year, regarding pipeline expansion and extension that went into service for the first quarter of 2009 as well as our new Midwestern Gas Transmission Interconnect with Rockies Express Pipeline, drove fourth quarter and year end results.
For 2009, our inter and intrastate pipelines were approximately 90% subscribed under demand based rates for the quarter, compared with 85% in 2008 and approximately 86% subscribed for the year, compared with 83% in 2008. Continued supply growth in the midcontinent region, especially in the Woodford Shale, would provide us an opportunity to develop and build new pipelines, connecting to new supply sources and take way expansions to meet the needs of the producers. We are currently talking to producers and customers about these potential growth projects.
Now, let's move to our natural gas liquid segment. Operating income increased more than 23% from the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily as a result of higher NGL volumes, gathered, fractionated, marketed and transported due to the completion of Overland Pass Pipeline and its related projects and the Arbuckle Pipeline.
For the year, operating income was lower, primarily due to narrower NGL product price differentials, offset partially by higher NGL volumes from our recently completed growth projects. The average price differential between the Conway and Mont Belvieu market centers for ethane was nearly 25% lower in the fourth quarter '09, compared with the same period in 2008 and was nearly 27% lower, compared with the 2008 average.
The amount of NGLs fractionated during the 2009 fourth quarter increased to 482,000 barrels per day or 35% higher. NGLs transported on our gathering lines were up 50% or 138,000 barrels per day and NGLs transported on our distribution lines increased 25% or 97,000 barrels per day.
The primary driver for these increases was the completion of Overland Pass Pipeline which reached more than 113,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter. Earlier this month, throughput reached 143,000 barrels per day, getting us closer to our target of over 200,000 barrels per day in the next three to five years, compared with Overland Pass' expandable capacity of 255,000 barrels per day.
We continue to experience solid results on our North System. The NGL and refined petroleum products pipeline serving the Midwest. In the fourth quarter, we experienced high propane demands due to strong quarter earnings season and winter heating demand. We also continue to see increase in third party interest in shipping diluents, used in the production and transportation of heavy Canadian crude oil.
Our 2010, operating income guidance reflects anticipated supply growth in the Mid-Continent and the full year impact of Arbuckle, Overland Pass and related projects that were completed in 2009.
Now, an update on Arbuckle. Throughput reached approximately 97,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2009, exceeding our expectations as new supplies continued to be developed across our systems.
Over the next three to five years, we have commitments from producers from more than 210,000 barrels per day of throughput, compared with Arbuckle expandable capacity of 240,000 barrels per day. For Overland Pass and Arbuckle, we expect approximately $40 million to $60 million in investments in additional pump stations in 2010.
Now, let's discuss the NGL Markets. Fundamentals across the NGL Industry remain strong. We expect fractionation capacity to remain tight and additional NGL supplies to continue to be developed. Demand for fractionation capacity is increasing and so are the fees, with some contracts being negotiated with firm demand fee structures.
Our volumes delivered to Piceance remains strong as U.S. Theme Cracker consumption of ethane exceeded 850,000 barrels per day during the fourth quarter of 2009. We expect this trend to continue throughout 2010.
Demand is driven by our customers continued need for reliable supplies, services and infrastructure. We expect NGL based feedstocks like ethane to continue to have a competitive cost advantage over oil based feedstocks.
We also anticipate as much as 100,000 barrels per day of cracking capacity. It could be further converted from oil based to ethane based feedstocks in the U.S. As NGL growth continues, we will carefully evaluate our NGL infrastructure growth opportunities and their underlined assumptions about the customer and market demand.
With these historically high demand levels and growing supplies, contract structures that significantly mitigate volume and margin risk will become more prevalent.
Chemical companies are projecting double-digit volume growth in 2010, driven by polyethylene and basic plastics as well as continued strong exports to Asia. USD stocking has ended and petrochemical companies are now expecting further increases and end user demand for various products.
A vast majority of the U.S. ethylene derivative demand comes from Canada, Mexico and South America were about 10% of the export demand historically being consumed in Asian markets. Some industry excellence belief that the new petrochemical capacity coming online overseas will display its less economic oil-based capacity in Asia.
We believe of our countries access to and preventability to quickly develop natural gas and natural gas liquid reserves at a relatively low cost will keep fuel and feedstock cost for U.S. petrochemicals at some of the lowest and most competitive in the world.
The need for continued expansion of our NGL infrastructure is driven by the long-term development plans of natural gas and NGL producers within our core areas especially in the Bakken Shale and Woodford Shale and some outside our core areas. We are in discussions with producers in the Williston basin about NGL infrastructure need and takeaway capacity to accommodate this group.
NGL fractionation and pipeline expansion opportunities remain a key focus for our business, particularly during this period of limited excess capacity that we mentioned earlier. We recently signed a 10 year fractionation services agreement with Targa for 60,000 barrels per day of capacity. At their facility in Mont Belvieu, Texas, which is currently being expanded and expected to be operational during the second quarter of 2011.
This agreement provide us with timely access to new capacity in a cost effective manner. It does not preclude us from continuing to evaluate the expansion of our own fractionators or from building new fractionation facilities. The emerging Marcellus shale field, which needs more natural gas and NGL infrastructure is experiencing a potentially challenging, legislative, regulatory and environmental landscape.
We are continuing our discussions with producers in this region to develop solutions related to NGL takeaway capacity. And we will require commitments from producers prior to making any investment. John, that concludes my remarks.

ONEOK's net income for 2009 was $306 million or $2.87 per diluted share, versus $312 million or $2.95 per diluted share in 2008.
Rob, will provide more details on the drivers of this financial performance in a few minutes. ONEOK's 2009 standalone free cash flow before changes in working capital, exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $223 million. By virtue of ONEOK's general partner interest and significant ownership position, ONEOK received $278 million and distributions from the partnership for 2009, an 11% increase from 2008.
At the partnership's estimated distribution level as detailed in the 2010 guidance, ONEOK will receive approximately $304 million in distributions for 2010, a 9% increase over 2009. ONEOK's liquidity position is excellent.
At the end of the fourth quarter and on a standalone basis, we had $359 million of commercial paper outstanding, which is backed by our $1.2 billion revolver that does not expire until 2011, $26 million in cash and cash equivalence and $366 million of natural gas in storage.
By the end of the first quarter, we expect that we've paid all of our short-term debt as we continue to full gas from storage to meet our customers' need. We currently project short-term borrowings to remain below $400 million for 2010. Our next scheduled debt maturity is not until 2011, when $400 million comes due.
Our current standalone long-term debt to equity is 41% and our standalone total debt to equity is 46%, which are both under a 50, 50 debt-to-equity target. ONEOK significant free cash flow and financial flexibility provide us with opportunities to make strategic acquisitions, increase our investment at ONEOK Partners, increase future dividends or repurchase shares.
As John mentioned, ONEOK did not participate in the recent ONEOK Partners equity offering because there was more efficient and timely through access the public market. However, it does not indicate a shift in ONEOK strategy or its capacity or support of the growth program of ONEOK Partners.
ONEOK's 2010 net income guidance is in the range of $300 million to $335 million. Our guidance reflects higher anticipated earnings in the ONEOK Partners and distribution segments partially offset by lower expected earnings in the energy services segment.
Pending board approval, ONEOK anticipates dividend increases of $0.02 per share semi annually during the year. Building on the fourth quarter dividend increased to $0.44 per share representing a 57% increase since January 2006.
We remain committed to our targeted longer-term dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70% of recurring earnings due to the stability of earnings and cash flows from all of our business segments. Now, Rob Martinovich will provide an update on ONEOK’s operating performance.

Terry already discussed ONEOK Partners, so I’ll start with our Distribution segment. Fourth quarter earnings were up 12% compared with 2008, due primarily to additional revenues from our capital recovery mechanism in Okla",1295,"Thanks Curtis and good morning. Terry already discussed ONEOK Partners, so I’ll start with our Distribution segment. Fourth quarter earnings were up 12% compared with 2008, due primarily to additional revenues from our capital recovery mechanism in Oklahoma that was approved by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission late last year partially offset by higher employee related cost.
Year-to-date operating income was up approximately 11%, due primarily to increased margins in all three states from successful rate case outcomes. Operating expenses were slightly higher due to higher employee related costs primarily incentives offset partially by reduced bad debt expenses and lower vehicle related costs.
For the past several years, we have focused on execution of our regulatory strategy to close the gap between our actual return on equity and our allowed return. I am pleased to report we have essentially closed this gap. Since 2005, the distribution segment has more than doubled its return on equity and nearly doubled its operating income.
In 2010, our weighted average allowed return has increased from 10.1% to 10.7% with an expected return on equity of 10.4%. Our innovative rate designs for capital recovery in all three states have enabled us to earn a return on our investments more quickly thus reducing regulatory lag and improving the level of sustainable earnings.
Going forward, we expect to grow rate base by efficiently investing capital and projects that provide benefits to our customers and our share holders. For example, we plan to invest $31 million to install automated meters and select metropolitan communities in Oklahoma.
These meters will enable quicker, safer and more efficient methods and meter rating. And we’ll provide a net reduction in expenses while allowing us to earn a return on these investments under the new performance based rate structure, creating a win-win for customers and the company.
With that, I will just briefly discuss the latest regulatory updates in our states beginning in Oklahoma. In mid December, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission approved an increase of $54.5 million and base rates and set an authorized return on equity of 10.5%. The previously approved performance based rate structure allows for a 75 basis points banned above and below the authorized return.
In this rate case, several riders including capital recovery were moved to base rates. The net revenue increase is expected to be $25.7 million contributing to approximately $14 million of incremental operating income in 2010. Our new performance based rate structure requires regulatory review and annual adjustments as needed. However, adjustments are anticipated to be on a smaller scale then in the past dependent on our terms beginning in 2011.
Moving to Kansas, in mid-December, the Kansas Corporation Commission approved our request for a $3.9 million rate increase under the Kansas Gas System Reliability Surcharge rider that became affected in January 2010.
Also in mid-December, Kansas Gas Services filed an application with the Kansas Corporation Commission that became an efficiencies Kansas utility partner. This program is line to promote energy conservation and is funded by federal economic stimulus dollars.
As filed, the company's participation in this program is continued upon the KCC approving a rate mechanism for revenue decoupling and allowing recovery of all program cost. The KCC has 240 days from the application date to issue ruling which result in a decision on or before August 16th.
Finally, our Texas rate equity. In early December, Texas Gas service filed for a $7.3 million rate increase in its El Paso service area. If approved, the new rates would become affective in May and are factored into our earnings guidance.
For 2010, the operating income guidance for our Distribution segment is $223 million. These reflects the $14 million impact from the approved Oklahoma rate case, $8 million from a retail market business moved from energy service segment and the impact of previously approved rates as well as anticipated new rates in Kansas and Texas.
Offset in these increases is a $17 million from the 2009 capital investment recovery mechanism in Oklahoma that will not recur in 2010. Now, let’s turn to energy services.
We had another strong quarter with results tripling compared with the same period in 2008. This was driven primarily by an increase in storage margins because of riders seasonal stores differentials, the summer winner spread as well as higher transportation margins due to hedges put in place during 2008 on the Rockies to mid-continent capacity. We were also able to take advantage of optimization opportunities in the market place due to the cold of weather.
Offsetting these increases was a decrease in premium services revenue due to lower demand fees and the increased cost of providing these services due to the colder weather in our core service areas in December 2009. Full year 2009 operating income was a $135 million, up nearly 80% compared with 2008, due primarily to the higher transportation margins from higher realized Rockies to mid-continent differentials and an increase in premium services fees due to the relatively warmer winter weather in the first quarter of 2009 compared with the same period in 2008.
Our natural gas and stores at the end of the year was about 61Bcf down from last year's 82Bcf. This decrease is primarily due to colder than normal regional weather in the fourth quarter mostly in December, compared with the fourth quarter of 2008 plus the year-over-year reduction of leased capacity.
We currently have 83 Bcf of stores capacity under lease compared with 91 Bcf at the end of 2008. Our January 31st, 2010 inventory balance was approximately 42 Bcf. As part of our ongoing re-alignment of storage and transportation capacity to meet the requirements of our premium services customers, we anticipate further storage capacity reductions to 71 Bcf by the end of this year and down to 65 Bcf by the end of 2011.
We expect our transportation capacity to be at 1.3Bcf per day by the end of 2010 and approximately 1Bcf per day by the end of 2012 compared with our current capacity of 1.5 Bcf per day. This capacity reduction targets those assets with lower than average unit margins. These actions will also reduce our earnings volatility and working capital requirements.
During 2009, we evaluated the potential benefits associated with maintaining the storage and transportation capacity above the levels needed to serve our premium services customers. In the past, this additional capacity has enabled us to take advantage of natural gas supply disruptions that created opportunities for strong but not necessarily repeatable financial results.
With our focus on premium services customers, we have created a more predictable less volatile earnings strength. Beginning this year, we moved our retail marketing business to the distribution segment which allows energy services to increase its focus on providing premium services to its wholesale customers.
Energy services 2010 earnings guidance of $107 million in operating income excludes the $8 millions from the retail marketing business and reflects lower expected transportation margins from narrower natural gas location differentials compared with 2009.
Our earnings guidance also anticipates reduced premium services demand fees as a result of the lower price environment when contracted along with reduction in market volatility relative to 2009. We do expect higher storage margins during the year as a result of wider seasonal storage differentials due to the lower pricing environment during the 2009 injection period.
For 2010, nearly 75% of our storage margins and 62% of our transportation margins are hedged. We will complete our storage hedges as we inject gas in to storage or financially if spreads significantly widen. For transportation, we will be opportunistic if differentials widen in the summer as they often do, we will put additional hedges in place, if they don’t we will optimize our position in the daily marketplace.
John, this concludes my remarks.

Now to summarize, since becoming general partner of ONEOK in 2006, we demonstrated our commitment to and a strong track record of strategic growth.
Growth in distributions, since 2006 of approximately 8% on a compound annual basis were more than $0.30 a quarter from $0.80 to a $1.10 as well as the expectation of continued distribution growth in 2010. Growth in capital investments to create long-term value for our customers and investors including more than $2 billion of investments between 2006 and 2009 and the identification of 300 million to 500 million per year in additional investment opportunities between now and 2015.
Growth in projects that creates sustainable earnings this year and next which also lead to additional investments in needed infrastructure in the future. Our industry clearly needs additional energy infrastructure as we secure producer commitments on the projects we've identified internally. We will announce specific projects with specific details as we have in the past.
We believe our track record of connecting supply with demand, meeting producer and customer needs by providing quality nondiscretionary services as well as doing what we say we will do, speaks to the credibility of our company and its employees.
Since 2006, we’ve announced 10 major projects, nine of which are now in service. All in all, I would say that's a pretty good betting [ph] average. So at this time, I would like to thank our employees for their commitment and contributions which allow us to continue to create the value we are delivering for our investors and our customers.
Our employee’s hard work and perseverance was a basis of our 2009 success. Making our sound strategy and good assets come together to deliver strong results in a challenging environment. I would like to thank each of them for their dedication and hard work.
Operator, we are now ready for questions.

We offered that option to them and by virtue of the fact of offering it to them; we are completely fine if they exercise it.

As far as conventional drilling, it's slowed down quite a bit. There is still some activity but the thing that's surprising us even some of the more traditional conventionally drilled formations are being horizontally drilled, and they were not horizontally drilled before.
So, yeah, conventional drilling has slowed down quite a bit. But the horizon drilling obviously the results in the Woodford and Colony Wash have much more than offset that.

Good morning and thanks for joining us today and of course, for your continued investment and interest in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Joining me on today's call are Curtis Dinan, our Chief Financial Officer for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners; Rob Martinovich, Chief Operating Officer of ONEOK; and Terry Spencer, our Chief Operating Officer of ONEOK Partners.
As our news release has stated, both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners turned in solid operating performances, with all of our businesses performing well. We are also reaffirming the 2010 earnings guidance for both entities reflecting our confidence in continued strong performance of our businesses. Energy services performed inline with our expectations.
Benefiting from increased storage and marketing margins net of hedging. We are on track with our efforts to reduce annual earnings volatility in this segment by reducing our least storage and transportation capacity. Our distribution segment continues to benefit from its innovative rate strategy with improved operating performance and returns.
Rob will provide more detail on both these segments later in the call. ONEOK partners reap the benefits of our recently completed $2 million plus capital investment program. With higher NGL volumes gathered fractionated and transported.
In the partnerships NGLs segment we experienced some short-term capacity bottlenecks during the quarter. As less fractionation and transportation capacity was available on our assets for optimization activities resulting in lower optimization margins when compared with the first quarter last year. 
We expect to relieve the short-term capacity constraint in the coming quarters and our reaffirming guidance for this segment. Terry will provide additional information on this constraint as well as why we see this as a short-term issue. Overall, almost 73% of the partnerships first quarter margins were fee-based compared with approximately 65% in the same period last year providing the partnership with repeatable and sustainable cash flow.
Our continued growth allows us to increase distributions to unitholders and dividends to shareholders. The partnership increases quarterly distribution another penny last week, representing a 40% increase since we became general partner four year ago this month. 
Pending board approval, we expect to increase the ONEOK dividend by another $0.02 in July, which has grown by almost 60% in the last four years these increases are driven primarily by our commitment too and our execution of growth of ONEOK Partners. ONEOK Partners continues to develop additional growth opportunities, which will not only create value for the partnership unitholders, but also for ONEOK as sole general partner and 43% owner.
Our announcement last week of more than $400 million of investments in the Bakken and Woodford Shale demonstrates our ability and our commitment to develop projects that provide our producers and customers with nondiscretionary services. Allowing them to deliver to market the natural gas and natural gas liquids they produce, these projects also provide attractive returns generating EBTIDA multiples of five to seven times.
At this time Curtis Dinan will provide a more detailed look at ONEOK Partners financial highlights and then Terry will review the partnerships operating performance and industry trends. Curtis?

John has already provided a high level summary of the drivers and the partnerships first quarter results and Terry will provide additional detail in a moment. My remarks will focus on the financial results and our expectations.
In the first quarter ONEOK Partners reported net income of $84 million or $0.57 per unit compared with last year’s first quarter net income of $100 million or $0.85 per unit. Distributable cash flow in the first quarter was $122 million compared with $135 million in the first quarter 2009.
For the first quarter 2010 the partnership increased the distribution one penny to $1.11 per unit representing an annualized rate of $4.44 per unit. This is the fourteenth distribution increase since ONEOK become sole general partner and it represents a cumulative 40% increase over that time.
Pending board approval, the partnership is on track to increase the distribution one penny per quarter for the remainder of the year. We reaffirm the partnerships 2010 guidance and expect net income to be in the range of $450 to $490 for the year and estimate that partnerships 2010 distributable cash flow to be in range of $580 to $620 million.
Based on the equity offering that we completed in February, we anticipate an average of 101.4 million units outstanding for 2010. Capital expenditure for the partnership are expected to be approximately $362 million comprised of $278 million in growth capital and $84 million in maintenance capital.
While growth capital expenditures were adjusted between the various businesses segments to accommodate the timing of certain projects associated with our recently announced expansions in the Bakken and Woodford Shale plays. The total amount of capital expenditures remains unchanged. We have identified additional growth projects for 2010 that we likely resulted an increase in our projected capital expenditures during the year and we will provide an updated forecast when appropriate.
We have hedges in place to lock in margins on our expected equity volumes in the partnership’s natural gas gathering and processing segment, which has the most sensitivity to commodity price changes.
For the remainder of 2010, we have hedged 70% of our expected NGL and condensate equity volumes at an average price of $1.22 per gallon and 81% of our expected natural gas equity volumes at $5.60 per MMBtu.
For 2011, approximately 16% of our expected NGL and condensate equity volumes are hedged at an average price of $1.65 per gallon and 43% of our expected natural gas equity volumes are hedged at $6.29 per MMBtu.
As is our practice, we continually monitor the commodity markets and will place additional hedges as conditions warrant to mitigate our overall risk. At the end of the first quarter, the partnership maintained a strong balance sheet with $310 million of debt outstanding and $558 million available under our $1 billion revolving credit agreement, and the partnerships total debt-to-capital ratio was 51%. 
The partnership’s next long-term debt maturities are very manageable $250 million due this June, which we expect to refinance with our short-term revolver and another $225 million due in 2011.
As I mentioned earlier, we completed an equity offering of approximately $5.5 million common units during the quarter, generating net proceeds of approximately $323 million that was used to reduce the amount outstanding on our $1 billion revolving credit agreement.
At this time, the partnership does not anticipate any additional financing needs this year, but we will continue to monitor the capital markets and take advantage of opportunities as they are presented.
Now, Terry Spencer will provide you with an overview of the operating performance of the partnership.

The partnership had a solid operating performance in the first quarter, driven primarily by volume increases in both the natural gas and natural gas liquids businesses from our recently completed $2 billion plus capita",1755,"Thank you, Curtis, and good morning. The partnership had a solid operating performance in the first quarter, driven primarily by volume increases in both the natural gas and natural gas liquids businesses from our recently completed $2 billion plus capital investment program. And accordingly the partnerships fee-based margin has grown to 73% in the first quarter of 2010, from 60% in 2006. 
The gathering and processing segment's first quarter financial results were lower compared with the same period in 2009, due primarily to lower gathered volumes, primary in Powder River Basin in Wyoming. Offset somewhat by higher natural gas volumes processed.
We experienced a 6% decline in natural gas gathered in the first quarter of 2010, compared with the first quarter of 2009, due primarily to production declines by producers of dry natural gas from coalbed methane wells in the Powder River Basin.
We continue to see a drop off in drilling and natural gas production in the Powder River Basin due to lower natural gas prices. As you may recall, Powder River natural gas production is generally not processed since it does not contain natural gas liquids, and is some of our lowest margin throughput.
However, our natural gas volumes processed increased nearly 2% for the quarter, and remained resilient due to our presence in the growing natural gas liquids rich Bakken shale and the Williston Basin in North Dakota and the Woodford Shale in Oklahoma, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. 
These areas continue to be very active development areas driven by favorable drilling economics in large part due to the natural gas liquids content and associated crude oil and condensate production.
We remain confident in this segment achieving this 2010 operating income guidance with continued growth in processing volumes and more than 70% of overall margin hedged. We’ve already placed some hedges for 2011 and we’ll continue to evaluate additional hedging opportunities as the year progresses.
I would like to add some additional color on recently announced plans to invest approximately $405 million to $470 million between now and the end of 2011 in growth projects in the Bakken and Woodford Shales. We are the largest independent operator of natural gas gathering and processing facilities in the Bakken shale.
We have seen significant increases in driven rig counts within for coal gathering area. Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques have resulted in new wells producing as much as 1500 barrels per day of oil and 1 million cubic per day NGL rich natural gas with NGL content in excess of 10 gallons per Mcf.
Current drilling economics in the Bakken are attractive and produces have plans to continue drilling for many years to come. We have large acreages dedications in the most active development areas which require additional gathering and processing capacity to handle these increasing volumes. By the end of the year our Grasslands plant is expected to be at capacity.
As a result, we will construct a new 100 million cubic feet per day gas processing facility, the Garden Creek plant and invest in expansions, upgrades additional compression and new well connects. The new plant is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2011. We expect to connect more than 300 wells in 2010 and more than 400 wells in 2011 in the Bakken shale at a cost of approximately $90 million over this timeframe. If any rig counts remain at current levels, the new wells drilled and completed on acreage dedicated to us could exceed 2400 through 2016.
Now some highlights on Woodford Shale projects where the partnership will invest $55 million between now and 2011. Our western Oklahoma Systems are near capacity because of the increased drilling activity in the Cana Woodford Shale and the Colony Wash development, while more of the natural gas driven play, the natural gas produced in these areas does contain considerable natural gas liquids, which enhances drilling economic.
Typical well completions in Cana Woodford which are horizontally drilled can produce as much as 8 million cubic feet per day with NGL contact of four to five gallons per Mcf. One of the projects will connect our western Oklahoma gathering system to our existing Maidsville processing plant allowing us to optimize our processing capacity and accommodate this volume growth. We expect to complete this project by the end of this year. We also expect to spend approximately $20 million in well connects in 2010 and 2011 in this region.
Now moving to our natural gas pipeline segment, This predominately fee-based segment had another exceptional quarter strong first quarter results were driven by the Guardian pipeline expansion and extension that went into service in the first quarter of 2009. Our new Midwestern Gas Transmission Interconnect with Rockies Express Pipeline as well as higher natural gas storage margin.
For the first quarter of 2010 our interstate and intrastate pipelines were approximately 91% subscribed under demand based rates compared with 79% in the first quarter of 2009. The FERC recently announce its approval and authorization for TransCanada to construct the Bison pipeline that will connect to Northern Boarder pipeline.
Thereby connecting Rockies supply with upper Midwest markets and diversifying Northern Boarder pipelines to supply sources. Bison is expected to be in service in November of this year. We remain focused on the development of growth opportunities to deliver natural gas to new markets as well as pipeline expansions to serve new supply growth particularly in the areas of new shale development.
Now let’s move to our Natural Gas Liquid segment. Net margin was relatively flat compared with the first quarter of 2009. We benefited from higher NGL volumes gathered fractionated marketed and transported primarily as a result of the completion of the Arbuckle Pipeline, Piceance lateral and D-J Basin lateral projects. However, the benefit of these higher volumes was offset by lower optimization margins, due primarily to less fractionation and pipeline capacity available to captured optimization opportunities which is being use to meet our fee-based contractual obligations.
These short-term capacity constraints limited our ability to capture additional optimization margins in the first quarter. We expect these capacity constraints to be revolved as we move thorough the year, when more fractionation capacity becomes available to us primarily through the expiration of certain contracts. We remain committed to maximizing our bundle, first the full service gathering, fractionation and transportation capability, while reducing standalone fractionation only services. So at certain fractionation only agreements expire more capacity will become available to serve our full service customers as well as our optimization activities.
The average price differential between the Conway and Mont Belvieu market centers for ethane was flat, compared with the same period in 2009. We do expect these differentials to widen the rest of this year as petrochemical demand remains robust and NGL supplies continue to grow. NGL production from our recently completed growth projects is inline with our expectations with continued growth expected throughout the year.
NGLs fractionated during the first quarter increased 492000 barrels per day or 6% higher. NGLs transported on our gathering lines were up 36% to 441,000 barrels per day and NGLs transported on our distribution lines increased 5% to 467,000 barrels per day. At this time Overland Pass Pipeline throughput is nearing its current capacity of a 140,000 barrels per day and we are evaluating and investment in additional pump stations to increase its capacity over the next few years.
Arbuckle throughput is inline with our expectations at about 60,000 barrels per day and is well positioned to accommodate mid-continent and Barnett Shale production growth. We remain confident in achieving our 2010 operating income guidance for the Natural Gas Liquid segment. Although the first quarter was reflect of the impact of some capacity constraints we expect additional optimization opportunities during the year along with anticipated new NGL supplies allowing us to provide the services our customers expect.
Now let’s discuss the NGL markets. On the demand side, petrochemical demand remains robust. The petrochemical chemical industry is currently experiencing wide margins which are expected to continue.
NGL, especially the lighter feeds such as ethane and propane remain economically attractive over some of the heavier oil based feeds, such as NASA. Natural Gasoline demand is also strengthening for years as a burn stock for motor gasoline as a denaturing for ethanol, a petrochemical feedstock and as diluent for Canadian oil essence.
Ethane demand is expected to reign relatively high within improving US demand picture and continued wide proved to natural gas ratios. We also believe there are more 100,000 barrels of additional ethane demand, related to the conversion of heavy-end crackers to ethane and another 100,000 barrels of per day of excess ethane cracking capacity available in Canada. 
On the export front, vast majority of the US ethylene derivative demand comes from Canada, Mexico and South America. With about 10% to 20% of the export demand being consumed in Asian markets. While recent Asian demand has cooled a bit, double-digit demand growth per year is still expected. 
The US Petrochemical industry is very competitive globally for the production of ethylene derivative due to the relatively low price of US NGLs. In addition our countries access to improve an ability to quickly develop natural gas and natural gas liquids research, at a relatively low cost keeps you and feed stock cost for US petrochemical as some of the lowest and most competitive in the world.
We do expect fractionation capacity to remain tight, as additional NGL supplies continue to be developed. Our integrated NGL assets are well positioned to catch these opportunities and provide our customer with the flexible and bundled services they need.
On the supply side, the projects announced last week include an NGL project in the Woodford Shale that exchange our existing Oklahoma NGL gathering system to a new natural gas process plant currently under construction that will be completed by the end of this year. This will increase supply into our Arbuckle pipeline and our (inaudible) fractionation facility.
As we said before, as NGL growth continues we will carefully evaluate our NGL infrastructure growth opportunities with this new Shale plays becoming more prevalent and the need for NGL takeaway solutions. We continue to meet with NGL producers and customers particularly in the Bakken and Marcellus, whether an existing our new shale plays in project we develop will be the result of a disciplined approach that creates value for the customer in exchange, the customer who long-term supply could may be to us.
John that concludes my remarks.

ONEOK's net income for the first quarter was $155 million or $1.44 per diluted share compared with last year's first quarter net income of $122 million or $1.16 per diluted share. We have reframed our 2010 financial guidance and continue to expect net income to be in the range of 300 million to $335 million for the year. Rob, will provide more details on the drivers of this financial performance in a few minutes.
ONEOK’s first quarter 2010 standalone free cash flow before changes in working capital exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $204 million. We currently estimate standalone free cash flow before changes in working capital to exceed capital expenditures and dividends by $200 million to $235 million; this is higher than our original forecast of $135 million to $170 million due to higher than previously forecast, accelerated tax depreciation deductions, resulting and lower income tax payments in 2010.
The midpoint of our standalone cash flow before changes in working capital is $650 million compared with our previous estimate of $584 million. By virtue ONEOK’s general partners interest and significant ownership position, ONEOK received $73 million in distribution from the partnership during the first quarter, a 6% increase from 2009. At the partnerships estimated distribution level as detailed in the 2010 guidance. ONEOK expect to receive approximately $304 million in distribution for 2010, a 9% increase over 2009.
At the end of the first quarter and on a standalone basis we had no commercial paper outstanding $1.2 billion available on our credit facility, $162 million in cash and cash equivalents and $178 million of natural gas and storage. As natural gas was full from storage during the quarter ONEOK’s standalone debt-to-equity was reduced 39% from 46% and as below our 50-50 debt-to-equity target.
We currently project short-term borrowings to remain below $400 million for the remainder of the year. Our next scheduled debt maturity is not until 2011, when $400 million comes due. ONEOK's significant free cash flow and financial flexibility provide us with opportunities to make strategic acquisitions, increased our investment in ONEOK Partners, increase future dividends or repurchase shares. 
Pending board approval, ONEOK is on track to increase the dividend $0.02 per share semi annually during the year. Building on the first quarter dividend of $0.44 per share.
We remain committed to our targeted long-term dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70% of recurring earnings, due to the stability of earnings and cash flows from all of our business segments. 
Now, Rob Martinovich will provide an update on ONEOK’s operating performance.

First quarter results were slightly lower down 2% compared with the first quarter of 2009. Improved margins were driven by successful rate activity and colder than normal weather that resulted in higher sales and transport margins in all three states. 
Expenses increased due to higher employee related costs and integrity management cost that were previously deferred but are now recovered in best rates. Some of the headlines of past heating stated this was year of a sudden winter seasons stated this was the year of the Southern winter. Much of our service territory in particular Oklahoma and Taxes experienced higher then normal snow fall, plus significantly higher heating degree days compared with 2009, and what is considered normal.
While our utility is experienced higher debt sales you may recall that we have weather normalization mechanisms in place to mitigate the earnings impact of colder or warmer than normal weather. As well as the couple rates for 75% of our residential customers in Oklahoma, we continue our efforts to grow our rate base by efficiently investing capital and projects that provide benefits to our customers and our shareholders. 
We are on schedule with approximately 12% complete with our 2010 projects to install automated meters in Tulsa and Oklahoma City. For a total capital investment of $31 million by the end of the year almost half of ONGs residential customers will have automated meters installed. These meters will enable quicker, safer and more efficient meter reading and provide a net reduction in expenses, while allowing us to earn a return on these investments under our new performance based rate structure, creating a win-win for customers and the company.
With that, I will briefly discuss the latest regulatory updates in our states beginning in Oklahoma. In late January we filed on application requesting recovery of the integrity management program cost deferred in 2009 of $15.7 million. The Oklahoma Corporation commission has anticipated to approve our application in hearing schedule June 17. As filed this will have no impact on earnings.
Moving to Kansas, in mid December Kansas get service filed an application with the Kansas Corporation commission to become in efficiency Kansas utility partner. This program is designed to promote energy conservation and is funded by federal economic stimulus dollars. As filed the company’s participation in this program is continued upon the KCC approving a rate mechanism for revenue decoupling and allowing recovery of all program cost. The KCC staff is examining the rate mechanism and public hearings have been schedule for mid-May. The KCC is expected to issue its order by mid-August.
Finally, our Texas rate activity, in early December, Texas Gas service filed for a $7.3 million rate increase in its El Paso service area, which was denied by the EL Paso City Counsel earlier this month. We’ll appeal this decision to Railroad Commission of Texas within the 30 day period, which expires on May 13. The railroad Commission will have a 185 days after RPL is filed to rendered decision. For 2010, we remain confident $223 million operating income guidance for our distribution segment. 
Now let’s turned to Energy Services, we experienced the very good first quarter. Our results would driven primarily by increased storage margins, as a result of riders seasonal storage differentials because of hedges we put in place 2009. An increased Rockies to mid-continent transportation differentials due to hedges we put in place during 2008 and early 2009.
We also were able to take advantage of increased optimization opportunities due to the cold weather experience in our core regions. Offsetting these increases will decrease in premium services revenues. Although, the level of service under contract was similar, the piece we were able to collect was lower due to the decrease in commodity prices and market volatility.
Our natural gas and storage at the end of the first quarter was about 25 Bcf, down from last year’s 46 Bcf. This decreases due primarily the colder than normal regional weather in the first quarter compared with the first quarter of 2009, plus the year-over-year reduction of a leased capacity.
We currently had 83 Bcf of storage capacity under lease, compared with 91 Bcf at the end of the first quarter of 2009. Our April 28, 2010 inventory balance is approximately 34 Bcf. As part of our ongoing realignment of stores and transportation capacity to meet the requirements of our premium services customers, we anticipate further storage capacity reductions, to 71 Bcf by the end of this year and 61 Bcf by the end of 2011. 
We expect our long term transportation capacity to be at 1.3 Bcf per day by the end of 2010 and approximately 1 Bcf per day by the end of 2012, compared with our current long term transportation capacity of 1.4 Bcf per day. This capacity reduction targets those assets with lower than average unit margins. These actions were also help to reduce our year-over-year earnings volatility and working capital requirements.
Energy Services is on track to achieve its 2010 earnings guidance of $107 million in operating income. Our 2010 earnings pattern is returning to the more normal pattern of higher first and fourth quarter earnings driven by the sale of natural gas related to winter weather. This logically follows the lowed profile of our core customers, the LDCs.
Looking at the balance of the year, we expect to have a challenging summer due to lower transportation margins from narrower natural gas location differentials and limited optimization opportunities as result of reduced market volatility. For the fourth quarter we expect narrower seasonal differentials compared with 2009 and reduced premium services revenues as a result of falling commodity prices and reduced market volatility.
For the November and December withdrawal period approximately 88% of our storage margins are hedged. In addition, approximately 62% of our transportation margins are hedged for the balance of the year. As stated in our last conference call, we’ll complete our storage hedges for the year as we inject gas into storage or financially it's quite significantly widened. For transportation, we’ll continue to be opportunistic, if differentials widened in the summer, we’ll put additional hedges in place, if they don't we’ll optimize our position in the daily marketplace. 
John, this concludes my remarks.

What has occurred and the reason is short term normally is that as we looked at our contract portfolio inside the NGL segment. As Terry mention in this comments, we had a number of fractionation only type contracts. They were consuming space if you will in that fee-based area and also we had volume associated with the exchange contracts and that volumes has come our system that faster way than we anticipated.
As also Terry pointed out, we’re at new capacity already on Overland Pass Pipeline and so the amount of space in the smaller section of the part is available to optimize is strong royalty to year ago because we had more balls coming under the fee-based structure, now the auction like candidly was and could have been to back out our fee-based customers and utilize that space to optimize price product differentials and location differentials, but that’s not the way we do business.
So what happens is we work these contracts out that we’ve identified and have been identified for sometime and then that space returns for optimization, but clearly it’s quite simply and exchange or an opportunity cost issue relative to doing your fee-based business versus what’s available for optimization. Does that give you, I mean -- do you want, Terry to give you more detail.

You enter into contracts which provide you a farm obligation to deliver and that space is not being utilized by those farm customers, you’re able to optimize or use under interruptible basis.
As we look forward to this year, we did not expect as higher level of throughput for both pipeline and fractionation capacity. We have found that our customers under firm transport if you have used more other space than we anticipated. In anticipation of that build in throughput, we had already identified certain contracts that needed to be terminated. Because of the build up, we just have less space available to optimize.
Now not always is the optimization margin going to be greater than the margin we collect on our exchange services. That all is depended upon the market is just like in our gathering and processing business. We’ve hedged our gas prices and our liquids prices one could argue that we shouldn't have hedged our liquids prices, but we have in the same thing is true here, we entered into these fee-based firm contracts and because of the volume has picked up little faster than we anticipated and we put our plan together that has diminished our ability to optimize.

So the rates at that time were very low under those contracts. So it’s not a bad thing that those things expire.
So and were frac-only contracts, so there are no other services bundled, they want the tax too or connected with other services or pipeline and gathering services that we provide. So their standalone frac contracts, those customers will move on and obtain those services from others; and we’ll be better prepared to not only optimize that capacity or use it in our optimization, but continue to serve our long-term for service customers.

So certainly $100 million a quarter does not mean $400 million a year; and I’ve explained our pattern going forward as it has been in the past is going to be higher one and four than in two and three, but what is different going forward is also as we have said many times before, as we’ve hedged a higher percentage of our margins relative to storage and transport that we have in the past.
A couple of years ago, while we were executing the strategy, we went into the winter and we typically in Energy Services this is went into the winter, which is the fourth quarter with over hedges on our natural gas volumes in other people’s storage field, because we felt that gas prices were going to increase during the winter months and that was a pretty safe opportunity. The reality is that doesn’t always happen, which we learned a couple of year ago.
So what you’re seeing this year is going to be more typical to what you’re going to see in the future, and that is front end loaded, and as Rob pointed out in his remarks, when we see opportunities to do exactly the same thing we did in ’09 for ’10. If we see those opportunities in ’10 for ’11 and ‘11 and ’12 et cetera, et cetera, we’re going to take advantage of those and remove that opportunity for earnings volatility.
So it’s fair to say fourth quarter is going to be higher than second and third, but I would not to say that it’s going to be the same or relatively close to be the same, because of the fact that we’ve hedge such a high percentage of our Energy Services business, which is why we are reaffirming the segment’s earnings at 107.

Good morning and many thanks for joining us today and for your continued investment and interest in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners.
Joining me on the call today are Curtis Dinan, our Chief Financial Officer for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners; Terry Spencer, our Chief Operating Officer of ONEOK Partners; and Rob Martinovich, Chief Operating Officer of ONEOK.
We completed another successful quarter at both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. At the Partnership segment both third quarter and nine-month results reflect higher NGL volumes and higher contracted natural gas transportation.
In a few minutes, Terry will provide you with more detail on the Partnership’s activities. Our ONEOK Distribution segment continues to benefit from our new performance-based rates in Oklahoma, which reduced volumetric sensitivity and increased revenues in the warmer months.
As expected, the Energy Services segments third quarter results were lower but remained on-track to earn $126 million this year, and we continue to make progress on reducing our contracted storage and transportation capacity to mitigate annual earnings volatility.
In late September, we updated our 2010 earnings guidance for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and remained confident we will achieve those results.
Also during the quarter, we announced additional growth projects at ONEOK Partners. Another gas processing plant in the Bakken Shale and a new natural gas liquids pipeline that will transport NGLs out of the Bakken to the Mid-Continent bringing our total to more than $1.5 billion of new projects announced this year.
These new projects along with the $2 billion of projects we completed late last year will benefit not only the Partnership but also ONEOK in the form of increased earnings and cash flow in the future.
Our visibility into future potential earnings and cash flow growth give us the confidence to project 14% to 18% EBITDA growth over the next three years at the Partnership, which will result in continued distribution growth during that period. We just recently increased the distribution by another penny, which results in a 40% increase since we became sole general partner 4.5 years ago.
Over the next three years, we believe this growth at the Partnership along with the continued contributions from our other segments will result in an 8% to 10% annual net income growth at ONEOK, and 50% to 60% dividend growth while generating $150 million to $200 million in free cash flow per year.
Our investments along with the efficient and prudent use of cash have been a significant part of our effort to create value for shareholders. As ONEOK has benefited from the Partnership’s many capital investments, we have continued to grow the dividend.
Just two weeks ago, the board approved a $0.02 per share dividend increase, which is in addition to the $0.02 per share increases we declared in January and July. At the same meeting, the board also authorized a three year $750 million stock repurchase program.
Curtis will provide additional financial insight into ONEOK later in our call, but first he’ll review ONEOK Partners financials and then Terry will review the Partnership’s operating performance. So, at this time, let me turn the call over to Curtis.

John has already provided a brief summary of the Partnership’s third quarter results and Terry will provide additional detail in a moment.

John has already provided a brief summary of the Partnership’s third quarter results and Terry will provide additional detail in a moment. My remarks will focus on our financial results and outlook.
In the third quarter, ONEOK Partners reported net income of $142 million or $1.09 per unit compared with last year’s third quarter net income of $122 million or $1 per unit. Third quarter results included a $16 million gain related to the sale of a 49% interest in Overland Pass to Williams Partners. That gain had a $0.16 per unit impact on the Partnership’s third quarter results.
On a perspective basis, Overland Pass has been deconsolidated in our financial statements and is now reflected as equity earnings from investments. In the third quarter we had $101.9 million units outstanding compared with $96.4 million units in the same period last year. Our equity offering in February 2010 added approximately $5.5 million additional units.
Distributable cash flow in the third quarter was $156 million compared with $144 million in the third quarter 2009. While the coverage ratio for the first nine months of 2010 was slightly below one times, the coverage ratio for the third quarter was 1.09 times and we expect that 2010 annual coverage ratio to be greater than one times.
For the third quarter, the Partnership increased the distribution $0.01 to $1.13 per unit representing an annualized rate of $4.52 per unit. This is the 16th distribution increase since ONEOK became sole general partner in April 2006.
Subject to Board approval, we plan to increase the distribution $0.01 per quarter through 2011 and 5% to 10% annually in 2012 and 2013.
In late September, we updated the Partnership’s 2010 earnings guidance in the range of $450 million to $470 million to reflect higher than anticipated earnings in the natural gas pipeline segment offset by lower expected earnings in the natural gas gathering and processing segment and the natural gas liquid segment.
We also updated our 2010 capital expenditure guidance to $464 million comprised of $394 million in growth capital and $70 million in maintenance capital. We used the $424 million we received from the Overland Pass transaction to reduce our short-term debt and fund a portion of our capital expenditures effectively eliminating a long-term debt offering that had been planned for this year.
We don’t anticipate any additional financing this year, but we will continue to monitor the capital markets and take advantage of opportunities that are presented. The Partnership’s next scheduled long-term debt maturity is not until March 2011 when $225 million comes due. We have chosen not to call any of our long-term debt early and refinance the debt in today’s low interest rate environment as the make-whole provisions included in our debt agreements are too expensive.
At the end of the third quarter, we had $326 million outstanding in commercial paper and $674 million available under our $1 billion revolving credit facility. The Partnership’s total debt-to-capital ratio was 49% and its debt-to-EBITDA ratio has improved to 3.8 from 4.5 at December 31, 2009.
We have hedges in place to lock in margins on our expected equity volumes in the Partnership’s natural gas gathering and processing segment which has the most sensitivity to commodity price changes.
For the remainder of 2010, we have hedges on 99% of our expected natural gas equity volumes at $5.55 per MMBtu and 65% of our expected NGL and condensate equity volumes at an average price of $1.25 per gallon.
For 2011, approximately 74% of our expected natural gas equity volumes are hedged at $5.72 per MMBtu and 18% of our expected NGL and condensate equity volumes are hedged at an average price of $1.37 per gallon. As is our practice, we continually monitor the commodity markets and will place additional hedges conditions warrant to mitigate our overall risk.
Now, Terry Spencer will provide you with an overview of the operating performance at the Partnership.

The Partnership had a solid operating performance in the third quarter from all segments, driven primarily by volume increases in both the natural gas and natural gas liquids businesses from our $2 billion plus growth capi",1878,"Thanks Curtis, and good morning. The Partnership had a solid operating performance in the third quarter from all segments, driven primarily by volume increases in both the natural gas and natural gas liquids businesses from our $2 billion plus growth capital program we completed last year and from recording the gain on the sale of the 49% ownership interest in Overland Pass Pipeline to Williams Partners.
Similar to the second quarter, the benefit of these higher natural gas liquids volumes was offset by lower optimization margins in the natural gas liquids segment, due to limited fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities and narrower NGL product price differentials between Conway, Kansas and Mont Belvieu, Texas NGL market centers.
As I discussed in our second quarter call, we expect margins to significantly improve in the near and long-term future for several reasons. First, on September 1, a significant NGL legacy contract expired freeing up space at our Mont Belvieu fractionator that is now being used to serve bundled service fee-based contracts and for optimization activities.
Second, additional fractionation capacity from the 60,000 barrel per day fractionation services agreement with Targa will become available in the second quarter of next year.
Third, we announced a few months ago a 15,000 barrel per day expansion of our Sterling I NGL distribution pipeline that will allow us to move more NGL purity products from the Mid-Continent to the Texas Gulf Coast.
I will now briefly discuss the operating performance of ONEOK Partners three segments. The gathering and processing segment’s third quarter financial results were slightly lower compared with the same period last year, due primarily to lower net realized commodity prices and lower gathered volumes, primarily in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming.
The declines in the Powder River Basin are due to reduced drilling activity since natural gas produced in the Powder is dry gas giving producers less economic incentive to drill.
We have also seen lower gathered volumes in some conventional basins in Kansas and Western Oklahoma due to brief periods of ethane rejection and inoperational related outage.
For 2010, we expect our gathered volumes will be down 1% to 2% compared with last year from the impact of reduced drilling in the Powder River offset somewhat by volume growth at our Grasslands natural gas processing plant in the Williston Basin, which we expect to be full by the end of this year as well as from incremental volumes from the Woodford Shale system expansions we announced in April.
Processed volumes for the third quarter were slightly higher compared with last year. Our strong presence in the growing natural gas liquids-rich Bakken Shale in North Dakota, the Woodford Shale and the Granite Wash regions have offset other declines.
For the year, we will expect our processing volumes to be approximately 4% higher than in 2009. We updated our operating income guidance for 2010 in late September to $155 million from $172 million, reflecting lower than expected processing volumes and lower commodity prices for the balance of the year compared with our original plan we completed in late 2009. The impact from lower commodity prices has been mitigated through our hedging activities that Curtis mentioned earlier.
Now, moving to our natural gas pipeline segment. Third quarter results including our 50% interest in Northern Border Pipeline were outstanding. Earnings from Northern Border nearly doubled when compared with the same period last year due mainly to an increase in contracted capacity as a result of strong Midwest market demand.
TransCanada announced on their conference call last week that the Bison Pipeline project targeted to come online in November has been delayed until December and that a significant amount of Northern Boarder’s capacity has been successfully contracted into April of next year.
Our increased guidance of $165 million for this segment reflects higher earnings from increased demand for park and loan transportation services on our pipeline.
Now, let’s move to our natural gas liquids segment. As I discussed earlier, the natural gas liquids segment benefited from higher NGL volumes gathered, fractionated, marketed and transported, primarily as a result of the completion of the Arbuckle Pipeline and the Lateral Pipelines on Overland Pass and the gain on the sale of the 49% ownership interest in Overland Pass Pipeline to Williams Partners.
NGL volumes fractionated during the third quarter were approximately 500,000 barrels per day, more than 91% of capacity, further emphasizing that fractionation capacity continues to be tight.
Our operating statistics in the news release NGLs transported on our gathering lines reflect Overland Pass being deconsolidated as of early September. NGLs transported on our gathering lines were up 13% to $436,000 barrels per day compared with 385,000 barrels per day for the same period last year. NGLs transported on our distribution lines increased 2% to 455,000 barrels per day.
Overland Pass Pipeline volumes are currently averaging approximately 120,000 to 130,000 barrels per day approaching the Pipeline’s current capacity of 140,000 barrels per day. These increases are necessitating continued expansions such as those announced in July and we expect the capacity to be increased to 255,000 barrels per day during 2013.
Arbuckle averaged almost 93,000 barrels per day during the quarter, and is currently averaging approximately 120,000 barrels per day, in line with our expectations and is well positioned to accommodate additional volumes from Rockies, Mid-Continent and Barnett Shale production growth, as our access to more fractionation capacity in Mont Belvieu increases.
Current Arbuckle capacity is approximately 160,000 barrels per day with plans to expand the capacity to 240,000 barrels per day in 2012. The average price differential for ethane between the Conway and Mont Belvieu market centers was $0.10 per gallon during the quarter compared with $0.15 during the same period last year.
A few notable items that may have impacted the Conway to Mont Belvieu differentials during the quarter included a number of maintenance outages at Gulf Coast petrochemical crackers, as well as increasing NGL volumes being transported via Arbuckle into Mont Belvieu.
We reduced earnings guidance for this segment in September to $267 million, primarily due to lower than expected NGL volumes gathered and transported as a result of the timing of certain supply commitments as well as the lower optimization margins for the first nine months of this year and narrower expected NGL product price differentials anticipated for the rest of the year.
Now, some additional color on the NGL markets. The petrochemical industry continues to find ways to crack more ethane due to its continued strong price advantage through retooling and potential restarts of idle crackers. Export demand for ethylene derivatives continues to be robust.
So, over the next couple of years, we see ethylene demand remaining strong as the ethane to crude ratio remains relatively low. Additionally, low natural gas to crude ratios will continue to be a key driver in keeping ethane a highly attractive petrochemical feedstock.
NGL infrastructure and fractionation capacity remains tight, but will gradually improve as the new frac capacity comes online over the next couple of years.
Looking at the NGL supply picture, we see producers very focused on liquid rich plays, such as the Bakken, Cana Woodford, Granite Wash and the Eagle Ford shales.
While NGL growth continues at a rapid pace, much of the growth in volumes is being offset by the inherent natural decline of the base natural gas production which by some experts exceeds 20% per year, and it is getting steeper each year with more shale gas.
This assume 20% decline rate if applied to roughly 2 million barrels per day of NGLs produced from U.S. natural gas processing plants results in a 400,000 barrel per day hold that has to be filled just to remain flat compared with the previous year. We and others believe that NGL demand will be sufficient over the next few years and that regional processing and NGL infrastructure expansions will in fact continue to be needed.
As I have touched on earlier, NGL demand continues to be robust as the petchems continue to demand more NGLs, particularly ethane due to its price advantage. Our discussion with industry experts indicates that petrochemical demand from heavy to light feed conversions could create another 100,000 barrels per day of demand.
Exports of NGLs should also further help demand keep pace with supply with increased propane export demand, as well as growing ethane demand in Canada due to its declining ethane supply.
Now, a few comments on our recent growth projects. In aggregate this year we have announced plans to invest approximately $1.5 billion in Barnett Shale related projects. In the Williston Basin, the Bakken and the underlying Three Forks Formations are oil plays, which also produced NGL-rich associated natural gas.
Attractive crude oil economics and new technology are pushing rig counts higher, and the midstream infrastructure must be built to allow producers to fully monetize their oil and natural gas reserves.
Our gathering and processing segment has a very large and well-established gathering and processing footprint overlaying the Bakken and Three Forks development. Our long-standing relationships with producers, extensive contracted acreage dedications and operating history are the keys to our future growth and clearly provide us with an advantage as we compete for new supplies.
We have announced approximately $700 million in gathering and processing growth projects in the Bakken Shale, which includes two $100 million cubic feet per day natural gas processing plants the Garden Creek plant and related infrastructure and the Stateline # I plant, and related infrastructure which will triple our processing capacity in the region to nearly $300 million cubic feet per day.
We are also evaluating the installation of another new plant, Stateline # II as volumes continue to grow. We also have more than $700 million in NGL infrastructure projects related to the Bakken growth, which includes the 500 plus mile 60,000 barrels per day raw NGL pipeline referred to as the Bakken pipeline that will connect with Overland Pass.
This new pipeline scheduled to be complete in 2013 will receive raw NGLs from our plants in the Williston, as well as from third-party processing plants. Included in that project, our expansions of Overland Pass Pipeline and our Bushton, Kansas fractionation capacity by 60,000 barrels per day to accommodate those additional volumes.
Also on the NGL side, we are expanding our Sterling # I NGL distribution pipeline by 15,000 barrels per day enabling us to transport to Mont Belvieu additional NGL purity products out of the Mid-Continent for our customers under fee-based contracts and to increase the capacity available for our optimization activities. The expansion will begin later this year and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2011.
In addition to the $1.6 billion of growth projects we’ve already announced, we are continuing to evaluate a lengthy backlog of natural gas and NGL-related infrastructure projects, some of which we have already briefed you on including another gas processing plant in the Bakken Shale, the Stateline # II plant and the NGL pipeline capacity expansions by adding additional pump stations.
We are also considering investments in our natural gas pipeline segment, fractionator expansions for a new fractionators, NGL storage facilities and additional pipeline capacity both for raw NGL and purity NGL products.
John, that concludes my remarks.

ONEOK’s net income for the third quarter was $55 million or $0.51 per diluted share compared with last year’s third quarter net income of $48 million, or $0.45 per diluted share. ONEOK Partners gain on the sale of a 49% interest in Overla",602,"Thanks John. ONEOK’s net income for the third quarter was $55 million or $0.51 per diluted share compared with last year’s third quarter net income of $48 million, or $0.45 per diluted share. ONEOK Partners gain on the sale of a 49% interest in Overland Pass impacted ONEOK’s third quarter diluted earnings per share by $0.04. Rob will provide more details on the drivers of ONEOK’s financial performance in a few minutes.
We increased the dividend $0.02 to $.48 per share for the third quarter 2010. This dividend increase, our third this year, reflects our continued confidence in the company and is the 10th dividend increase since January 2006, representing a 70% increase over that time period.
As John mentioned, over the next three years, we plan to execute a more aggressive dividend growth rate of approximately 50% to 60%, while maintaining our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 70% of recurring earnings.
In September, we updated our 2010 earnings guidance and expect net income to be in the range of $320 million to $335 million for the year. We currently estimate 2010 standalone cash flow, before changes in working capital, to exceed capital expenditures and dividends by $250 million to $300 million, which is higher than originally forecast and reflects the positive impact from the implementation of recent tax legislation that extended the 50% bonus depreciation provisions for 2010.
This increases our deferred taxes and cash flow for 2010 but is not indicative of our future cash flow expectations. We anticipate standalone cash flow to exceed capital expenditures and dividends by a range of $150 million to $200 million per year over the next three years.
Embedded within that expectation are the more aggressive dividend growth and the targeted payout ratio that I previously mentioned. Last month, the ONEOK Board approved the ability of the company to execute at its option up to $750 million of share repurchases over a three-year period with a limitation of $300 million of share repurchases in any one calendar year.
We continue to evaluate both the method and timing of any potential repurchases. Our three-year cash flow projections include the impact of that share repurchase program. By virtue of ONEOK’s general partner interest and significant ownership position, ONEOK received $77 million in distributions from the Partnership during the third quarter, a 10% increase from the third quarter last year.
At the Partnership’s estimated distribution level included in the updated 2010 guidance, ONEOK should receive approximately $304 million in distributions during 2010, a 9% increase over 2009. In effect, the Partnership’s distribution increases have funded the dividend increases at ONEOK further demonstrating the alignment between the two entities.
At the end of the third quarter, on a standalone basis, ONEOK had no short-term debt outstanding, $46 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $440 million of natural gas in storage. ONEOK’s standalone debt to equity remains 39%, below our 50-50 debt to equity target.
We currently project short-term borrowings to remain below $100 million for the remainder of the year. ONEOK’s next scheduled debt maturity is not until April 2011 when $400 million comes due.
Finally, a few comments about the Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Act. While the actual regulations are still being written, we do not expect them to significantly impact our ability to hedge commodity price and interest rate risk. However, the cost of doing so may increase and liquidity in the marketplace could become more constrained.
Additionally, we may incur higher administrative costs associated with compliance and additional reporting and disclosure obligations.
Now, Rob Martinovich will provide an update on ONEOK’s operating performance.

Improved margins similar to those experienced in the second quarter were driven primarily b",1308,"Thanks, Curtis, and good morning, everyone. Let’s start with our distribution segment. Third quarter results were higher compared with the third quarter of 2009. Improved margins similar to those experienced in the second quarter were driven primarily by increased revenues and a new rate structure approved in our 2009 Oklahoma rate case.
By design, this new rate structure reduces volumetric sensitivity by increasing fixed fees which increase revenues in the warmer months. Approximately two-thirds of our total margin comes from our residential customers with 73% fixed and 27% volume sensitive. A significant amount of our volumetric sensitive margin is mitigated by normal usage patterns and weather normalization mechanisms.
Third quarter expenses increased over last year due primarily to the recognition of previously deferred integrity management program costs in Oklahoma that are now recovered in base rates. We remain confident in our updated operating income guidance of $232 million which was increased in late September, due primarily to lower operating expenses compared with our original guidance.
We continue our efforts to grow our rate base by efficiently investing our capital and projects that provide benefits to our customers and our shareholders. We’re approximately 96% complete with the installation of automated meters in Tulsa and Oklahoma City.
As a result, by the end of the year almost half of Oklahoma Natural’s residential customers will have automated meters. These meters provide quicker, safer and more efficient meter reading and a net reduction in expenses, while allowing us to earn a return on these investments creating a win-win for customers and the company.
Now, a brief regulatory update beginning in Oklahoma. In September, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed an application with the Oklahoma Corporation Commission to recover cost and receive performance incentives as a partner in numerous proposed energy efficient state programs. A procedural schedule is currently being developed and a hearing is expected to take place in February 2011.
In Texas, we filed an appeal with the Railroad Commission of Texas on May 12 to increase rates by $5.3 million in our El Paso service area after the El Paso City Council denied our rate request. Subsequently, rate case expenses were placed into a separate docket, which effectively reduced the requested increase to $4.4 million. A decision on the appeal is required by December 16 and any new rates would likely to go into effect within 20 days of the decision, if a motion for rehearing is not filed.
In the third quarter, cost of service adjustments were approved throughout our Texas jurisdictions, with the total annual impact to earnings of approximately $1.6 million, which was incorporated into our guidance. There continues to be interest by the Railroad Commission of Texas to initiate a rulemaking procedure proposing the replacement of steel natural gas service lines.
The Railroad Commission recently voted through a first draft of a steel service line replacement rule. Numerous Texas gas utilities, including Texas Gas Service, have provided written comments in response which the commission is taking under consideration. The commissioners may vote on a final rule as early as November 30, and any capital expenditure impact associated with replacing lines would be recovered through the regulatory process.
Now, let’s turn to Energy Services, our third quarter results were lower as expected driven primarily by narrower-realized seasonal storage differentials and lower transportation margins due to narrower Mid-Continent to Gulf Coast location differentials. In addition, premium service revenues decreased.
While the volumetric level of contracted premium services was about the same as last year, revenues were lower due to low natural gas prices and reduced market volatility. These market factors affect the value we receive for providing these premium services.
Our natural gas in storage at the end of the third quarter was about 65 Bcf, down from last year’s 79 Bcf, due primarily to the year-over-year reduction of lease storage capacity. We currently have 73.6 Bcf of storage capacity under lease compared with 83 Bcf at the end of the third quarter of 2009. On October 31, we had approximately 70.5 Bcf of gas in storage.
As part of our ongoing realignment of storage and transportation capacity to meet the requirements of our premium services customers, we are on track to reduce our storage capacity to 71 Bcf by the end of this year and to 65 Bcf by the end of 2011.
We expect our long-term transportation capacity to be at 1.2 Bcf per day by the end of 2010, and approximately 1 Bcf per day by the end of 2012 compared with our current long-term transportation capacity of 1.4 Bcf per day. This capacity reduction targets those assets with lower unit margins and that are not required to provide premium services to our customers.
Energy Services operating income guidance for 2010 was updated in late September to $126 million. Our strong 2010 storage margin performance was a result of hedges put in place in 2009 which enabled us to capture wider, seasonal storage differentials and our ability to capture incremental margins as a result of the cold weather in the first quarter of this year and hotter than normal weather in the summer.
The current business environment is in a word, challenging. It includes narrow locational and season storage differentials which impact the value realized on our transportation and storage positions. These narrow location differentials are primarily a result of low natural gas prices and increased pipeline capacity.
Low natural gas prices coupled with a flat forward price curve have reduced seasonal storage differentials. High gas storage levels persist in spite of the cold first quarter and a hot summer, due to reduced demand as a result of the slow economy and supply growth.
For the November and December withdrawal period, approximately 98% of our storage margins are hedged. In addition, approximately 67% of our transportation margins are hedged for the balance of 2010.
For 2011, we have hedged approximately 32% of our transportation margins for the year, and approximately 73% of our storage margins for the first quarter. Our general strategy is to execute hedges on both transportation and storage based on our forward view of the market and market liquidity.
Finally, I would like to make a few comments about our pipeline integrity efforts at both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. We operate an extensive array of gas gathering, transmission, distribution and liquid pipelines in 16 states. Our pipeline control center helps to monitor these pipelines 24 hours a day to ensure the safety of employees, contractors and communities near these lines.
Our pipeline controllers monitor variances in operating pressures, alarm system indications, third party calls, weather-related issues and storage levels. Any observed operational anomalies are reported promptly to field operations for review and response.
We use a number of inspection methods and processes to detect and mitigate pipeline corrosion, third party damage and other outside exposures that may affect our pipelines. Federal and state regulations require us to develop, implement and maintain formal integrity management programs for transmission and liquid pipelines that cross high consequence areas or HCAs.
HCAs include areas with large population, navigable waterways and sensitive environmental areas. These regulations require assessments on covered natural gas pipelines at least once every seven years while assessments on covered natural gas liquids pipelines are required every five years.
For our natural gas liquids pipelines, all assessments were required to be completed by March 2008 and they were. Natural gas pipeline assessments which includes our gas distribution and gas transmission pipelines must be completed before December 17, 2012. All of our gas pipeline assessments are scheduled to be completed within their required inspection timeframe.
As a final point, the integrity assessment program is not limited to only those pipelines and HCAs. Monitoring and testing are done on all parts of our pipelines as appropriate to verify the safety of our operations.
John, this concludes my remarks.

We remiss on not recognizing your leadership and that of your people in regards to leading our effort as it relates to both integrity and safety pipeline, well beyond pipeline also our rather assets as well. So very much appreciate it.
I made a remark at our recent Investor Day about our desire to execute a transforming transaction which has led many questions about what I meant, what it is, timing structure and how the recently announced Board authorization of the three-year stock repurchase program might impact our ability to execute such a transaction.
To me, a transforming transaction is one that significantly expands our current line of business or allows us to enter into a new line of business within the energy value chain. In this case, a review of our history may be the best predictor of our future.
Our purchase of three separate packages of natural gas gathering and processing assets in 1999 and 2000 transformed us from primarily a utility to a diversified natural gas company with a significant midstream presence.
Our acquisition of the Mid-Continent natural gas liquids business in 2005 clearly transformed us into a preeminent NGL player and paved the way for additional growth that more than doubled the business in less than five years.
Our becoming sole general partner in selling $3 billion of assets to what is now ONEOK Partners transformed the Partnership and ONEOK into growth-oriented organizations that performed better than their peers on any number of financial measures.
We are looking for an opportunity that will not only continue to grow the partnership, but at the same time, could grow ONEOK’s distribution segment and provide additional opportunities for our energy services segment.
We are also looking outside our current value chain for businesses where we can confidently utilize our capabilities into creating more value for our customers, much like we did when we acquired the NGL business.
As far as timing goes, we will continue to be very diligent on the acquisition front, evaluating assets that come on the market and seeking out those that might make sense, all the while exercising the financial discipline that has become our hallmark, not paying too much or buying just for the sake of buying.
Given our continued backlog of growth opportunities at the Partnership, executing a transforming transaction is not an urgent need, but rather an opportunistic option that we will continue to consider.
Our structure also provides us with the tremendous flexibility on completing such a transaction, allowing us to buy assets or whole companies at either the ONEOK or ONEOK Partners levels. If we were to transact at the ONEOK level, depending on the assets we could hold them there or sell them all at once or over time to ONEOK Partners.
And finally, our recently announced share repurchase program does not affect our ability to make a transforming transaction if the right asset, at the right price comes along. And finally and probably most importantly, I’d like to thank our more than 4,700 employees who create value everyday for our investors and for our customer through their hard work, their dedication and continued commitment.
Operator, we’re now ready to answer questions.

So, I think we can’t lose side of the fact that building Arbuckle and putting more raw barrels in Arbuckle is going to have nothing but a helpful benefit to the shipper and put more pressure to shrink that spread over time.

Constantly, in the back of our minds, the challenge is always been how do we continue to grow this company and part of it is coming through that effort with confidence that we can not only continue to execute on internal growth projects, but we can also look beyond that and see other opportunities to grow our company.

Of course, you mentioned that the growth in IDRs and limited partnership distributions has an effect under the OKE dividend increases and mentally even though all the cash is fundable but mentally is that how we should continue to think about the OKE dividends? In other words as the IDRs and the LPs increase then the OKE dividends will increase and the potential for significant share repurchases is really a function of the balance sheet being slightly less ‘optimized?’

So, it’s another way of continuing to talk to the investment community about the benefits of ONEOK Partners to ONEOK.
And the way we’ve chosen to fill that level kit bit out is the fact that when you think about it and you make a good point, cash is cash, it’s all fundable. A way to think about it is that when we have had those increases in the past then end effect have flown through and taking care of. It’s just the way of trying to draw the conclusion or help to draw a conclusion. But I don’t think I’d make a correlation as far as, as deep as you’re going, it certainly is beneficial. Curtis?

So, the challenge for those who currently own fractionation is making sure you don’t overbuild because when you overbuild then it can have a detrimental effect on all of your capacity.
So that I would not characterize as part of a transformational transaction, I see that more as a unique opportunity within NGL business, and that’s why we’ve been very careful about where we’ve added NGL fractionation capacity as have others who own NGL fractionation capacity. Our deal is probably more aligned or opportunities just across the entire value chain not specific just fractionation.

For example, the acquisition dollars, because they are all over the board. You can spend a little bit of money and make a transforming transaction, you spend a lot of money.
I think the takeaway is that a transaction could be significant from the standpoint of dollars, and the share repurchase is not a commitment on our part to buy $750 million worth of our stock back over three years. It’s an option. We have an opportunity where we can deploy the company’s assets in a transaction. We’ll do that and not buy the shares back or vice versa. It’s an optionality, it’s an option that exists for us. Till you got the turkey leg in front of you, you just don’t know how big it is.
