We are very happy to conclude 2009 a year in which we faced exceptional challenges in the travel industry. The difficult year was driven by a weakened economic environment, a declining GDP in business investment as well as increasing unemployment.
Despite the difficult economy, we made considerable progress to strengthening our balance sheet and positioning the company to take advantage of future opportunities. We issued 790 million in equity, 920 million in debt, and completed 200 million in asset sales for a total capital raised of about 1.90 billion. These activities allowed us to repay nearly 900 million in near-term maturities as well as provide additional funds for investment.
Overall, we believe the actions we took in 2009 materially improved the strength of our balance sheet and positioned us well for 2010. So let’s start by talking about our fourth quarter and full year results, and then I’ll discuss our outlook for 2010.
Fourth quarter RevPAR for our comparable hotels decreased 14.6% driven primarily by a decrease in room rate at 12.8%, and a decline in occupancy of 1.3 percentage points. For the full year, comparable RevPAR decreased 19.9% as a result of a 13.5% decrease in average rate combined with a decline in occupancy of 5.4 percentage points compared to where we were in 2008.
Our average rates for the year for our comparable hotels was $172 per night and our average occupancy rate was 66%. Food and beverage revenues at our comparable hotels decreased 15.9% for the quarter due to a decline in banquet business resulting from large scale reductions in group business. For the year, food and beverage revenues decline 20.4%.
Comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins decreased 430 basis points in the fourth quarter, 520 basis points for the full year, resulting in adjusted EBITDA for Host at 229 million for the quarter, 798 million for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter and the full year has been decreased by approximately 41 million due to the unexpected fourth quarter of a potential litigation law relating to the ground lease for our San Antonio Rivercenter hotel.
Our FFO per diluted share was $0.18 for the fourth quarter and $0.51 for the full year. FFO per diluted share was also impacted by the potential litigation loss as well as non-cash impairment charges which will be now at $0.06 for the quarter and $0.28 per share for the full year.
Overall, the favorable trends we experienced in the third quarter accelerated during the fourth quarter as transient occupancy turned positive for the first time this year driven in part by increased special corporate bookings. While weekday performance improved on a relative basis, transient leisure demand remained surprisingly strong into the fourth quarter. As we saw beginning in the third quarter, short-term group bookings continue to improve.
On all fronts, demand is improving on a relative basis, however, we continue to see those improvements at lower room rates compared to the prior year. Starting with our transient business, volume was very strong with an increase in room rates in the fourth quarter of nearly 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, and perhaps even more noteworthy, up almost 1% compared to 2007. These increases compare favorably to the first half of the year where transient occupancy was down over 7% to 2008.
The increase in transient occupancy stemmed primarily from additional demand in both with discount which was up 14% room night, and special corporate segments which were up 6% room night. Although even our higher rated segments were up by a less than in prior quarter, rates continue to be a challenge as the average trends in rates declined by 15% for the quarter which led to an overall transient revenue decline of 9.6%.
Overall for the year, transient demand was down roughly 1%, rate was off by almost 18% and revenues were down by 18.6%. As we project these trends into 2010, we are expecting a solid increase in transient occupancy, although this maybe offset by a decline in transient rate.
Turning to our group business, group room nights for the fourth quarter decreased 14.3%. However, this drop actually reflected significant recovery from the declines that we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. The improvement over the course of the quarter resulted from robust short-term group bookings as the net group bookings in the quarter for the quarter were about 90% higher than in the fourth quarter of 2008 and almost 50% higher than what we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Group business trends have begun to turn the corner as the run rate of declines in group occupancy continues to improve and the outside levels of attrition and cancellation activity are reverting back to historical norms. The average group rate decline 9% for the quarter, which when combined with the decreased in occupancy resulted in a 22% drop in group revenues. Looking at 2010, at this point our forward bookings represent more than 70% of the group room nights we achieved in 2009.
Adjusting our booking pace numbers for the record level of cancellations that occurred in the first half of 2009, our group room night bookings for this year approximately 5% to 6% behind 2009’s pace. Based on the strength of our short-term bookings, we would expect to close much but not all of that gap by yearend.
However, we believe that rate crisis will persist on the group side in 2010, and that the decline in average rate will be higher for groups than on the transient side of our business. This will likely lead to a reduction in group revenues for the year. Off course the final results for both of our group and transient business will depend on the ultimate strength of the recovery and the economy in 2010.
On the asset sale price, in addition to the $200 million in sales we completed last year, we also sold the Sheraton Green Tree [ph] hotel earlier this month for $9 million and recorded a gain of approximately $1 million. This continued our plan of selling non-core properties for significant capital requirements.
Given the current operating environment, tight capital markets for potential buyers and our strong capital position, we have not included any additional dispositions in our guidance for the remainder of the year, although, we still expect to market a few assets this year.
On the investment front, it is interesting to see how the market has developed over the last 12 months. Despite obviously distress in industry and a growing number of loan defaults, the combination of structural complexity in securitized transactions and a little pressure on banks to resolve troubled loan situations has resulted in very few assets actually coming to market.
The bulk of the activity today is occurring in slices of securitized loans either because holders have marked position down enough to permit a sale or a profit, or because that represents the initial level of default in the transaction. At this point, we are pursuing several of these types of investments. While we continue to expect to see more assets come to market, we are less optimistic that we will see -- the opportunities in the near term. Those opportunities we do may be initiated by tactical sellers as opposed to distressed sellers.
As the operating environment stabilizes and begins to improve, we should see deal flow accelerate, but that will likely not occur until later this year or into 2011. Given our successful capital raising efforts, we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities as they begin to arise. However, while we are fairly confident we’ll acquire assets including debt instruments this year, we have not built any acquisition assumption into our guidance at this point.
Our level of capital spending declined in 2009, although we continue to reinvest in our portfolios to insure that our assets are well positioned for the future. This past year we completed a new ballroom in the Chicago Swissotel, The Ritz-Carlton in Amelia Island, and the Harbor Beach Marriott. These hotels should benefit from the expanded bidding face [ph] in their respective markets as the recovery begins and group business begins to pick up.
Our capital expenditures totaled $85 million for the quarter and $300 million for the full year. Return on investment in repositioning projects totaled $35 million for the quarter and $176 million for the full year. We expect that our capital spending will be approximately $270 million to $300 million in 2010 as we take advantage of a lower cost environment to complete several larger room renovation projects, including the complete repositioning of our San Diego Marina Marriott convention hotel. We do intend to revisit our capital plan - spending plan at mid-year to determine if any other projects should be added.
Now let me spend some time in our outlook for 2010. Economic indicators present a very mixed picture with GDP improving, business investment expected to be relatively flat while unemployment remains high and job growth is not expected to accelerate until next year. Even with the recession ending in 2009, we believe that the pace of recovery in 2010 will be somewhat moderate as concerns over unemployment and consumer spending linger.
Lodging demand is expected to increase, however, this again would be somewhat offset by a moderate increase and supply. The bigger challenge is on the rate side as we begin this year with average rate running around 10% below last year’s level. While comparisons will become easier as we move into the second quarter, we see pricing power returning only slowly on a market-by-market basis as demand begins to improve. Unless we experience a far more robust recovery that is currently anticipated, we would expect to endure a third consecutive year of decline in RevPAR and EBITDA.
In a more favorably scenario, where significant business investment in job growth, which result in flat RevPAR for the full year, we would anticipate the comparable adjusted margin will decline a 175 basis points, leading to adjusted EBITDA of $750 million and FFO per share of $0.57. Assuming the recovery is more modest, we would anticipate RevPAR could be down 5%, which would result in comparable operating margins declining by 350 basis points, adjusted EBITDA of $635 million and FFO per share of $0.41.
Turning to our dividend, we expect to reinstate our regular cash dividend on our common stocks in the amount of penny per share per quarter, and we will continue to pay our quarterly cash dividend on our preferred stocks. In closing, let me say that we do expect to see an economic recovery, and we know from experience that early stage acquisitions tend to outperform. So, we will be aggressively looking for opportunities both domestically and internationally over the next couple of years.
We took significant step last year to improve our balance sheet and position ourselves as opportunities arrived. At the property level, we will closely monitor the level of recovery and work closely with our hotel to ensure we are positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities and improved pricing strategy. We also continue to be diligent in our oversight of property operations to ensure we maximize EBITDA and property cash flow through cost controls.
Thank you. And now I will return the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail.

Let me start by giving you some detail on our comparable hotel RevPAR results. Looking at the portfolio based on property types, our urban hotels performed the best during the fourth quarter with a RevPAR decline of 13.2%. RevPAR for our resort conference hotels decreased 16.5%, while RevPAR at our suburban and airport hotels fell 16.9% and 18.5% respectively.
For the full year, our urban hotels performed the best with a RevPAR decline of 18.5% followed by our suburban hotels, which declined 21.4% and our airport hotels, which fell 21.7%. RevPAR declined 23.3% for our resort conference hotels.
Our top performing market for the fourth quarter was New Orleans with a RevPAR increase of 13.8%. Strong in-house group and transient business contributed to an occupancy increase of over seven percentage points. In addition, the success of the Saints increased fan and media interest, resulting in additional demand for home gains.
The Tampa market continued its strong performance in 2009 with a RevPAR decline of only 3.1%, primarily due to several national sporting events that drove demand, particularly at our Tampa Waterside Marriot, although average daily rates declined 11.8%. The Orlando World Center Marriot outperformed the portfolio with a RevPAR decline of 6.8% as occupancy increased over 370 basis points, while rates fell 12.8%.
The outperformance was driven by stronger leisure demand, group pickup and better than expected attrition. As expected, the Washington DC market continued it’s strong with RevPAR down 8.4% in the fourth quarter. Occupancy was down slightly due to strong government and government related demand while rates fell 8%.
RevPAR for Boston fell 9.2% due to a year-over-year increase in occupancy from strong citywide activity offset by a drop in ADR of 10.1%. Additionally, some hotels were able to draw a significant demand in leisure business as well as short-leave group bookings. The San Francisco market RevPAR fell 12.3% which was much better than our expectations for the quarter. Occupancy was up 210 basis points due to strong transient demand while rates fell 14.9%.
We are also presently surprised by the outperformance of New York City where RevPAR declined 13% versus a third quarter decline of 29.2%. International and domestic leisure travel business transient and short-leave group bookings dropped -- remained higher than 2008 levels by 260 basis points.
RevPAR for the San Diego market fell 18.9% driven by a decline in occupancy of 390 basis points and a 13.7% decline in rates. Lower group demand led to discounting transient rates in order to increase demand. Our two worst markets were Phoenix and Houston where RevPAR fell by 25.7% and 27.2% respectively. Phoenix continues to suffer from the impact of new supply, diminished demand and weak economic fundamentals.
The Houston market suffered in 2009 in relation to 2008 from a spike in demand generated by hurricane Ike. For the year, our top three markets were New Orleans with a RevPAR decline of 3.7%, Washington D.C. with a RevPAR decline of 5.3%, and Tampa with a RevPAR decline of 9.6%. The Chicago market, where RevPAR declined 25.8%, the Orlando market with a decrease of 24.2%, and the Phoenix market with a 24% drop in RevPAR were our weakest performers.
As Ed mentioned in his comments, we have taken advantage of our liquidity and continue to invest in our portfolio. As we discussed some of our expectations for select market in 2010, you will know that some markets will benefit from our 2009 capital plans and others will be affected by the 2010 capital plans. We expect the Miami/Fort Lauderdale market to perform very well.
The outperformance will be driven by the late 2009 Ballroom addition at the Harbor Beach Marriott and demand generated by the Super Bowl and Pro Bowl. Boston will also be a top performer, benefiting from the 2009 renovation at the Sheraton Boston, Boston Marriott Copley Place and the Hyatt Cambridge. In addition, leisure and in-house group demand to help to offset weak citywide activities.
We also expect New York City to outperform in 2010. We believe that occupancy will continue to strengthen across all transient segments, and may allow us to stabilize and eventually increase rates. San Francisco will also perform well, the Ballroom renovation at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis will negatively affect the first quarter but improve fourth quarter comparisons. While the citywide pace is down, transient demand is recovering well.
Markets that will continue to struggle in 2010 includes Phoenix, where substantial decline in group room nights is expected along with the 2.5% increase in supply. The ballrooms at the Ritz-Carlton and Phoenix in the Westin Kierland will be renovated and we are adding a ballroom in Kierland which will be disrupted and further reduce group room nights.     The Hawaiian market will continue to be challenged by the lack of airline capacity and airline price increases. Although we have started to see a recent increase in flights, they are still well below 2007 level. In addition, both of our hotels will undergo room renovations.
The San Diego market will struggle due to a substantial decline in citywide demand and the absorption of the new Hilton that opened in 2009, and room renovation at the San Diego Marina Marriott will also negatively effect our performance.
For our European joint venture, RevPAR calculated in constant euros decreased 13.4% for the quarter. The Westin Palace, Milan, Western Europe and Regina and Venice and The Sheraton Skyline in London outperformed the rest of the portfolio. For the year, RevPAR calculated in constant euros fell 19.9%. We expect the European joint venture portfolio to have RevPAR of +2% to -2% for 2010.
For the fourth quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels declined 430 basis points. In spite of the difficult comparisons to the fourth quarter of 2008, due to the high levels of contingency plans implemented at that time, the margin performance was very strong. Our managers continue to actively cut discretionary spending and have been proactive in implementing new cost saving measures.
Profit flow through in the rooms department was higher than anticipated due to reductions in controllable expenses and an improvement in productivity. Food and beverage flow through was also quite good due to reductions in cost and improvements in productivity as well, even though the revenue decline was driven by the loss of higher margin banquet and audio-visual revenues.
Overall, wages and benefits decreased 10.4% and unallocated costs declined by 7.8% for the quarter as hotels reduced management headcount and significantly lowered other controllable costs. Utility cost decreased 9.7% through a combination of lower usage, lower rates and the impact of energy saving capital improvements. For the quarter, real estate taxes declined 6.9% while property insurance costs increased by approximately 1.4%.
It is worth noting that we achieved this level of margin performance for the quarter despite the significant negative impact from the treatment of the New York Marriott Marquis ground lease of 50 basis points and a 50% year-over-year decline in cancellation and attrition fees in the quarter, which led to an additional 60 basis points drop in margins.
Looking forward to 2010, we expect occupancy to increase, which will lead to growth in wage and benefit costs, slightly less than inflation. After taking into consideration the benefit productivity gain, we expect unallocated costs to decrease less than inflation except for utilities, where we expect higher growth to an increase in rates in volume due to 2010’s cold winter compared to the mild winter of 2009.
We expect property insurance to increase of inflation, and property taxes to rise in excess of inflation. As a result, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins to decrease 175 basis points at a better end of the RevPAR range and decrease 350 basis points at the worst end of the range. I previously mentioned the impact of attrition and cancellation fees in the fourth quarter of 2009 results. For all of 2009, attrition and cancellation fees were approximately $40 million higher than a typical year, adjusting 2009 to a typical year with results in 2010 margins declining by 75 basis points less in the marketing detail of ours [ph].
With respect to our balance sheet, we finished the year with over $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents. We recently redeemed the remaining $346 million and 7% Series M senior notes due in August of 2012 and repaid the $124 million mortgage on the Atlanta Marriott Marquis with an interest rate in the loan was set to increase 200 basis points to 9.4%. As result of these repayments, we reduced our outstanding debt by $470 million to approximately $5.4 billion and we currently have approximately $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 99 assets unencumbered by mortgage debt.
Lastly, I want to briefly comment on the litigation loss detailed in the press release. Our fourth quarter EBITDA and FFO have been reduced by approximately $41 million for the potential loss related to the attempted sale of the land encumbered by a ground lease for the San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter. We are obviously disappointed by the juries’ verdict which is not yet final and is subject to close trial motions. While we certainly appreciate the time that the Jury put into this case, we disagree with the trial court’s interpretation of the ground lease in question and the effect that interpretation and other rulings had on the jury’s deliberations and verdict.
This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have.

That’s part of it, part of it is that we were able to, one of the reasons our property tax numbers dropped in the fourth quarter as we were successful in some of the appeals that we had mounted over the course of the last couple of years and the benefits of those appeals came into the fourth quarter number. So that was the reason why the fourth quarter was down.
As we look at this year we're still going to be contesting in a number of jurisdictions but I think the problem we are running into is that we know that single family values are down throughout a lot of markets. There is a reluctance on the part of most local governments to increase tax rates, especially as it relates to residential customers.
And so, even though our value should be lower, at the end of the day we are assuming that we're going to pay a bit more. It should be at that as it was a couple of years ago where we really got caught in historically high cash flows in a declining environment. So we should get to the point where we start to moderate and see this go the other way, but we don’t think we're quite there yet.

I mean, obviously it depends a lot on the size of the group, but I would say as we look back we talk to our asset managers on our properties and then compare this to what we've seen over the course of the last seven to ten years, we are clearly at the short end of the cycle in terms of how closely events are happening compared to when people are booking them. It’s not uncommon to see big events booked within a 30-day timeframe, although I think in general you are seeing the bulk of the business gets booked in a 30- to 60-day timeframe. We’re not yet -- as the occupancy levels that we are seeing in the industry right now, they are still at pretty high level of confidence on the part of most, both that are bookings group events -- they will be able to find a place to have at their hotel.

I am sure many of you know already that a typical securitized deal often comes with a senior notes that’s secured by the real estate or maybe a B notes that’s also secured by the real estate, and then maybe varying levels of mez debt that are not secured by the real estate but rather look to security in the form of the borrowers' ownership interest for their collateral. What you are finding in a lot of situations right now, it's clear that the borrower is probably going to be out of the picture that just because of decline in value has been significant enough that the borrowers not likely to retain any equity interest in the property because the value is not worth to debt.
But what that still means is that there’s opportunities to invest either at the mez debt level or at the B note level. Some of those opportunities will be a route to the real estate. It will be an opportunity to buy that note at a significant discount, and then ultimately through for closure process or some other process end up with control of the property.
In other cases it may just be that where there is an opportunity to invest in one of those securities and get a mid-teens or higher returns, which would be attractive from our perspective. So, each of the transaction tends to be a little bit different, they are actually fairly interesting but they are also fairly complex, but I think that gives you some flavor for what we are looking at.

But, I mean, the point I was trying to make, maybe I wasn’t quite so clear about it is that, number one, we do have a pipeline, but there isn’t anything imminent that we don’t intend to issue equity at the same rate that we have been over the next couple of quarters unless we see that pipeline start to materialize in real deal. So, I think, partly it sounds like part of our comment was that it would be prudent to be slower about raising equity capital until we start to see deal flow materialize, and I don’t think we see the road differently from you.

We only have - assuming our exchangeable afflict to us in a couple of months, we only have a little over 300 million come through this year, and we don’t deal our exposure in 2011 that’s much different than that. But remember that part of the drive and the world is changing, but part of the drive that we had over the course of 2009 is to make certain we were adequately prepared to deal with the different debt maturities that we have.

The truth is that I don’t think there is a huge difference in the way we are looking at next 2010 compared to Marriott and Starwood are. They represent together probably 75% to 80% of our portfolio. So, to the extent that the way the years plays out is closer to the midpoint of their guidance and necessarily the midpoint of ours, you will see that benefit in our performance. I don’t expect that we would really ultimately perform much differently from them.
I don’t know the exact composition of Starwood and Marriott portfolios from a group versus transient perspective. We mentioned the point that we may have a bit more groups in them and I suspect that that’s right. I think in the case of the Marriott portfolio I am sure that when you look at all the large group convention hotels that we own, that they also operate, I suspect that we will have a disproportionate percentage of those. If you look at that in terms of how we compare to the overall market in this area last year we probably ran 37% to 38% of our mix was group, and I think the industry as a whole has been up or upscale average 30% to 31%.
So we are a little bit higher in group, and we area little bit concerned about group for this year just from the standpoint that everything we talked about today and in the past has been that group got hit a lot harder in this downturn than it normally got and frankly then we would have hoped in a way we developed our portfolio.
I suspect that if we do underperform at all it would probably because we have a slightly larger group presence, and it may take a bit longer for that to come back. I think longer term that will -- I see that as a huge benefit. The reality is that that our normal group typically represents 42% to 43% of our overall business. So that’s a 5% plus jump in share that should ultimately come out of our portfolio, or happen to our portfolio the group that covers. And once that starts to turn the corner, we start to see group and it will especially be corporate group comeback. You'll see that reflected in stronger results for those.

A lot of that is weighted towards the first part of the year, its logic that with finance. That tree, financial meltdown are finally completed.
As you look across the spectrum of markets that appear to be a bit more challenging, finance in New York and Denver tend to be some of the markets where we've seen more supply coming in, kind of looking at that in a 2009 to 2011 timeframe. That when New York makes that list of, the supply in New York is not really in Manhattan as much as in some of the surrounding neighborhoods and surrounding boroughs. So, ultimately as we look at the New York market, we actually feel fairly good about the ability of New York to absorb what will a downtown market what we are, for New York to absorb that supply.
I mean the reality is for our portfolio for last year we ran well above 80% in terms of occupancy. I think it was around 83% for the full year in New York, was over -- a real close to 90% in the fourth quarter. So New York is one of those markets that we actually think, if you could get a little bit of pickup on the corporate transient side, we have little bit of strength on the group side, that’s the market that could surprise to the upside over the course of 2010.

It has dragged us down in a way those hotels performed last year. It is interesting to watch them and the trends on the luxury side, luxury did, I would say it did better, that would be an overstatement that they did better than the rest of the portfolio in the fourth quarter, but it certainly did a lot better than it had done in the first three quarters of the year.
And as you got towards December and into January, and I think some of this is because if you think about the luxury segment especially the Ritz-Carlton Hotels that have own, we have a big lot [ph] of presence. We’ve actually seen that, that segment has outperformed the rest of the company in both the months of December and January.
Now I think some of that is timing and some of that is the fact -- again reflects back to that last year was fairly ugly on the luxury side because those are the hotels that got hit first by the some of the politics around the same reasons for some other areas, but more than short is that we’re actually expecting for our whole portfolio this year for likely to probably do a little bit better than the portfolio as a whole.
We’re actually thinking of Florida hotels based on their budgets and their performance here so far, individually there was only six weeks in the year, so you don’t really get a lot out of that. But so far our RevPAR which is in Florida are expecting to have positive RevPAR for the year. So I think what that tells you is that they are doing a little - they are doing better on the demand side. They are still down meaningfully in terms of rate, so that’s going to a challenge and it probably take them a while to rebuild on that front.
There are still some segments in the industry that are scared to go to a luxury hotel, and so I suspect we’ll fight back for another year. We don’t - and our risk is we do at for season, we don’t get a lot of bookings that are multiple years out, that’s a typical corporate customer in terms of what close they are in. So I don’t know that you can draw a lot of comfort for what you are see in ’11 and ’12 but the bookings looking out further are inline with what you would expect in a normal year. They don’t reflect some of the weakness in all of that.

After a challenging year in 2009, we are pleased to report that our first quarter operating results and trends were significantly better than we expected. As I will discuss in more detail, we experienced significant increases in transient demand and very encouraging trends on the group side of our business. While we still face challenges rebuilding our average rates, our recent operating results have turned positive on the top line and suggest that the industry is reaching an inflection point.
Turning to our results, first quarter RevPAR for our comparable hotel decreased by 2.3% driven by a decrease in average room rate of 8.7% which was offset by an increase in occupancy of 4.3% each quarter. For the quarter, our average rate was at $167 and our average occupancy was 65.5%. Our top line results improved on a relative basis each funds of the quarter and turned positive in March. As you may remember, due to the timing of our reporting period, our first quarter does not include the operating results for a significant portion of our portfolio for the month of March. Adjusting our results to reflect the inclusion of all of our assets for the calendar quarter, would result in a RevPAR decline of only 1%. 
Food and beverage revenues at our comparable hotels decreased 3.7% for the quarter and total revenue fell by 3.9%. While our managers continue to strive to control costs, the combination of increased occupancy, continued pressure on average rates and a meaningful reduction in attrition and cancellation fees, resulted in a decrease in comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin of 275 basis points for the quarter. First quarter adjusted EBITDA for Host was $126 million. FFO per diluted share for the quarter was $0.08, which included a reduction of $0.01 as a result of cost associated with the prepayment of debt and an accrual related to the potential of San Antonio litigation loss. Overall, we are very pleased that our adjusted EBITDA and FFO per share diluted results materially exceeded our expectations.
Turning to our business mix for the quarter, the demand trends that developed over the second half of 2009 accelerated in the first quarter of 2010 positively impacting our business mix on a wider scale. For the third straight quarter, we experienced year-over-year growth in our Transient business with an overall increase in Transient room nights of more than 12%. More importantly, this increase in demand was led by our Special Corporate business where room nights increased more than 28%, and our Premium and Corporate segments where room nights increased for the first time in nine quarters at a rate of nearly 9%. Special Corporate demand growth was especially strong in our Luxury properties which experienced a demand increase in that segment of more than 50%. While average rates in both of these corporate segments were still down by roughly 8%, these are solid indicators of improvements in corporate travel which is required for the industry to commence a true recovery. 
Overall, the positive shift in business mix in the Transient segment for the first time since the summer of 2008, held a decline in the overall average rates of 7.7%, which led to a Transient revenue increase of 3.6%. On the group side, frankly, we were pleasantly surprised by the pace of our short-term bookings during the quarter. At the beginning of the year, we faced a 4% shortfall in the first quarter, taking into account the record cancellations we experienced in the early months of 2009, and roughly a 6% shortfall for the entire year. At the end of the quarter, group demand improved by 0.5% for the quarter and our full-year bookings are now trending ahead of the prior year's pace. 
Volume improvements for the quarter came primarily from a 14% increase in Association room night and more than a 5% increase in discount business. While Corporate groups continue to be a challenge as demand decreased by 13% in the quarter, we saw a meaningful acceleration in Corporate group activity as companies began to rebook business. Interestingly, our Luxury Corporate group room nights actually increased more than 18% compared to the first quarter of last year, which suggest the companies are feeling somewhat less concerned about the potential political ramifications of booking business at higher-end property. Overall, group room rates declined 9% and, combined with the increase in demand of 0.5%, resulted in a decrease in group revenues of 8.6%. The rebounding Group business compared to expectations and Association business in particular, helped our big box hotels as they slightly outperformed the rest of the portfolio. 
Looking at the second quarter and the remainder of the year, our visibility continues to be fairly limited because of the short booking window. RevPAR growth for period four exceeded 5% continuing the recent trend of improving results. Group bookings continued to be strong as bookings in the first quarter for the second quarter have more than tripled when compared to last year and even slightly outpaced our 2007 level of activity. Transient bookings for the second quarter are also trending ahead of last year. Overall, improvement is still relying on the strength of the economy, but we are optimistic that businesses are beginning to loosen their travel budgets starting a recovery in lodging demand.
While the investment front, as I discussed with you last quarter, the combination of structural complexity and secure-type transactions and little pressure on banks to resolve troubled loans situations has resulted in a limited number of assets actually coming to market, however, we are seeing investment opportunities in the form of distressed loans. Earlier this month we purchased the junior traunches of a mortgage loan secured by a 1,900-room portfolio hotel in Europe. The par value of the traunches we purchased are approximately 64 million euros and we purchased the notes at a meaningful discount. While we cannot get into more specifics regarding this investment, the return we expect to generate on the notes meets or exceeds our return target for a levered investment. 
In terms of fee acquisition as the operating environment stabilizes and begins to improve, our pipeline of potential transactions has increased both domestically and internationally and we are well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities as they begin to arise. Our guidance continues to not reflect any benefits from property acquisitions even though we expect to complete at least some acquisitions during the second half of the year. 
During the first quarter, we sold a 370-room Sheraton Braintree hotel for $9 million. We also signed an agreement to sell the Ritz-Carlton in Dearborn. This asset is in one of the most challenging markets in the country, generates negative net operating income and has significant capital need. Since the transaction is not that closed, we do not provide any additional detail to the deal at this time. While we expect to market additional assets this year, we have not included any additional dispositions in our guidance.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter totaled approximately $50 million, which included $23 million of return on investment projects. During the first quarter, we completed the renovation of over 95,000 square feet of meeting space at the San Francisco Marriott Masconi Marquis, one of the preeminent group hotels in San Francisco. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, at our San Diego Marriott Hotel &Marina, we renovated the south tower rooms, and during the quarter we completed the construction of a new health club. These projects are part of the first phase of what is ultimately projected to be $190 million reinvention of this hotel. In addition to the complete renovation of the rooms, this project will provide significant upgrades to the pool, food and beverage and entry experiences. We are also in the process of planning a new 40,000-square-foot exhibit hall and a 40,000-square-foot ballroom, which will have use of both the nearby marina and the downtown area. Construction on that phase of the project is expected to commence in March of 2011. We are also adding a new 15,000-square-foot ballroom and a 5,000-square-foot to the Westin Kierland Resort & Spa in Phoenix as part of a broader meeting space renovation project. 
Given the strength of our balance sheet combined with currently low construction costs and the fact that occupancy levels are still below peak, we believe that the timing is ideal to accelerate the pace of some of our planned capital expenditure projects. As a result, we are increasing our expected capital expenditure estimate for the year to $300 million to $340 million, and we'll continue to evaluate other projects as we work through the year. 
Now let me spend some time on our outlook for 2010.  While we remain concerned that employment growth has lagged, consumer spending trends are still inconsistent and there are continuing risks to the financial system, it is clear that the broader economy is in recovery. Assuming that recovery continues, our better-than-expected first quarter results, combined with the improvement in our near-term booking phase and positive results in April, have led us to a more positive outlook for the remainder of the year. As a result, we are increasing our estimates for RevPAR for the year to an increase of 1% to 4% with a comparable adjusted margin decline of 125 basis points to 50 basis points. Based on these assumptions, full-year adjusted EBITDA would be approximately $750 million to $800 million and FFO per diluted share would be $0.58 to $0.65. 
In closing, we are certainly more optimistic than we were on our call last quarter. We are seeing signs of recovery in demand and we'll continue to work with our hotels and monitor our pricing strategies for improvement on the rate side. On the investment front, we know from experience that early-stage acquisitions tend to outperform so we will continue to aggressively look for investment opportunities both domestically and internationally. In addition, we will continue to develop reinvestment opportunities within our existing portfolio in order to take advantage of favorable costs and occupancy levels. We took significant steps last year to improve our balance sheet and we are well-prepared for opportunities as they arise. Thank you, and let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer."

Let me start by giving you some detail on comparable hotel RevPAR results. Looking at the portfolio based on property types, our airport hotels performed the best during the quarter, with a RevPAR decline of 0.9% as the hotels benefited for the poor weather in the Northeast that led to numerous flight cancellations and layovers. RevPAR for our urban hotels increased 1.7%, while RevPAR suburban and resort conference hotels fell 2.4% and 4.8%, respectively. Before I address individual market performance, I wanted to mention that half of our top 20 markets had positive RevPAR for the quarter. Our top-performing market was Philadelphia with a RevPAR increase of 12.3%. Strong Transient, Citywide and Group business contributed to and occupancy increase of nearly 9% and an ADR decline of 2.8%. For the second quarter, we expect the Philadelphia market to underperform the portfolio due to lower levels of both transient and group demand.
As expected, the Miami Fort Lauderdale market performed very well with a RevPAR increase of 10.3%. Occupancy was up 6.4% and the rate was up 1.7%. Yes, that's right. I said rate was up in the market. The outperformance was driven by growth in Transient and Group business generated by the Super Bowl and Pro Bowl, as well as the impact of the late 2009 ballroom addition at the Harbor Beach Marriott Resort & Spa. We expect the Miami Fort Lauderdale market to have a weaker second quarter but still have positive RevPAR. The San Antonio market also performed very well, with a RevPAR increase of 7.3%. A strong citywide calendar drove an increase in compression days leading to an increase in occupancy of 5.4% and limiting the rate decline to only 0.8%. We expect San Antonio to have a decent second quarter and a strong second half of the year. 
RevPAR for Boston increased 6.7% due to better transient and group demand. Occupancy was up 5.7% and ADR declined 5.1%. Some of the improvement was due to easier comparisons as the Boston Marriott Copley Place and Sheraton Boston were under renovation in the first quarter of 2009. We expect our Boston hotels to have a great second quarter with double-digit RevPAR growth due to strong citywide activity and improvement in transient demand. 
Orange County, a market that was extremely hard hit by the housing market meltdown, had RevPAR growth of 6.7% in the quarter. Transient demand across all segments showed signs of recovery. Occupancy was up 10.2% while ADR was down 7.9%. We expect the Orange County market to continue to perform well in the second quarter. 
We were also pleasantly surprised by the outperformance of New York City, where RevPAR increased 2.6% as occupancy grew by 7.7% and rate declined 7.7%. Business transient and shortening group bookings drove the improvement in demand. We expect New York City to have an outstanding second quarter due to high levels of business transient demand. 
RevPAR for our Chicago properties fell 11.2% due to significant decline in citywide activity which was partially offset by an increase in special corporate and discount business, albeit at a lower rate, as ADR fell 9.9%. The Swissotel, with its recent addition of 38,000 square feet of meeting space, substantially outperformed the market with a RevPAR decline of only 7.7%. We expect Chicago to perform much better in the second quarter and for the outperformance of the Swissotel to continue. 
Forward group demand and weak pricing across all segments affected RevPAR performance at both of our Hawaiian hotels resulting in a 14.1% decline in RevPAR, substantially all of which was due to a 13.5% drop in ADR. We expect the hotels to perform much better in the second quarter but we need to see further increases in airline capacity versus stay in recovery. 
RevPAR for our DC hotels declined 15.9% with a 2% decline in occupancy and a 13.4% drop in ADR. As expected, year-over-year comparisons for the market were difficult due to the 2009 presidential inauguration and related activity as well as record-breaking levels of snowfall in 2010, both of which were significantly affected Group and Transient business. Excluding DC from our concept for the first quarter, RevPAR would have only declined 0.6%. Our DC hotels had positive RevPAR in period three and we expect DC to have positive RevPAR in the second quarter. 
As expected, the San Diego market struggled due to a substantial decline in citywide demand and the absorption of the new Hilton that opened in 2009. RevPAR declined 16.9% with an occupancy decline of 3.5% and a 12.2% decline in ADR. A rooms renovation of the San Diego Marriott Hotel & Marina also negatively affected our performance. We expect the San Diego market to continue to struggle in the second quarter but improve in the second half of the year. 
For our European joint venture, RevPAR calculated in constant euros decreased 1.8% for the quarter. Occupancy increased 5.2% and ADR declined 10.7%. The Westin Europa and Regina in Venice, the Sheraton Skyline in London and the Sheraton Warsaw outperformed the rest of the portfolio. For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels declined 275 basis points. This performance was better than expected due to the challenges created by four items. The first item was a substantial impact of cancellation and attrition fees. In the first quarter of 2009, cancellation and attrition fees were over $12 million higher than the first quarter of 2010 accounting for 110 basis points of the overall margin decline. 
The second item was due to our RevPAR decline driven by a combination of an increase in occupancy and a drop in rate, which is a challenge from an operating profit perspective. However, we were still able to reduce overall rooms cost for occupied rooms to improvement in productivity and reductions in several controllable cost areas. 
The third challenge was the loss of high profit banquet and audiovisual revenues which declined 7.3%. However, food and beverage flow-through was quite good as our managers continued to refine and implement efficiencies in their staffing models. 
The fourth item was the treatment of the ground lease payments in the New York Marriott Marquis. As we discussed last year, in the first quarter of 2009, $3 million of our rent payment was applied to fully fund the deferred purchase price of the land. In the first quarter of 2010, our entire payment was treated as ground rent expense, which reduced EBITDA by $3 million. We have the ability from today through 2017 to buy the fee interest in the land under the hotel from an incremental payment of $19.9 million. Overall, wages and benefits decreased 1.3% or 8.2% on a per occupied room basis, and unallocated cost declined by 2.7% for the quarter as hotels reduced management headcount and lowered other controllable costs. Utility costs also decreased 8.4% through a combination of lower usage, lower rates and the impact of energy saving capital improvements. For the quarter, real estate taxes were flat. 
Looking out through the rest of the year, we expect occupancy to increase further, which will likely lead to growth in wage and benefit cost at inflation after taking into consideration the benefit from productivity gains. We expect unallocated cost to increase at inflation except for utilities where rates will increase and occupancy improvements will drive higher utilization, and sales and marketing where higher revenues will increase cost. We will also incur cost for the implementation of new sales and marketing initiatives. We expect property insurance to increase at inflation and property taxes to rise in excess of inflation. As a result, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins for the year to decrease 50 basis points at the high-end of the RevPAR range and decrease 125 basis points at the low end of the range. 
I previously mentioned the impact of cancellation and attrition fees on the first quarter of 2010 results. For all of 2010, cancellation and attrition fees will be significantly lower than 2009. Adjusting 2009 to a typical year of cancellations would result in an improvement of the above margin guidance of 70 basis points. With respect to our balance sheet, we finished the quarter with over $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and a full $600 million of capacity on our line of credit. In the quarter, we redeemed the remaining $346 million of 7% Series M senior notes due in August 2012 and repaid $124 million mortgage on the Atlanta Marriott Marquis where the interest rate on the loan was set to increase 200 basis points to 9.4%. As a result of these repayments, we reduced our outstanding debt by $470 million to approximately $5.4 billion and we currently have 99 assets unencumbered by mortgage debt. Holders of our $325 million in Exchangeable Senior Debentures had the right to put the securities to us on April 15 of this year. None of the securities were put to us and the next put date for holders is April 15, 2014. 
This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have."

As I said in my comments, we expect a very strong second quarter overall mainly due to really strong Corporate and Special Corporate Transient business. One of the things that I would point out that I know has been causing some questions around our results this quarter, is to remind folks is that as I said in my comments, all of our non-Marriott hotels, so that is Starwood, Hyatt, Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons, are all on a monthly reporting system. And for Host, just because of the way we time our quarters, we don't capture the March results for any of those monthly hotels in our numbers. New York, in my recollection in general from New York, is that it did better sequentially through the first quarter. We are missing the March results from both the W on Lexington Avenue as well as the Big Sheraton near Times Square. So my guess is that if those results were added in -- I don't know that number off the top of my head, but my guess is if those results were added in,you’d see a little better performance in New York for the first quarter."

It lost money last year. I think it might have been right on the margin in 2008 in terms of whether it made or lost money. So unfortunately, we've been facing some big challenges in that market, not surprisingly, given the challenges that the auto industry has faced. We have postponed a fair amount of CapEx with that hotel because we've been trying to sort out the right resolution for it, while there is then I think an effective way to invest a certain amount of capital dollars in the hotel, we've concluded that it would be better off being -- selling the hotel at this point than pursuing that path.

Where we've invested in this asset and given the underlying leverage compared to what we think the value is, we're comfortable that just as a debt investment we will likely exceed those leverage return targets. The strategy for what happens with the investment will in part be based upon how the economy improves, obviously in Europe, and as it relates to these individual assets. We would be very comfortable if this just continues to be a performing loan and that we get paid off in due course, which based on the terms of the loan document, will generally come due no later than about 2.5 years from where we are right now. On the other hand, we obviously are very comfortable being an investor in Europe and if the properties performance does not improve enough for us to be paid off, we would be comfortable being an owner."

And again, as I mentioned in my comments, it's still not a flood of opportunities although our pipeline is clearly larger than it was 50, even 65, 70 days ago. I'd say that the opportunities are sort of splitting into two camps. There's one group of opportunities that are happening because pricing has been recovering, and I think you're seeing fairly low cap rates and fairly high EBITDA multiples, reflecting both the outlook for the future as well as the fact that we are at drop EBITDA levels. So with the recovery in pricing, you are seeing certain sellers who face debt maturities in the near-term who are thinking that perhaps it's worthwhile testing the market to see if there is an opportunity to sell an asset today, and at least recover some of their initial investment. I think there's another group of sellers, again it’s a relatively small group, but there's another group of sellers who are evaluating their business now, who are maybe more confident about investing in their own business but might be looking to liquidate certain of the assets that they have in order to then reuse those proceeds in a different direction within their individual business. I sort of describe that a little bit as a strategic seller because that type of a seller is really doing this because it’s a strategic aspect of their business as opposed to because they necessarily think that this is when they’re going to get the maximum price for an asset. I suspect that we will see more activity in both of these camps as we work our way through the year, but as you can tell by the volume of transaction activity that's been reported, in each instance the volume is still relatively light but we are relatively encouraged by at least the trend that we are seeing there and the number of conversations that we’re having."

Certainly within the realm of the guidance that we provided, we're really not anticipating that it happens until the end of the year. And I think it's a little touch-and-go on whether or not we actually get the true rate growth for a full quarter by the end of the year. Probably at the high-end of our guidance, there's a shot at that. On the margin front, I think you -- our estimate is that we are looking at a 50 basis point decline tied to a 4% overall full year RevPAR growth rate. Again, my guess is that the margin and the -- because margin growth is going to be tied to both overall level of RevPAR increase as well as, to some degree, whether that is happening because of rate or because of occupancy, if there's an opportunity for positive margins it’s certainly near the end of the year."

Going forward, ultimately margin growth ties to the relationship between revenue growth, which is of course more than just RevPAR growth, and inflation. So if we continue to see inflation stay at a fairly low level, plus or minus 2%, then I would expect that we would be able to see margin growth in '11 and '12 at below 4% RevPAR level. Now I suspect that if the recovery continues, that won't be a problem because we're going to be seeing stronger levels of RevPAR increase than that. But I think you could see margin growth at less than 4%.  As we've commented in the past, the transition here when one goes from having been in free fall to starting to see RevPAR recovery and business recovery is always a tricky year for margins, while I would say there was tremendous strides made at all of our properties at taking out cost. There clearly are some costs that came out of our operations that are not sustainable, and so typically in that first eight to 12 months of RevPAR recovery, some of those costs trickle back in, which usually leads to the first year of positive RevPAR growth having less than impressive margins. But normally, especially if we’re doing our job on the asset management side, once you get past that initial kind of recovery of some expenses,you get back into a more traditional relationship. And as long as RevPAR and revenue growth are outpacing inflation, we should see margin growth."

Pricing has certainly recovered more quickly than some folks had anticipated, and as operations begin to improve, one can get more comfortable with selling some of the assets that we don't expect to be owning in 2014 or 2015 a bit sooner. We are in the process right now of evaluating the portfolio and looking at a number of assets to determine if it is better to sell those assets now and take advantage of a fair amount of capital that's not able to be deployed, or whether we’re able to – whether we would be better off waiting for the NOI to recover a bit more and then put those properties on the market. That's one of the reasons why we made the statement that, while we're not putting any more sales – or not contemplating specific sales in the context of our guidance, we are intending to market a few properties and we'll sort of see how that plays out. But what I would say on that is because of the amount of capital we have, we do not need to effect a sale for liquidity reasons. So we will be very, very price sensitive in any of those marketing opportunities. If we're not hitting the number that we want, we will not be a seller because the only reason to do it is the one that you’ve outlined, to take advantage of a strong market and sell some assets that, while they are non-core for us, could clearly be a good acquisition for somebody else."

I think that’s the tricky part when you're in this sort of a transition. As we clearly saw tremendous occupancy growth in the first quarter and that was unfortunately offset by rate declines, we work our way through the quarter, though we’ve probably been expecting to see the occupancy run at a fairly heavy rate but the question is going to be how quickly can we eliminate negative rate and move into positive rate. Let me give you a couple of other insights around why we got more optimistic relative to RevPAR for the rest of the year. The big drive for us was what was happening on the transient side. As I mentioned, we were up 12% in overall transient demand. We are practically, for the first quarter at least, back to where we were in 2007. But the biggest key for us was the fact that when you combine corporate and special corporate business, we were up 15% in room nights. Now, while we were still down in rate in those segments, the fact that that demand was coming back was pretty key for us because we had not really seen that happen even in the fourth quarter of last year. And hence when that start to occur, that's a great sign for the fact that the business is going to rebuild. And I think the other piece of it is, that as you look at what was happening on the group side, we started out the quarter at the deficit for both the full year and for the quarter. We very quickly closed that deficit in the first quarter and ended up positive in room nights. A lot of that was because on the association events people showed up, and in fact we started to run into situations where more people showed up than we had rooms available. And even on the corporate side, we started to find that our booking pace was accelerating beyond what we had expected. So as we look at the activity for the second and third quarter, it’s very solid. There is still a little bit of weakness in the fourth quarter but we are up for the full year in terms of group booking pace now, which we haven't been able to say for quite some time. And I think we felt that because that's such an important component of our business and because when you go back and look at where we were compared to '07, we had really lost the most in terms of group room nights compared to the other segments in our business, the fact that that was beginning to recover, led us to look much more optimistically at the rest of the year."

At the end of the day, I think I'd reiterate what I said the last quarter when there was a little bit of a gap between where we were and where both of them were, which is that there's really no reason, given that I would agree with your point that we own some of their best hotels and we typically perform pretty much in line with them, there's no reason in our mind why we would underperform either of them.

What we are hearing from our GMs at this point is that holding at 800, it may be coming in higher than that in some cases. The key for us on that is to really understand that and start to build that into our revenue expectations. Because as we begin to get more confident that those associations will not only fulfill their full block but actually begin to exceed it, that allows us to begin to do some nickshift by cutting off some of the cheaper channels that we might have available, and save rooms either for that higher-priced group or simply make certain we save enough rooms in certain markets where we’re only selling rooms to that higher-priced corporate customer as opposed to that lower-priced discount customer."

Let me try to approach it in a slightly different way. If you look at what was happening on net booking pace for the first quarter, we generally found that in the first quarter itself our net bookings were up by over 100% compared to where we were in '09. And those bookings actually exceeded the pace that we had in 2007 which we tend to use as sort as a stabilized year by more than 25%. If you look at how it played out for the quarter, we started off down about 6% and ended up slightly. So you can see that the fact that we booked so many more rooms in the quarter than we traditionally have done, allowed us to close the gap in a way that we probably wouldn't have in the past.  On a full-year basis, you're finding that more -- the bookings are short-term, there still is not -- we haven't hit that magic moment that I can tell yet where somebody calls up, wants to do an event in four weeks and finds out that there's no room available at the inn.  So we haven't quite gotten to that point because of where our occupancy levels were. So you're finding that most of the success in the booking pace side is relatively short-term which is why our second quarter bookings are up almost over 250% compared to 2009. Now recognized there weren't a lot of short-term bookings happening at this time last year, but the reality is even the second quarter bookings when you go back and compare them to 2007 are slightly positive. So we would take that as a good sign, too. The net of it is that when we started off the year being negative in terms of overall room nights, we've closed that gap in a material way and in fact now even with adjusting those umber of nights booked to reflect what we thought was a cancellation that happened last year, because I think that gives you a cleaner sense of the data, instead of being down 6% we are now up 3% to 4%. So I think that obviously is a pretty good change in a relatively short period of time."

What we look at, we start with trying to understand what we think based on our projections is an unlevered rate of return from a particular asset. So in each instance what we're going to do with that is we’re going to make certain assumptions about what the performance is going to be this year and then we're going to assess what we think is likely to happen for that particular asset and that particular market. Over the next few years, and I think having kind of calculated in what we think the recovery is, we would probably stabilize it a longer term revenue and EBITDA or NOI growth rate and carry that out to ultimately get to a 10-year discounted cash flow. If you think about how that works, obviously markets that have fallen further but then are expected to rise faster are going to ultimately end up with lower cap rates today, but that's just reflecting the particular circumstances and their market. The other major element that we would look at is the one that you were referencing which is trying to understand where you are in a discount to replacement cost. I think one of the key factors in employing that in your analysis, is that to the extent that you are legitimately analyzing what your replacement cost is, if you're buying at a meaningful discount to replacement cost, well that in and of itself does not tell you that you're necessarily going to have a successful investment. It does give you a sense that it is harder on a relative basis if the discount is larger or a new competitor had come into your market simply because the cost to build that new competitor are probably not going to make sense in the context of the return on the investment until cash flow depreciated meaningfully. So discount to replacement costs becomes a good gut check for us on whether or not -- if you are underwriting a very aggressive recovery for an asset that you thought was at replacement cost, you probably have to ask yourself if you're really being fair about the likelihood of new supply in that market. So those would be the two primary things that we would look at. My guess is at the end of the day, I think most of our competitors are pretty sophisticated. They would each have their own take, but I suspect that they're looking at it in generally the same way."

The speed with which everything recovers this year will probably have played some role in looking at what happens in margins next year, and to the extent that we begin to see a stronger recovery. And so some of that cost increase that I'm expecting is going to happen, happens this year. It probably sets us up for a more normalized year in 2011 with respect to margin. When you step back and look at what would happen in 2011, if you were to have 5% RevPAR growth, I would be very disappointed if we didn't have some margin growth there. I am not anticipating that inflation is going to be particularly high next year and so assuming that, that plays out that way and that there is a reasonable gap between RevPAR/revenues and inflation, we should be in a situation where we should see some margin growth."

It all depends upon how active we can ultimately be on the acquisition side. We obviously have a fair amount of capital right now. As Larry mentioned in his comments, we got a pleasant surprise when the exchangeable that was puttable to us a couple weeks ago wasn't put, so that gives us an extra $325 million of capital that we weren't counting on. So we’ll take that into account in deciding what to do with the continuous equity program. At the end of the day, I think folks should assume that we are trying to add additional hotels to our portfolio and that we will ultimately draw on that capital in order to help fund that growth. In the long run, I would expect that we would have another continuous equity program. We do want to have – I think that's a very cost effective way to fund the equity portion of our balance sheet, but it's all going to be tied to exactly what level of growth we’re having and because if you don't have the growth then you don't necessarily need to issue the incremental equity."

After a challenging year in 2009, we are pleased to report that our first quarter operating results and trends were significantly better than we expected. As I will discuss in more detail, we experienced significant increases in transient demand and very encouraging trends on the group side of our business. While we still face challenges rebuilding our average rates, our recent operating results have turned positive on the top line and suggest that the industry is reaching an inflection point.
Turning to our results, first quarter RevPAR for our comparable hotel decreased by 2.3% driven by a decrease in average room rate of 8.7% which was offset by an increase in occupancy of 4.3% each quarter. For the quarter, our average rate was at $167 and our average occupancy was 65.5%. Our top line results improved on a relative basis each funds of the quarter and turned positive in March. As you may remember, due to the timing of our reporting period, our first quarter does not include the operating results for a significant portion of our portfolio for the month of March. Adjusting our results to reflect the inclusion of all of our assets for the calendar quarter, would result in a RevPAR decline of only 1%. 
Food and beverage revenues at our comparable hotels decreased 3.7% for the quarter and total revenue fell by 3.9%. While our managers continue to strive to control costs, the combination of increased occupancy, continued pressure on average rates and a meaningful reduction in attrition and cancellation fees, resulted in a decrease in comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin of 275 basis points for the quarter. First quarter adjusted EBITDA for Host was $126 million. FFO per diluted share for the quarter was $0.08, which included a reduction of $0.01 as a result of cost associated with the prepayment of debt and an accrual related to the potential of San Antonio litigation loss. Overall, we are very pleased that our adjusted EBITDA and FFO per share diluted results materially exceeded our expectations.
Turning to our business mix for the quarter, the demand trends that developed over the second half of 2009 accelerated in the first quarter of 2010 positively impacting our business mix on a wider scale. For the third straight quarter, we experienced year-over-year growth in our Transient business with an overall increase in Transient room nights of more than 12%. More importantly, this increase in demand was led by our Special Corporate business where room nights increased more than 28%, and our Premium and Corporate segments where room nights increased for the first time in nine quarters at a rate of nearly 9%. Special Corporate demand growth was especially strong in our Luxury properties which experienced a demand increase in that segment of more than 50%. While average rates in both of these corporate segments were still down by roughly 8%, these are solid indicators of improvements in corporate travel which is required for the industry to commence a true recovery. 
Overall, the positive shift in business mix in the Transient segment for the first time since the summer of 2008, held a decline in the overall average rates of 7.7%, which led to a Transient revenue increase of 3.6%. On the group side, frankly, we were pleasantly surprised by the pace of our short-term bookings during the quarter. At the beginning of the year, we faced a 4% shortfall in the first quarter, taking into account the record cancellations we experienced in the early months of 2009, and roughly a 6% shortfall for the entire year. At the end of the quarter, group demand improved by 0.5% for the quarter and our full-year bookings are now trending ahead of the prior year's pace. 
Volume improvements for the quarter came primarily from a 14% increase in Association room night and more than a 5% increase in discount business. While Corporate groups continue to be a challenge as demand decreased by 13% in the quarter, we saw a meaningful acceleration in Corporate group activity as companies began to rebook business. Interestingly, our Luxury Corporate group room nights actually increased more than 18% compared to the first quarter of last year, which suggest the companies are feeling somewhat less concerned about the potential political ramifications of booking business at higher-end property. Overall, group room rates declined 9% and, combined with the increase in demand of 0.5%, resulted in a decrease in group revenues of 8.6%. The rebounding Group business compared to expectations and Association business in particular, helped our big box hotels as they slightly outperformed the rest of the portfolio. 
Looking at the second quarter and the remainder of the year, our visibility continues to be fairly limited because of the short booking window. RevPAR growth for period four exceeded 5% continuing the recent trend of improving results. Group bookings continued to be strong as bookings in the first quarter for the second quarter have more than tripled when compared to last year and even slightly outpaced our 2007 level of activity. Transient bookings for the second quarter are also trending ahead of last year. Overall, improvement is still relying on the strength of the economy, but we are optimistic that businesses are beginning to loosen their travel budgets starting a recovery in lodging demand.
While the investment front, as I discussed with you last quarter, the combination of structural complexity and secure-type transactions and little pressure on banks to resolve troubled loans situations has resulted in a limited number of assets actually coming to market, however, we are seeing investment opportunities in the form of distressed loans. Earlier this month we purchased the junior traunches of a mortgage loan secured by a 1,900-room portfolio hotel in Europe. The par value of the traunches we purchased are approximately 64 million euros and we purchased the notes at a meaningful discount. While we cannot get into more specifics regarding this investment, the return we expect to generate on the notes meets or exceeds our return target for a levered investment. 
In terms of fee acquisition as the operating environment stabilizes and begins to improve, our pipeline of potential transactions has increased both domestically and internationally and we are well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities as they begin to arise. Our guidance continues to not reflect any benefits from property acquisitions even though we expect to complete at least some acquisitions during the second half of the year. 
During the first quarter, we sold a 370-room Sheraton Braintree hotel for $9 million. We also signed an agreement to sell the Ritz-Carlton in Dearborn. This asset is in one of the most challenging markets in the country, generates negative net operating income and has significant capital need. Since the transaction is not that closed, we do not provide any additional detail to the deal at this time. While we expect to market additional assets this year, we have not included any additional dispositions in our guidance.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter totaled approximately $50 million, which included $23 million of return on investment projects. During the first quarter, we completed the renovation of over 95,000 square feet of meeting space at the San Francisco Marriott Masconi Marquis, one of the preeminent group hotels in San Francisco. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, at our San Diego Marriott Hotel &Marina, we renovated the south tower rooms, and during the quarter we completed the construction of a new health club. These projects are part of the first phase of what is ultimately projected to be $190 million reinvention of this hotel. In addition to the complete renovation of the rooms, this project will provide significant upgrades to the pool, food and beverage and entry experiences. We are also in the process of planning a new 40,000-square-foot exhibit hall and a 40,000-square-foot ballroom, which will have use of both the nearby marina and the downtown area. Construction on that phase of the project is expected to commence in March of 2011. We are also adding a new 15,000-square-foot ballroom and a 5,000-square-foot to the Westin Kierland Resort & Spa in Phoenix as part of a broader meeting space renovation project. 
Given the strength of our balance sheet combined with currently low construction costs and the fact that occupancy levels are still below peak, we believe that the timing is ideal to accelerate the pace of some of our planned capital expenditure projects. As a result, we are increasing our expected capital expenditure estimate for the year to $300 million to $340 million, and we'll continue to evaluate other projects as we work through the year. 
Now let me spend some time on our outlook for 2010.  While we remain concerned that employment growth has lagged, consumer spending trends are still inconsistent and there are continuing risks to the financial system, it is clear that the broader economy is in recovery. Assuming that recovery continues, our better-than-expected first quarter results, combined with the improvement in our near-term booking phase and positive results in April, have led us to a more positive outlook for the remainder of the year. As a result, we are increasing our estimates for RevPAR for the year to an increase of 1% to 4% with a comparable adjusted margin decline of 125 basis points to 50 basis points. Based on these assumptions, full-year adjusted EBITDA would be approximately $750 million to $800 million and FFO per diluted share would be $0.58 to $0.65. 
In closing, we are certainly more optimistic than we were on our call last quarter. We are seeing signs of recovery in demand and we'll continue to work with our hotels and monitor our pricing strategies for improvement on the rate side. On the investment front, we know from experience that early-stage acquisitions tend to outperform so we will continue to aggressively look for investment opportunities both domestically and internationally. In addition, we will continue to develop reinvestment opportunities within our existing portfolio in order to take advantage of favorable costs and occupancy levels. We took significant steps last year to improve our balance sheet and we are well-prepared for opportunities as they arise. Thank you, and let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer."

Let me start by giving you some detail on comparable hotel RevPAR results. Looking at the portfolio based on property types, our airport hotels performed the best during the quarter, with a RevPAR decline of 0.9% as the hotels benefited for the poor weather in the Northeast that led to numerous flight cancellations and layovers. RevPAR for our urban hotels increased 1.7%, while RevPAR suburban and resort conference hotels fell 2.4% and 4.8%, respectively. Before I address individual market performance, I wanted to mention that half of our top 20 markets had positive RevPAR for the quarter. Our top-performing market was Philadelphia with a RevPAR increase of 12.3%. Strong Transient, Citywide and Group business contributed to and occupancy increase of nearly 9% and an ADR decline of 2.8%. For the second quarter, we expect the Philadelphia market to underperform the portfolio due to lower levels of both transient and group demand.
As expected, the Miami Fort Lauderdale market performed very well with a RevPAR increase of 10.3%. Occupancy was up 6.4% and the rate was up 1.7%. Yes, that's right. I said rate was up in the market. The outperformance was driven by growth in Transient and Group business generated by the Super Bowl and Pro Bowl, as well as the impact of the late 2009 ballroom addition at the Harbor Beach Marriott Resort & Spa. We expect the Miami Fort Lauderdale market to have a weaker second quarter but still have positive RevPAR. The San Antonio market also performed very well, with a RevPAR increase of 7.3%. A strong citywide calendar drove an increase in compression days leading to an increase in occupancy of 5.4% and limiting the rate decline to only 0.8%. We expect San Antonio to have a decent second quarter and a strong second half of the year. 
RevPAR for Boston increased 6.7% due to better transient and group demand. Occupancy was up 5.7% and ADR declined 5.1%. Some of the improvement was due to easier comparisons as the Boston Marriott Copley Place and Sheraton Boston were under renovation in the first quarter of 2009. We expect our Boston hotels to have a great second quarter with double-digit RevPAR growth due to strong citywide activity and improvement in transient demand. 
Orange County, a market that was extremely hard hit by the housing market meltdown, had RevPAR growth of 6.7% in the quarter. Transient demand across all segments showed signs of recovery. Occupancy was up 10.2% while ADR was down 7.9%. We expect the Orange County market to continue to perform well in the second quarter. 
We were also pleasantly surprised by the outperformance of New York City, where RevPAR increased 2.6% as occupancy grew by 7.7% and rate declined 7.7%. Business transient and shortening group bookings drove the improvement in demand. We expect New York City to have an outstanding second quarter due to high levels of business transient demand. 
RevPAR for our Chicago properties fell 11.2% due to significant decline in citywide activity which was partially offset by an increase in special corporate and discount business, albeit at a lower rate, as ADR fell 9.9%. The Swissotel, with its recent addition of 38,000 square feet of meeting space, substantially outperformed the market with a RevPAR decline of only 7.7%. We expect Chicago to perform much better in the second quarter and for the outperformance of the Swissotel to continue. 
Forward group demand and weak pricing across all segments affected RevPAR performance at both of our Hawaiian hotels resulting in a 14.1% decline in RevPAR, substantially all of which was due to a 13.5% drop in ADR. We expect the hotels to perform much better in the second quarter but we need to see further increases in airline capacity versus stay in recovery. 
RevPAR for our DC hotels declined 15.9% with a 2% decline in occupancy and a 13.4% drop in ADR. As expected, year-over-year comparisons for the market were difficult due to the 2009 presidential inauguration and related activity as well as record-breaking levels of snowfall in 2010, both of which were significantly affected Group and Transient business. Excluding DC from our concept for the first quarter, RevPAR would have only declined 0.6%. Our DC hotels had positive RevPAR in period three and we expect DC to have positive RevPAR in the second quarter. 
As expected, the San Diego market struggled due to a substantial decline in citywide demand and the absorption of the new Hilton that opened in 2009. RevPAR declined 16.9% with an occupancy decline of 3.5% and a 12.2% decline in ADR. A rooms renovation of the San Diego Marriott Hotel & Marina also negatively affected our performance. We expect the San Diego market to continue to struggle in the second quarter but improve in the second half of the year. 
For our European joint venture, RevPAR calculated in constant euros decreased 1.8% for the quarter. Occupancy increased 5.2% and ADR declined 10.7%. The Westin Europa and Regina in Venice, the Sheraton Skyline in London and the Sheraton Warsaw outperformed the rest of the portfolio. For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels declined 275 basis points. This performance was better than expected due to the challenges created by four items. The first item was a substantial impact of cancellation and attrition fees. In the first quarter of 2009, cancellation and attrition fees were over $12 million higher than the first quarter of 2010 accounting for 110 basis points of the overall margin decline. 
The second item was due to our RevPAR decline driven by a combination of an increase in occupancy and a drop in rate, which is a challenge from an operating profit perspective. However, we were still able to reduce overall rooms cost for occupied rooms to improvement in productivity and reductions in several controllable cost areas. 
The third challenge was the loss of high profit banquet and audiovisual revenues which declined 7.3%. However, food and beverage flow-through was quite good as our managers continued to refine and implement efficiencies in their staffing models. 
The fourth item was the treatment of the ground lease payments in the New York Marriott Marquis. As we discussed last year, in the first quarter of 2009, $3 million of our rent payment was applied to fully fund the deferred purchase price of the land. In the first quarter of 2010, our entire payment was treated as ground rent expense, which reduced EBITDA by $3 million. We have the ability from today through 2017 to buy the fee interest in the land under the hotel from an incremental payment of $19.9 million. Overall, wages and benefits decreased 1.3% or 8.2% on a per occupied room basis, and unallocated cost declined by 2.7% for the quarter as hotels reduced management headcount and lowered other controllable costs. Utility costs also decreased 8.4% through a combination of lower usage, lower rates and the impact of energy saving capital improvements. For the quarter, real estate taxes were flat. 
Looking out through the rest of the year, we expect occupancy to increase further, which will likely lead to growth in wage and benefit cost at inflation after taking into consideration the benefit from productivity gains. We expect unallocated cost to increase at inflation except for utilities where rates will increase and occupancy improvements will drive higher utilization, and sales and marketing where higher revenues will increase cost. We will also incur cost for the implementation of new sales and marketing initiatives. We expect property insurance to increase at inflation and property taxes to rise in excess of inflation. As a result, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins for the year to decrease 50 basis points at the high-end of the RevPAR range and decrease 125 basis points at the low end of the range. 
I previously mentioned the impact of cancellation and attrition fees on the first quarter of 2010 results. For all of 2010, cancellation and attrition fees will be significantly lower than 2009. Adjusting 2009 to a typical year of cancellations would result in an improvement of the above margin guidance of 70 basis points. With respect to our balance sheet, we finished the quarter with over $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and a full $600 million of capacity on our line of credit. In the quarter, we redeemed the remaining $346 million of 7% Series M senior notes due in August 2012 and repaid $124 million mortgage on the Atlanta Marriott Marquis where the interest rate on the loan was set to increase 200 basis points to 9.4%. As a result of these repayments, we reduced our outstanding debt by $470 million to approximately $5.4 billion and we currently have 99 assets unencumbered by mortgage debt. Holders of our $325 million in Exchangeable Senior Debentures had the right to put the securities to us on April 15 of this year. None of the securities were put to us and the next put date for holders is April 15, 2014. 
This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have."

One of the things that I would point out that I know has been causing some questions around our results this quarter, is to remind folks is that as I said in my comments, all of our non-Marriott hotels, so that is Starwood, Hyatt, Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons, are all on a monthly reporting system. And for Host, just because of the way we time our quarters, we don't capture the March results for any of those monthly hotels in our numbers. New York, in my recollection in general from New York, is that it did better sequentially through the first quarter. We are missing the March results from both the W on Lexington Avenue as well as the Big Sheraton near Times Square. So my guess is that if those results were added in -- I don't know that number off the top of my head, but my guess is if those results were added in,you’d see a little better performance in New York for the first quarter."

I would tell you that it is a relatively – in fact relatively is not the fair word, it’s a low price, but it is reflective of the fact that the asset, as I mentioned in my comment, is losing money this year. It lost money last year. I think it might have been right on the margin in 2008 in terms of whether it made or lost money. So unfortunately, we've been facing some big challenges in that market, not surprisingly, given the challenges that the auto industry has faced. We have postponed a fair amount of CapEx with that hotel because we've been trying to sort out the right resolution for it, while there is then I think an effective way to invest a certain amount of capital dollars in the hotel, we've concluded that it would be better off being -- selling the hotel at this point than pursuing that path. So it’s going to be a pretty low number and with any luck the transaction closes in the next 60 days, then we will be happy to tell everybody about it."

Where we've invested in this asset and given the underlying leverage compared to what we think the value is, we're comfortable that just as a debt investment we will likely exceed those leverage return targets. The strategy for what happens with the investment will in part be based upon how the economy improves, obviously in Europe, and as it relates to these individual assets. We would be very comfortable if this just continues to be a performing loan and that we get paid off in due course, which based on the terms of the loan document, will generally come due no later than about 2.5 years from where we are right now. On the other hand, we obviously are very comfortable being an investor in Europe and if the properties performance does not improve enough for us to be paid off, we would be comfortable being an owner."

And again, as I mentioned in my comments, it's still not a flood of opportunities although our pipeline is clearly larger than it was 50, even 65, 70 days ago. I'd say that the opportunities are sort of splitting into two camps. There's one group of opportunities that are happening because pricing has been recovering, and I think you're seeing fairly low cap rates and fairly high EBITDA multiples, reflecting both the outlook for the future as well as the fact that we are at drop EBITDA levels. So with the recovery in pricing, you are seeing certain sellers who face debt maturities in the near-term who are thinking that perhaps it's worthwhile testing the market to see if there is an opportunity to sell an asset today, and at least recover some of their initial investment. I think there's another group of sellers, again it’s a relatively small group, but there's another group of sellers who are evaluating their business now, who are maybe more confident about investing in their own business but might be looking to liquidate certain of the assets that they have in order to then reuse those proceeds in a different direction within their individual business. I sort of describe that a little bit as a strategic seller because that type of a seller is really doing this because it’s a strategic aspect of their business as opposed to because they necessarily think that this is when they’re going to get the maximum price for an asset. I suspect that we will see more activity in both of these camps as we work our way through the year, but as you can tell by the volume of transaction activity that's been reported, in each instance the volume is still relatively light but we are relatively encouraged by at least the trend that we are seeing there and the number of conversations that we’re having."

Again, my guess is that the margin and the -- because margin growth is going to be tied to both overall level of RevPAR increase as well as, to some degree, whether that is happening because of rate or because of occupancy, if there's an opportunity for positive margins it’s certainly near the end of the year."

Going forward, ultimately margin growth ties to the relationship between revenue growth, which is of course more than just RevPAR growth, and inflation. So if we continue to see inflation stay at a fairly low level, plus or minus 2%, then I would expect that we would be able to see margin growth in '11 and '12 at below 4% RevPAR level. Now I suspect that if the recovery continues, that won't be a problem because we're going to be seeing stronger levels of RevPAR increase than that. But I think you could see margin growth at less than 4%.  As we've commented in the past, the transition here when one goes from having been in free fall to starting to see RevPAR recovery and business recovery is always a tricky year for margins, while I would say there was tremendous strides made at all of our properties at taking out cost. There clearly are some costs that came out of our operations that are not sustainable, and so typically in that first eight to 12 months of RevPAR recovery, some of those costs trickle back in, which usually leads to the first year of positive RevPAR growth having less than impressive margins. But normally, especially if we’re doing our job on the asset management side, once you get past that initial kind of recovery of some expenses,you get back into a more traditional relationship.

Pricing has certainly recovered more quickly than some folks had anticipated, and as operations begin to improve, one can get more comfortable with selling some of the assets that we don't expect to be owning in 2014 or 2015 a bit sooner. We are in the process right now of evaluating the portfolio and looking at a number of assets to determine if it is better to sell those assets now and take advantage of a fair amount of capital that's not able to be deployed, or whether we’re able to – whether we would be better off waiting for the NOI to recover a bit more and then put those properties on the market. That's one of the reasons why we made the statement that, while we're not putting any more sales – or not contemplating specific sales in the context of our guidance, we are intending to market a few properties and we'll sort of see how that plays out. But what I would say on that is because of the amount of capital we have, we do not need to effect a sale for liquidity reasons. So we will be very, very price sensitive in any of those marketing opportunities. If we're not hitting the number that we want, we will not be a seller because the only reason to do it is the one that you’ve outlined, to take advantage of a strong market and sell some assets that, while they are non-core for us, could clearly be a good acquisition for somebody else."

I think that’s the tricky part when you're in this sort of a transition. As we clearly saw tremendous occupancy growth in the first quarter and that was unfortunately offset by rate declines, we work our way through the quarter, though we’ve probably been expecting to see the occupancy run at a fairly heavy rate but the question is going to be how quickly can we eliminate negative rate and move into positive rate. Let me give you a couple of other insights around why we got more optimistic relative to RevPAR for the rest of the year. The big drive for us was what was happening on the transient side. As I mentioned, we were up 12% in overall transient demand. We are practically, for the first quarter at least, back to where we were in 2007. But the biggest key for us was the fact that when you combine corporate and special corporate business, we were up 15% in room nights. Now, while we were still down in rate in those segments, the fact that that demand was coming back was pretty key for us because we had not really seen that happen even in the fourth quarter of last year. And hence when that start to occur, that's a great sign for the fact that the business is going to rebuild. And I think the other piece of it is, that as you look at what was happening on the group side, we started out the quarter at the deficit for both the full year and for the quarter. We very quickly closed that deficit in the first quarter and ended up positive in room nights. A lot of that was because on the association events people showed up, and in fact we started to run into situations where more people showed up than we had rooms available. And even on the corporate side, we started to find that our booking pace was accelerating beyond what we had expected. So as we look at the activity for the second and third quarter, it’s very solid. There is still a little bit of weakness in the fourth quarter but we are up for the full year in terms of group booking pace now, which we haven't been able to say for quite some time. And I think we felt that because that's such an important component of our business and because when you go back and look at where we were compared to '07, we had really lost the most in terms of group room nights compared to the other segments in our business, the fact that that was beginning to recover, led us to look much more optimistically at the rest of the year."

Whereas for them, they're much more sensitive just to the top line changes because the management fees don’t represent anywhere near as big a component in their earnings as EBITDA does for us.  At the end of the day, I think I'd reiterate what I said the last quarter when there was a little bit of a gap between where we were and where both of them were, which is that there's really no reason, given that I would agree with your point that we own some of their best hotels and we typically perform pretty much in line with them, there's no reason in our mind why we would underperform either of them. I think it’s just, obviously we are moving our expectations a fair amount from one quarter to the next and I think we'd rather -- we don't want to necessarily get ahead of ourselves.

I think what we are finding though is that the hotels are constantly in touch with the bigger groups to understand what their room nights are going to ultimately come out to be. And what they have been finding is that where a lot of times last year, we might have expected 800 rooms and by the time we got two weeks out we were starting to find that 800 was turning into 700 or 750. What we are hearing from our GMs at this point is that holding at 800, it may be coming in higher than that in some cases. The key for us on that is to really understand that and start to build that into our revenue expectations. Because as we begin to get more confident that those associations will not only fulfill their full block but actually begin to exceed it, that allows us to begin to do some nickshift by cutting off some of the cheaper channels that we might have available, and save rooms either for that higher-priced group or simply make certain we save enough rooms in certain markets where we’re only selling rooms to that higher-priced corporate customer as opposed to that lower-priced discount customer."

Let me try to approach it in a slightly different way. If you look at what was happening on net booking pace for the first quarter, we generally found that in the first quarter itself our net bookings were up by over 100% compared to where we were in '09. And those bookings actually exceeded the pace that we had in 2007 which we tend to use as sort as a stabilized year by more than 25%. If you look at how it played out for the quarter, we started off down about 6% and ended up slightly. So you can see that the fact that we booked so many more rooms in the quarter than we traditionally have done, allowed us to close the gap in a way that we probably wouldn't have in the past.  On a full-year basis, you're finding that more -- the bookings are short-term, there still is not -- we haven't hit that magic moment that I can tell yet where somebody calls up, wants to do an event in four weeks and finds out that there's no room available at the inn.  So we haven't quite gotten to that point because of where our occupancy levels were. So you're finding that most of the success in the booking pace side is relatively short-term which is why our second quarter bookings are up almost over 250% compared to 2009. Now recognized there weren't a lot of short-term bookings happening at this time last year, but the reality is even the second quarter bookings when you go back and compare them to 2007 are slightly positive. So we would take that as a good sign, too. The net of it is that when we started off the year being negative in terms of overall room nights, we've closed that gap in a material way and in fact now even with adjusting those umber of nights booked to reflect what we thought was a cancellation that happened last year, because I think that gives you a cleaner sense of the data, instead of being down 6% we are now up 3% to 4%. So I think that obviously is a pretty good change in a relatively short period of time."

What we look at, we start with trying to understand what we think based on our projections is an unlevered rate of return from a particular asset. So in each instance what we're going to do with that is we’re going to make certain assumptions about what the performance is going to be this year and then we're going to assess what we think is likely to happen for that particular asset and that particular market. Over the next few years, and I think having kind of calculated in what we think the recovery is, we would probably stabilize it a longer term revenue and EBITDA or NOI growth rate and carry that out to ultimately get to a 10-year discounted cash flow. If you think about how that works, obviously markets that have fallen further but then are expected to rise faster are going to ultimately end up with lower cap rates today, but that's just reflecting the particular circumstances and their market. The other major element that we would look at is the one that you were referencing which is trying to understand where you are in a discount to replacement cost. I think one of the key factors in employing that in your analysis, is that to the extent that you are legitimately analyzing what your replacement cost is, if you're buying at a meaningful discount to replacement cost, well that in and of itself does not tell you that you're necessarily going to have a successful investment. It does give you a sense that it is harder on a relative basis if the discount is larger or a new competitor had come into your market simply because the cost to build that new competitor are probably not going to make sense in the context of the return on the investment until cash flow depreciated meaningfully. So discount to replacement costs becomes a good gut check for us on whether or not -- if you are underwriting a very aggressive recovery for an asset that you thought was at replacement cost, you probably have to ask yourself if you're really being fair about the likelihood of new supply in that market. So those would be the two primary things that we would look at. My guess is at the end of the day, I think most of our competitors are pretty sophisticated. They would each have their own take, but I suspect that they're looking at it in generally the same way."

And so some of that cost increase that I'm expecting is going to happen, happens this year. It probably sets us up for a more normalized year in 2011 with respect to margin.

It all depends upon how active we can ultimately be on the acquisition side. We obviously have a fair amount of capital right now.

We do want to have – I think that's a very cost effective way to fund the equity portion of our balance sheet, but it's all going to be tied to exactly what level of growth we’re having and because if you don't have the growth then you don't necessarily need to issue the incremental equity."

After a challenging year in 2009, we are pleased to report that our first quarter operating results and trends were significantly better than we expected. As I will discuss in more detail, we experienced significant increases in transient demand and very encouraging trends on the group side of our business. While we still face challenges rebuilding our average rates, our recent operating results have returned positive on the top line and suggest that the industry is reaching an inflection point.
Turning to our results, first quarter RevPAR for our comparable hotels decreased by 2.3% driven by a decrease in average room rate of 8.7%, which was offset by an increase in occupancy of 4.3 percentage points. For the quarter our average rate was at $167 and our average occupancy was 65.5%. Our top line results improved on a relative basis each month of the quarter and turned positive in March. As you may remember, due to the timing of our reporting period, our first quarter does not include the operating results for a significant portion of our portfolio for the month of March. 
Adjusting our results to reflect the inclusion of all of our assets for the calendar quarter would result in a RevPAR decline of only 1%. Food and beverage revenues at our comparable hotels decreased 3.7% for the quarter and total revenues fell by 3.9%. While our managers continue to strive to control cost, the combination of increased occupancy, continued pressure on average rate, and a meaningful reduction in attrition and cancellation fee resulted in a decrease in comparable hotel-adjusted operating profit margin of 275 basis points for the quarter. 
First quarter adjusted EBITDA for Host was a $126 million. FFO per diluted share for the quarter was $0.08, which included a reduction of $0.01 as a result of cost associated with the prepayment of debt and an accrual related to the potential San Antonio litigation loss. Overall, we are very pleased that our adjusted EBITDA and FFO per share diluted results materially exceeded our expectation.
Turning to our business mix for the quarter, the demand trends that developed over the second half of 2009 accelerated in the first quarter of 2010 positively impacting our business mix on a wider scale. For the third straight quarter, we experienced year-over-year growth in our transient business with an overall increase in transient room nights of more than 12%. More importantly this increase in demand was led by our special corporate business where room nights increased more than 28% and our premium and corporate segments where room nights increased for the first time in nine quarters at a rate of nearly 9%. 
Special corporate demand growth was especially strong in our luxury properties, which experienced a demand increase in that segment of more than 50%. While average rates in both of these corporate segments were still down by roughly 8%, these are solid indicators of improvements in corporate travel, which is required for the industry to commence a true recovery. Overall, the positive shift in business mix in the transient segment for the first time since the summer of 2008 held the decline in the overall average rates to 7.7%, which led to a transient revenue increase of 3.6%.
On the group side, frankly, we were pleasantly surprised by the pace of our short-term bookings during the quarter. At the beginning of the year, we faced a 4% shortfall in the first quarter taking into account the record cancellations we experienced in the early months of 2009 and roughly a 6% shortfall for the entire year. At the end of the quarter, group demand improved by 0.5% for the quarter and our full-year bookings are now trending ahead of the prior year's pace. 
Volume improvements for the quarter came primarily from a 14% increase in association room nights and more than a 5% increase in discount business. While corporate groups continue to be a challenge as demand decreased by 13% in the quarter, we saw a meaningful acceleration in corporate group activity as companies began to rebook business. Interestingly our luxury corporate group room nights actually increased more than 18% compared to the first quarter of last year, which suggests the companies are feeling somewhat less concerned about the potential political ramifications of booking business at higher-end properties.
Overall, group room rates declined 9% and combined with the increase in demand of a 0.5% resulted in a decreasing group revenue of 8.6%. The rebound in group business compared to expectations and association business in particular, helped our big box hotels as they slightly outperformed the rest of the portfolio. Looking at the second quarter and the remainder of the year, our visibility continues to be fairly limited because of the short booking window. 
RevPAR growth for period four exceeded 5% continuing the recent trend of improving results. Group bookings continue to be strong as bookings in the first quarter for the second quarter have more than tripled when compared to last year and even slightly outpaced our 2007 level of activity. Transient bookings for the second quarter are also trending ahead of last year. Overall improvement is still reliant on the strength of the economy, but we are optimistic that the businesses are beginning to loosen their travel budget, starting a recovery in lodging demand.
On the investment front as I discussed with you last quarter, the combination of structural complexity in secured type transactions and little pressure on banks to resolve troubled loans situations has resulted in a limited number of assets actually coming to market. However, we are seeing investment opportunities in the form of stressed loans. Earlier this month we purchased the junior tranches of a mortgage loan secured by a 1,900 room portfolio of hotels in Europe. The par value of the tranches we purchased are approximately 64 million euro, and we purchased the notes at a meaningful discount. While I cannot get into more specifics regarding this investment, the return we expect to generate on the note meets or exceeds our return target for a levered investment.
In terms of fee acquisitions, as the operating environment stabilizes and begins to improve, our pipeline of potential transactions has increased both domestically and internationally, and we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities as they begin to arrive. Our guidance continues to not reflect any benefits from property acquisitions even though we expect to complete at least some acquisitions during the second half of the year. During the first quarter we sold the 370-room Sheraton Braintree hotel for $9 million. We also signed an agreement to sell the Ritz Carlton in Dearborn. This asset is in one of the most challenging markets in the country, generates negative net operating income, and has significant capital needs. Since the transaction is not yet closed, we cannot provide any additional details of the deal at this time. While we expect to market additional assets this year, we have not included any additional dispositions in our guidance.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter totaled approximately $50 million, which included $23 million of return on investment projects. During the first quarter, we completed the renovation of over 95,000 square feet of meeting space at the San Francisco, Moscone Marriott Marquis, one of the preeminent group hotels in San Francisco. Subsequent to the end of the quarter at our San Diego Marriott Hotel and Marina we renovated the South Tower rooms, and during the quarter we completed the construction of a new health club. These projects are part of the first phase of what is ultimately projected to be $190 million reinvention of this hotel. 
In addition to the complete renovation of the rooms, this project will provide significant upgrades to the pool, food and beverage, and entree experiences. We are also in the process of planning a new 40,000 square foot exhibit hall and a 40,000 square foot ballroom, which will have views of both the nearby Marina and the Downtown area. Construction on that phase of the project is expected to commence in March of 2011. 
We are also adding a new 15,000 square foot ballroom and a 5,000 square foot terrace to the Westin Kierland Resort and Spa in Phoenix as part of a broader meeting space renovation project. Given the strength of our balance sheet combined with the currently low construction costs, and the fact that occupancy levels are still below peak, we believe that the timing is ideal to accelerate the pace of some of our planned capital expenditure projects. As a result, we are increasing our expected capital expenditure estimate for the year to $300 million to $340 million and we'll continue to evaluate other projects as we work through the year.
Now, let me spend some time on our outlook for 2010. While we remain concerned that employment growth has lagged, consumer spending trends are still inconsistent, and there are continuing risks to the financial system, it is clear that the broader economy is in recovery. Assuming that recovery continues, our better-than-expected first quarter results combined with the improvement in our near term booking pace and positive results in April have led us to a more positive outlook for the remainder of the year. As a result, we are increasing our estimates for RevPAR for the year to an increase of 1% to 4% with a comparable adjusted margin decline of a 125 basis points to 50 basis points. Based on these assumptions, full year adjusted EBITDA would be approximately $750 million to $800 million and FFO per diluted share would be $0.58 to $0.65.
In closing, we are certainly more optimistic than we were on our call last quarter. We are seeing signs of recovery in demand, and we'll continue to work with our hotels and monitor our pricing strategies for improvement on the rate side.
On the investment front, we know from experience that early stage acquisitions tend to outperform. So, we will continue to aggressively look for investment opportunities both domestically and internationally. In addition, we will continue to develop reinvestment opportunities within our existing portfolio in order to take advantage of favorable cost and occupancy levels. We took significant steps last year to improve our balance sheet and we are well prepared for opportunities as they arrive.
Thank you and let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer.

Looking at the portfolio, based on property types, our airport hotels performed the best during the quarter with a RevPAR decline of 0.9% as the hotels benefited",1543,"Thank you, Ed. Let me start by giving you some detail on our comparable hotel RevPAR results. Looking at the portfolio, based on property types, our airport hotels performed the best during the quarter with a RevPAR decline of 0.9% as the hotels benefited from the poor weather in the Northeast that led to numerous flight cancellations and layovers. RevPAR for our urban hotels increased 1.7%, while RevPAR at suburban and resort conference hotels fell 2.4% and 4.8% respectively. Before I address individual market performance, I wanted to mention that half of our top 20 markets had positive RevPAR for the quarter. Our top performing market was Philadelphia with a RevPAR increase of 12.3%. Strong transient, city-wide, and group business contributed to an occupancy increase of nearly nine percentage points, and an ADR decline of 2.8%.
For the second quarter, we expect the Philadelphia market to underperform the portfolio due to lower levels of both transient and group demand. As expected the Miami/Fort Lauderdale market performed very well with a RevPAR increase of 10.3%. Occupancy was up 6.4 percentage points, and the rate was up 1.7%. Yes, that's right; I said rate was up in the market. The outperformance was driven by growth in transient and group business generated by the Super Bowl and Pro Bowl as well as the impact of the late 2009 ballroom addition at the Harbor Beach Marriott Resort and Spa. We expect that Miami/Fort Lauderdale market to have a weaker second quarter, but still have positive RevPAR.
The San Antonio market also performed very well with a RevPAR increase of 7.3%. A strong city-wide calendar drove an increase in compression days leading to an increase in occupancy of 5.4 percentage points and limiting the rate decline to only 0.8%. We expect San Antonio to have a decent second quarter and a strong second half of the year.
RevPAR for Boston increased 6.7% due to better transient and group demand. Occupancy was up 5.7 percentage points, and ADR declined 5.1%. Some of the improvement was due to easier comparisons as the Boston Marriott Copley Place and Sheraton Boston were under renovation in the first quarter of 2009. We expect our Boston hotels to have a great second quarter with double-digit RevPAR growth due to strong city-wide activity and improvement in transient demand.
Orange County, a market that was extremely hard hit by the housing market meltdown, had RevPAR growth of 6.7% in the quarter. Transient demand across all segments showed signs of recovery. Occupancy was up 10.2 percentage points, while ADR was down 7.9%. We expect the Orange County market to continue to perform well in the second quarter.
We were also pleasantly surprised by the outperformance of New York City, where RevPAR increased 2.6% as occupancy grew by 7.7 percentage points, and the rate declined 7.7%. Business transient and short-leave group bookings drove the improvement in demand. We expect New York City to have an outstanding second quarter due to high levels business transient demand.
RevPAR for our Chicago properties fell 11.2%, due to significant decline in city-wide activity, which was partially offset by an increase in special corporate and discount business, albeit at a lower rate as ADR fell 9.9%. The Swissotel with its recent addition of 38,000 square feet of meeting space substantially outperformed the market with a RevPAR decline of only 7.7%. We expect Chicago to perform much better in the second quarter, and for the outperformance of the Swissotel to continue.
Poor group demand and weak pricing across all segments affected RevPAR performance at both of our Hawaiian hotels, resulting in a 14.1% decline in RevPAR, substantially all of which was due to a 13.5% drop in ADR. We expect the hotels to perform much better in the second quarter, but we need to see further increases in airline capacity versus stay in recovery.
RevPAR for our DC hotels declined 15.9% with a 2 percentage point decline in occupancy, and a 13.4% drop in ADR. As expected, year-over-year comparisons for the market were difficult due to the 2009 presidential inauguration and related activities as well as record breaking levels of snowfall in 2010, both of which were significantly affected group and transient business. Excluding DC from our comp set for the first quarter, RevPAR would have only declined 0.6%. Our DC hotels had positive RevPAR in period three and we expect DC to have a positive RevPAR in the second quarter.
As expected the San Diego market struggled due to a substantial decline in city-wide demand and the absorption of the new Hilton that opened in 2009. RevPAR declined 16.9% with an occupancy decline of 3.5 percentage points and 12.2% decline in ADR. Room renovations at the San Diego Marriott Hotel & Marina also negatively affected our performance. We expect the San Diego market to continue to struggle in the second quarter, but improve in the second half of the year.
For our European joint venture RevPAR calculated in constant euros decreased 1.8% for the quarter. Occupancy increased 5.2 percentage points and ADR declined 10.7%. The Westin Europa & Regina in Venice, the Sheraton Skyline in London, and the Sheraton Warsaw outperformed the rest of the portfolio. For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels declined 275 basis points. This performance was better than expected due to the challenges created by four items.
The first item was the substantial impact of cancellation and attrition fees. In the first quarter of 2009 cancellation and attrition fees were over $12 million higher in the first quarter of 2010, accounting for 110 basis points of the overall margin decline. The second item was due to our RevPAR decline driven by a combination of an increase in occupancy and a drop in rate, which is the challenge from an operating profit perspective. However we were still able to reduce overall rooms cost per occupied room through improvements in productivity and reductions in several controllable cost areas.
The third challenge was the loss of high profit banquet and audio-visual revenues, which declined 7.3%. However, food and beverage flow through was quite good as our managers continue to refine and implement efficiencies in their staffing models. The fourth item was a treatment of the ground lease payments on the New York Marriott Marquee.
As we discussed last year, in the first quarter of 2009, $3 million of our rent payment was applied to fully fund the deferred purchase price of the land. In the first quarter of 2010, our entire payment was treated as ground rent expense, which reduced EBITDA by $3 million. We have the ability from today through 2017 to buy the fee interest in the land under the hotel for an incremental payment of $19.9 million.
Overall wages and benefits decreased 1.3%, or 8.2% on a per occupied room basis, and unallocated cost declined by 2.7% for the quarter, as hotels reduced management headcount and lowered other controllable costs. Utility cost also decreased 8.4% through a combination of lower usage, lower rates, and the impact of energy saving capital improvements.
For the quarter, real estate taxes were flat. Looking out to the rest of the year we expect occupancy to increase further, which will likely lead to growth in wage and benefit costs at inflation after taking into consideration the benefit from productivity gains. We expect unallocated cost to increase at inflation, except for utilities, where rates will increase and occupancy improvements will drive higher utilization in sales and marketing, where higher revenues will increase cost.
We will also incur cost for the implementation of new sales and marketing initiatives. We expect property insurance to increase at inflation, and property taxes to rise in excess of inflation. As a result, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins for the year to decrease 50 basis points at the high end of the RevPAR range and decreased 125 basis points at the low end of the range.
I previously mentioned the impact of cancellation and attrition fees in the first quarter of 2010 results. For all of 2010 cancellation and attrition fees will be significantly lower than 2009. Adjusting 2009 to a typical year of cancellations would result in an improvement in the above margin guidance of 70 basis points. With respect to our balance sheet, we finish the quarter with over $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and the full $600 million of capacity on our line of credit. In the quarter, we redeem the remaining $346 million of 7% series M serial notes due in August of 2012, and repay the $124 million mortgage on the Atlanta Marriott Marquis, where the interest rate on the loan was set to increase 200 basis points to 9.4%. As a result of these repayments we reduced our outstanding debt by $470 million to approximately $5.4 billion, and we currently have 99 assets unencumbered by mortgage debt.
Orders of our $325 million in exchangeable senior debentures has a right to put the securities to us on April 15, of this year none of the securities will put to us, and the next put date for holder is April 15, 2014. This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have.

I would tell you that it is a relatively, no, in fact, relatively is not the fair word. It's a low priced. But it is reflective of the fact that the asset, as I mentioned in my comments, is losing money this year. It lost money last year. I think it might have been right on the margin in 2008 in terms of whether it made or lost money. So, unfortunately, we've been facing some big challenges in that market, not surprisingly given the challenges that the auto industry has faced. 
We have postponed a fair amount of CapEx of that hotel because we've been trying to sort out the right resolution for it. While there isn't I think an effective way to invest a certain amount of capital dollars in the hotel, we've concluded that it would be better off being selling the hotel at this point than pursuing that path. So, it's going to be a pretty low number and with any luck the transaction closes in the next 60 days, and then we'll be happy to tell everybody about it.

The strategy for what happens with the investment will in part be based upon how the economy improves, obviously in Europe, and as it relates to these individual assets. We would be very comfortable if this just continues to be a performing loan and that we get paid off in due course which based on the terms of loan documents would generally come due no later than about 2.5 years from where we are right now. On the other hand, we obviously are very comfortable being an investor in Europe, and if property's performance does not improve enough for us to be paid-off, we would be comfortable being an owner.

What I would break, what we are seeing out, and again as I've mentioned in my comment. It's still not a flood of opportunities, although our pipeline is clearly larger than it was just even 65, 70 days ago. I'd say that the opportunities, they're sort of splitting into two camps. There is one group of opportunities that are happening because pricing has been recovering. 
And I think, you're seeing fairly low cap rates and fairly high EBITDA multiples, reflecting both the outlook for the future as well as the fact that we're in trough EBITDA level. But with the recovery in pricing, you are seeing certain sellers who face debt maturities in the near term, who are thinking that perhaps it's worthwhile testing the market to see if there is an opportunity to sell an asset today, and at least recover some of their initial investment. I think, there's another group of seller, again, a relatively small group, but there's another group of sellers who are evaluating their business now or maybe more confident about investing in their own business, but might be looking to liquidate certain of the assets that they have in order to then reuse such proceeds in a different direction within their individual business. 
I sort of described that a little bit as a strategic seller, because that type of a seller is really doing this because of strategic aspect of their business as opposed because they necessarily think that this going to get the maximum price for asset. I suspect that we will see more activity in both of these camps as we work our way through the year, but as you could tell by the volume of transaction activity that's been reported, and in each instance the volume is still relatively light, but we are relatively encouraged by at least the trend that we're seeing there and the number of conversations that we're having.

What I would say to you is, as you well know, is that the recovery in rate is going to happen on a market-by-market basis, and some of the markets that Larry talked about, but I think we've got a chance to seeing some rate growth relatively quickly would include some of the big East Coast markets like Boston, New York and DC. I think, New Orleans surprisingly, its having a pretty good year and we expect to see some rate growth there. Miami in part because of the burst around Super Bowl, but I also think in general we are seeing some strength in that market. So that's another market where we think it's likely that we'll see some rate growth in the relatively near term. 
Portfolio-wide, I would bet that it's probably at best the second half of the year, certainly within the realm of the guidance that we provided. We're really not anticipating that it happens until the end of the year. And I think it is a little touch and go on whether or not we actually get the true rate growth for a full quarter by the end of the year. It's probably at the high end of our guidance as a shot at that. 
On the margin front, I think, our estimate is that we're looking at a 50 basis point decline, tied to a 4% overall full year RevPAR growth rate. Again my guess is that because margin growth is going to be tied to both overall level of RevPAR increase, as well as to some degree whether that's happening because of rate or because of occupancy, if there is an opportunity for positive margins, it's certainly near the end of the year.

Going forward, ultimately margin growth look tied to the relationship between revenue growth, which is, of course, more than just RevPAR growth and inflation. So if we continue to see inflation stay at a fairly low level, plus or minus 2%, then I would expect that we would be able to see margin growth in '11 and '12 at the low of 4% RevPAR level. Now I suspect that if the recovery continues that won't be a problem, because we're going to be seeing stronger levels of RevPAR increase than that. But I think you could see margin growth at less than 4%. 
As we've commented in the past, the transition year when one goes from having been in freefall to starting to see in March, see RevPAR recovery and business recovery is always a tricky year for margins. Well, I would say there is tremendous stride made at all of our properties at taking out cost. There clearly are some costs that came out of our operation that are not sustainable. And so typically in that first, call it, eight to 12 months of RevPAR recovery, some of those costs trickle back in, which usually leads to the first year of positive RevPAR growth having less than impressive margins. But normally, especially, if we're doing our job on the asset management side, once you get passed that initial kind of recovery of some expenses, you get back into a more traditional relationship and as long as RevPAR revenue growth are outpacing inflation, we should see margin growth.

Pricing has certainly recovered more quickly than some folks had anticipated, and as operations begin to improve one can get more comfortable with selling some of the assets that we don't expect to be owning in 2014 or 2015 a bit sooner. We are in the process right now of evaluating the portfolio and looking at a number of assets to determine if it is better to sell those assets now and take advantage of fair amount of capital that's not able to be deployed or whether we would be better off waiting for the NOI to recover a bit more and then put those properties on the market. 
And that's one of the reasons why we made the statements that while we're not putting any more sales or not contemplating specific sales in the context of our guidance, we are intending to market a few properties, and we'll sort of see how that plays out. But what I would say on that is because of the amount of capital we have, we do not need to affect a sale for liquidity reasons. So we will be very, very price sensitive in any of those marketing opportunities. If we're not hitting the numbers that we want, we will not be a seller, because the only reason to do it is the one that you outlined, to take advantage of a strong market and sell some assets that whilst they are non-core for us could clearly be a good acquisition for somebody else.

I think that's the tricky part when you're in this sort of a transition, as we clearly saw tremendous occupancy growth in the first quarter and that was unfortunately offset by rate declines. We worked our way through the quarter, though. We probably will be expecting to see the occupancy run at a fairly heavy rate, but the question is going to be how quickly can we eliminate negative rate and move into positive rate. 
Let me give you a couple of other insights around why we got more optimistic relative to RevPAR for the rest of the year. A big driver for us was what was happening on the transient side. As I mentioned, we were up 12% in overall transient demand. We are practically for the first quarter, at least, back to where we were in 2007, but the biggest key for us was the fact that when you combine corporate and special corporate business, we were up 15% in room nights. 
Now while we were still down in rate in those segments, the fact is that demand was coming back was pretty key for us, because we had not really seen that happen even in the fourth quarter of last quarter. And hence when that starts to occur, that's a great sign for the fact that the business is going to rebuild. And I think the other piece of it is that as you look at what was happening on the group side, we started out the quarter at a deficit for both the full year and for the quarter. We very quickly closed that deficit in the first quarter and ended up positive in room nights. 
A lot of that was because on the association events people showed up and in fact we started to run into some situations where more people showed than we had rooms available. And even on the corporate side, we started to find that our booking pace was accelerating beyond what we had expected. So as we look at the activity for the second and third quarter is solid, there is still a little bit of weakness in the fourth quarter, but we're up for the full year in terms of group booking pace now, which we haven't been able to say for quite some time. And I think we felt that because that's such an important component of our business and because when you go back and look at where we were compared to '07, we had really lost the most in terms of group room nights compared to the other segments in our business. The fact that that was beginning to recover led us to look it much more optimistically the rest of the year.

Is it I guess I'll call it conservatism for the sake of conservatism or do you think that their expectations for the back half of the year are little more aggressive?

At the end of the day, I think, I'd reiterate what I said the last quarter when there was a little bit of a gap between where we were and where both of them were, which is that there's really no reason given that I would agree with your point that we own some of their best hotels and we typically perform pretty much in line with them. There's no reason in our mind why we would underperform either of them.

What we're hearing from our GMs at this point is that holding at 800 it may be coming in higher than that in some cases, the key for us on that is to really understand that and try to build that into our revenue expectations, because as we begin to get more confident that those associations will not only fulfill their full block but actually begin to exceed it, that allows us to begin to do some mix shift by cutting off some of the cheaper channels that we might have available and save rooms either for that higher priced group or simply may certainly save enough rooms in certain markets where we're only selling rooms to that higher priced corporate customer as opposed to that lower priced discount customer.

Let me try to approach it a slightly different way. If you look at what was happening on net booking pace in for the first quarter, we generally found that in the first quarter itself our net bookings were up by over a",380,"Let's see. We gave some data before. Let me try to approach it a slightly different way. If you look at what was happening on net booking pace in for the first quarter, we generally found that in the first quarter itself our net bookings were up by over a 100% compared to where we were in '09. And those bookings actually exceeded the pace that we had in 2007, which we tend to use as sort of stabilized here by more than 25%. 
If you look at how it's laid out for the quarter, we started off down about 6% and ended up slightly. So you can see that the fact that we booked so many more rooms in the quarter than we traditionally have done, allowed us to close the gap in a way that we probably wouldn't have in the past. On a full-year basis, you're finding that the bookings are short term. We haven't hit that magic moment that I can tell yet where somebody calls up, wants to do an event in four weeks and finds out that there is no room available at the end. So we haven't quite gotten to that point because of where our occupancy levels were. 
So you're finding that most of the successes on the booking pace side is relatively short term, which is why our second quarter bookings are up almost over 250% compared to 2009. Now, recognize there weren't a lot of short-term bookings happening at this time last year, but the reality is as even the second quarter bookings when you go back and compare them to 2007 are slightly positive. So we would take that as a good sign too. 
The net of it is that when we started off the year, being negative in terms of overall room nights, we've closed that gap in a material way and in fact now adjusting those number of nights booked to reflect what we thought were the cancellations that happened last year because I think that gives you a cleaner sense of data. Instead of being down I think 6%, we are now up call it 3% to 4%. So I think that obviously is a pretty good change in a relatively short period of time.

What we look at, we start with trying to understand what we think based on our projections is an unlevered rate of return from a particular asset. And so in each instance what we're going to do with that is we're going to make certain assumptions about what the performance is going to be this year and that we're going to assess what we think is likely to happen for that particular asset in that market over the next few years. And then I think having kind of calculated in what we think the recovery is, we would probably stabilize it a longer term revenue and EBITDA or NOI growth rates and carry that out to ultimately get to a 10-year discounted cash flow. 
If you think about how that works, obviously markets that have fallen further but then are expected to rise faster are going to ultimately end up with lower cap rates today but that's just reflecting the particular circumstances of their market. The other major element that we would look at it is the one that you're referencing, which is trying to understand where you are in a discount to replacement cost. I think one of the key factors in employing that in your analysis is that to the extent that you are legitimately analyzing what your replacement cost is, if you're buying at a meaningful discount to replacement cost, well that in and of itself does not tell you that you're necessarily going to have a successful investment. 
It does give you a sense that it is harder on a relative basis that the discount is larger for a new competitor to come into your market simply because the cost to build that new competitor are probably not going to make sense in the context of the return on the investments until cash flow has appreciated meaningfully. So discount to replacement cost becomes a good gut check for us on whether or not if you're underwriting a very aggressive recovery for an asset that you thought was at replacement cost, you probably have to ask yourself if you're really being fair about the likelihood of new supply in that market. So those would be the two primary things that we would look at. My guess is at the end of the day I think most of our competitors are pretty sophisticated. They would each have their own take, but I suspect that they are looking at it in generally the same way.

The speed with which everything recovers this year will probably have to play some role in looking at what happens in margins next year and to the extent that we began to see a stronger recovery and so some of that cost creep that I'm expecting is going to happen, happens this year it probably sets us up for a more normalized year in 2011 with respect to margins. 
When you step back and look at what would happen in 2011, if you were to have 5% RevPAR growth, I would be very disappointed if we didn't have some margin growth there. I'm not anticipating that inflation's going to be particularly high next year, and so assuming that that plays out that way and that there is a reasonable gap between RevPAR/revenues and inflation, we should be in a situation where we should see some margin growth.

After a challenging year in 2009, we are pleased to report that our first quarter operating results and trends were significantly better than we expected. As I will discuss in more detail, we experienced significant increases in transient demand and very encouraging trends on the group side of our business. While we still face challenges rebuilding our average rates, our recent operating results have turned positive on the top line and suggest that the industry is reaching an inflection point.
Turning to our results, first quarter RevPAR for our comparable hotel decreased by 2.3% driven by a decrease in average room rate of 8.7% which was offset by an increase in occupancy of 4.3% each quarter. For the quarter, our average rate was at $167 and our average occupancy was 65.5%. Our top line results improved on a relative basis each funds of the quarter and turned positive in March. As you may remember, due to the timing of our reporting period, our first quarter does not include the operating results for a significant portion of our portfolio for the month of March. Adjusting our results to reflect the inclusion of all of our assets for the calendar quarter would result in a RevPAR decline of only 1%. 
Food and beverage revenues at our comparable hotels decreased 3.7% for the quarter and total revenue fell by 3.9%. While our managers continue to strive to control costs, the combination of increased occupancy, continued pressure on average rates and a meaningful reduction in attrition and cancellation fees, resulted in a decrease in comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin of 275 basis points for the quarter. First quarter adjusted EBITDA for Host was $126 million. FFO per diluted share for the quarter was $0.08, which included a reduction of $0.01 as a result of cost associated with the prepayment of debt and an accrual related to the potential San Antonio litigation loss. Overall, we are very pleased that our adjusted EBITDA and FFO per share diluted results materially exceeded our expectations.
Turning to our business mix for the quarter, the demand trends that developed over the second half of 2009 accelerated in the first quarter of 2010, positively impacting our business mix on a wider scale. For the third straight quarter, we experienced year-over-year growth in our Transient business with an overall increase in Transient room nights of more than 12%. More importantly, this increase in demand was led by our Special Corporate business where room nights increased more than 28%, and our Premium and Corporate segments where room nights increased for the first time in nine quarters at a rate of nearly 9%. 
Special Corporate demand growth was especially strong in our Luxury properties which experienced a demand increase in that segment of more than 50%. While average rates in both of these corporate segments were still down by roughly 8%, these are solid indicators of improvements in corporate travel, which is required for the industry to commence a true recovery. Overall, the positive shift in business mix in the Transient segment for the first time since the summer of 2008, held the decline in the overall average rates of 7.7%, which led to a Transient revenue increase of 3.6%. 
On the group side, frankly, we were pleasantly surprised by the pace of our short-term bookings during the quarter. At the beginning of the year, we faced a 4% shortfall in the first quarter, taking into account the record cancellations we experienced in the early months of 2009, and roughly a 6% shortfall for the entire year. At the end of the quarter, group demand improved by 0.5% for the quarter and our full year bookings are now trending ahead of the prior year's pace. 
Volume improvements for the quarter came primarily from a 14% increase in association room night and more than a 5% increase in discount business. While Corporate groups continue to be a challenge as demand decreased by 13% in the quarter, we saw a meaningful acceleration in corporate group activity as companies began to rebook business. Interestingly, our luxury corporate group room night actually increased more than 18% compared to the first quarter of last year, which suggest the  companies are feeling somewhat less concerned about the potential political ramifications of booking business at higher-end property. 
Overall, group room rates declined 9% and, combined with the increase in demand of 0.5%, resulted in a decrease in group revenues of 8.6%. The rebounding Group business compared to expectations and Association business in particular, helped our big box hotels as they slightly outperformed the rest of the portfolio. 
Looking at the second quarter and the remainder of the year, our visibility continues to be fairly limited because of the short booking window. RevPAR growth for period four exceeded 5%, continuing the recent trend of improving results. Group bookings continue to be strong as bookings in the first quarter for the second quarter have more than tripled when compared to last year and even slightly outpaced our 2007 level of activity. Transient bookings for the second quarter are also trending ahead of last year. Overall, improvement is still relying on the strength of the economy, but we are optimistic that businesses are beginning to loosen their travel budgets spurring a recovery in lodging demand.
On the investment front, as I discussed with you last quarter, the combination of structural complexity and secure-type transactions and little pressure on banks to resolve troubled loans situations has resulted in a limited number of assets actually coming to market. However, we are seeing investment opportunities in the form of distressed loans. Earlier this month, we purchased the junior tranches of a mortgage loan secured by a 1,900-room portfolio of hotels in Europe. The par value of the tranches we purchased are approximately EUR 64 million and we purchased the notes at a meaningful discount. While we cannot get into more specifics regarding this investment, the return we expect to generate on the notes meets or exceeds our return target for a levered investment. 
In terms of fee acquisition, as the operating environment stabilizes and begins to improve, our pipeline of potential transactions has increased both domestically and internationally and we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities as they begin to arise. Our guidance continues to not reflect any benefits from property acquisitions even though we expect to complete at least some acquisitions during the second half of the year. 
During the first quarter, we sold the 370-room Sheraton Braintree hotel for $9 million. We also signed an agreement to sell the Ritz-Carlton in Dearborn. This asset is in one of the most challenging markets in the country, generates negative net operating income and has significant capital need. Since the transaction is not yet closed, we cannot provide any additional detail to the deal at this time. While we expect to market additional assets this year, we have not included any additional dispositions in our guidance.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter totaled approximately $50 million, which included $23 million of return on investment projects. During the first quarter, we completed the renovation of over 95,000 square feet of meeting space at the San Francisco Moscone Marriott Marquis, one of the pre-eminent group hotels in San Francisco. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, at our San Diego Marriott Hotel & Marina, we renovated the south tower rooms and during the quarter we completed the construction of a new health club. These projects are part of the first phase of what is ultimately projected to be $190 million reinvention of this hotel. 
In addition to the complete renovation of the rooms, this project will provide significant upgrades to the pool, food and beverage and entry experiences. We are also in the process of planning a new 40,000-square-foot exhibit hall and a 40,000-square-foot ballroom, which will have use of both the nearby marina and the downtown area. Construction on that phase of the project is expected to commence in March of 2011. We are also adding a new 15,000-square-foot ballroom and a 5,000-square-foot terrace to the Westin Kierland Resort & Spa in Phoenix as part of a broader meeting space renovation project. 
Given the strength of our balance sheet combined with currently low construction costs and the fact that occupancy levels are still below peak, we believe that the timing is ideal to accelerate the pace of some of our planned capital expenditure projects. As a result, we are increasing our expected capital expenditure estimate for the year to $300 million to $340 million, and we'll continue to evaluate other projects as we work through the year. 
Now let me spend some time on our outlook for 2010.  While we remain concerned that employment growth has lagged, consumer spending trends are still inconsistent and there are continuing risks to the financial system, it is clear that the broader economy is in recovery. Assuming that recovery continues, our better-than-expected first quarter results combined with the improvement in our near-term booking phase and positive results in April, have led us to a more positive outlook for the remainder of the year. As a result, we are increasing our estimates for RevPAR for the year to an increase of 1% to 4% with a comparable adjusted margin decline of 125 basis points to 50 basis points. Based on these assumptions, full year adjusted EBITDA would be approximately $750 million to $800 million and FFO per diluted share would be $0.58 to $0.65. 
In closing, we are certainly more optimistic than we were on our call last quarter. We are seeing signs of recovery in demand and we'll continue to work with our hotels and monitor our pricing strategy for improvement on the rate side. On the investment front, we know from experience that early-stage acquisitions tend to outperform so we will continue to aggressively look for investment opportunities both domestically and internationally. In addition, we will continue to develop reinvestment opportunities within our existing portfolio in order to take advantage of favorable costs and occupancy levels. We took significant steps last year to improve our balance sheet and we are well prepared for opportunities as they arise. Thank you, and let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer."

Let me start by giving you some detail on comparable hotel RevPAR results. Looking at the portfolio based on property types, our airport hotels performed the best during the quarter, with a RevPAR decline of 0.9% as the hotels benefited for the poor weather in the Northeast that led to numerous flight cancellations and layovers. RevPAR for our urban hotels increased 1.7%, while RevPAR suburban and resort conference hotels fell 2.4% and 4.8%, respectively. Before I address individual market performance, I wanted to mention that half of our top 20 markets had positive RevPAR for the quarter. Our top-performing market was Philadelphia with a RevPAR increase of 12.3%. Strong Transient, Citywide and Group business contributed to and occupancy increase of nearly 9% and an ADR decline of 2.8%. For the second quarter, we expect the Philadelphia market to underperform the portfolio due to lower levels of both transient and group demand.
As expected, the Miami Fort Lauderdale market performed very well with a RevPAR increase of 10.3%. Occupancy was up 6.4% and the rate was up 1.7%. Yes, that's right. I said rate was up in the market. The outperformance was driven by growth in Transient and Group business generated by the Super Bowl and Pro Bowl, as well as the impact of the late 2009 ballroom addition at the Harbor Beach Marriott Resort & Spa. We expect the Miami Fort Lauderdale market to have a weaker second quarter but still have positive RevPAR. The San Antonio market also performed very well, with a RevPAR increase of 7.3%. A strong citywide calendar drove an increase in compression days leading to an increase in occupancy of 5.4% and limiting the rate decline to only 0.8%. We expect San Antonio to have a decent second quarter and a strong second half of the year. 
RevPAR for Boston increased 6.7% due to better transient and group demand. Occupancy was up 5.7% and ADR declined 5.1%. Some of the improvement was due to easier comparisons as the Boston Marriott Copley Place and Sheraton Boston were under renovation in the first quarter of 2009. We expect our Boston hotels to have a great second quarter with double-digit RevPAR growth due to strong citywide activity and improvement in transient demand. 
Orange County, a market that was extremely hard hit by the housing market meltdown, had RevPAR growth of 6.7% in the quarter. Transient demand across all segments showed signs of recovery. Occupancy was up 10.2% while ADR was down 7.9%. We expect the Orange County market to continue to perform well in the second quarter. 
We were also pleasantly surprised by the outperformance of New York City, where RevPAR increased 2.6% as occupancy grew by 7.7% and rate declined 7.7%. Business transient and shortening group bookings drove the improvement in demand. We expect New York City to have an outstanding second quarter due to high levels of business transient demand. 
RevPAR for our Chicago properties fell 11.2% due to significant decline in citywide activity which was partially offset by an increase in special corporate and discount business, albeit at a lower rate, as ADR fell 9.9%. The Swissotel, with its recent addition of 38,000 square feet of meeting space, substantially outperformed the market with a RevPAR decline of only 7.7%. We expect Chicago to perform much better in the second quarter and for the outperformance of the Swissotel to continue. 
Forward group demand and weak pricing across all segments affected RevPAR performance at both of our Hawaiian hotels resulting in a 14.1% decline in RevPAR, substantially all of which was due to a 13.5% drop in ADR. We expect the hotels to perform much better in the second quarter but we need to see further increases in airline capacity versus stay in recovery. 
RevPAR for our DC hotels declined 15.9% with a 2% decline in occupancy and a 13.4% drop in ADR. As expected, year-over-year comparisons for the market were difficult due to the 2009 presidential inauguration and related activity as well as record-breaking levels of snowfall in 2010, both of which were significantly affected Group and Transient business. Excluding DC from our concept for the first quarter, RevPAR would have only declined 0.6%. Our DC hotels had positive RevPAR in period three and we expect DC to have positive RevPAR in the second quarter. 
As expected, the San Diego market struggled due to a substantial decline in citywide demand and the absorption of the new Hilton that opened in 2009. RevPAR declined 16.9% with an occupancy decline of 3.5% and a 12.2% decline in ADR. A rooms renovation of the San Diego Marriott Hotel & Marina also negatively affected our performance. We expect the San Diego market to continue to struggle in the second quarter but improve in the second half of the year. 
For our European joint venture, RevPAR calculated in constant euros decreased 1.8% for the quarter. Occupancy increased 5.2% and ADR declined 10.7%. The Westin Europa and Regina in Venice, the Sheraton Skyline in London and the Sheraton Warsaw outperformed the rest of the portfolio. For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels declined 275 basis points. This performance was better than expected due to the challenges created by four items. The first item was a substantial impact of cancellation and attrition fees. In the first quarter of 2009, cancellation and attrition fees were over $12 million higher than the first quarter of 2010 accounting for 110 basis points of the overall margin decline. 
The second item was due to our RevPAR decline driven by a combination of an increase in occupancy and a drop in rate, which is a challenge from an operating profit perspective. However, we were still able to reduce overall rooms cost for occupied rooms to improvement in productivity and reductions in several controllable cost areas. 
The third challenge was the loss of high profit banquet and audiovisual revenues which declined 7.3%. However, food and beverage flow-through was quite good as our managers continued to refine and implement efficiencies in their staffing models. 
The fourth item was the treatment of the ground lease payments in the New York Marriott Marquis. As we discussed last year, in the first quarter of 2009, $3 million of our rent payment was applied to fully fund the deferred purchase price of the land. In the first quarter of 2010, our entire payment was treated as ground rent expense, which reduced EBITDA by $3 million. We have the ability from today through 2017 to buy the fee interest in the land under the hotel from an incremental payment of $19.9 million. Overall, wages and benefits decreased 1.3% or 8.2% on a per occupied room basis, and unallocated cost declined by 2.7% for the quarter as hotels reduced management headcount and lowered other controllable costs. Utility costs also decreased 8.4% through a combination of lower usage, lower rates and the impact of energy saving capital improvements. For the quarter, real estate taxes were flat. 
Looking out through the rest of the year, we expect occupancy to increase further, which will likely lead to growth in wage and benefit cost at inflation after taking into consideration the benefit from productivity gains. We expect unallocated cost to increase at inflation except for utilities where rates will increase and occupancy improvements will drive higher utilization, and sales and marketing where higher revenues will increase cost. We will also incur cost for the implementation of new sales and marketing initiatives. We expect property insurance to increase at inflation and property taxes to rise in excess of inflation. As a result, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins for the year to decrease 50 basis points at the high-end of the RevPAR range and decrease 125 basis points at the low end of the range. 
I previously mentioned the impact of cancellation and attrition fees on the first quarter of 2010 results. For all of 2010, cancellation and attrition fees will be significantly lower than 2009. Adjusting 2009 to a typical year of cancellations would result in an improvement of the above margin guidance of 70 basis points. With respect to our balance sheet, we finished the quarter with over $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and a full $600 million of capacity on our line of credit. In the quarter, we redeemed the remaining $346 million of 7% Series M senior notes due in August 2012 and repaid $124 million mortgage on the Atlanta Marriott Marquis where the interest rate on the loan was set to increase 200 basis points to 9.4%. As a result of these repayments, we reduced our outstanding debt by $470 million to approximately $5.4 billion and we currently have 99 assets unencumbered by mortgage debt. Holders of our $325 million in Exchangeable Senior Debentures had the right to put the securities to us on April 15 of this year. None of the securities were put to us and the next put date for holders is April 15, 2014. 
This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have."

As I said in my comments, we expect a very strong second quarter overall, mainly due to really strong Corporate and Special Corporate Transient business. One of the things that I would point out that I know has been causing some, I guess just questions around our results this quarter, is to remind folks is that as I said in my comments, all of our non-Marriott hotels, so that is Starwood, Hyatt, Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons, are all on a monthly reporting system. And for Host, just because of the way we time our quarters, we don't capture the March results for any of those monthly hotels in our numbers. New York, in my recollection in general from New York, is that it did better sequentially through the first quarter. We are missing the March results from both the W on Lexington Avenue as well as the big Sheraton near Times Square. So my guess is that if those results were added in -- I don't know that number off the top of my head, but my guess is if those results were added in, you’d see a little bit better performance in New York in the first quarter."

I would tell you that it is a relatively – in fact relatively is not the fair word, it’s a low price, but it is reflective of the fact that the asset, as I mentioned in my comment, is losing money this year. It lost money last year. I think it might have been right on the margin in 2008 in terms of whether it made or lost money. So unfortunately, we've been facing some big challenges in that market, not surprisingly, given the challenges that the auto industry has faced. We've postponed a fair amount of CapEx at that hotel because we've been trying to sort out the right resolution for it. While there is a and I think an effective way to invest a certain amount of capital dollars in the hotel, we've concluded that it would be better off being -- selling the hotel at this point than pursuing that path. So it’s going to be a pretty low number and with any luck the transaction closes in the next 60 days, then we will be happy to tell everybody about it."

Where we've invested in this asset and given the underlying leverage compared to what we think the value is, we're comfortable that just as a debt investment, we will likely exceed those leverage return targets. The strategy for what happens with the investment will in part be based upon how the economy improves, obviously in Europe, and as it relates to these individual assets. We would be very comfortable if this just continues to be a performing loan and that we get paid off in due course, which based on the terms of the loan document, will generally come due no later than about two and a half years from where we are right now. On the other hand, we obviously are very comfortable being an investor in Europe and if the properties performance does not improve enough for us to be paid off, we would be comfortable being an owner."

And again, as I mentioned in my comments, it's still not a flood of opportunities although our pipeline is clearly larger than it was 50, even 65, 70 days ago. I'd say that the opportunities are sort of splitting into two camps. There's one group of opportunities that are happening because pricing has been recovering, and I think you're seeing fairly low cap rates and fairly high EBITDA multiples, reflecting both the outlook for the future as well as the fact that we are at drop EBITDA levels. So with the recovery in pricing, you are seeing certain sellers who face debt maturities in the near-term who are thinking that perhaps it's worthwhile testing the market to see if there is an opportunity to sell an asset today, and at least recover some of their initial investment. I think there's another group of sellers, again it’s a relatively small group, but there's another group of sellers who are evaluating their business now, who are maybe more confident about investing in their own business but might be looking to liquidate certain of the assets that they have in order to then reuse those proceeds in a different direction within their individual business. I sort of describe that a little bit as a strategic seller because that type of a seller is really doing this because it’s a strategic aspect of their business as opposed to because they necessarily think that this is when they’re going to get the maximum price for an asset. I suspect that we will see more activity in both of these camps as we work our way through the year, but as you can tell by the volume of transaction activity that's been reported, in each instance the volume is still relatively light but we are relatively encouraged by at least the trend that we are seeing there and the number of conversations that we’re having."

Miami, in part because of the burst around the Super Bowl, but I also think in general we’re seeing some strength in that market. So that’s another market where we think it's likely that we’ll see some rate growth in the relatively near term. Portfolio-wide, I would at best say it’s -- it's probably at best the second half of the year. Certainly within the realm of the guidance that we provided, we're really not anticipating that it happens until the end of the year. And I think it's a little touch-and-go on whether or not we actually get the true rate growth for a full quarter by the end of the year. Probably at the high-end of our guidance, there's a shot at that. On the margin front, I think you -- our estimate is that we are looking at a 50 basis point decline tied to a 4% overall full year RevPAR growth rate. Again, my guess is that the margin and the -- because margin growth is going to be tied to both overall level of RevPAR increase as well as, to some degree, whether that is happening because of rate or because of occupancy, if there's an opportunity for positive margins it’s certainly near the end of the year."

Going forward, ultimately margin growth ties to the relationship between revenue growth, which is of course more than just RevPAR growth, and inflation. So if we continue to see inflation stay at a fairly low level, plus or minus 2%, then I would expect that we would be able to see margin growth in '11 and '12 at below 4% RevPAR level. Now I suspect that if the recovery continues, that won't be a problem because we're going to be seeing stronger levels of RevPAR increase than that. But I think you could see margin growth at less than 4%.  As we've commented in the past, the transition here when one goes from having been in free fall to starting to see RevPAR recovery and business recovery is always a tricky year for margins, while I would say there was tremendous strides made at all of our properties at taking out cost. There clearly are some costs that came out of our operations that are not sustainable, and so typically in that first eight to 12 months of RevPAR recovery, some of those costs trickle back in, which usually leads to the first year of positive RevPAR growth having less than impressive margins. But normally, especially if we’re doing our job on the asset management side, once you get past that initial kind of recovery of some expenses,you get back into a more traditional relationship. And as long as RevPAR and revenue growth are outpacing inflation, we should see margin growth."

Pricing has certainly recovered more quickly than some folks had anticipated, and as operations begin to improve, one can get more comfortable with selling some of the assets that we don't expect to be owning in 2014 or 2015 a bit sooner. We are in the process right now of evaluating the portfolio and looking at a number of assets to determine if it is better to sell those assets now and take advantage of a fair amount of capital that's not able to be deployed, or whether we’re able to – whether we would be better off waiting for the NOI to recover a bit more and then put those properties on the market. That's one of the reasons why we made the statement that, while we're not putting any more sales – or not contemplating specific sales in the context of our guidance, we are intending to market a few properties and we'll sort of see how that plays out. But what I would say on that is because of the amount of capital we have, we do not need to effect a sale for liquidity reasons. So we will be very, very price sensitive in any of those marketing opportunities. If we're not hitting the number that we want, we will not be a seller because the only reason to do it is the one that you’ve outlined, to take advantage of a strong market and sell some assets that, while they are non-core for us, could clearly be a good acquisition for somebody else."

I think that’s the tricky part when you're in this sort of a transition. As we clearly saw tremendous occupancy growth in the first quarter and that was unfortunately offset by rate declines, we work our way through the quarter, though we’ve probably been expecting to see the occupancy run at a fairly heavy rate but the question is going to be how quickly can we eliminate negative rate and move into positive rate. Let me give you a couple of other insights around why we got more optimistic relative to RevPAR for the rest of the year. The big drive for us was what was happening on the transient side. As I mentioned, we were up 12% in overall transient demand. We are practically, for the first quarter at least, back to where we were in 2007. But the biggest key for us was the fact that when you combine corporate and special corporate business, we were up 15% in room nights. Now, while we were still down in rate in those segments, the fact that, that demand was coming back was pretty key for us because we had not really seen that happen even in the fourth quarter of last year. And hence when that start to occur, that's a great sign for the fact that the business is going to rebuild. And I think the other piece of it is, that as you look at what was happening on the group side, we started out the quarter at the deficit for both the full year and for the quarter. We very quickly closed that deficit in the first quarter and ended up positive in room nights. A lot of that was because on the association events people showed up, and in fact we started to run into situations where more people showed up than we had rooms available. And even on the corporate side, we started to find that our booking pace was accelerating beyond what we had expected. So as we look at the activity for the second and third quarter, it’s very solid. There is still a little bit of weakness in the fourth quarter but we are up for the full year in terms of group booking pace now, which we haven't been able to say for quite some time. And I think we felt that because that's such an important component of our business and because when you go back and look at where we were compared to '07, we had really lost the most in terms of group room nights compared to the other segments in our business, the fact that, that was beginning to recover, led us to look much more optimistically at the rest of the year."

At the end of the day, I think I'd reiterate what I said the last quarter when there was a little bit of a gap between where we were and where both of them were, which is that there's really no reason, given that I would agree with your point that we own some of their best hotels and we typically perform pretty much in line with them, there's no reason in our mind why we would underperform either of them.

What we are hearing from our GMs at this point is that holding at 800, it may be coming in higher than that in some cases. The key for us on that is to really understand that and start to build that into our revenue expectations. Because as we begin to get more confident that those associations will not only fulfill their full block but actually begin to exceed it, that allows us to begin to do some nickshift by cutting off some of the cheaper channels that we might have available, and save rooms either for that higher-priced group or simply make certain we save enough rooms in certain markets where we’re only selling rooms to that higher-priced corporate customer as opposed to that lower-priced discount customer."

Let me try to approach it in a slightly different way. If you look at what was happening on net booking pace for the first quarter, we generally found that in the first quarter itself our net bookings were up by over 100% compared to where we were in '09. And those bookings actually exceeded the pace that we had in 2007 which we tend to use as sort as a stabilized year by more than 25%. If you look at how it played out for the quarter, we started off down about 6% and ended up slightly. So you can see that the fact that we booked so many more rooms in the quarter than we traditionally have done, allowed us to close the gap in a way that we probably wouldn't have in the past.  On a full-year basis, you're finding that more -- the bookings are short-term, there still is not -- we haven't hit that magic moment that I can tell yet where somebody calls up, wants to do an event in four weeks and finds out that there's no room available at the inn.  So we haven't quite gotten to that point because of where our occupancy levels were. So you're finding that most of the success in the booking pace side is relatively short-term which is why our second quarter bookings are up almost over 250% compared to 2009. Now recognized there weren't a lot of short-term bookings happening at this time last year, but the reality is even the second quarter bookings when you go back and compare them to 2007 are slightly positive. So we would take that as a good sign, too. The net of it is that when we started off the year being negative in terms of overall room nights, we've closed that gap in a material way and in fact now even with adjusting those umber of nights booked to reflect what we thought was a cancellation that happened last year, because I think that gives you a cleaner sense of the data, instead of being down 6% we are now up 3% to 4%. So I think that obviously is a pretty good change in a relatively short period of time."

What we look at, we start with trying to understand what we think based on our projections is an unlevered rate of return from a particular asset. So in each instance what we're going to do with that is we’re going to make certain assumptions about what the performance is going to be this year and then we're going to assess what we think is likely to happen for that particular asset and that particular market. Over the next few years, and I think having kind of calculated in what we think the recovery is, we would probably stabilize it a longer term revenue and EBITDA or NOI growth rate and carry that out to ultimately get to a 10-year discounted cash flow. If you think about how that works, obviously markets that have fallen further but then are expected to rise faster are going to ultimately end up with lower cap rates today, but that's just reflecting the particular circumstances and their market. The other major element that we would look at is the one that you were referencing which is trying to understand where you are in a discount to replacement cost. I think one of the key factors in employing that in your analysis, is that to the extent that you are legitimately analyzing what your replacement cost is, if you're buying at a meaningful discount to replacement cost, well that in and of itself does not tell you that you're necessarily going to have a successful investment. It does give you a sense that it is harder on a relative basis if the discount is larger or a new competitor had come into your market simply because the cost to build that new competitor are probably not going to make sense in the context of the return on the investment until cash flow depreciated meaningfully. So discount to replacement costs becomes a good gut check for us on whether or not -- if you are underwriting a very aggressive recovery for an asset that you thought was at replacement cost, you probably have to ask yourself if you're really being fair about the likelihood of new supply in that market. So those would be the two primary things that we would look at. My guess is at the end of the day, I think most of our competitors are pretty sophisticated. They would each have their own take, but I suspect that they're looking at it in generally the same way."

It all depends upon how active we can ultimately be on the acquisition side. We obviously have a fair amount of capital right now. As Larry mentioned in his comments, we got a pleasant surprise when the exchangeable that was puttable to us a couple weeks ago wasn't put, so that gives us an extra $325 million of capital that we weren't counting on. So we’ll take that into account in deciding what to do with the continuous equity program. At the end of the day, I think folks should assume that we are trying to add additional hotels to our portfolio and that we will ultimately draw on that capital in order to help fund that growth. In the long run, I would expect that we would have another continuous equity program. We do want to have – I think that's a very cost effective way to fund the equity portion of our balance sheet, but it's all going to be tied to exactly what level of growth we’re having and because if you don't have the growth then you don't necessarily need to issue the incremental equity."

After a challenging year in 2009, we are pleased to report that our first quarter operating results and trends were significantly better than we expected. As I will discuss in more detail, we experienced significant increases in transient demand and very encouraging trends on the group side of our business. While we still face challenges rebuilding our average rates, our recent operating results have turned positive on the top line and suggest that the industry is reaching an inflection point.
Turning to our results, first quarter RevPAR for our comparable hotel decreased by 2.3% driven by a decrease in average room rate of 8.7% which was offset by an increase in occupancy of 4.3% each quarter. For the quarter, our average rate was at $167 and our average occupancy was 65.5%. Our top line results improved on a relative basis each funds of the quarter and turned positive in March. As you may remember, due to the timing of our reporting period, our first quarter does not include the operating results for a significant portion of our portfolio for the month of March. Adjusting our results to reflect the inclusion of all of our assets for the calendar quarter would result in a RevPAR decline of only 1%. 
Food and beverage revenues at our comparable hotels decreased 3.7% for the quarter and total revenue fell by 3.9%. While our managers continue to strive to control costs, the combination of increased occupancy, continued pressure on average rates and a meaningful reduction in attrition and cancellation fees, resulted in a decrease in comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin of 275 basis points for the quarter. First quarter adjusted EBITDA for Host was $126 million. FFO per diluted share for the quarter was $0.08, which included a reduction of $0.01 as a result of cost associated with the prepayment of debt and an accrual related to the potential San Antonio litigation loss. Overall, we are very pleased that our adjusted EBITDA and FFO per share diluted results materially exceeded our expectations.
Turning to our business mix for the quarter, the demand trends that developed over the second half of 2009 accelerated in the first quarter of 2010, positively impacting our business mix on a wider scale. For the third straight quarter, we experienced year-over-year growth in our Transient business with an overall increase in Transient room nights of more than 12%. More importantly, this increase in demand was led by our Special Corporate business where room nights increased more than 28%, and our Premium and Corporate segments where room nights increased for the first time in nine quarters at a rate of nearly 9%. 
Special Corporate demand growth was especially strong in our Luxury properties which experienced a demand increase in that segment of more than 50%. While average rates in both of these corporate segments were still down by roughly 8%, these are solid indicators of improvements in corporate travel, which is required for the industry to commence a true recovery. Overall, the positive shift in business mix in the Transient segment for the first time since the summer of 2008, held the decline in the overall average rates of 7.7%, which led to a Transient revenue increase of 3.6%. 
On the group side, frankly, we were pleasantly surprised by the pace of our short-term bookings during the quarter. At the beginning of the year, we faced a 4% shortfall in the first quarter, taking into account the record cancellations we experienced in the early months of 2009, and roughly a 6% shortfall for the entire year. At the end of the quarter, group demand improved by 0.5% for the quarter and our full year bookings are now trending ahead of the prior year's pace. 
Volume improvements for the quarter came primarily from a 14% increase in association room night and more than a 5% increase in discount business. While Corporate groups continue to be a challenge as demand decreased by 13% in the quarter, we saw a meaningful acceleration in corporate group activity as companies began to rebook business. Interestingly, our luxury corporate group room night actually increased more than 18% compared to the first quarter of last year, which suggest the  companies are feeling somewhat less concerned about the potential political ramifications of booking business at higher-end property. 
Overall, group room rates declined 9% and, combined with the increase in demand of 0.5%, resulted in a decrease in group revenues of 8.6%. The rebounding Group business compared to expectations and Association business in particular, helped our big box hotels as they slightly outperformed the rest of the portfolio. 
Looking at the second quarter and the remainder of the year, our visibility continues to be fairly limited because of the short booking window. RevPAR growth for period four exceeded 5%, continuing the recent trend of improving results. Group bookings continue to be strong as bookings in the first quarter for the second quarter have more than tripled when compared to last year and even slightly outpaced our 2007 level of activity. Transient bookings for the second quarter are also trending ahead of last year. Overall, improvement is still relying on the strength of the economy, but we are optimistic that businesses are beginning to loosen their travel budgets spurring a recovery in lodging demand.
On the investment front, as I discussed with you last quarter, the combination of structural complexity and secure-type transactions and little pressure on banks to resolve troubled loans situations has resulted in a limited number of assets actually coming to market. However, we are seeing investment opportunities in the form of distressed loans. Earlier this month, we purchased the junior tranches of a mortgage loan secured by a 1,900-room portfolio of hotels in Europe. The par value of the tranches we purchased are approximately EUR 64 million and we purchased the notes at a meaningful discount. While we cannot get into more specifics regarding this investment, the return we expect to generate on the notes meets or exceeds our return target for a levered investment. 
In terms of fee acquisition, as the operating environment stabilizes and begins to improve, our pipeline of potential transactions has increased both domestically and internationally and we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities as they begin to arise. Our guidance continues to not reflect any benefits from property acquisitions even though we expect to complete at least some acquisitions during the second half of the year. 
During the first quarter, we sold the 370-room Sheraton Braintree hotel for $9 million. We also signed an agreement to sell the Ritz-Carlton in Dearborn. This asset is in one of the most challenging markets in the country, generates negative net operating income and has significant capital need. Since the transaction is not yet closed, we cannot provide any additional detail to the deal at this time. While we expect to market additional assets this year, we have not included any additional dispositions in our guidance.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter totaled approximately $50 million, which included $23 million of return on investment projects. During the first quarter, we completed the renovation of over 95,000 square feet of meeting space at the San Francisco Moscone Marriott Marquis, one of the pre-eminent group hotels in San Francisco. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, at our San Diego Marriott Hotel & Marina, we renovated the south tower rooms and during the quarter we completed the construction of a new health club. These projects are part of the first phase of what is ultimately projected to be $190 million reinvention of this hotel. 
In addition to the complete renovation of the rooms, this project will provide significant upgrades to the pool, food and beverage and entry experiences. We are also in the process of planning a new 40,000-square-foot exhibit hall and a 40,000-square-foot ballroom, which will have use of both the nearby marina and the downtown area. Construction on that phase of the project is expected to commence in March of 2011. We are also adding a new 15,000-square-foot ballroom and a 5,000-square-foot terrace to the Westin Kierland Resort & Spa in Phoenix as part of a broader meeting space renovation project. 
Given the strength of our balance sheet combined with currently low construction costs and the fact that occupancy levels are still below peak, we believe that the timing is ideal to accelerate the pace of some of our planned capital expenditure projects. As a result, we are increasing our expected capital expenditure estimate for the year to $300 million to $340 million, and we'll continue to evaluate other projects as we work through the year. 
Now let me spend some time on our outlook for 2010.  While we remain concerned that employment growth has lagged, consumer spending trends are still inconsistent and there are continuing risks to the financial system, it is clear that the broader economy is in recovery. Assuming that recovery continues, our better-than-expected first quarter results combined with the improvement in our near-term booking phase and positive results in April, have led us to a more positive outlook for the remainder of the year. As a result, we are increasing our estimates for RevPAR for the year to an increase of 1% to 4% with a comparable adjusted margin decline of 125 basis points to 50 basis points. Based on these assumptions, full year adjusted EBITDA would be approximately $750 million to $800 million and FFO per diluted share would be $0.58 to $0.65. 
In closing, we are certainly more optimistic than we were on our call last quarter. We are seeing signs of recovery in demand and we'll continue to work with our hotels and monitor our pricing strategy for improvement on the rate side. On the investment front, we know from experience that early-stage acquisitions tend to outperform so we will continue to aggressively look for investment opportunities both domestically and internationally. In addition, we will continue to develop reinvestment opportunities within our existing portfolio in order to take advantage of favorable costs and occupancy levels. We took significant steps last year to improve our balance sheet and we are well prepared for opportunities as they arise. Thank you, and let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer."

Let me start by giving you some detail on comparable hotel RevPAR results. Looking at the portfolio based on property types, our airport hotels performed the best during the quarter, with a RevPAR decline of 0.9% as the hotels benefited for the poor weather in the Northeast that led to numerous flight cancellations and layovers. RevPAR for our urban hotels increased 1.7%, while RevPAR suburban and resort conference hotels fell 2.4% and 4.8%, respectively. Before I address individual market performance, I wanted to mention that half of our top 20 markets had positive RevPAR for the quarter. Our top-performing market was Philadelphia with a RevPAR increase of 12.3%. Strong Transient, Citywide and Group business contributed to and occupancy increase of nearly 9% and an ADR decline of 2.8%. For the second quarter, we expect the Philadelphia market to underperform the portfolio due to lower levels of both transient and group demand.
As expected, the Miami Fort Lauderdale market performed very well with a RevPAR increase of 10.3%. Occupancy was up 6.4% and the rate was up 1.7%. Yes, that's right. I said rate was up in the market. The outperformance was driven by growth in Transient and Group business generated by the Super Bowl and Pro Bowl, as well as the impact of the late 2009 ballroom addition at the Harbor Beach Marriott Resort & Spa. We expect the Miami Fort Lauderdale market to have a weaker second quarter but still have positive RevPAR. The San Antonio market also performed very well, with a RevPAR increase of 7.3%. A strong citywide calendar drove an increase in compression days leading to an increase in occupancy of 5.4% and limiting the rate decline to only 0.8%. We expect San Antonio to have a decent second quarter and a strong second half of the year. 
RevPAR for Boston increased 6.7% due to better transient and group demand. Occupancy was up 5.7% and ADR declined 5.1%. Some of the improvement was due to easier comparisons as the Boston Marriott Copley Place and Sheraton Boston were under renovation in the first quarter of 2009. We expect our Boston hotels to have a great second quarter with double-digit RevPAR growth due to strong citywide activity and improvement in transient demand. 
Orange County, a market that was extremely hard hit by the housing market meltdown, had RevPAR growth of 6.7% in the quarter. Transient demand across all segments showed signs of recovery. Occupancy was up 10.2% while ADR was down 7.9%. We expect the Orange County market to continue to perform well in the second quarter. 
We were also pleasantly surprised by the outperformance of New York City, where RevPAR increased 2.6% as occupancy grew by 7.7% and rate declined 7.7%. Business transient and shortening group bookings drove the improvement in demand. We expect New York City to have an outstanding second quarter due to high levels of business transient demand. 
RevPAR for our Chicago properties fell 11.2% due to significant decline in citywide activity which was partially offset by an increase in special corporate and discount business, albeit at a lower rate, as ADR fell 9.9%. The Swissotel, with its recent addition of 38,000 square feet of meeting space, substantially outperformed the market with a RevPAR decline of only 7.7%. We expect Chicago to perform much better in the second quarter and for the outperformance of the Swissotel to continue. 
Forward group demand and weak pricing across all segments affected RevPAR performance at both of our Hawaiian hotels resulting in a 14.1% decline in RevPAR, substantially all of which was due to a 13.5% drop in ADR. We expect the hotels to perform much better in the second quarter but we need to see further increases in airline capacity versus stay in recovery. 
RevPAR for our DC hotels declined 15.9% with a 2% decline in occupancy and a 13.4% drop in ADR. As expected, year-over-year comparisons for the market were difficult due to the 2009 presidential inauguration and related activity as well as record-breaking levels of snowfall in 2010, both of which were significantly affected Group and Transient business. Excluding DC from our concept for the first quarter, RevPAR would have only declined 0.6%. Our DC hotels had positive RevPAR in period three and we expect DC to have positive RevPAR in the second quarter. 
As expected, the San Diego market struggled due to a substantial decline in citywide demand and the absorption of the new Hilton that opened in 2009. RevPAR declined 16.9% with an occupancy decline of 3.5% and a 12.2% decline in ADR. A rooms renovation of the San Diego Marriott Hotel & Marina also negatively affected our performance. We expect the San Diego market to continue to struggle in the second quarter but improve in the second half of the year. 
For our European joint venture, RevPAR calculated in constant euros decreased 1.8% for the quarter. Occupancy increased 5.2% and ADR declined 10.7%. The Westin Europa and Regina in Venice, the Sheraton Skyline in London and the Sheraton Warsaw outperformed the rest of the portfolio. For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels declined 275 basis points. This performance was better than expected due to the challenges created by four items. The first item was a substantial impact of cancellation and attrition fees. In the first quarter of 2009, cancellation and attrition fees were over $12 million higher than the first quarter of 2010 accounting for 110 basis points of the overall margin decline. 
The second item was due to our RevPAR decline driven by a combination of an increase in occupancy and a drop in rate, which is a challenge from an operating profit perspective. However, we were still able to reduce overall rooms cost for occupied rooms to improvement in productivity and reductions in several controllable cost areas. 
The third challenge was the loss of high profit banquet and audiovisual revenues which declined 7.3%. However, food and beverage flow-through was quite good as our managers continued to refine and implement efficiencies in their staffing models. 
The fourth item was the treatment of the ground lease payments in the New York Marriott Marquis. As we discussed last year, in the first quarter of 2009, $3 million of our rent payment was applied to fully fund the deferred purchase price of the land. In the first quarter of 2010, our entire payment was treated as ground rent expense, which reduced EBITDA by $3 million. We have the ability from today through 2017 to buy the fee interest in the land under the hotel from an incremental payment of $19.9 million. Overall, wages and benefits decreased 1.3% or 8.2% on a per occupied room basis, and unallocated cost declined by 2.7% for the quarter as hotels reduced management headcount and lowered other controllable costs. Utility costs also decreased 8.4% through a combination of lower usage, lower rates and the impact of energy saving capital improvements. For the quarter, real estate taxes were flat. 
Looking out through the rest of the year, we expect occupancy to increase further, which will likely lead to growth in wage and benefit cost at inflation after taking into consideration the benefit from productivity gains. We expect unallocated cost to increase at inflation except for utilities where rates will increase and occupancy improvements will drive higher utilization, and sales and marketing where higher revenues will increase cost. We will also incur cost for the implementation of new sales and marketing initiatives. We expect property insurance to increase at inflation and property taxes to rise in excess of inflation. As a result, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins for the year to decrease 50 basis points at the high-end of the RevPAR range and decrease 125 basis points at the low end of the range. 
I previously mentioned the impact of cancellation and attrition fees on the first quarter of 2010 results. For all of 2010, cancellation and attrition fees will be significantly lower than 2009. Adjusting 2009 to a typical year of cancellations would result in an improvement of the above margin guidance of 70 basis points. With respect to our balance sheet, we finished the quarter with over $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and a full $600 million of capacity on our line of credit. In the quarter, we redeemed the remaining $346 million of 7% Series M senior notes due in August 2012 and repaid $124 million mortgage on the Atlanta Marriott Marquis where the interest rate on the loan was set to increase 200 basis points to 9.4%. As a result of these repayments, we reduced our outstanding debt by $470 million to approximately $5.4 billion and we currently have 99 assets unencumbered by mortgage debt. Holders of our $325 million in Exchangeable Senior Debentures had the right to put the securities to us on April 15 of this year. None of the securities were put to us and the next put date for holders is April 15, 2014.

In fact, New York, at least for our Marriott hotels, had a strong period four, so we're definitely seeing acceleration there. As I said in my comments, we expect a very strong second quarter overall, mainly due to really strong Corporate and Special Corporate Transient business. One of the things that I would point out that I know has been causing some, I guess just questions around our results this quarter, is to remind folks is that as I said in my comments, all of our non-Marriott hotels, so that is Starwood, Hyatt, Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons, are all on a monthly reporting system. And for Host, just because of the way we time our quarters, we don't capture the March results for any of those monthly hotels in our numbers. New York, in my recollection in general from New York, is that it did better sequentially through the first quarter. We are missing the March results from both the W on Lexington Avenue as well as the big Sheraton near Times Square. So my guess is that if those results were added in -- I don't know that number off the top of my head, but my guess is if those results were added in, you’d see a little bit better performance in New York in the first quarter."

And again, as I mentioned in my comments, it's still not a flood of opportunities although our pipeline is clearly larger than it was 50, even 65, 70 days ago. I'd say that the opportunities are sort of splitting into two camps. There's one group of opportunities that are happening because pricing has been recovering, and I think you're seeing fairly low cap rates and fairly high EBITDA multiples, reflecting both the outlook for the future as well as the fact that we are at drop EBITDA levels. So with the recovery in pricing, you are seeing certain sellers who face debt maturities in the near-term who are thinking that perhaps it's worthwhile testing the market to see if there is an opportunity to sell an asset today, and at least recover some of their initial investment. I think there's another group of sellers, again it’s a relatively small group, but there's another group of sellers who are evaluating their business now, who are maybe more confident about investing in their own business but might be looking to liquidate certain of the assets that they have in order to then reuse those proceeds in a different direction within their individual business. I sort of describe that a little bit as a strategic seller because that type of a seller is really doing this because it’s a strategic aspect of their business as opposed to because they necessarily think that this is when they’re going to get the maximum price for an asset. I suspect that we will see more activity in both of these camps as we work our way through the year, but as you can tell by the volume of transaction activity that's been reported, in each instance the volume is still relatively light but we are relatively encouraged by at least the trend that we are seeing there and the number of conversations that we’re having."

What I would say to you, as you well know, is that the recovery in rates is going to happen on a market-by-market basis. And some of the markets that Larry talked about, that I think we've got a chance of seeing some rate growth relatively quickly, would include some of the big East Coast markets like Boston, New York and DC.

Miami, in part because of the burst around the Super Bowl, but I also think in general we’re seeing some strength in that market. So that’s another market where we think it's likely that we’ll see some rate growth in the relatively near term.

Certainly within the realm of the guidance that we provided, we're really not anticipating that it happens until the end of the year. And I think it's a little touch-and-go on whether or not we actually get the true rate growth for a full quarter by the end of the year. Probably at the high-end of our guidance, there's a shot at that. On the margin front, I think you -- our estimate is that we are looking at a 50 basis point decline tied to a 4% overall full year RevPAR growth rate. Again, my guess is that the margin and the -- because margin growth is going to be tied to both overall level of RevPAR increase as well as, to some degree, whether that is happening because of rate or because of occupancy, if there's an opportunity for positive margins it’s certainly near the end of the year."

Going forward, ultimately margin growth ties to the relationship between revenue growth, which is of course more than just RevPAR growth, and inflation. So if we continue to see inflation stay at a fairly low level, plus or minus 2%, then I would expect that we would be able to see margin growth in '11 and '12 at below 4% RevPAR level. Now I suspect that if the recovery continues, that won't be a problem because we're going to be seeing stronger levels of RevPAR increase than that. But I think you could see margin growth at less than 4%.  As we've commented in the past, the transition here when one goes from having been in free fall to starting to see RevPAR recovery and business recovery is always a tricky year for margins, while I would say there was tremendous strides made at all of our properties at taking out cost. There clearly are some costs that came out of our operations that are not sustainable, and so typically in that first eight to 12 months of RevPAR recovery, some of those costs trickle back in, which usually leads to the first year of positive RevPAR growth having less than impressive margins. But normally, especially if we’re doing our job on the asset management side, once you get past that initial kind of recovery of some expenses,you get back into a more traditional relationship. And as long as RevPAR and revenue growth are outpacing inflation, we should see margin growth."

Pricing has certainly recovered more quickly than some folks had anticipated, and as operations begin to improve, one can get more comfortable with selling some of the assets that we don't expect to be owning in 2014 or 2015 a bit sooner. We are in the process right now of evaluating the portfolio and looking at a number of assets to determine if it is better to sell those assets now and take advantage of a fair amount of capital that's not able to be deployed, or whether we’re able to – whether we would be better off waiting for the NOI to recover a bit more and then put those properties on the market. That's one of the reasons why we made the statement that, while we're not putting any more sales – or not contemplating specific sales in the context of our guidance, we are intending to market a few properties and we'll sort of see how that plays out. But what I would say on that is because of the amount of capital we have, we do not need to effect a sale for liquidity reasons. So we will be very, very price sensitive in any of those marketing opportunities. If we're not hitting the number that we want, we will not be a seller because the only reason to do it is the one that you’ve outlined, to take advantage of a strong market and sell some assets that, while they are non-core for us, could clearly be a good acquisition for somebody else."

I think that’s the tricky part when you're in this sort of a transition. As we clearly saw tremendous occupancy growth in the first quarter and that was unfortunately offset by rate declines, we work our way through the quarter, though we’ve probably been expecting to see the occupancy run at a fairly heavy rate but the question is going to be how quickly can we eliminate negative rate and move into positive rate. Let me give you a couple of other insights around why we got more optimistic relative to RevPAR for the rest of the year. The big drive for us was what was happening on the transient side. As I mentioned, we were up 12% in overall transient demand. We are practically, for the first quarter at least, back to where we were in 2007. But the biggest key for us was the fact that when you combine corporate and special corporate business, we were up 15% in room nights. Now, while we were still down in rate in those segments, the fact that, that demand was coming back was pretty key for us because we had not really seen that happen even in the fourth quarter of last year. And hence when that start to occur, that's a great sign for the fact that the business is going to rebuild. And I think the other piece of it is, that as you look at what was happening on the group side, we started out the quarter at the deficit for both the full year and for the quarter. We very quickly closed that deficit in the first quarter and ended up positive in room nights. A lot of that was because on the association events people showed up, and in fact we started to run into situations where more people showed up than we had rooms available. And even on the corporate side, we started to find that our booking pace was accelerating beyond what we had expected. So as we look at the activity for the second and third quarter, it’s very solid. There is still a little bit of weakness in the fourth quarter but we are up for the full year in terms of group booking pace now, which we haven't been able to say for quite some time. And I think we felt that because that's such an important component of our business and because when you go back and look at where we were compared to '07, we had really lost the most in terms of group room nights compared to the other segments in our business, the fact that, that was beginning to recover, led us to look much more optimistically at the rest of the year."

At the end of the day, I think I'd reiterate what I said the last quarter when there was a little bit of a gap between where we were and where both of them were, which is that there's really no reason, given that I would agree with your point that we own some of their best hotels and we typically perform pretty much in line with them, there's no reason in our mind why we would underperform either of them. I think it’s just, obviously we are moving our expectations a fair amount from one quarter to the next and I think we'd rather -- we don't want to necessarily get ahead of ourselves. You should take from our call, we feel very good about what we are seeing in the first quarter. But we are still in a recovering economy and we want to take note of that."

I think what we are finding though is that the hotels are constantly in touch with the bigger groups to understand what their room nights are going to ultimately come out to be. And what they have been finding is that where a lot of times last year, we might have expected 800 rooms and by the time we got two weeks out we were starting to find that 800 was turning into 700 or 750. What we are hearing from our GMs at this point is that holding at 800, it may be coming in higher than that in some cases. The key for us on that is to really understand that and start to build that into our revenue expectations. Because as we begin to get more confident that those associations will not only fulfill their full block but actually begin to exceed it, that allows us to begin to do some nickshift by cutting off some of the cheaper channels that we might have available, and save rooms either for that higher-priced group or simply make certain we save enough rooms in certain markets where we’re only selling rooms to that higher-priced corporate customer as opposed to that lower-priced discount customer."

Let me try to approach it in a slightly different way. If you look at what was happening on net booking pace for the first quarter, we generally found that in the first quarter itself our net bookings were up by over 100% compared to where we were in '09. And those bookings actually exceeded the pace that we had in 2007 which we tend to use as sort as a stabilized year by more than 25%. If you look at how it played out for the quarter, we started off down about 6% and ended up slightly. So you can see that the fact that we booked so many more rooms in the quarter than we traditionally have done, allowed us to close the gap in a way that we probably wouldn't have in the past.  On a full-year basis, you're finding that more -- the bookings are short-term, there still is not -- we haven't hit that magic moment that I can tell yet where somebody calls up, wants to do an event in four weeks and finds out that there's no room available at the inn.  So we haven't quite gotten to that point because of where our occupancy levels were. So you're finding that most of the success in the booking pace side is relatively short-term which is why our second quarter bookings are up almost over 250% compared to 2009. Now recognized there weren't a lot of short-term bookings happening at this time last year, but the reality is even the second quarter bookings when you go back and compare them to 2007 are slightly positive. So we would take that as a good sign, too. The net of it is that when we started off the year being negative in terms of overall room nights, we've closed that gap in a material way and in fact now even with adjusting those umber of nights booked to reflect what we thought was a cancellation that happened last year, because I think that gives you a cleaner sense of the data, instead of being down 6% we are now up 3% to 4%. So I think that obviously is a pretty good change in a relatively short period of time."

What we look at, we start with trying to understand what we think based on our projections is an unlevered rate of return from a particular asset. So in each instance what we're going to do with that is we’re going to make certain assumptions about what the performance is going to be this year and then we're going to assess what we think is likely to happen for that particular asset and that particular market. Over the next few years, and I think having kind of calculated in what we think the recovery is, we would probably stabilize it a longer term revenue and EBITDA or NOI growth rate and carry that out to ultimately get to a 10-year discounted cash flow. If you think about how that works, obviously markets that have fallen further but then are expected to rise faster are going to ultimately end up with lower cap rates today, but that's just reflecting the particular circumstances and their market. The other major element that we would look at is the one that you were referencing which is trying to understand where you are in a discount to replacement cost. I think one of the key factors in employing that in your analysis, is that to the extent that you are legitimately analyzing what your replacement cost is, if you're buying at a meaningful discount to replacement cost, well that in and of itself does not tell you that you're necessarily going to have a successful investment. It does give you a sense that it is harder on a relative basis if the discount is larger or a new competitor had come into your market simply because the cost to build that new competitor are probably not going to make sense in the context of the return on the investment until cash flow depreciated meaningfully. So discount to replacement costs becomes a good gut check for us on whether or not -- if you are underwriting a very aggressive recovery for an asset that you thought was at replacement cost, you probably have to ask yourself if you're really being fair about the likelihood of new supply in that market. So those would be the two primary things that we would look at. My guess is at the end of the day, I think most of our competitors are pretty sophisticated. They would each have their own take, but I suspect that they're looking at it in generally the same way."

And so some of that cost increase that I'm expecting is going to happen, happens this year. It probably sets us up for a more normalized year in 2011 with respect to margin. When you step back and look at what would happen in 2011, if you were to have 5% RevPAR growth, I would be very disappointed if we didn't have some margin growth there.

It all depends upon how active we can ultimately be on the acquisition side. We obviously have a fair amount of capital right now. As Larry mentioned in his comments, we got a pleasant surprise when the exchangeable that was puttable to us a couple weeks ago wasn't put, so that gives us an extra $325 million of capital that we weren't counting on. So we’ll take that into account in deciding what to do with the continuous equity program. At the end of the day, I think folks should assume that we are trying to add additional hotels to our portfolio and that we will ultimately draw on that capital in order to help fund that growth. In the long run, I would expect that we would have another continuous equity program. We do want to have – I think that's a very cost effective way to fund the equity portion of our balance sheet, but it's all going to be tied to exactly what level of growth we’re having and because if you don't have the growth then you don't necessarily need to issue the incremental equity."

We are pleased to report that for the second straight quarter our operating results and trends were significantly better than we expected. The improving economy and resulting ramp up in demand generated sequential improvement in RevPAR throughout the quarter. This positive momentum has enabled us to increase our estimates for the second time this year, which I will discuss further in a moment.
We've also been successful in placing some great hotels under contract, which will further enhance the quality of our portfolio.
First, let's talk about our second quarter results. Our comparable hotel RevPAR for the second quarter increased 8.1% driven by an increase in occupancy of 6 percentage points and offset by a slight decrease in our average rate of $0.07. Our average rate was at $165 and our average occupancy was 73.8%. Strong group business helped drive an 8.6% increase in food and beverage revenues.
Overall revenue growth is 6.2% combined with flat comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $250 million for the second quarter and FFO per diluted share of $0.23.
On a year-to-date basis, comparable hotel RevPAR increased 3.5%, and food and beverage revenues grew 3.1%. Total year-to-date revenue growth of 1.7% combined with comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins that declined 110 basis points, resulted in year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of 376 million and year-to-date FFO per diluted share of $0.31. I should note that RevPAR improved throughout the quarter, with period six achieving RevPAR growth of nearly aided by our first overall rate growth in over a year and a half.
On a calendar-year-basis, our second quarter RevPAR was up nearly 10%. In general for the quarter the occupancy increase was better than we had expected and the average rate declined less than we anticipated resulting in a better than expected RevPAR and EBITDA.
Turning to our business mix for the quarter, we continue to see positive demand trends which resulted in a substantial increase in overall room nights for the quarter of almost 9% compare to last year. More importantly, we are seeing demand recover specifically in our higher rated business segments for both group and transient. This is an extremely positive sign and suggests that hotels were becoming less reliant on discount as booking as demand continues to strengthen.
Transient room nights increased 8%, led by an 11% increase in our Premium and Corporate segments and a 33% increase in the Special Corporate segment. The recovery and business travel that we experienced in the first quarter continued to gain momentum this quarter. In addition, the average rate in our Premium and Corporate businesses increased by more than 6% resulting in revenue growth of 8% in those segments.
Conversely, we experienced a 1% decrease in discount room nights, which was the first decline in discount room nights, which was the first decline in this segment in 2007. This should be viewed as positive sign that hotels are more confident in their ability to attract higher rate of business travelers.
Overall, the combination of higher rates and the positive shifts of business mix resulted in the transient average rate increase of almost 3% for the quarter, the first that's increased in two years leading to an increase in transient revenue of 11%.
The recovery that begun in group businesses, the beginning of the year accelerated as total groups demand increased 10% for the second quarter lead by a 16% increase in corporate group. These trends were even more pronounced in our Luxury hotels, where group activity increased by 7% and corporate group was up by 34%.
In the quarter for the quarter bookings in the discount segment grew approximately 33%, while higher rated association and corporate bookings grew 121% indicating that hotels are starting to rely less on the discount markets for short-term bookings and focus more on higher rate of business. The strong group demand combined with the gradual shifts and business mix held the average rate decline in the group to less than 5% and resulted in nearly a 5% increase in group revenues.
Group booking activity in the third quarter is showing material improvement compared to 2009. At the beginning of the second quarter, booking pace for the third quarter was down about 2%. But by the end of the quarter, booking pace compared to the prior year had improved to an increase of roughly 8%, which reflect the continued short-term nature of our group booking and our limits of visibility.
Our fourth quarter booking pace is also demonstrated sequential improvements albeit a more moderated phase. The positive results in the first half of the year combined with the strong third quarter booking pace should result in a meaningful improvement in group room nights for the full year compared to 2009.
Transient bookings for the third and fourth quarter are also trending slightly ahead of last year, especially during the holiday period. Overall, improvement is still relying on the strength of the economy. But we are signs of improvement in business travels, which is a key component to driving the recovery and rising demands.
On the investment front, we have several transactions to talk about. First, we signed an agreement to acquire the 270-room W New York Union Square in a joint venture with Union Square Real Holding Corporation through a pre-negotiated reorganization plan requiring U.S. Bankruptcy Court approval. Host will participate as a majority partner in the venture with the Eastern world to purchase the hotel. A subsidiary post will provide asset management services to the venture.
The hotel is located on the Northeast corner of Union Square Park Avenue in 17th street adjacent to pre-eminent commercial and residential neighborhood near cultural attractions, fine dining and entertainment as well some of the best shopping in the city. The building was renovated, converted to a W Hotel and opened in November of 2000. While the hotel is heavily impacted by the downturn which lead to the recent bankruptcy filing, both New York and Lifestyle oriented properties are recovering quickly as is evidence by the year-to-date 34% RevPAR increased at our W New York Hotel on Lexington Avenue.
We also recently signed an agreement to acquire the 424-room Westin Chicago River North for $165 million. The hotel is situated in a primary commercial center of the city and close to major tourist actions including the Magnificent Miles and Navy Pier in Millennium Park. The hotel is in excellent condition with large guest rooms and approximately 28,000 square feet of well-designed meeting space including an 8,400 square-foot ballroom. We expect to close this transaction in mid-August.
Finally, we signed an agreement through our joint venture Asia to develop seven of core branded hotels at a total cost of $325 million in three major markets in India, Delhi, Bangalore and Chennai through a partnership with the Accor and InterGlobe, both of which have a proven track record of successfully developing and operating hotels in India. The portfolio consists of approximately 1,750 rooms, will have a strong upscale focus that will cater to India's growing corporate market. The timeline for opening these hotels ranges from early 2011 to early 2013. Our Asia joint venture expects to invest approximately $50 million in the transaction.
We will continue to look for acquisition opportunities that meet our investment criteria and our guidance for the remainder of the year since that we will complete at least one additional deal, beyond what we've announce today given our very active pipeline. Additionally, we have not included any added dispositions in our guidance for the remainder of the year.
Capital expenditures for the second quarter, total of approximately $50 million and $100 million year-to-date, including $33 million of return on investment projects. For the full year, our expected capital expenditure estimate is $300 to 320 million.
Now, let me spend some time on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Our performance in the second quarter was significantly better than we anticipated and I previously referenced, our advance bookings for the third quarter are quite robust. As a result, despite the modest pullback in economic forecast for the remainder of the year, we believe that it is appropriate to further increase our forecast of our full year performance.
We now expect RevPAR for the year to increased 4 to 5.5% with a comparable adjusted margin change of flat through a decline of 50 basis points. Based on these assumptions, full year adjusted EBITDA would be approximately $795 to 825 million and FFO per diluted share would be $0.56 cents to $0.70.
In closing, we are up and have to think about the trends we are seeing in our business. Demand is continuing to strengthen and we are focus on our pricing strategy for continued improvement on the right side.
On the investment process, we are excited about the transactions we announced today and we will continue to aggressively look for investment opportunity, both domestically and internationally. Thank you. And now let me turn this call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating financial performance in more detail.

Let me start by giving you some detail on comparable hotel RevPAR results. Looking at the portfolio based on property types, our urban hotels performed the best during the quarter, with a RevPAR increased 9.9%. RevPAR for our suburban hotel",1477,"Thank you, Ed. Let me start by giving you some detail on comparable hotel RevPAR results. Looking at the portfolio based on property types, our urban hotels performed the best during the quarter, with a RevPAR increased 9.9%. RevPAR for our suburban hotels increased 9.4%, while RevPAR at our airport and resort conference hotels increased 5.4% and 2%, respectively.
As expected, our top performing market for the quarter was Boston, with a RevPAR increase of 23.8%. Occupancy increase nearly 30 percentage points and ADR increased 3.7%. Transient ADR was up 6% as the market benefited from compression with an increase group and citywide demand and a mix shift from discount rooms to retail and special corporate business.
Some of the improvements was due to easier comparisons as the Boston Marriot Copley Place and Sheraton in Boston were under renovation on the second quarter of 2009. For the third quarter, we expect the Boston market to perform in line with the portfolio.
RevPAR for the New Orleans Marriot increased 22.4% with an occupancy increase of 7.9 percentage points and a 10.5% increase in ADR. Group demand increased significantly allowing for an increase in transient rates for the quarter of 12.5%. We expect the hotel to have an outstanding third quarter due to additional citywide and group business as well as the benefit from demand generated by the Gulf oil spill containment and cleanup efforts.
New York also had a great quarter. With a RevPAR increased of 19.1% as occupancy grew by 9.4 percentage points and rate increase 7%. Robust transient business and strong group bookings drove the improvement and demand. Transient ADR increased 14.2% due to shift in the mix of business and rate increases. We expect New York City to have a strong third quarter due to high levels of business transient and leisure demand.
The Miami Fort Lauderdale market outperformed our expectations, with a RevPAR increased of 14.3%. Occupancy was up 11.7 percentage points while rate declined 2.9%. The outperformance was driven by growth and transient and group business as well as the impact of the late 2009 ballroom addition at the Harbor Beach Marriot Resort & Spa. We expect the Miami Fort Lauderdale market to have weak third quarter due to impact of the public space renovation at the Miami [Inaudible] Marriot and lower levels of group business.
Orange County, a market that was extremely hard hit by the housing market meltdown, had RevPAR growth of 13.3% in the quarter. Both transient and group demand was strong as occupancy increase 10 percentage points, while ADR was down 1.5%. We expect the Orange County market to slightly underperform the portfolio in the third quarter due to a slight decline in group to group business.
Before I address individual market performance, I wanted to mention that half of our top 20 markets had positive RevPAR for the quarter. Our top-performing market was Philadelphia with a RevPAR increased of 12.3%. Strong Transient, Citywide and Group business contributed to and occupancy increase of nearly 9% and an ADR decline of 2.8%. For the second quarter, we expect the Philadelphia market to underperform the portfolio due to lower levels of both transient and group demand.
The San Antonio market also performed very well, with a RevPAR increased of 7.3%. A strong citywide calendar drove an increased in compression days leading to an increased in occupancy of 5.4% and limiting the rate decline to only 0.8%. We expect San Antonio to have a decent second quarter and a strong second half of the year.
RevPAR for our San Francisco hotels increased 12.1% due to better transient and group demand. Occupancy was up 10.2 percentage points, while ADR declined 2.9%. We expect our San Francisco hotels to slightly underperform in the third quarter due to less citywide and group demand.
The Chicago market recovered from a tough first quarter to post a 9.2% RevPAR increase that was driven by a significant increase in group and transient demand. Occupancy increased 7.6 percentage points, while ADR declined 2.7%. The Swissotel, with its recent addition of 38,000 square feet of meeting space, substantially outperformed the market with a RevPAR increase of 20.6%. We expect Chicago to outperform the portfolio in the third quarter and for the Swissotel to continue to perform exceptionally well. 
RevPAR fell 2.7% for our Hawaiian hotels, as occupancy increase 7.6 percentage points due to strong transient demand while ADR fell 12.8 percent. Group demand was weak in the quarter. However, we expect the Maui market to outperform the portfolio in the third quarter due to continued improvements in airline capacity and stronger transient demand.
RevPAR for our Phoenix hotel has declined 3.9% with a 6.3 percentage point increase in occupancy and a 12% drop in ADR, primarily due to significant discounting of group rates. Transient demand has remained relatively strong. We expect our Phoenix hotels to continue to struggle in the third quarter, particularly due to the renovation of a significant amount of the meeting space at two of our hotels and the construction of a new ballroom at the Western Kierland.
As expected, the San Diego market continue to underperform due to a substantial decline in citywide and group demand and the absorption of the new Hilton that opened in 2009. RevPAR declined 12.8%, with an occupancy decline of 1.6 percentage points and a 10.8% decline in ADR. However, we expect our San Diego hotels to outperform the portfolio in the third quarter due to increased citywide activity.
Year-to-date, Boston has been our top-performing market with a RevPAR increase of 18.5%; followed by New Orleans, with a RevPAR increase of 13%; New York with a RevPAR increase of 12.4%; and Miami Fort Lauderdale with a RevPAR increase of 11.9%.
Our worst-performing markets have been San Diego, with a RevPAR decrease of 14.7%; and Hawaii, where RevPAR declined 7.7%.
For our European joint venture, RevPAR calculated in constant Euros increased 5.6% for the quarter. Occupancy increased 8.1 percentage points and ADR declined 5.8%. The Crown Plaza Amsterdam, The Sheraton Skyline in London and the Westin Palace Madrid outperformed the rest of the portfolio while the Hotel Arts Barcelona was the poorest performer. On a year-to-date basis, RevPAR calculated in constant Euros increased 3.2%.
For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels were flat, consistent with the first quarter; margins for the second quarter were significantly impacted by the level of cancellation and the attrition fees in 2009. In the second quarter of 2009, cancellation and attrition fees were approximately $16 million higher than the second quarter of 2010, accounting for 100-basis point reduction in margins.
In addition, profit [ph] level bonus expense increased significantly in the quarter resulting in a 25-basis point reduction in margins. Strong rooms flow through as a challenge when there is a substantial increase in occupancy and a decrease in rate. However, rooms flow-through was excellent for the quarter at 70.6% as rooms cost per occupied room was flat. Food and beverage flow through was also very strong at 50.7%. The shift in the mix of business to more catering and audio visual revenues and a reduction in beverage cost as a percentage of revenue led to the outperformance.
Contributing to the strong flow-through, productivity improvements led to a reduction in wages and benefits on a per occupied room basis. However, due to the overall increase in occupancy, wages and benefits increased 3.5%. Unallocated cost increased by 6% for the quarter. This increase was primarily driven by expenses that are variable with revenues, including credit card commissions, reward programs and cluster and shared service allocations.
In addition, as we mentioned in the first quarter call, the cost related to implementation of new sales and marketing initiatives would impact margins for the rest of the year and they did in the second quarter.
Showroom [ph] cost only increased 0.6% reflecting the impact of energy-saving capital improvements. Property taxes declined 2.8% while property insurance increased 15.6%. Looking out to the full year, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins to be flat at the high-end of the RevPAR range and decreased 50 basis points at the low end of the range. These amounts have been reduced by 65 basis points for the year-over-year difference in cancellation and attrition fees and 25 basis points for incremental property level bonus expense.
During the quarter, we redeemed approximately 4 million shares of our 8 7/8s Class E series of preferred stock for approximately $100 million. We finished the quarter with nearly $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and a full $600 million of capacity on our line of credit. After taking into consideration the acquisitions detailed in our press release, we would have approximately $925 million in cash and cash equivalents.
This completes our prepared remarks, we are now interested in answering any questions you may have.

Food and beverage tends to is really tied more to whether the source of business is outlets or the source of business is banquet. The 50% flow-through we had this quarter was quite good.

But that class, when they start a travel is probably not going to be staying in a luxury hotels, they're going to need something that's a little bit more affordable. And that's really true whether it's for leisure or whether it's for business. So, bottom line is as we look at both India and China, while we would be interested in opportunities that were higher price points, our sense is that these are sort of the right price point to be investing in those markets.

So, by definition the market is a little bit stronger. I would still say that as we - this is - we're nowhere near a hot market yet. What you're seeing happen at this point is, I think consistent with the way some of us has predicted which is whether its distress in the form of the W deal, where you have a deal that is essentially blown up, gone into the bankruptcy and needs to be worked out or it's a situation that we really face in the opportunity on the West and where there wasn't a distress situation but simply there was debt coming due in the near-term and the ultimately the owner made a decision that it was probably better to sell rather than try to refinance that debt.
We're starting to see that in pending debt bubbles start to create in some passions and transactions. And I suspect that as we go forward over the next six to 12 months, we'll continue to see that those two forces are the primary motivation behind the transactions that happen. That doesn't mean that there won't be transactions that just happened because somebody has made a decision that take advantage of whatever capital to have it in asset and unsell because they have a better place to the deploy the capital, but I think it's still - in the near term it's more likely to be the other type of deal.

I would bet that if you look - in general, we'll be investing more dollars over the next couple of years in the U.S. than we will be investing internationally, but I think you'll find that the balance between our international activity and our domestic activity will be more even than it's been in the past. We certainly are seeing some interesting opportunities in the Europe right now and are pursuing those. We also have some other things in the pipeline in Asia although nothing that we obviously were prepared to announce at this point in time, and we have a number of things that we're looking at in the United States too.
So, will just have to - yes, some of it is just a function of how quickly the transactions go from the initial stages of activity to actually turning into a transaction. When it comes to the pricing question, it is really difficult to give a short answer to that question because the reality, is that if you look across the United States, for example, the market like New York, where you have had a very deep decline over the course of 2008 and 2009, but where one would likely anticipate a very strong recovery, hence it'll lead you towards lower cap rates.
Other markets, Washington D.C., for example, which is a market that while it fell, fell, I think roughly half as that much as on the top line as New York, you would logically expect to see slightly higher cap rates because you're both working off of a better level of income to start and you're not necessarily expecting to see quite the same level of ramp up over the next couple of years as you'd like to see New York. I think you could see in certain markets, you could see some sub-bicap [ph] rates for this year and on the other it's probably for the more stabilized market you'd be a little bit above that.
All of these, the cap rates are probably based on the series though that you're going to see relatively healthy growth in U.S. domestic markets looking out the next couple of years. If you look at Europe, you're probably looking at a situation that is somewhat analogous to Washington DC, maybe slightly lower cap rates there because of a historical level of cap rates that typically have been a little bit lower than the U.S. But the key European markets, London, Paris and some others, did not necessarily get as hit as hard as some of the prime markets in the United States. And so you'll see that reflected in the pricing.
Asia cap rates are far more varied because you have a combination of both stabilized or mature markets combined with some of these other places where people are projecting very strong economic growth and the cap rates in some of the markets will, again, vary based upon the opportunity whether its development or existing. But in those markets that are less mature, you're typically going to see both a higher cap rate but more importantly, a higher projected overall level of return.
I'd probably circle back on the whole point of cap rates for us, certainly the current cap rate is important, most certainly the relationship to replacement cost is important, but ultimately when we're looking at an acquisition, we're looking to achieve a premium to our cost of capital in our acquisition and that's calculated in the form of the 10-year unlevered IRR and so that becomes the basis for how we decide if an acquisition makes sense or not.

Given that my response earlier and in my comments about the fact that we're not likely to be an aggressive seller in 2010, it is less likely that that would end up creating the need for special dividend.

And I guess the kick off on the acquisition in Chicago of the Westin, I'm sure if there's something that might be unique about that asset that drove the per peak consideration up just because looking at the comps over the last three to four years most of the full-service hotels in the downtown Chicago areas sold around 300,000 a key and I think even the one adjacent to it has hold right around that price.

The first off is that I have to admit it, I'm not totally familiar with some of the other deals that you have referenced in your notes this morning, but my sense at least on a few of them is that there were fairly material CapEx needs for those hotels, which was probably built into the - was built into the deal but not into the quoted price.
In this instance, we have a very minimal capital program for this hotel based on our acquisition analysis, so we don't feel a need as we have in other acquisitions to where we're going to need to invest a lot into the hotel. So that might be one area of difference. Certainly this hotel from a standpoint of its performance and from the sizes of rooms, the overall quality in the box, I think stands in the relatively top number of hotels in this kind of class level within the Chicago market.
I'd also note that one of the things that was attractive to us about this acquisition is the fact that this is a fairly advantageous management contract. It expires in 2020 or rather to say differently, the owner has the right to decide to extend it in 2020, not the operator, which as you know is a bit unusual and when you think about what that means in terms of back quality of asset in that type of a location, we at least have the flexibility around what slogs [ph] the hotel might slide, certainly doest land to a better cap rate on a sale in a pro forma that we might be using to analyze the asset.

I wouldn't want to - while I wouldn't necessarily say that the window is lengthening necessarily although there are some properties where you are starting to see some signs of that. I think what we were taking comfort in was the fact that we haven't seen consistent short-term booking pace strength and that's been happening now for two or three quarters in a row and while the out quarters are probably still tracking a little bit behind where they might have been in the prior year, the reality is that this gap between where they are and where they were is closing. And so we are seeing that as we look forward, I think we're getting more optimistic about the fact that we will continue to see as we get to the start of each quarter that we will be seeing more of the group room nights on the book than where we had been in the prior year.
But I think the other part has kind of drives our sense of how the rest of the year will play out, relates back to some of the comments that I made relative to what we were seeing from corporate demand. Our corporate demand has really been growing both at the Special Corporate level and in terms of just regular business travel. As you well know, that the segment of our business, the latter one that pays the highest rate and so can, and the fact that we are actually able across the portfolio to see an increase in those rates we took it's quite a good sign. But we're also finding that our hotels are feeling less of a need to offer discounts in order to attract business. And I think that's key because that means you're really not sacrificing rate any more to attract business. You're really getting more comfortable that you're going to see that the business is going to materialize from your better paying customers.
Kind of going back to the group side for a second, one interesting thing for most of our operators is that they are finding that the business that they're booking now is at higher rates than where they booked last year. So not only is the pace of the bookings up but the rates that they're booking at are also higher. So, when we put all of that together, while obviously there's some of the press around the economy has not been ideal and we do have some concern around some of the most recent measures of consumer confidence, we see that being somewhat offset by the outlook for business investment, which continues to improve and the net of it is we just felt better about the second half of the year and you see that in our revised guidance.

But on your second question about whether at least to acquisition opportunities, I think that's a really interesting question.
I don't know that brand standards per se is going to necessarily create an investment opportunity. But what I will say, what will create the investment opportunity is that hotels that were bought in six or seven and over levered, are now starting to get to the point where they may be facing in 2010 and '11 their third year were capital spending has been materially constrained because the property has not been generating the cash flow that that equates to both service to debt and service to property.
And so while brand standards alone aren't going to create the problems, at the reality is that as you well know in the hotel industry you get to a tipping point with an asset where if you don't maintain it to a certain level, customers ultimately understand that feedback, feel that and stop showing up at that hotel. That ultimately starts the hotel on a spiral. So, as lenders begin to understand that the hotel is getting to that tipping point, they would logically be more aggressive about demanding action either in the form of the debt pay-down or investment in the hotel in some faction and I think in a lot of cases that could create opportunity. But it'll come more out of the overall physical condition and not just simply the re-institution of brand standards.

It's going to take a while before that equation falls and gets back into an off-balance to where we would see adequate returns to contemplate new development. So, again, I wouldn't say never but I wouldn't see that as a near-term priority in the U.S. for sure.

Not only do you have the partial year effective in you, but there are some new accounting requirements that Larry is far more qualified to explain than I am, that essentially require that we write off the acquisition cost associated with the deal at closing as opposed to capitalizing and amortizing them over the life of the deal.

What you're generally seeing, and as I say this I think it will make sense to most people is that core business that is being booked in the relatively near term. From all practical perspective, you're seeing relatively minor cancellations and attrition fees. Some of that is the competitive landscape that we're operating in, some of it is reflecting that's not a point that it's worth the hotel negotiating a lot over because at this point, if you're negotiating for a group of that in the next 90 days, odds are pretty good you're going to have it anyway.
So at the end of the day, if you had a choice between negotiating for a little bit higher food and beverage offering versus getting a cancellation fee, you're going to go for the money, not for the sort of safety. As you start to work your way longer term and look at business as being booked for '11 and '12, the situation begins to shift a little bit more. I would say that our sense that we're still not back to where we were to '05, '06 and '07, where we were getting fairly significant cancellation fees, but we're certainly negotiating for something in this timeframe. And that will depend a lot, it's a market by market phenomenon and it also depends a little bit on what time of year you're looking at it, to whether the business is in a period where we are highly confident we can replace it or a period of time where it's more aggressive where there's more demand versus a period whether there isn't a lot of demand and we really want a piece of business in that pie.

At least sounds from your comments, at least on the group side, that's really not having yet of an impact of any corporate pulling back. But I'm curious as you start approaching the fall on your corporate rate negotiation, how you think that would trend and whether there is any concern in terms of corporate and businesses in terms of the amount of space that they're taking and the rate that they're willing to pay.

As I said before so far, while we've all read different economics statistics that has showed up in the press, we haven't necessarily seen an impact on that. But, conversely, was also beside about the fact that primarily a lot of our near-term demand is really for fairly short term, so it's certainly a trend that we're watching.
As we think about the year though, and we watch the trends that we're seeing and as I get feedback from the operators who are of course one step closer to this negotiation process certainly than we are, they're not sensing, at least so far, a desire on the part of companies to pull back. And I think they are sending a strong message and I've already talked about this a little bit last week that we're going to be expecting and start to look for meaningful rate increases in our Special Corporate negotiations for next year.
I think we're also bit of sending the messages as we start to talk about group business that they should be assuming the group business will be booked at higher rates, not lower rates. My sense is that that message is being accepted. It doesn't mean it won't ultimately get negotiated but it is being accepted out there by the corporate customer that we're talking about.
As we think about how to approach certainly the second in the last few months of this year and the beginning of 2011, we're going to continue to emphasize what we think is the strength in our properties, which is our positioning on the group side and are going to be looking and try to build a pretty solid group base and we're going to continue to try to do a fair amount of business on the Special Corporate side.
We've been talking about so far this year, the fact that we were up somewhere in the 20s in the first quarter, we're up 33% this quarter, Special Corporate business. Well, I suspect that we will lose some of those accounts as we work our way into 2010 because we will be priced a little too richly for some of those corporate customers to come back. We're still going to be focusing on that as a key segment of our demand for next year at a higher rate, not a lower rate like it's been this year. And our efforts to just give ourselves a little bit of protection on the downside in case some of this weakness in the economy lasts longer than we would all like it to.

So, we're seeing good trends there in as sense that while we were behind, we're shipping it away pretty quickly and the bookings that we saw on the last quarter for 2011 were picking up some momentum.
The interesting thing on that side is that from a rate perspective, we're fairly flat right now, which is actually better than where we are at '10 and I would be expecting based on the feedback that we're getting about the ability to book business at higher rates than we did last year's cause we'll start to see that tide turn as we work our way through the second half of this year.

I do think that you're still binding that everyone is kind of think through some of the comments, especially some of the more recent questions we just have. There is a level of uncertainty out there and to some degree, it's probably leading people to be cautious about bookings. But, again, remember that was the degree of occupancy decline as the industry suffered and recognize that for the last 15 to 18 months, we've trained people that you could afford to wait for the last minute to make a decision in order to get the room because the rooms have been there.
Hopefully that's starting to change. Hopefully in a call or two we're talking about an extended booking cycle, which is suggesting that somebody has called out try to get a room and it wasn't available or try to get meeting space and it wasn't available, which starts to train people the other direction, which is basically forcing them to commit a little bit sooner. I suspect were in that involving state of going from where I was, you could assume you can get space and now, where you have to think a little bit more about it, you may have to make that extra phone call to find it and then hopefully another couple of quarters, where to point where you start to see that booking cycle lengthen and we're starting to sell rooms a little bit faster.

We are pleased to report that for the second straight quarter our operating results and trends were significantly better than we expected. The improving economy and resulting ramp up in demand generated sequential improvement in RevPAR throughout the quarter. This positive momentum has enabled us to increase our estimates for the second time this year, which I will discuss further in a moment. We've also been successful in placing some great hotels under contract, which will further enhance the quality of our portfolio. First, let's talk about our second quarter results.
Our comparable hotel RevPAR for the second quarter increased 8.1% driven by an increase in occupancy of six percentage points and offset by a slight decrease in our average rate of 710. Our average rate was $175 and our average occupancy was 73.8%. Strong group business helped drive an 8.6% increase in food and beverage revenues. Overall revenue growth of 6.2%, combined with flat comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin, resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $250 million for the second quarter and FFO per diluted share of $0.23. On a year-to-date basis, comparable hotel RevPAR increased 3.5% and food and beverage revenues grew 3.1%. Total year-to-date revenue growth of 1.7%, combined with comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin that declined 110 basis points, resulted in year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $376 million and year-to-date FFO per diluted share of $0.31. I should note that RevPAR improved throughout the quarter with period six achieving RevPAR growth of nearly 10% aided by our first overall rate growth in over a year and a half. On a calendar year basis, our second-quarter RevPAR was up nearly 10%. In general, for the quarter, the occupancy increase was better than we had expected and the average rate declined less than we anticipated resulting in a better-than-expected RevPAR and EBITDA.
Turning to our business mix for the quarter, we continue to see positive demand trends, which resulted in a substantial increase in overall room nights for the quarter of almost 9% compared to last year. More importantly, we are seeing demand recovered specifically in our higher-rated business segments for both group and transient. This is an extremely positive sign and suggests that hotels are becoming less reliant on discounted booking as demand continues to strengthen. Transient room nights increased 8% led by an 11% increase in our Premium and Corporate segments and a 33% increase in the Special Corporate segment. The recovery in business travel that we experienced in the first quarter continued to gain momentum this quarter. In addition, the average rate in our premium and corporate businesses increased by more than 6%, resulting in revenue growth of 18% in those segments. Conversely, we experienced a 1% decrease in discount room nights, which was the first decline in this segment since 2007. This should be viewed as a positive sign that hotels are more confident in their ability to attract higher-rated business travelers. Overall, the combination of higher rates and the positive shift of business mix resulted in a transient average rate increase of almost 3% for the quarter, the first such increase in two years, leading to an increase in transient revenue of 11%. The recovery that began in group business at the beginning of the year accelerated as total group demand increased 10% for the second quarter, led by a 16% increase in Corporate group. These trends were even more pronounced in our luxury hotels where group activity increased by 27% and Corporate group was up by 34%. In-the-quarter for-the-quarter bookings in the discount segment grew approximately 33% while higher-rated association and corporate bookings grew 121%, indicating that hotels are starting to rely less on the discount market for short-term bookings and focus more on higher-rated business. The strong group demand, combined with the gradual shift in business mix held the average rate decline in group to less than 5% and resulted in nearly a 5% increase in group revenues. 
Group booking activity in the third quarter is showing material improvement compared to 2009. At the beginning of the second quarter, booking pace for the third quarter was down about 2%. But by the end of the quarter, booking pace compared to the prior year had improved to an increase of roughly 8%, which reflects the continued short-term nature of our group bookings and our limited visibility. 
Our fourth quarter booking pace has also demonstrated sequential improvement albeit at a more moderated pace. The positive results in the first half of the year combined with the strong third quarter booking pace should result in a meaningful improvement in group room nights for the full year compared to 2009. Transient bookings for the third and fourth quarter are also trending slightly ahead of last year, especially during the holiday period. Overall, improvement is still reliant on the strength of the economy but we are seeing signs of improvement in business travel which is a key component to driving the recovery in lodging demand.
On the investment front, we have several transactions to talk about. First, we signed an agreement to acquire the 270-room W New York Union Square in a joint venture with Union Square Real Holding Corp. through a pre-negotiated reorganization plan requiring U.S. Bankruptcy Court approval. Host will participate as a majority partner in a venture with Istithmar World to purchase the hotel. A subsidiary post will provide asset management services to the venture. The hotel is located on the northeast corner of Union Square, Park Avenue and 17th street, adjacent to pre-eminent commercial and residential neighborhoods near cultural attractions, fine dining and entertainment as well as some of the best shopping in the city. The building was renovated, converted to a W Hotel and opened in November of 2000. While the hotel is heavily impacted by the downturn, which led to the recent bankruptcy filing, both New York and lifestyle-oriented properties are recovering quickly as is evidenced by the year-to-date 34% RevPAR increase at our W New York Hotel on Lexington Avenue. We also recently signed an agreement to acquire the 424-room Westin Chicago River North for $165 million. The hotel is situated in a primary commercial center of the city and close to major tourist attractions including the Magnificent Mile, the Navy Pier and Millennium Park. The hotel is in excellent condition with large guestrooms and approximately 28,000 square feet of well-designed meeting space including an 8,400-square-foot ballroom. We expect to close this transaction in mid-August. 
Finally, we signed an agreement through our joint venture in Asia to develop seven Accor-branded hotels at a total cost of $325 million in three major markets in India: Delhi, Bangalore and Chennai, through a partnership with Accor and InterGlobe, both of which have a proven track record of successfully developing and operating hotels in India. The portfolio consists of approximately 1,750 rooms, will have a strong upscale focus that will cater to India's growing corporate market. The timeline for opening these hotels ranges from early 2011 to early 2013. Our Asian joint venture expects to invest approximately $50 million in the transaction. We will continue to look for acquisition opportunities that meet our investment criteria and our guidance for the remainder of the year assumes that we will complete at least one additional deal beyond what we've announced today given our very active pipeline. Additionally, we have not included any added dispositions in our guidance for the remainder of the year. 
Capital expenditures for the second quarter totaled approximately $50 million and $100 million year-to-date, including $33 million of return on investment projects. For the full year, our expected capital expenditure estimate is $300 million to $320 million.
Now let me spend some time on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Our performance in the second quarter was significantly better than we anticipated and as I previously referenced, our advance bookings for the third quarter are quite robust. As a result, despite the modest pullback in economic forecast for the remainder of the year, we believe it is appropriate to further increase our forecast of our full-year performance. We now expect RevPAR for the year to increase to 4% to 5.5%, with a comparable adjusted margin change of flat to a decline of 50 basis points. Based on these assumptions, full-year adjusted EBITDA would be approximately $795 million to $825 million and FFO per diluted share would be $0.66 to $0.70. 
In closing, we are optimistic about the trends we are seeing in our business. Demand is continuing to strengthen and we are focused on our pricing strategies for continued improvement on the rate side. On the investment front, we are excited about the transactions we announced today and we will continue to aggressively look for investment opportunities both domestically and internationally. Thank you, and now let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."

As expected, our top-performing market for the quarter was Boston, with a RevPAR increase of 23.8%, occupancy increased nearly 13 percentage points and ADR increased 3.7%. Transient ADR was up 6% as the market benefited from compression with an increased group and citywide demand and a mix shift from discount rooms to retail in Special Corporate business. Some of the improvement was due to easier comparisons as the Boston Marriott Copley Place and Sheraton Boston were under renovation in the second quarter of 2009. For the third quarter, we expect the Boston market to perform in line with the portfolio. RevPAR for the New Orleans Marriott increased 22.4%, with an occupancy increase of 7.9 percentage points and a 10.5% increase in ADR. Group demand increased significantly, allowing for an increase in transient rates for the quarter of 12.5%. We expect the hotel to have an outstanding third quarter due to additional citywide and group business as well as the benefit from demand generated by the Gulf oil spill containment and cleanup efforts. New York also had a great quarter, with a RevPAR increase of 19.1% as occupancy grew by 9.4 percentage points and rate increased 7%. Robust transient business and strong group bookings drove the improvement in demand. Transient ADR increased 14.2% due to a shift in the mix of business and rate increases. We expect New York City to have a strong third quarter due to high levels of business transient and leisure demand. The Miami-Fort Lauderdale market outperformed our expectations with a RevPAR increase of 14.3%. Occupancy was up 11.7 percentage points while rate declined 2.9%. The outperformance was driven by growth and transient and group business as well as the impact of the late 2009 ballroom addition at the Harbor Beach Marriott Resort and Spa. We expect the Miami-Fort Lauderdale market to have a weak third quarter due to the impact of the public space renovation at the Miami Biscayne Bay Marriott and lower levels of group business. Orange County, a market that was extremely hard hit by the housing market meltdown, had RevPAR growth of 13.3% in the quarter. Both transient and group demand were strong as occupancy increased 10 percentage points while ADR was down 1.5%. We expect the Orange County market to slightly underperform the portfolio in the third quarter due to a slight decline in group business.
RevPAR for our San Francisco hotels increased 12.1% due to better transient and group demand. Occupancy was up 10.2 percentage points, while ADR declined 2.9%. We expect our San Francisco hotels to slightly underperform the portfolio in the third quarter due to less citywide and group demand. The Chicago market recovered from a tough first quarter to post a 9.2% RevPAR increase that was driven by a significant increase in group and transient demand. Occupancy increased 7.6 percentage points while ADR declined 2.7%. The Swissotel, with its recent addition of 38,000 square feet of meeting space, substantially outperformed the market with a RevPAR increase of 20.6%. We expect our Chicago hotels to outperform the portfolio in the third quarter and for the Swissotel to continue to perform exceptionally well. RevPAR fell 2.7% for our Hawaiian hotels as occupancy increased 7.6 percentage points due to strong transient demand, while ADR fell 12.8%. Group demand was weak in the quarter; however, we expect the Maui market to outperform the portfolio in the third quarter due to continued improvements in airline capacity and stronger transient demand. RevPAR for our Phoenix hotels declined 3.9% with a 6.3 percentage point increase in occupancy and a 12% drop in ADR, primarily due to significant discounting of group rates. Transient demand has remained relatively strong. We expect our Phoenix hotels to continue to struggle in the third quarter, particularly due to the renovation of a significant amount of the meeting space at two of our hotels and the construction of a new ballroom at the Westin Kierland. 
As expected, the San Diego market continued to underperform due to a substantial decline in citywide and group demand and the absorption of the new Hilton that opened in 2009. RevPAR declined 12.8%, with an occupancy decline of 1.6 percentage points and a 10.8% decline in ADR. However, we expect our San Diego hotels to outperform the portfolio in the third quarter due to increased citywide activity. Year-to-date, Boston has been our top-performing market with a RevPAR increase of 18.5%; followed by New Orleans, with a RevPAR increase of 13%; New York with a RevPAR increase of 12.4%; and Miami-Fort Lauderdale with a RevPAR increase of 11.9%. Our worst performing markets have been San Diego, with a RevPAR decrease of 14.7%; and Hawaii, where RevPAR declined 7.7%. For our European joint venture, RevPAR calculated in constant euros increased 5.6% for the quarter. Occupancy increased 8.1 percentage points and ADR declined 5.8%. The Crowne Plaza Amsterdam, the Sheraton Skyline in London and The Westin Palace, Madrid outperformed the rest of the portfolio while The Hotel Arts, Barcelona was the poorest performer. On a year-to-date basis, RevPAR calculated in constant euros increased 3.2%. For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels were flat. Consistent with the first quarter, margins for the second quarter were significantly impacted by the level of cancellation and attrition fees in 2009. In the second quarter of 2009, cancellation and attrition fees were approximately $16 million higher than the second quarter of 2010, accounting for a 100 basis point reduction in margins. In addition, property-level bonus expense increased significantly in the quarter, resulting in a 25 basis point reduction in margins. Strong rooms flow-through is a challenge when there is a substantial increase in occupancy and a decrease in rate. However, rooms flow-through was excellent for the quarter at 70.6% as rooms cost per occupied room was flat. Food and beverage flow-through was also very strong at 50.7%. The shift in the mix of business to more catering and audio-visual revenues and a reduction in beverage costs as a percentage of revenue led to the outperformance. 
Contributing to the strong flow-through, productivity improvements led to a reduction in wages and benefits on a per-occupied room basis. However, due to the overall increase in occupancy, wages and benefits increased 3.5%. Unallocated costs increased by 6% for the quarter. This increase was primarily driven by expenses that are variable with revenues, including credit card commissions, reward programs and cluster and shared service allocations. In addition, as we mentioned on the first quarter call, the costs related to implementation of new sales and marketing initiatives would impact margins for the rest of the year and they did in the second quarter. 
Utility costs only increased 0.6% reflecting the impact of energy-saving capital improvements. Property taxes declined 2.8% while property insurance increased 15.6%. Looking out to the full year, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins to be flat at the high-end of the RevPAR range and decrease 50 basis points at the low end of the range. These amounts have been reduced by 65 basis points for the year-over-year difference in cancellation and attrition fees and 25 basis points for incremental property level bonus expense. 
During the quarter, we redeemed approximately 4 million shares of our 8-7/8% Class E series of preferred stock for approximately $100 million. We finished the quarter with nearly $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and the full $600 million of capacity on our line of credit. After taking into consideration the acquisitions detailed in our press release, we would have approximately $925 million in cash and cash equivalents. This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have."

But we kind of felt that the midscale and upscale versus upper upscale and luxury probably present a better opportunity, in part because as you look at the opportunity for increase in demand in India and China, it is as much driven by the increasing wealth of those populations and more people moving into the middle class, which should, based on history, suggest more people traveling. But that class, when they start to travel, are probably not going to be staying in luxury hotels. They're going to need something that's a bit more affordable. And that's really true whether it's for leisure or whether it's for business. So bottom line is as we've looked at both India and China, while we would be interested in opportunities that were at higher price points, our sense is that these are sort of the right price point to be investing in those markets."

I would still say though, that as we -- we're nowhere near a hot market yet. What you're seeing happen at this point is, I think, consistent with the way some of us had predicted which is whether its distress in the form of the W deal, where you have a deal that has essentially blown up, gone into bankruptcy and needs to be worked out or it's a situation that we really faced in the opportunity on the Westin, where there wasn't a distress situation but simply there was debt coming due in the near-term and that ultimately the owner made a decision that it was probably better to sell rather than try to refinance that debt. We're starting to see that impending debt bubble start to create, in some fashion, some transactions. And I suspect that as we go forward over the next six to 12 months, we'll continue to see that those two forces are the primary motivation behind the transactions that happen. That doesn't mean that there won't be transactions that just happen because somebody has made a decision to take advantage of whatever capital they have in an asset and unsell because they have a better place to the deploy the capital but I think it's still, in the near term, it's more likely to be the other type of deal."

I would bet that if you look -- in general, we'll be investing more dollars over the next couple of years in the U.S. than we will be investing internationally, but I think you'll find that the balance between our international activity and our domestic activity will be more even than it's been in the past. We certainly are seeing some interesting opportunities in Europe right now and are pursuing those. We also have some other things in the pipeline in Asia, although nothing that we obviously were prepared to announce at this point in time, and we have a number of things that we're looking at in the United States too. So we'll just have to -- some of it's just a function of how quickly these transactions go from the initial stages of activity to actually turning into a transaction. When it comes to the pricing question, it is really difficult to give a short answer to that question because the reality is, is that if you look across the United States, for example, markets like New York where you had a very deep decline over the course of 2008 and 2009 but where one would likely anticipate a very strong recovery, potentially lead you towards lower cap rates. Other markets, Washington D.C., for example, which is a market that while it fell, fell I think, roughly half as much as on the topline as New York, you would logically expect to see slightly higher cap rates because you're both working off of a better level of income to start and you're not necessarily expecting to see quite the same level of ramp up over the next couple of years as you'd like to see in New York. I think you could see in certain markets, you could see some sub-prime cap rates for this year and on the other it's -- probably for the more stabilized markets you'd be a little bit above that. All of the cap rates are probably based on a theory, though, that you're going to see relatively healthy growth in the U.S. domestic markets looking out the next couple of years. If you look at Europe, you're probably looking at a situation that is somewhat analogous to Washington D.C., maybe slightly lower cap rates there because of a historical level of cap rates that typically have been a little bit lower than the U.S. But the key European markets, London, Paris and some others, did not necessarily get as hit as hard as some of the prime markets in the United States. And so you'll see that reflected in the pricing. Asia cap rates are far more varied because you have a combination of both stabilized or mature markets combined with some of these other places where people are projecting very strong economic growth. And the cap rates in some of the markets will again vary, based upon the opportunity whether its development or existing. But in those markets that are less mature, you're typically going to see both a higher cap rate but more importantly, a higher projected overall level of return. I'd probably circle back on the whole point of cap rates is that, for us, certainly the current cap rate is important, most certainly the relationship to replacement cost is important, but ultimately when we're looking at an acquisition, we're looking to achieve a premium to our cost of capital in our acquisitions and that's calculated in the form of a 10-year unlevered IRR. And so that becomes the basis for how we decide if an acquisition makes sense or not."

First off is that, I have to admit I'm not totally familiar with some of the other deals that you have referenced in your note this morning but my sense at least on a few of them is that there were fairly material CapEx needs for those hotels which was probably built into the deal but not into the quoted price. In this instance, we have a very minimal capital program for this hotel based on our acquisition analysis so we don't feel a need as we have in other acquisitions to where we're going to need to invest a lot into the hotel. So that might be one area of difference. Certainly this hotel, from a standpoint of its performance and from the size of the rooms, the overall quality of the box, I think stands in the relatively top number of hotels in this kind of class level within the Chicago market. I'd also note that one of the things that was attractive to us about this acquisition is the fact that this is a fairly advantageous management contract. It expires in 2020 or rather to say differently, the owner has the right to decide to extend it in 2020, not the operator, which as you know is a bit unusual, and when you think about what that means in terms of that quality of asset in that type of a location, to at least have the flexibility around what flags the hotel might fly. Certainly does lend to a better cap rate on a sale in a pro forma that we might be using to analyze the asset."

I wouldn't necessarily say that the window is lengthening necessarily, although there are some properties where you are starting to see some signs of that. I think what we were taking comfort in was the fact that we haven't seen consistent short-term booking pace strength and that's been happening now for two or three quarters in a row and while the out quarters are probably still tracking a little bit behind where they might have been in the prior year, the reality is that the gap between where they are and where they were is closing. And so we are seeing that as we look forward, I think we're getting more optimistic about the fact that we will continue to see as we get to the start of each quarter that we will be seeing more of the group room nights on the book than where we had been in the prior year. But I think the other part that kind of drives our sense of how the rest of the year will play out, relates back to some of the comments that I made relative to what we were seeing from corporate demand. Our corporate demand has really been growing both at the Special Corporate level and in terms of just regular business travel. As you well know, that's the segment of our business, the latter one, that pays the highest rate and the fact that we were actually able, across the portfolio, to see an increase in those rates we took as quite a good sign. But we're also finding that our hotels are feeling less of a need to offer discounts in order to attract business. And I think that's key because that means you're really not sacrificing rate any more to attract business. You're really getting more comfortable that you're going to see additional -- that the business is going to materialize from your better paying customers. Kind of going back to the group side for a second, one interesting theme for most of our operators is that they are finding that the business that they're booking now is at higher rates than where they booked last year. So not only is the pace of booking up, but the rates that they're booking at are also higher. So when we put all of that together, while obviously there's some of the press around the economy has not been ideal and we do have some concern around some of the most recent measures of consumer confidence, we see that being somewhat offset by the outlook for business investment, which continues to improve and the net of it is we just felt better about the second half of the year and you see that in our revised guidance."

And maybe more importantly, do you think it could also be a catalyst for acquisitions for you guys to the extent that there are people out there who are maybe a little cash poor and can't put through some of these reinstated brand standards?"

But on your second question about whether it leads to acquisition opportunities, I think that's a really interesting question. I don't know that brand standards per se is going to necessarily create an investment opportunity but what I will say, what will create the investment opportunity is that hotels that were bought in '06 or '07 and over-levered are now starting to get to the point where they may be facing in 2010 and '11, their third year, where capital spending has been materially constrained because the property has not been generating the cash flow that's adequate to both service to debt and service to property. And so while brand standards alone aren't going to create the problem, the reality is, is that as you well know in the hotel industry you get to a tipping point with an asset where if you don't maintain it to a certain level, customers ultimately understand that, see that, feel that and stop showing up at that hotel. That ultimately starts the hotel on a spiral. So as lenders begin to understand that a hotel is getting to that tipping point, they would logically be more aggressive about demanding action either in the form of a debt pay-down or investment in the hotel in some fashion and I think in a lot of cases that could create opportunity. But it'll come more out of the overall physical condition and not just simply the re-institution of brand standards."

I've learned never to say never, so I'm certainly not going to sit here and say we would never do a new development transaction in the U.S, but if you step back and look at just the fundamentals of our business, if you look at the degree to which EBITDA has fallen, if you look at where construction pricing is, if you kind of look at the discount between where value is in the states to where replacement cost is, it's going to take a while before that equation falls and gets back into enough balance to where we would see adequate returns to contemplate new development.

Not only do you have the partial year effect hitting you but there are some new accounting requirements that Larry is far more qualified to explain than I am, but essentially require that we write off the acquisition costs associated with the deal at closing as opposed to capitalizing them and amortizing them over the life of the deal.

What you're generally seeing, and as I say this I think it'll make sense to most people, is that core business that is being booked in the relatively near term. From all practical perspective you're seeing relatively minor cancellations and attrition fees. Some of that is the competitive landscape that we're operating in, some of it is reflecting that, that's not a point that it's worth the hotel negotiating a lot over because at this point, if you're negotiating for a group event in the next 90 days, odds are pretty good you're going to have it anyway. So at the end of the day, if you had a choice between negotiating for a little bit higher food and beverage offering versus getting a cancellation fee, you're going to go for the money, not for the sort of the safety. As you start to work your way longer term and look at business as being booked for '11 and '12, the situation begins to shift a little bit more. I would say that, our sense is that we're still not back to where we were in '05, '06 and '07 where we were getting fairly significant cancellation fees but we're certainly negotiating for something in this time frame. And that will depend a lot on, it's a market by market phenomenon and it also depends a little bit on what time of year you're looking at as to whether the business is in a period where we are highly confident we can replace it or a period of time where it's more aggressive, where there's more demand, versus a period where there isn't a lot of demand and we really want a piece of business in that pie."

As I said before so far, while we've all read different economic statistics that have showed up in the press, we haven't necessarily seen an impact on that. But conversely, we've also been talking about the fact that primarily a lot of our near-term demand has really been fairly short-term, so it's certainly a trend that we're watching. As we think about the year though, and we watch the trends that we're seeing and as I get feedback from the operators who are of course one step closer to this negotiation process certainly than we are, they're not sensing, at least so far, a desire on the part of companies to pull back. And I think they are sending a strong message, and Arnie talked about this a bit last week, that we're going to be expecting and start to look for meaningful rate increases in our Special Corporate negotiations for next year. I think we're also sending the message as we start to talk about group business that they should be assuming that group business will be booked at higher rates, not lower rates. My sense is that, that message is being accepted. It doesn't mean it won't ultimately get negotiated but it is being accepted out there by the corporate customers that we're talking about. As we think about how to approach certainly the second in the last few months of this year and the beginning of 2011, we're going to continue to emphasize what we think is the strength in our properties, which is our positioning on the group side and are going to be looking and try to build a pretty solid group phase and we're going to continue to try to do a fair amount of business on the Special Corporate side. We've been talking about so far this year, the fact that, I think we were up somewhere in the 20s in the first quarter, we're up 33% this quarter, in Special Corporate business. While I suspect that we will lose some of those accounts as we work our way into 2010 because we will be priced a little too richly for some of those corporate customers to come back, we're still going to be focusing on that as a key segment of our demand for next year at a higher rate, not a lower rate like it's been this year.

Based on what we've been seeing, I would be expecting that we would start off 2011 at least as good as 2010 and hopefully a little bit better."

I do think that you're still finding that everyone is kind of -- I think through some of the comments especially some of the more recent questions we just had, there is a level of uncertainty out there and to some degree, it is probably leading people to be cautious about bookings but again, remember that where the degree of occupancy declined as the industry suffered and recognize that for the last 15 to 18 months, we've trained people that you could afford to wait for the last minute to make a decision in order to get a room because the rooms have been there. Hopefully that's starting to change. Hopefully in a call or two we're talking about an extended booking cycle which is suggesting that somebody has called up, tried to get a room and it wasn't available, or they're trying to get meeting space and it wasn't available, which start to train people in the other direction which is basically forcing them to commit a little bit sooner. I suspect we're in that evolving state of going from where it was you could assume that you could get space, to now where you have to think a little bit more about it and you may have to make that extra phone call to find it and hopefully in another couple of quarters, we're at a point where you start to see that booking cycle lengthen and we're starting to sell rooms a little bit faster."

We are pleased to report that for the second straight quarter our operating results and trends were significantly better than we expected. The improving economy and resulting ramp up in demand generated sequential improvement in RevPAR throughout the quarter. This positive momentum has enabled us to increase our estimates for the second time this year, which I will discuss further in a moment. We've also been successful in placing some great hotels under contract, which will further enhance the quality of our portfolio. First, let's talk about our second quarter results.
Our comparable hotel RevPAR for the second quarter increased 8.1% driven by an increase in occupancy of six percentage points and offset by a slight decrease in our average rate of 710. Our average rate was $175 and our average occupancy was 73.8%. Strong group business helped drive an 8.6% increase in food and beverage revenues. Overall revenue growth of 6.2%, combined with flat comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin, resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $250 million for the second quarter and FFO per diluted share of $0.23. On a year-to-date basis, comparable hotel RevPAR increased 3.5% and food and beverage revenues grew 3.1%. Total year-to-date revenue growth of 1.7%, combined with comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin that declined 110 basis points, resulted in year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $376 million and year-to-date FFO per diluted share of $0.31. I should note that RevPAR improved throughout the quarter with period six achieving RevPAR growth of nearly 10% aided by our first overall rate growth in over a year and a half. On a calendar year basis, our second-quarter RevPAR was up nearly 10%. In general, for the quarter, the occupancy increase was better than we had expected and the average rate declined less than we anticipated resulting in a better-than-expected RevPAR and EBITDA.
Turning to our business mix for the quarter, we continue to see positive demand trends, which resulted in a substantial increase in overall room nights for the quarter of almost 9% compared to last year. More importantly, we are seeing demand recovered specifically in our higher-rated business segments for both group and transient. This is an extremely positive sign and suggests that hotels are becoming less reliant on discounted booking as demand continues to strengthen. Transient room nights increased 8% led by an 11% increase in our Premium and Corporate segments and a 33% increase in the Special Corporate segment. The recovery in business travel that we experienced in the first quarter continued to gain momentum this quarter. In addition, the average rate in our premium and corporate businesses increased by more than 6%, resulting in revenue growth of 18% in those segments. Conversely, we experienced a 1% decrease in discount room nights, which was the first decline in this segment since 2007. This should be viewed as a positive sign that hotels are more confident in their ability to attract higher-rated business travelers. Overall, the combination of higher rates and the positive shift of business mix resulted in a transient average rate increase of almost 3% for the quarter, the first such increase in two years, leading to an increase in transient revenue of 11%. The recovery that began in group business at the beginning of the year accelerated as total group demand increased 10% for the second quarter, led by a 16% increase in Corporate group. These trends were even more pronounced in our luxury hotels where group activity increased by 27% and Corporate group was up by 34%. In-the-quarter for-the-quarter bookings in the discount segment grew approximately 33% while higher-rated association and corporate bookings grew 121%, indicating that hotels are starting to rely less on the discount market for short-term bookings and focus more on higher-rated business. The strong group demand, combined with the gradual shift in business mix held the average rate decline in group to less than 5% and resulted in nearly a 5% increase in group revenues. 
Group booking activity in the third quarter is showing material improvement compared to 2009. At the beginning of the second quarter, booking pace for the third quarter was down about 2%. But by the end of the quarter, booking pace compared to the prior year had improved to an increase of roughly 8%, which reflects the continued short-term nature of our group bookings and our limited visibility. 
Our fourth quarter booking pace has also demonstrated sequential improvement albeit at a more moderated pace. The positive results in the first half of the year combined with the strong third quarter booking pace should result in a meaningful improvement in group room nights for the full year compared to 2009. Transient bookings for the third and fourth quarter are also trending slightly ahead of last year, especially during the holiday period. Overall, improvement is still reliant on the strength of the economy but we are seeing signs of improvement in business travel which is a key component to driving the recovery in lodging demand.
On the investment front, we have several transactions to talk about. First, we signed an agreement to acquire the 270-room W New York Union Square in a joint venture with Union Square Real Holding Corp. through a pre-negotiated reorganization plan requiring U.S. Bankruptcy Court approval. Host will participate as a majority partner in a venture with Istithmar World to purchase the hotel. A subsidiary post will provide asset management services to the venture. The hotel is located on the northeast corner of Union Square, Park Avenue and 17th street, adjacent to pre-eminent commercial and residential neighborhoods near cultural attractions, fine dining and entertainment as well as some of the best shopping in the city. The building was renovated, converted to a W Hotel and opened in November of 2000. While the hotel is heavily impacted by the downturn, which led to the recent bankruptcy filing, both New York and lifestyle-oriented properties are recovering quickly as is evidenced by the year-to-date 34% RevPAR increase at our W New York Hotel on Lexington Avenue. We also recently signed an agreement to acquire the 424-room Westin Chicago River North for $165 million. The hotel is situated in a primary commercial center of the city and close to major tourist attractions including the Magnificent Mile, the Navy Pier and Millennium Park. The hotel is in excellent condition with large guestrooms and approximately 28,000 square feet of well-designed meeting space including an 8,400-square-foot ballroom. We expect to close this transaction in mid-August. 
Finally, we signed an agreement through our joint venture in Asia to develop seven Accor-branded hotels at a total cost of $325 million in three major markets in India: Delhi, Bangalore and Chennai, through a partnership with Accor and InterGlobe, both of which have a proven track record of successfully developing and operating hotels in India. The portfolio consists of approximately 1,750 rooms, will have a strong upscale focus that will cater to India's growing corporate market. The timeline for opening these hotels ranges from early 2011 to early 2013. Our Asian joint venture expects to invest approximately $50 million in the transaction. We will continue to look for acquisition opportunities that meet our investment criteria and our guidance for the remainder of the year assumes that we will complete at least one additional deal beyond what we've announced today given our very active pipeline. Additionally, we have not included any added dispositions in our guidance for the remainder of the year. 
Capital expenditures for the second quarter totaled approximately $50 million and $100 million year-to-date, including $33 million of return on investment projects. For the full year, our expected capital expenditure estimate is $300 million to $320 million.
Now let me spend some time on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Our performance in the second quarter was significantly better than we anticipated and as I previously referenced, our advance bookings for the third quarter are quite robust. As a result, despite the modest pullback in economic forecast for the remainder of the year, we believe it is appropriate to further increase our forecast of our full-year performance. We now expect RevPAR for the year to increase to 4% to 5.5%, with a comparable adjusted margin change of flat to a decline of 50 basis points. Based on these assumptions, full-year adjusted EBITDA would be approximately $795 million to $825 million and FFO per diluted share would be $0.66 to $0.70. 
In closing, we are optimistic about the trends we are seeing in our business. Demand is continuing to strengthen and we are focused on our pricing strategies for continued improvement on the rate side. On the investment front, we are excited about the transactions we announced today and we will continue to aggressively look for investment opportunities both domestically and internationally. Thank you, and now let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."

Let me start by giving you some detail on our comparable hotel RevPAR results. Looking at the portfolio based on property types, our urban hotels performed the best during the quarter with a RevPAR increase of 9.9%. RevPAR for our suburban hotels increased 9.4%, while RevPAR at our airport and resort conference hotels increased 5.4% and 2% respectively. As expected, our top-performing market for the quarter was Boston, with a RevPAR increase of 23.8%, occupancy increased nearly 13 percentage points and ADR increased 3.7%. Transient ADR was up 6% as the market benefited from compression with an increased group and citywide demand and a mix shift from discount rooms to retail in Special Corporate business. Some of the improvement was due to easier comparisons as the Boston Marriott Copley Place and Sheraton Boston were under renovation in the second quarter of 2009. For the third quarter, we expect the Boston market to perform in line with the portfolio. RevPAR for the New Orleans Marriott increased 22.4%, with an occupancy increase of 7.9 percentage points and a 10.5% increase in ADR. Group demand increased significantly, allowing for an increase in transient rates for the quarter of 12.5%. We expect the hotel to have an outstanding third quarter due to additional citywide and group business as well as the benefit from demand generated by the Gulf oil spill containment and cleanup efforts. New York also had a great quarter, with a RevPAR increase of 19.1% as occupancy grew by 9.4 percentage points and rate increased 7%. Robust transient business and strong group bookings drove the improvement in demand. Transient ADR increased 14.2% due to a shift in the mix of business and rate increases. We expect New York City to have a strong third quarter due to high levels of business transient and leisure demand. The Miami-Fort Lauderdale market outperformed our expectations with a RevPAR increase of 14.3%. Occupancy was up 11.7 percentage points while rate declined 2.9%. The outperformance was driven by growth and transient and group business as well as the impact of the late 2009 ballroom addition at the Harbor Beach Marriott Resort and Spa. We expect the Miami-Fort Lauderdale market to have a weak third quarter due to the impact of the public space renovation at the Miami Biscayne Bay Marriott and lower levels of group business. Orange County, a market that was extremely hard hit by the housing market meltdown, had RevPAR growth of 13.3% in the quarter. Both transient and group demand were strong as occupancy increased 10 percentage points while ADR was down 1.5%. We expect the Orange County market to slightly underperform the portfolio in the third quarter due to a slight decline in group business.
RevPAR for our San Francisco hotels increased 12.1% due to better transient and group demand. Occupancy was up 10.2 percentage points, while ADR declined 2.9%. We expect our San Francisco hotels to slightly underperform the portfolio in the third quarter due to less citywide and group demand. The Chicago market recovered from a tough first quarter to post a 9.2% RevPAR increase that was driven by a significant increase in group and transient demand. Occupancy increased 7.6 percentage points while ADR declined 2.7%. The Swissotel, with its recent addition of 38,000 square feet of meeting space, substantially outperformed the market with a RevPAR increase of 20.6%. We expect our Chicago hotels to outperform the portfolio in the third quarter and for the Swissotel to continue to perform exceptionally well. RevPAR fell 2.7% for our Hawaiian hotels as occupancy increased 7.6 percentage points due to strong transient demand, while ADR fell 12.8%. Group demand was weak in the quarter; however, we expect the Maui market to outperform the portfolio in the third quarter due to continued improvements in airline capacity and stronger transient demand. RevPAR for our Phoenix hotels declined 3.9% with a 6.3 percentage point increase in occupancy and a 12% drop in ADR, primarily due to significant discounting of group rates. Transient demand has remained relatively strong. We expect our Phoenix hotels to continue to struggle in the third quarter, particularly due to the renovation of a significant amount of the meeting space at two of our hotels and the construction of a new ballroom at the Westin Kierland. 
As expected, the San Diego market continued to underperform due to a substantial decline in citywide and group demand and the absorption of the new Hilton that opened in 2009. RevPAR declined 12.8%, with an occupancy decline of 1.6 percentage points and a 10.8% decline in ADR. However, we expect our San Diego hotels to outperform the portfolio in the third quarter due to increased citywide activity. Year-to-date, Boston has been our top-performing market with a RevPAR increase of 18.5%; followed by New Orleans, with a RevPAR increase of 13%; New York with a RevPAR increase of 12.4%; and Miami-Fort Lauderdale with a RevPAR increase of 11.9%. Our worst performing markets have been San Diego, with a RevPAR decrease of 14.7%; and Hawaii, where RevPAR declined 7.7%. For our European joint venture, RevPAR calculated in constant euros increased 5.6% for the quarter. Occupancy increased 8.1 percentage points and ADR declined 5.8%. The Crowne Plaza Amsterdam, the Sheraton Skyline in London and The Westin Palace, Madrid outperformed the rest of the portfolio while The Hotel Arts, Barcelona was the poorest performer. On a year-to-date basis, RevPAR calculated in constant euros increased 3.2%. For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels were flat. Consistent with the first quarter, margins for the second quarter were significantly impacted by the level of cancellation and attrition fees in 2009. In the second quarter of 2009, cancellation and attrition fees were approximately $16 million higher than the second quarter of 2010, accounting for a 100 basis point reduction in margins. In addition, property-level bonus expense increased significantly in the quarter, resulting in a 25 basis point reduction in margins. Strong rooms flow-through is a challenge when there is a substantial increase in occupancy and a decrease in rate. However, rooms flow-through was excellent for the quarter at 70.6% as rooms cost per occupied room was flat. Food and beverage flow-through was also very strong at 50.7%. The shift in the mix of business to more catering and audio-visual revenues and a reduction in beverage costs as a percentage of revenue led to the outperformance. 
Contributing to the strong flow-through, productivity improvements led to a reduction in wages and benefits on a per-occupied room basis. However, due to the overall increase in occupancy, wages and benefits increased 3.5%. Unallocated costs increased by 6% for the quarter. This increase was primarily driven by expenses that are variable with revenues, including credit card commissions, reward programs and cluster and shared service allocations. In addition, as we mentioned on the first quarter call, the costs related to implementation of new sales and marketing initiatives would impact margins for the rest of the year and they did in the second quarter. 
Utility costs only increased 0.6%, reflecting the impact of energy-saving capital improvements. Property taxes declined 2.8%, while property insurance increased 15.6%. Looking out to the full year, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins to be flat at the high end of the RevPAR range and decrease 50 basis points at the low end of the range. These amounts have been reduced by 65 basis points for the year-over-year difference in cancellation and attrition fees and 25 basis points for incremental property level bonus expense. 
During the quarter, we redeemed approximately 4 million shares of our 8 7/8% Class E series of preferred stock for approximately $100 million. We finished the quarter with nearly $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and the full $600 million of capacity on our line of credit. After taking into consideration the acquisitions detailed in our press release, we would have approximately $925 million in cash and cash equivalents. This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have."

But as we have examined the emerging markets, especially India and China, we have felt that there is a better opportunity to invest more in some of these middle tiers, although not all of these hotels fit into that description. But we've kind of felt that the midscale and upscale versus upper upscale and luxury probably present a better opportunity, in part because as you look at the opportunity for increase in demand in India and China, it is as much driven by the increasing wealth of those populations and more people moving into the middle class, which should, based on history, suggest more people traveling. But that class, when they start to travel, are probably not going to be staying in luxury hotels. They're going to need something that's a bit more affordable. And that's really true whether it's for leisure or whether it's for business. So bottom line is as we've looked at both India and China, while we would be interested in opportunities that were at higher price points, our sense is that these are sort of the right price point to be investing in those markets."

What you're seeing happen at this point is, I think, consistent with the way some of us had predicted which is whether its distress in the form of the W deal, where you have a deal that has essentially blown up, gone into bankruptcy and needs to be worked out or it's a situation that we really faced in the opportunity on the Westin, where there wasn't a distress situation but simply there was debt coming due in the near-term and that ultimately the owner made a decision that it was probably better to sell rather than try to refinance that debt. We're starting to see that impending debt bubble start to create, in some fashion, some transactions. And I suspect that as we go forward over the next six to 12 months, we'll continue to see that those two forces are the primary motivation behind the transactions that happen. That doesn't mean that there won't be transactions that just happen because somebody has made a decision to take advantage of whatever capital they have in an asset and unsell because they have a better place to the deploy the capital but I think it's still, in the near term, it's more likely to be the other type of deal."

I would bet that if you look -- in general, we'll be investing more dollars over the next couple of years in the U.S. than we will be investing internationally, but I think you'll find that the balance between our international activity and our domestic activity will be more even than it's been in the past. We certainly are seeing some interesting opportunities in Europe right now and are pursuing those. We also have some other things in the pipeline in Asia, although nothing that we obviously were prepared to announce at this point in time, and we have a number of things that we're looking at in the United States too. So we'll just have to -- some of it's just a function of how quickly these transactions go from the initial stages of activity to actually turning into a transaction. When it comes to the pricing question, it is really difficult to give a short answer to that question because the reality is, is that if you look across the United States, for example, markets like New York where you had a very deep decline over the course of 2008 and 2009 but where one would likely anticipate a very strong recovery, potentially lead you towards lower cap rates. Other markets, Washington D.C., for example, which is a market that while it fell, fell I think, roughly half as much as on the topline as New York, you would logically expect to see slightly higher cap rates because you're both working off of a better level of income to start and you're not necessarily expecting to see quite the same level of ramp up over the next couple of years as you'd like to see in New York. I think you could see in certain markets, you could see some sub-prime cap rates for this year and on the other it's -- probably for the more stabilized markets you'd be a little bit above that. All of the cap rates are probably based on a theory, though, that you're going to see relatively healthy growth in the U.S. domestic markets looking out the next couple of years. If you look at Europe, you're probably looking at a situation that is somewhat analogous to Washington D.C., maybe slightly lower cap rates there because of a historical level of cap rates that typically have been a little bit lower than the U.S. But the key European markets, London, Paris and some others, did not necessarily get as hit as hard as some of the prime markets in the United States. And so you'll see that reflected in the pricing. Asia cap rates are far more varied because you have a combination of both stabilized or mature markets combined with some of these other places where people are projecting very strong economic growth. And the cap rates in some of the markets will again vary, based upon the opportunity whether its development or existing. But in those markets that are less mature, you're typically going to see both a higher cap rate but more importantly, a higher projected overall level of return. I'd probably circle back on the whole point of cap rates is that, for us, certainly the current cap rate is important, most certainly the relationship to replacement cost is important, but ultimately when we're looking at an acquisition, we're looking to achieve a premium to our cost of capital in our acquisitions and that's calculated in the form of a 10-year unlevered IRR. And so that becomes the basis for how we decide if an acquisition makes sense or not."

And the first off is that -- I have to admit I'm not totally familiar with some of the other deals that you have referenced in your note this morning, but my sense at least on a few of them is that there were fairly material CapEx needs for those hotels which was probably built into the deal but not into the quoted price. In this instance, we have a very minimal capital program for this hotel based on our acquisition analysis, so we don't feel a need as we have in other acquisitions to where we're going to need to invest a lot into the hotel. So that might be one area of difference. Certainly this hotel, from a standpoint of its performance and from the size of the rooms, the overall quality of the box, I think stands in the relatively top number of hotels in this kind of class level within the Chicago market. I'd also note that one of the things that was attractive to us about this acquisition is the fact that this is a fairly advantageous management contract. It expires in 2020 or rather to say differently, the owner has the right to decide to extend it in 2020, not the operator, which as you know is a bit unusual. And when you think about what that means in terms of that quality of asset in that type of a location, to at least have the flexibility around what flags the hotel might fly. Certainly does lend to a better cap rate on a sale in a pro forma that we might be using to analyze the asset."

I wouldn't necessarily say that the window is lengthening necessarily, although there are some properties where you are starting to see some signs of that. I think what we were taking comfort in was the fact that we haven't seen consistent short-term booking pace strength, and that's been happening now for two or three quarters in a row. And while the out quarters are probably still tracking a little bit behind where they might have been in the prior year, the reality is that the gap between where they are and where they were is closing. And so we're seeing that as we look forward, I think we're getting more optimistic about the fact that we will continue to see, as we get to the start of each quarter, that we will be seeing more of the group room nights on the book than where we had been in the prior year. But I think the other part that kind of drives our sense of how the rest of the year will play out relates back to some of the comments that I made relative to what we were seeing from corporate demand. Our corporate demand has really been growing both at the Special Corporate level and in terms of just regular business travel. As you well know, that's the segment of our business, the latter one, that pays the highest rate and the fact that we were actually able, across the portfolio, to see an increase in those rates, we took as quite a good sign. But we're also finding that our hotels are feeling less of the need to offer discounts in order to attract business. And I think that's key because that means you're really not sacrificing rate any more to attract business. You're really getting more comfortable that you're going to see additional -- that the business is going to materialize from your better paying customers. Kind of going back to the group side for a second, one interesting theme for most of our operators is that they are finding that the business that they're booking now is at higher rates than where they booked last year. So not only is the pace of booking up, but the rates that they're booking at are also higher. So when we put all of that together, while obviously there's some of the press around the economy has not been ideal and we do have some concern around some of the most recent measures of consumer confidence, we see that being somewhat offset by the outlook for business investment, which continues to improve, and the net of it is we just felt better about the second half of the year, and you see that in our revised guidance."

But on your second question about whether it leads to acquisition opportunities, I think that's a really interesting question. I don't know that brand standards per se is going to necessarily create an investment opportunity. But what I will say, what will create the investment opportunity is that hotels that were bought in '06 or '07 and over-levered are now starting to get to the point where they may be facing in 2010 and '11, their third year, where capital spending has been materially constrained because the property has not been generating the cash flow that's adequate to both service the debt and service the property. And so while brand standards alone aren't going to create the problem, the reality is, is that as you well know in the hotel industry that you get to a tipping point with an asset where if you don't maintain it to a certain level, customers ultimately understand that, see that, feel that and stop showing up at that hotel. That ultimately starts the hotel on a spiral. So as lenders begin to understand that a hotel is getting to that tipping point, they would logically be more aggressive about demanding action, either in the form of a debt paydown or investment in the hotel in some fashion. And I think in a lot of cases, that could create opportunity. But it'll come more out of the overall physical condition and not just simply the re-institution of brand standards."

Not only do you have the partial year effect hitting you but there are some new accounting requirements that Larry is far more qualified to explain than I am, but essentially require that we write off the acquisition costs associated with the deal at closing as opposed to capitalizing them and amortizing them over the life of the deal. So that has the effect of reducing the initial year impact of acquisitions. When you cut through all that, our sense right now is of the transactions that we've announced today the contribution to EBIT there is probably plus or minus $5 million for this year."

What you're generally seeing, and as I say this I think it'll make sense to most people, is that core business that is being booked in the relatively near term. From all practical perspective you're seeing relatively minor cancellations and attrition fees. Some of that is the competitive landscape that we're operating in, some of it is reflecting that, that's not a point that it's worth the hotel negotiating a lot over because at this point, if you're negotiating for a group event in the next 90 days, odds are pretty good you're going to have it anyway. So at the end of the day, if you had a choice between negotiating for a little bit higher food and beverage offering versus getting a cancellation fee, you're going to go for the money, not for the sort of the safety. As you start to work your way longer term and look at business as being booked for '11 and '12, the situation begins to shift a little bit more. I would say that, our sense is that we're still not back to where we were in '05, '06 and '07 where we were getting fairly significant cancellation fees but we're certainly negotiating for something in this time frame. And that will depend a lot on, it's a market by market phenomenon and it also depends a little bit on what time of year you're looking at as to whether the business is in a period where we are highly confident we can replace it or a period of time where it's more aggressive, where there's more demand, versus a period where there isn't a lot of demand and we really want a piece of business in that pie."

As I said before so far, while we've all read different economic statistics that have showed up in the press, we haven't necessarily seen an impact on that. But conversely, we've also been talking about the fact that primarily a lot of our near-term demand has really been fairly short-term, so it's certainly a trend that we're watching. As we think about the year though, and we watch the trends that we're seeing and as I get feedback from the operators who are of course one step closer to this negotiation process certainly than we are, they're not sensing, at least so far, a desire on the part of companies to pull back. And I think they are sending a strong message, and Arnie talked about this a bit last week, that we're going to be expecting and start to look for meaningful rate increases in our Special Corporate negotiations for next year. I think we're also sending the message as we start to talk about group business that they should be assuming that group business will be booked at higher rates, not lower rates. My sense is that, that message is being accepted. It doesn't mean it won't ultimately get negotiated but it is being accepted out there by the corporate customers that we're talking about. As we think about how to approach certainly the second in the last few months of this year and the beginning of 2011, we're going to continue to emphasize what we think is the strength in our properties, which is our positioning on the group side and are going to be looking and try to build a pretty solid group phase and we're going to continue to try to do a fair amount of business on the Special Corporate side. We've been talking about so far this year, the fact that, I think we were up somewhere in the 20s in the first quarter, we're up 33% this quarter, in Special Corporate business. While I suspect that we will lose some of those accounts as we work our way into 2010 because we will be priced a little too richly for some of those corporate customers to come back, we're still going to be focusing on that as a key segment of our demand for next year at a higher rate, not a lower rate like it's been this year. In an effort to just give ourselves a little bit of protection on the downside in case some of this weakness in the economy lasts longer than we would all like it to."

I do think that you're still finding that everyone is kind of -- I think through some of the comments especially some of the more recent questions we just had, there is a level of uncertainty out there and to some degree, it is probably leading people to be cautious about bookings but again, remember that where the degree of occupancy declined as the industry suffered and recognize that for the last 15 to 18 months, we've trained people that you could afford to wait for the last minute to make a decision in order to get a room because the rooms have been there. Hopefully that's starting to change. Hopefully in a call or two we're talking about an extended booking cycle which is suggesting that somebody has called up, tried to get a room and it wasn't available, or they're trying to get meeting space and it wasn't available, which start to train people in the other direction which is basically forcing them to commit a little bit sooner. I suspect we're in that evolving state of going from where it was you could assume that you could get space, to now where you have to think a little bit more about it and you may have to make that extra phone call to find it and hopefully in another couple of quarters, we're at a point where you start to see that booking cycle lengthen and we're starting to sell rooms a little bit faster."

We are pleased to report another strong quarter with solid RevPAR growth driven for the first time in a while by improvements in average rates and continued transaction activity as we completed great acquisitions in s",1373,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another strong quarter with solid RevPAR growth driven for the first time in a while by improvements in average rates and continued transaction activity as we completed great acquisitions in several key target markets. 
First, let's talk about our third quarter results. Our comparable hotel RevPAR for the third quarter increased 8.8% driven by an increase in our average rate of 4.5% and an increase in occupancy of 2.9 percentage points. Our average rate was $162 and our average occupancy for the quarter was 73.3%. Our properties benefited from strong group demand which drove a 6.2% increase in comparable food and beverage revenues, ancillary revenues, net of cancellation fee increased by just 1.6%. Comparable hotel revenue growth of 6.9% combined with an increase in comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin of 150 basis points resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $163 million for the third quarter which represented an increase of $24 million from the prior year.
FFO per diluted share after a reduction of $0.02 related to debt repayment and acquisition costs was $0.11 for the quarter.
On a year-to-date basis comparable hotel RevPAR increased 5.6% and comparable F&B revenues grew just 4.3%. Total year-to-date revenue growth of 3.7% combined with comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins that declined 20 basis points, resulted in a year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $539 million and year-to-date FFO per diluted share of $0.42.
RevPAR growth in our portfolio has been consistently strong since April of this year. As we have transitioned more fully into a recovery, the composition of that RevPAR growth has turned more favorable as the improvement has been increasingly driven by increases in average rate. We are also continuing to benefit from a shift in business mix towards higher rated segments, and these improving demand trends allow us to be less reliant on just booking discounted business.
While these trends were apparent in both our group and transient businesses during the third quarter the actual beneficial impact differed. On the transient front our 8.6% revenue improvement was primarily driven by an increase in transient rate of nearly 7% led by an 11% average rate increase in our premium corporate business. Our overall transient demand growth of nearly 2% was generated primarily by an increase of 34% in special corporate business, which more than offset a 7% reduction in discount room night.
We would expect to see additional strengthening on the rate side as our business mix continues to shift more towards the higher rated segment, and as the impact of last year's special corporate rate which were determined during the weak environment diminished and are replaced by higher price contracts.
On the group side the strengthening demand trend we have been enjoying all year carried into the third quarter as group revenues improved by more than 9%. The bulk of this improvement was caused by an almost 8% increase in room night although we still benefited from a 1.3% increase in average rate, which was our first average rate increase in the group sector since the fourth quarter of 2008.
The demand growth was led by association businesses which grew by more than 11% and our luxury corporate segment which increased by 27%. While we benefited from demand growth in all segments; the lowest increase was in the discount segment. Adjusted with the pattern we have been experiencing this year our booking cycle continues to be very short-term. Bookings in the quarter, for the quarter exceeded last year's strong pay and well above levels we experienced in 2007.
Group booking activity for the fourth quarter is up nearly 6% compared to 2009 with the improvement occurring over the last 90 days as our fourth quarter room night pace was negative as the start of the third quarter. As we look out to 2011, our booking pace for the combined first three quarters is up slightly and we would expect that surplus to strengthen as we progress into the year.
On the investment front, we completed several transactions over the last few months, some of which we discussed with you during our call in July. In addition to the purchase of the Westin Chicago River North which was announced on our last call. We closed on the acquisition of the W New York-Union Square and the Le Meridien Piccadilly which is located in the Mayfair district of London. These three acquisitions represent a solid cross-section of the types of transactions we are seeking to complete, the [total] assets located in major urban gateway markets that can appeal to both business and leisure travelers. We are confident that these assets will outperform the industry over the course of the cycle. Today's earnings release, we announced the fourth acquisition that matches that profile, the 245-room JW Marriott Hotel, Rio de Janeiro our first hotel in Brazil. This high end property is in a prime location across from the Copacabana Beach and close to the city Central Business District. The hotel is approximately 7,300 square feet of meeting space, it includes the 2,300 square foot ball room, it also has a rooftop pool with spectacular views of the city and the coastline.
This hotel represents our fourth investment in Latin America and we are hopeful that it will facilitate further investment into the dynamic resilient market. These four hotels were purchased for a combined price of 478 million and reflect a 2010 EBITDA multiple of slightly less than 14 times. So actively we project our acquisition prices represent more than a 25% discount through replacement cost. This is a unique period of time in the acquisition market as the spread between unlevered return and our cost of capital has rarely been higher and the discount to replacement cost for an acquisition has seldom been more attractive. 
We will continue to look for additional acquisition opportunity that meet our investment criteria. Overall we continue to have a solid pipeline our guidance for the remainder of the year doesn't include any additional deals beyond what we've announced today. Additionally, we have not included any further dispositions in our guidance for the reminder of the year. 
Turning to our capital investment program, expenditures for the third quarter totals approximately 49 million and are 149 million year-to-date including 17 million of return on investment project for the quarter. For the full year, our expected capital expenditure estimate is $300 million to $320 million. 
Now let me spend some time on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Overall, our strong performance in the third quarter and the solid booking activity for the fourth quarter suggests the RevPAR should increase between 5.5% and 6.5% for the year which reflects an increase over our prior guidance.
However, this improvement is slightly offset by a more cautious outlook with respect to food and beverage and ancillary revenue. The revenue guidance combined with a comparable adjusted margin change of flat to up 15 basis points results in full year adjusted EBITDA of approximately $815 million to $830 million and FFO per diluted share of $0.67 to $0.69 which has been reduced by $0.04 to $0.05 per diluted share for debt repayment and acquisition costs.
Given that we are in the very early stages of our budgeting process, we are not providing 2011 guidance at this point. However, as we look to next year we believe that the positive trends we are seeing now will continue resulting in improvements in RevPAR margins and EBITDA. We will give detailed 2011 guidance on our next call in February. 
In closing, we are pleased with our performance this year and certainly this quarter and are optimistic about the trends we are seeing in our industry and look forward to carrying the momentum into 2011.
We remain focused on pricing strategies that are assets for continued improvement on the rate side, on the investment front we are excited about the transactions we have completed over the last several months and are continuing to aggressively look for investment opportunities, both domestically and internationally. 
Thank you and now let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail.

Let me start by giving you some detail on our comparable hotel RevPAR results. When looking at our portfolio based on property types, all of them performed very well for the quarter. Our urban hotels performed the best with a RevPAR increase",1521,"Thank you Ed. Let me start by giving you some detail on our comparable hotel RevPAR results. When looking at our portfolio based on property types, all of them performed very well for the quarter. Our urban hotels performed the best with a RevPAR increase of 9%. RevPAR for our resort conference hotels increased 8.7%, while RevPAR at our suburban and airport hotels increased 8.6% and 7.8% respectively.
The two best performing markets for the quarter were New Orleans and Orlando, where we have one large hotel in each market. New Orleans property had a RevPAR increase of 28.3%, occupancy increased over 12 percentage points and ADR increased 8.3%. 
The hotel benefited from a significant increase in group room nights and contract business related to the Gulf oil spill clean-up. For the fourth quarter, we expect the property to under perform the rest of the portfolio due to less city-wide business. 
RevPAR for our Orlando property increased 26.7%, due to an occupancy increase of 14 percentage points and a slight decrease in ADR. Group demand, particularly association business increased significantly. We expect the hotel to under perform the portfolio in the fourth quarter due to lower levels of group business and the start of the rooms' renovation at the hotel. 
The Chicago market continued to outperform the portfolio with a 14.2% improvement in RevPAR. Although there were too fewer city-wide events in the quarter, occupancy increased three percentage points and ADR improved 9.4% as our hotels benefited from higher levels of in-house group business. A positive shift in the mix of transient business, as well as actual rate increases drove the ADR growth. We expect our Chicago hotels to perform in line with the portfolio in the fourth quarter. 
Our Boston hotels with a RevPAR increase of 14.5% continue to perform exceptionally well. Occupancy increased 5.8 percentage points and ADR grew 6.9%. The out performance was driven by nearly a 30% improvement in group and city-wide room nights. Our five hotels in the market averaged nearly 87% occupancy for the quarter. However, we expect the Boston market to under perform the portfolio in the fourth quarter due to fewer city-wide room nights and the ballroom renovation at the Sheraton Boston. 
Our New York hotels had another great quarter with a RevPAR increase of 12.9% as rate increased 12.4% and occupancy increased slightly. For the quarter, our New York hotels had nearly 91% occupancy. At these levels we have been limiting the number of groups and driving transient business and rates. As a result, transient ADR increased 15.4%. We expect New York City to have a very good fourth quarter even with rooms' renovations at the New York Marriott Marquee and the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers.
As we discussed on the second quarter call, we expected our Hawaiian hotels to finally turn the corner in the third quarter and they did. RevPAR increased 11.8%. Occupancy improved 8.3 percentage points due primarily to a significant improvement in group demand.
The increase in airline capacity helped results for the quarter. While both of our hotels will have some of their rooms out of service due to renovations; we still expect them to continue to outperform the portfolio in the fourth quarter. 
The Denver market continues to perform well with the RevPAR improvement of 11.8%. A significant increase in group and transient demand drove occupancy up 7.2 percentage points. For the fourth quarter, we expect Denver to continue to outperform the portfolio as we expect those group and transient demand to remain strong. 
RevPAR for our San Francisco hotels increased 11% due to higher levels of transient demand. Occupancy was up 5.3 percentage points and ADR improved 3.9%. Improvement in special corporate and corporate demand lead to a transient ADR increase of 6.5%. We expect our San Francisco hotels to perform in line with the portfolio in the fourth quarter. 
RevPAR for our San Antonio hotels fell 7%, as occupancy dropped 6.6 percentage points and rate increased 2.3%. The poor performance was due to lower transient and group demand. We expect our San Antonio hotels to rebound in the fourth quarter, and outperform the portfolio due to a substantial increase in group and city wide demand. As expected our Phoenix hotel struggled in the third quarter due to the renovation of a significant amount of the meeting space at two of our hotels and the construction of a new ballroom at the Western Kierland.
RevPAR declined 9.8% as occupancy fell 4.3 percentage points and ADR decreased 1.8%. We expect our Phoenix hotels to continue to underperform the portfolio as the renovation and construction projects at the Western Kierland continue in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date New Orleans has been our top performing market with a RevPAR increase of 16.9% followed by Boston with an increase of 16.8%, New York with an increase of 12.6% and Miami Fort Lauderdale with a RevPAR increase of 10.1%. Our worst performing market was San Diego with a RevPAR decrease of 5.8%. However our San Diego hotels started to rebound in the third quarter and we expect them to significantly outperform the portfolio in the fourth quarter.
For our European joint venture RevPAR calculated in constant euros increased 10.3% for the quarter due to an 8% improvement in occupancy and a slight decline in ADR. The Crowne Plaza, Amsterdam and the Westin Palace, Madrid outperformed the rest of the portfolio. While the Renaissance Brussels was the poorest performer, primarily due to our rooms renovation. On a year-to-date basis, RevPAR calculated in constant euros increased 6.1%. For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels increased 150 basis points, our best performance of the year.
This occurred despite the significant reduction in the level of cancellation and attrition fees and a meaningful increase in bonus expense in 2010, which when combined resulted in a 100 basis point reduction in margins. Rooms flow-through was excellent for the quarter, at 80.1% as flow-through benefited from the ADR increase and productivity improvements that led to flat wages and benefits on a per occupied room basis. Food and beverage flow-through was lower than expected as groups remain cautious of ancillary spending preferring to purchase lower margin items.
Unallocated cost increased 7% for the quarter. This increase was primarily driven by expenses that are variable with revenues, including credit card commissions, reward programs and cluster and shared service allocations. Utility cost increased 6.2% primarily due to higher electricity usage particularly in the Northeast where some of our major markets such as Boston and New York and Washington, D.C had a substantial increase in the number of 90 degree plus days.
Property taxes declined 1% while property insurance decreased approximately 20%. Looking out to the full year, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins to be up 15 basis points at the high end of the RevPAR range and flat at the low end of the range. These amounts have been reduced by 70 basis points for the year-over-year difference in cancellation and attrition fees and 30 basis points for incremental property level bonus expense. We currently own a leasehold interest in 53 Courtyards and 18 Residence Inns, which were sold to Hospitality Properties Trust and leased back in 1995 and 1996. In 1998 we subleased these 71 properties to a third party with initial lease terms expiring in 2010 and 2012.
In the third quarter the subtenants failed the net worth covenant, and we terminated the sublease in order to not trigger a default under our lease. Accordingly, we now act as owner under the management agreement and we started to record property-level revenues and expenses from the date of the sublease termination instead of rental income and rental expense.
While the sublease terminations affected revenues and expenses, there is no effect on the quarter's operating profit or net income from the termination. We have recourse against the parent of the subtenants and the subtenants, and expect them to continue to fund the majority of the deficit.
We gave notice that we will terminate the lease on the 18 Residence Inn properties effective December 31, 2010, at which time we expect that our $70 million of differed proceeds plus some cash collateral will be returned by HPT. In 2010 we also intend to give notice that we will terminate the lease on the 53 Courtyard effective December 31, 2012, at which time our $50 million of differed proceeds, plus some cash collateral will also be returned.
During the quarter we redeemed $225 million of our 718 Series K senior notes for $230 million. We finished the quarter with over $838 million of cash and cash equivalents, and over $540 million of capacity on our line of credit.
After taking into consideration the acquisition of the JW Marriott Rio de Janeiro subsequent to the end of the third quarter and the pending (inaudible) of the $115 million mortgage on the W Union Square later this month, we would have approximately $670 million in cash and cash equivalents. This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have.

A lot of that's going to be dependent upon both the performance of the assets that we are looking to sell meaning, have they started to come back closer to their peak operating levels. 
So that we will feel comfortable that we are getting good pricing and we don't need to sell assets right now from a liquidity perspective. Selling assets is more about reaping value where we think we've created as much as we can and then it's also a part of just over time repositioning the portfolio, that bulk of the portfolio is located at higher growth market.

I think what you are just seeing is the good news that the customers are meeting again, groups are coming back to properties and the events are happening. I think what we've found over the course of the summer and as we looked out into the fourth quarter, is that they were probably being a bit more cautious about what they spent on food and beverage specifically on break that seemed to be areas we talked to the operator where we were feeling the most impact. 
Its just coffee and water and soda instead of more elaborate food displayed and that affected the group's spending is per customer is down just a little bit and I wouldn't want to describe this as any kind of a sea change from our perspective but it was. We were expecting a little bit more in the third quarter and as we look out to the fourth quarter we realized that we should probably moderate our expectations there. The other thing that kind of happened on that side that I referred to in my comments that I think is a little tied into the ancillary revenue of this issue is that on the ancillary revenue side we're not seeing quite as much spending in spas and golf as we might have anticipated. You know with the strong increase in occupancy that we've had, we would have normally expected those revenues to trend up a little bit more aggressively. 
Now if you look at where we ended up, I think we're probably up about 4% increase in occupancy, yet our ancillary revenues were only up about 1%. Again I don't think it's a major issue. It's just we were hoping that we were going to see a little bit more growth on that side. And I think what you're finding is consistent with the fact that groups are spending a little bit less on some food items. They're also spending a little bit less on some of the activities that are happening around events. 
Now as we look in to next year, I don't know that we have enough data yet to necessarily draw a firm conclusion. I would expect that if you rather than thinking about what happened in prior recovery, typically what happens is that once first groups have to start to meet, then the next year you start to see folks be willing to spend a little bit more on the event in order to make the event a little bit more special. And we tend to start to benefit from that of course. 
The other thing that will hopefully start to happen, and so far we've have only seen this happen in a couple of markets, is at some point the dynamics around the competition for leading space in hotels at certain high targeted times will begin to allow us to again to charge meeting room rental. And that of course, there is a flow-through on that particular revenue item is excellent. 
We've been able to charge it in some markets this year, this last quarter, but not very many. Those occupancies continue to improve. I think there is a greater likelihood we'll start to see that next year, and that will factor into this equation too.

There were some title challenges with that asset that needed to be resolved before Marriott could execute a sale transaction and so once those were resolved it was possible for the two of us to negotiate but it was something that we had been interested in really as far back as two years ago.
I think its somewhat coincidence or opportunistic in terms of the timing that we've had that of the first four properties we've bought, two of them have been located outside the US and two were located inside the US. I still suspect that on general, the majority of the acquisitions that we complete will be domestic. It's just that we have active in these other markets; we have been working in these other places for a while. We felt comfortable with the opportunities when they presented themselves and so we acted on them but by and large there are pipeline still has more assets that we're looking at that are domestic in nature than those that are international.

I think that the comp gets slightly more difficult in Q4. But I think that the one thing we did comment on as Larry went through the different markets is that we do have some renovations happening at some of our larger hotels that are going to hit in November and December of this year.
Now the reason those renovations are targeted for that time of year is traditionally business demand levels and volume levels are lower. So we hope that there will be the less disruption, but in terms of thinking through what was going to likely happen in the quarter we were thinking that we should at least provide for some room for conservatism in case the impact turned out to be greater than we expected.
Clearly we've had a lot of questions and meetings and sort of I think there's in the industry about the potential impact of some of the slowing that we saw in the economy during really the late spring and during the early summer and whether that's going to have any impact on our operations. And clearly that's something that we have been focused on.
Now the short answer on that is that we have continued to see very good demand. September is based on preliminary results was up 9.5%. So September for us meaning, September for our monthly hotels including 2010 for our Marriott International hotels. So that's favorable compared to where we are for the third quarter. 
Booking pace continues to follow the same pattern of being about in line a quarter out and then getting very strong during that quarter proceeding the actual quarter that happens and then bookings in the quarter continue to be good. We are also comfortable about the fact that as demand has continued to improve we are finding better and better ability to both stop a limit providing discounts to customers to solicit business and at the same time to begin to move rates. And of course the broader economic or the broader fundamental in all of this is that supplies is moderating consistently through the year and will be even low as we work our way into next year.
So the net of it is that it is something we've been watching carefully. We've been looking carefully at every monthly report we get to try to see if there is anything that's suggesting that there is weakness. And I think really what's happening at least as it relates to our portfolio, which of course is very focused on urban market and has always benefited a lot from corporate travel is despite the fact that GDP growth has not been as strong as people might have hoped or certainly might have predicted earlier in the year, we're continuing to see that corporate investment and corporate profitability are very strong and frankly are coming in better than where people thought in the beginning of the year, and even better than where people thought at the beginning of the third quarter. We benefit from that trend because whenever investment is up corporate travel seems to be up. At least that's what history suggests.
So I think that's why you're seeing the results that we are having. The good news for us is we worked a little bit further forward, is that the outlook for this point for corporate investment for next year is to be even stronger than what we're seeing this year.

I think last quarter you mentioned that, typically towards the peak of the disparity between the rate growth and occupancy growth you get to plus or minus 80% flow through, yet you really do that at only about 50% split between rate growth and occupancy growth. If I were going to assume maybe rate growth is up 80% of RevPAR growth in 2011, is it realistic to believe we could exceed that 80% flow through or do you think 80% sort of peaks at, costs will start to go up a little bit more?

Certainly as you look around the world and focus on market flag, Brazil, India, China, you certainly see a lot better economic growth to what we are projecting to see in the U.S. and we know that economic growth ultimately translates into hotel demand growth. And that's the most fundamental reason why we felt it was important to explore our opportunities internationally.
Today, international probably when you total up the amount of investments that we have in our portfolio in international markets, it's roughly in the 7% to 8%. That's counting in U.S., just our share of the JV and not the total magnitude of the assets that are there. But as we look into the future, if we continue to feel that we can invest successfully in those markets, every country is a little bit different and every market is a little bit different. So as we continue to prove to ourselves that we can successfully invest outside the US, I think for the very reason you suggest that we would feel comfortable in having that percentage increase in efforts to try to give us broader exposure to markets that are going to grow better than where the US is going to grow.

I would feel comfortable that the increases in EBITDA that we would expect to benefit from would certainly keep asset pricing well above where it is today. 
I mean at the end of the day pricing should in most markets move much closer to replacement cost and as I mentioned in our comments we think we are buying at a meaningful discount to replacement cost. The increasing interest rate or the low levels of interest rates, they have had some effect certainly on the ability of people to pay some of the prices that they paid. Where this is not quite as debt driven in acquisition environment right now that's what we saw in the '05, '06 and '07 timeframe. 
Leverages plays a role in deals but it's not the driver behind deals right now because you just can't get leverage at the same level that you could get before. So none of it is, you will probably see cap rates go up over the next two or three years but I think some of that is going to be reflective of. It will little bit because rates are a little bit higher and it will be because as we start to progress through the growth phase that we all expect to see in these assets '11, '12 and '13 there's usually a little bit of moderation that comes, the anticipated growth rate moderates too.

The industry is going to be getting pretty close to being within striking distance, say by 2012, of sort of peak revenues or nearing on peak profitability, we saw last time and construction costs are arguably lower. I am curious, I mean I know its not today but do you think in the next 12 months we could hear increasing signs of construction activity or do you think that that's still going to be off the table as we look forward.

And I still tend to look towards the levels of supply growth that we saw in three, four, five and six as being indicative of what's likely to happen in '11, '12, '13 at least '11, '12 and '13. When I compare the two periods, even assuming we have the same rate of recovery that we had last time which I think is feasible, the reality is as we started a little bit lower, so the gap between value and replacement cost is certainly as great if not greater. The availability of financing in today's environment for new construction is weaker than what we experienced in the early part of the last decade. So while financing conditions are trending in the right direction, I don't see a lot of lenders racing to provide loans for new hotels. And that, that will be necessary in order for construction to really increase. 
So, I think you're right, the value from the standpoint that values have recovered maybe a bit more quickly than people were projecting. The bulk of the reason behind that is the cash flows are recovering more quickly than people have projected. That will ultimately support new construction, but I think we have got a fair amount of time before that's going to happen. 
Now, having said that, that's a full service discussion, I think it's even tougher in the luxury market. Luxury sells more, and luxury the last time was subsidized by a lot of condominium construction where the hotel was an amenity to a condo project. That's only going to make sense in markets that have a vibrant condo market, and I don't see that happening in the near term in most of the major markets across the country.
We probably will see some limited service construction sooner than we'll see full service construction. Those properties are smaller, they are easier to finance, the numbers have always tended to work sooner with that type of a product. And so I suspect that when we do start to see supply numbers begin to trend upwards instead of continuing to trend downwards, it will be because of additional supply in that segment.

I meant we are encouraged by the fact that while the occupancy rebound this year has been strong as it has been. But at the same time, we're encouraged just last quarter by how strong the rate contribution was. We're probably if you look at how we've done; we are still not quite 50% back. So, if you look at the drop that we had from 73, 74 in occupancy in '07 down to 66 last year. We are working our way back but we're probably at best about half way back on that recovery. 
So I will still be expecting next year that we would continue to progress back towards our prior peak occupancy levels. But certainly as you work your way through the year next year rate will play an increasing role. And what's interesting is that as you look at what's happened to us this past quarter is that change in business mix has been helpful but we've also been able to get absolute changes in rate within particular segments. And I don't see any reason why that trend won't continue into next year. 
So to sum that up my guess is by the time we get to the end of next year, we probably would find that rate was a bigger contributor to RevPAR growth than occupancy but both will contribute.

We are pleased to report another strong quarter, with solid RevPAR growth driven for the first time in a while by improvements in average rates and continued transaction activities as we completed great acquisitions i",1367,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another strong quarter, with solid RevPAR growth driven for the first time in a while by improvements in average rates and continued transaction activities as we completed great acquisitions in several key target markets. 
First, let's talk about our third quarter results. Our comparable hotel RevPAR for the third quarter increased 8.8%, driven by an increase in our average rate of 4.5% and an increase in occupancy of 2.9 percentage points. Our average rate was $152, and our average occupancy for the quarter was 73.3%.
Our properties benefited from strong group demand, which drove a 6.2% increase in comparable food and beverage revenues. Ancillary revenues, net of cancellation fees, increased by just 1.6%. Comparable hotel revenue growth of 6.9%, combined with an increase in comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins of 150 basis points resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $163 million for the third quarter, which represented an increase of $24 million from the prior year. FFO per diluted share after a reduction of $0.02 related to debt repayment and acquisition costs was $0.11 for the quarter. 
On a year-to-date basis, comparable hotel RevPAR increased 5.6%, and comparable S&P revenues grew just 4.3%. Total year-to-date revenue growth of 3.7% combined with comparable hotel-adjusted operating profit margins that declined 20 basis points resulted in the year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $539 million and year-to-date FFO per diluted share of $0.42.
RevPAR growth in our portfolio is consistently strong since April of this year. As we have transitioned more fully into a recovery, the composition of that RevPAR growth has turned more favorable as the improvement has been increasingly driven by increases in average rates. We are also continuing to benefit from a shift in business mix towards higher-rated segments, and these improving demand trends allow us to be less reliant on booking discounted business.
While this trends were apparent in both our Group and Transient businesses during the third quarter, the actual beneficial impact differ. On the Transient front, our 8.6% revenue improvement was primarily driven by an increase in transient rate of nearly 7%, led by an 11% average rate increase in our Premium Corporate business. Our overall transient demand growth of nearly 2% was generated primarily by an increase of 34% in Special Corporate business, which more than offset a 7% reduction in discount room nights. We would expect to see additional strengthening on the rate side as our business mix continues to shift more towards the higher-rated segments and as the impact of last year's Special Corporate rates, which were determined during a weak environment diminished and are replaced by higher-priced contracts.
On the Group side, the strengthening demand trends we have been enjoying all year carried into the third quarter as Group revenues improved by more than 9%. The bulk of this improvement was caused by an almost 8% increase in room nights, although we still benefited from a 1.3% increase in average rates, which was our first average rate increase in the Group sector since the fourth quarter of 2008. The demand growth was led by Association business, which grew by more than 11% and our Luxury Corporate segment, which increased by 27%. While we benefited from demand growth in all segments, the lowest increase was in the Discount segment.
Consistent with the pattern we have been experiencing this year, our booking cycle continues to be very short term. Bookings in the quarter for the quarter exceeded last year's strong pace and are well above levels we experienced in 2007. Group booking activity for the fourth quarter is up nearly 6% compared to 2009 with the improvement occurring over the last 90 days, as our fourth quarter room nights pace was negative at the start of the third quarter. As we look out to 2011, our booking pace with a combined first three quarters is up slightly, and we would expect that surplus to strengthen as we progress into the year.
On the investment front, we completed several transactions over the last few months, some of which we discussed with you during our call in July. In addition to the purchase of the Western Chicago River North, which was announced on our last call, we closed on the acquisitions of the W New York Union Square and the Le Meridien Piccadilly, which is located in the Mayfair district of London. These three acquisitions representing solid cross-section of the types of transactions we are seeking to complete, the termed assets located in major urban gateway markets that can appeal to those business and leisure travelers. We are confident that these assets will outperform the industry over the course of the cycle.
In today's earnings release, we announced the fourth acquisition that matches that profile, the 245-room JW Marriott Hotel Rio de Janeiro, our first hotel in Brazil. This high-end property is in a prime location across from the Copacabana Beach and close to the city's central business district. The hotel is approximately 7,300 square feet of meeting space. It includes a 2,300 square foot ballroom. It also has a rooftop full of spectacular views of the city and the coastline. This hotel represents our fourth investment in Latin America, and we are hopeful that it will facilitate further investments in the dynamic Brazilian market.
These four hotels were purchased for a combined price of $478 million and reflect a 2010 EBITDA multiple of slightly less than 14x. Proactively, we project our acquisition price represent more than 25% discount to replacement cost. This is the unique period of time in the acquisition market as the spread between unlevered return and our cost of capital has rarely been higher and the discount to replacement cost on acquisitions has seldom been more attractive.
We will continue to look for additional acquisition opportunities that meet our investment criteria. And while we continue to have a solid pipeline, our guidance for the remainder of the year does not include any additional deals beyond what we have announced today. Additionally, we have not included any further dispositions in our guidance for the remainder of the year.
Turning to our capital investment program. Expenditures for the third quarter totaled approximately $49 million and are $149 million year-to-date, including $17 million of return on investment projects for the quarter. For the full year, our expected capital expenditure estimate is $300 million to $320 million.
Now let me spend some time on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Overall, our strong performance in the third quarter and the solid booking activity for the fourth quarter suggest that RevPAR should increase between 5.5% and 6.5% for the year, which reflects an increase over our prior guidance. However, this improvement is slightly offset by a more cautious outlook with respect to Food and Beverage and ancillary revenue. 
The revenue guidance combined with the comparable adjusted margin change of flat to up 15 basis points, results in full year adjusted EBITDA of approximately $815 million to $830 million, an FFO per diluted share of $0.67 to $0.69, which has been reduced by $0.04 to $0.05 per diluted share for debt repayment and acquisition cost.
Given that we are in the very early stages of our budgeting process, we are not providing 2011 guidance at this point. However, as we look to next year, we believe that the positive trends we are seeing now will continue resulting in improvements in RevPAR margins and EBITDA. We will give detailed 2011 guidance on our next call in February. 
In closing, we are pleased with our performance this year and certainly this quarter and are optimistic about the trends we are seeing in our industry and look forward to carrying the momentum into 2011. We remain focused on pricing strategies that are asset for continued improvement on the rates side. On the investment front we are excited about the transactions we have completed over the last several months and are continuing to aggressively look for investment opportunities both domestically and internationally.
Thank you. And now let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."

When looking at our portfolio based on property types, all of them performed very well for the quarter. 
Our urban hotels performed the best with the RevPAR increase of 9%. RevPAR for our resort conference hotels increased 8.7%, while RevPAR at our suburban and airport hotels increased 8.6% and 7.8%, respectively. The two best performing markets for the quarter were New Orleans and Orlando, where we have one large hotel in each market. 
New Orleans property have a RevPAR increase of 28.3%, occupancy increased over 12 percentage points and ADR increased 8.3%. The hotel benefited from a significant increase in group room nights and contract business related to the Gulf oil spill cleanup.
For the fourth quarter, we expect the property to underperform the rest of the portfolio due to less citywide business. RevPAR for our Orlando property increased 26.7% due to an occupancy increase of 14 percentage points and a slight decrease in ADR. Group demand, particularly Association business, increased significantly. We expect the hotel to underperform the portfolio in the fourth quarter due to lower levels of Group business and the start of a rooms renovation at the hotel.
The Chicago market continue to outperform the portfolio with a 14.2% improvement in RevPAR. Although there were two fewer citywide advance in the quarter, occupancy increased three percentage points, and ADR improved 9.4% as our hotels benefited from higher levels of in-house Group business. A positive shift in the mix of Transient business, as well as actual rate increases drove the ADR growth. We expect our Chicago hotels to perform in line with the portfolio in the fourth quarter.
Our Boston hotels, with a RevPAR increase of 14.5%, continue to perform exceptionally well. Occupancy increased 5.8 percentage points and ADR grew 6.9%. The outperformance was driven by nearly a 30% improvement in group and citywide room nights. Our five hotels in the market averaged nearly 87% occupancy for the quarter. However, we expect the Boston market to underperform that portfolio in the fourth quarter due to fewer citywide room nights and a ballroom renovation at the Sheraton Boston.
Our New York hotels had another great quarter with a RevPAR increase of 12.9% as rate increased 12.4% and occupancy increased slightly. For the quarter, our New York hotels had nearly 91% occupancy. At these levels, we have been limiting the number of groups and driving Transient business and rates. As a result, Transient ADR increased 15.4%. We expect New York City to have a very good fourth quarter even with rooms renovations at the New York Marriott Marquis and the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers. 
As we discussed on the second quarter call, we expect that our Hawaiian hotels to finally turn the corner in the third quarter, and they did. RevPAR increased 11.8%. Occupancy improved 8.3 percentage points due primarily to a significant improvement in Group demand. 
The increase in airline capacity helped results for the quarter. While both of our hotels will have some of the rooms out of service due to renovations, we still expect them to continue to outperform the portfolio in the fourth quarter.
The Denver market continue to perform well, with a RevPAR improvement of 11.8%. A significant increase in Group and Transient demand drove occupancy up 7.2 percentage points. For the fourth quarter, we expect Denver to continue to outperform the portfolio as we expect both Group and Transient demand to remain strong.
RevPAR for our San Francisco hotels increased 11% due to higher levels of Transient demand. Occupancy was up 5.3 percentage points and ADR improved 3.9%. Improvement in Special Corporate and Corporate demand led to a Transient ADR increase of 6.5% We expect our San Francisco hotels to perform in line with the portfolio in the fourth quarter.
RevPAR for our San Antonio hotels fell 7% as occupancy dropped 6.6 percentage points and rate increased 2.3%. The poor performance was due to lower transient and group demand. We expect our San Antonio hotels to rebound in the fourth quarter and outperform the portfolio due to a substantial increase in group and citywide demand.
As expected, our Phoenix hotels struggled in the third quarter due to a renovation of a significant amount of the meeting space at two of our hotels and the construction of a new ballroom at the Westin Kierland. RevPAR declined 9.8% as occupancy fell 4.3 percentage points and ADR decreased 1.8%. We expect our Phoenix hotels to continue to underperform the portfolio as the renovation and construction projects at the Westin Kierland continue in the fourth quarter.
Year-to-date, New Orleans has been our top performing market with a RevPAR increase of 16.9%; followed by Boston, with an increase of 16.8%; New York, with an increase of 12.6%; and Miami-Fort Lauderdale, with a RevPAR increase of 10.1%. 
Our worst performing market was San Diego, with a RevPAR decrease of 5.8%. However, our San Diego hotels started to rebound in the third quarter, and we expect them to significantly outperform the portfolio in the fourth quarter.
For our European joint venture, RevPAR calculated in constant euros increased 10.3% for the quarter due to an eight percentage improvement in occupancy and a slight decline in ADR. The Crowne Plaza Amsterdam and The Westin Palace Madrid outperformed the rest of the portfolio, while the Renaissance Brussels was the poorest performer, primarily due to a rooms renovation. On a year-to-date basis, RevPAR calculated in constant euros increased 6.1%. 
For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels increased 150 basis points, our best performance of the year. This occurred despite the significant reduction in the level of cancellation and attrition fees and a meaningful increase in bonus expenses in 2010, which when combined, resulted in a 100 basis point reduction in margins. Rooms flow-through was excellent for the quarter at 80.1%, as flow-through benefited from the ADR increase and productivity improvements that led to flat wages and benefits on a per-occupied room basis. Food and Beverage flow-through was lower than expected as groups remain cautious with the ancillary spending, preferring to purchase lower margin items.
Unallocated costs increased 7% for the quarter. This increase was primarily driven by expenses that are variable with revenues, including credit card commissions, reward programs and cluster and shared service allocations. Utility costs increased 6.2% primarily due to higher electricity usage, particularly the northeast, where some of our major markets, such as Boston, New York and Washington, D.C. had a substantial increase in a number of 90-degree-plus days.
Property taxes declined 1%, while property insurance decreased approximately 20%. Looking out to the full year, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins to be up 15 basis points at the high end of the RevPAR range and flat at the low end of the range. These amounts have been reduced by 70 basis points for the year-over-year difference in cancellation and attrition fees and 30 basis points for incremental property level bonus expense.
We currently own a lease hold interest in 53 courtyards and 18 residence inns, which were sold to Hospitality Properties Trust at lease back in 1995 and 1996. In 1998, we subleased these 71 properties to a third party, with initial lease turns expiring in 2010 and 2012. In the third quarter, the subtenants failed the network covenant, and we terminated the sublease in order to not trigger a default under our lease. Accordingly, we now act as owner under management agreement and we started to record property level revenues and expenses from the date of the sublease termination instead of rental income and rental expense. While the sublease terminations affected revenues and expenses, there was no effect in the quarter's operating profit or net income from the termination. We have recourse against the impairment of the subtenants and the subtenants and expect them to continue to fund the majority of the deficit.
We gave notice that we will terminate the lease on the 18 residence and properties effective December 31, 2010, at which time we expect that our $17 million of deferred proceeds plus cash collateral will be returned by HPT. In 2010, we also attend to give notice that we will terminate the lease on the 53 courtyards effective December 31, 2012, at which time our $50 million of deferred proceeds, plus some cash collateral, will also be returned.
During the quarter, we redeemed $225 million of our 7 1/8% Series K senior notes for $230 million. We finished the quarter with over $838 million of cash and cash equivalents and over $540 million of capacity on our line of credit. After taking into consideration the acquisition of the JW Marriott Rio de Janeiro, subsequent to the end of the third quarter, and the depending to seasons of the $115 million mortgage on the W Union Square later this month, we would have approximately $670 million in cash and cash equivalents. 
This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have."

I think what you're just seeing is customers being -- it's good news as the customers are meeting again. Groups are coming back to properties, and the events are happening. I think what we found over the course of the summer, and as we looked out into the fourth quarter, is that they were probably being a bit more cautious about what they spend on food and beverage, specifically on breaks, that seemed to be the areas we talked to the operators, where we were; feeling the most impact. It's just coffee and water and soda instead of more elaborate food displays. And so, the net effect is that group spending per customer is down just a little bit. And I would like to describe this as any kind of a sea change from our perspective but it was we were expecting a little bit more in the third quarter, and as we look out for the fourth quarter, we realized that we should probably moderate our expectations a bit. The other thing that's going to happen on that side that I referred to in my comment is I think it's a little tied into the ancillary revenue or this issue is on the ancillary revenue side, we're not seeing quite as much spending in spas and golf as we might have anticipated. With the strong increase in occupancy that we've had, we would have normally expected those revenues to trend up a little bit more aggressively. Now if you look at where we ended up, I think we're probably up, probably about four percentage or 4% increase in occupancy yet our ancillary revenues is really up about 1%. Again, I don't think it's a major issue, which is we are hoping that we are going to see a little bit more growth on that side. And I think what you're finding is consistent with the fact that groups are spending a little bit less on some food items, they're also spending a little bit less on some of the activities that are happening around event. And as we look into the next year, I don't know that we have enough data yet to necessarily draw a firm conclusion. I would expect that if you rather than thinking about what happened in prior recoveries, typically what happens is that once -- first groups have to start to meet, then the next year, you start to see folks be willing to spend a little bit more on the event in order to make the event a little more special. And we tend to start to benefit from that, of course. The other thing that we're hopefully start to happen, and so far we're going to see that happen in a couple of market, is that at some point the dynamic around the competition for meeting space in hotels at certain high-targeted times will begin to allow us to, again, to charge meeting room rental. And that, of course, is a great -- there's a flow-through on that particular revenue line and it is excellent. We've been able to charge it in some markets this year, this last quarter, but not very many. As occupancies continue to improve, I think there's a greater likelihood we'll start to see that next year and that will factor into this equation, too."

There were some title challenges with that assets that needed to be resolved before Marriott can execute a sale transaction. And so once those were resolved, it was possible for the two of us to negotiate. But it was something that we had been interested in really as far back as two years ago. I think it's somewhat coincident or opportunistic in terms of the timing that we've had that of the first four properties we've bought, two of them have been located outside the U.S. and two are located inside the U.S. I still suspect that on general, the majority of the acquisitions that we complete will be domestic. It's just that we have been active in these other markets, we've been looking in these other places for a while, we felt comfortable with the opportunities when they presented themselves, and so we acted on them. But by and large, I'd say our pipeline still has more assets that we're looking at that are domestic in nature than those that are international."

And so far, we're not hearing that. And as we talked a little bit, one of the things that might help offset some of those changes over the course of the year which Larry had talked about several times in his comments, we've had some pressure in the broad salary and wage area because of the bonus expense kind of coming back into our P&L as the properties perform much better than anticipated, and certainly much better than last year. We'll still have bonus expense for next year. But as you think about year-over-year changes, that bonus expense should not be as significant in the year-over-year context as it was in 2010."

I think that comp gets slightly more difficult in Q4. But I think that the one thing we did comment on, as Larry through the different markets, is that we do have some renovations happening at some of our larger hotels that are going to hit November and December this year. Now the reason those renovations are targeted for that time of year is traditionally, business demand levels are and volume levels are lower. So we hope that there will be less disruptions. But in terms of thinking through what was going to likely happen in the quarter, we were thinking that we should at least provide for some room for conservatism in case the impact turned out to be greater than we expected. Now as we -- clearly, we've had a lot of questions in meetings and sort of, I think, there is in the industry about the potential impact of some of the slowing that we saw on the economy, during the late spring, during the early summer and whether that's going to have an impact on our operations. Clearly that's something that we have been focused on. Now the short answer on that is that we continue to see very good demand. September, based on preliminary results, was up 9.5%. September for us, meaning, September for our monthly hotels at period '10 for our Marriott International hotels. So that trend, that's favorable compared to where we are for the third quarter. Booking pace continues to follow the same pattern of being about in-line a quarter out and then getting very strong during that quarter preceding the actual quarter that happened to them. Bookings in the quarter continue to be good. We're also comforted by the fact that as demand has continue to improve, we're finding more -- better and better ability to fullstop a limit from writing discounts to customers to solicit business, and at the same time to begin to move rates. Of course, the broader economic or the broader fundamental in all of these is that supply is moderating consistently through the year and will be even lower as we work our way into next year. So the net of it is that it is something we've been watching carefully, we've been looking carefully at every monthly report we get to try to see if there is anything that suggesting that there is weakness. And I think really what's happening, at least as it relates to our portfolio, which of course is very focused on urban markets and has always benefited a lot from corporate travel, is despite the fact that GDP growth has not been a strong as people might have hoped or certainly might have predicted early in the year, we're continuing to see that corporate investment and corporate profitability are very strong and frankly, are coming in better than where people thought the beginning of the year and even better than where people thought at the beginning of the third quarter. We benefit from that trend, because whenever investment is up, corporate travel seems to be up. At least, that's what history suggest. And so I think that's why you're seeing the results that we're having. The good news for us is we look a little bit further forward is that the outlook for this point, for corporate investment for next year, is to be even stronger than what we're seeing this year."

Obviously, you guys did a great job this quarter with an 80% flow-through on the rooms department.

Certainly, as you look around the world and focus on markets like Brazil, India, China, do you certainly see a lot better economic growth than what we're projecting to see in the U.S.? And we know that economic growth ultimately translates this to hotel demand growth. And that's really the most fundamental reason why we have felt it was important to explore opportunities internationally. Today, International, probably when you total up the amount of investments that we have in our portfolio in international market, it's roughly in the 7% to 8%. That's counting in Europe just our share of the JV and not the total magnitude of the assets that are there. But as we look into the future, if we continue to feel that we can invest successfully in those markets, every country is a little bit different and every market is a little bit different. So as we continue to prove to ourselves that we can successfully invest outside of the U.S., I think for the very reason you suggest that we would feel comfortable in having that percentage increase in an effort to try to give us broader exposure to markets that are going to grow better than what the U.S. is going to grow."

I must feel comfortable that the increases in EBITDA that we would expect to benefit from would certainly keep asset pricing well above where it is today. I mean at the end of the day, pricing should, in most markets, move much closer to replacement cost. And as I mentioned in our comments, we think we're buying at a meaningful discount to replacement cost. The increasing interest rate or the low levels of interest rates have had some effect, certainly, on the ability of people to pay some of the prices that they've paid. This is not quiet as debt driven an acquisition environment right now than what we saw in the '05, '06 and '07 time frame. Leverage plays a rolling deals but it's not the driver behind deals right now because you just can't get leverage at the same levels that you can get before. So net of it is if -- you'll probably see cap rates go up over the next two or three years, but I think some of that is going to be reflective of, it'll be a little bit because rates are little bit higher, and it'll be because as we start to progress through the growth phase that we all expect to see in these assets in '11, '12, and '13 there's usually a little bit of moderation that comes with the greatly anticipated growth rate moderates to."

I'm curious, I mean, so I know it's not today but do you think in the next 12 months we could hear increasing signs of construction activity or do you think that that's still going to be off the table as we look forward?"

And I still tend to look towards the levels of supply growth that we saw in '03,",381,"Certainly from the standpoint of full-service development, I think I would be surprised if we saw real progress towards a lot of new development in the next 12 to 24 months. And I still tend to look towards the levels of supply growth that we saw in '03, '04, '05 and '06 as being indicative of what's likely to happen in at least '11, '12 and '13. When I compare the two periods, even assuming we have the same rate of recovery that we had last time, which I think is feasible, reality is we're starting a little bit lower so the gap between value and replacement cost is certainly as great but not greater. The availability of financing in today's environment for new construction is weaker than what we experienced in the early part of the last decade. So while financing conditions are trending in the right direction, I don't see a lot of lenders racing to provide loans for new hotels and that will be necessary in order for construction to really increase. So I think you're right. From the standpoint that values have recovered maybe a bit more quickly than people were projecting. The bulk of the reasons behind that is the cash flows are recovering more quickly than people had projected. That will ultimately support new construction, but I think we've got a fair amount of time before that's going to happen. Now having said that, that's a full-service discussion. I think it's even tougher in the luxury markets, luxury sell more, and luxury the last time was subsidized by a lot of condominium construction, where the hotel was an amenity to the condo project. That's only going to make sense in markets that have a vibrant condo market, and I don't see that happening in the near term in most of the major markets across the country. We probably will see some limited-service construction sooner than we'll see full-service constructions. Those properties are smaller, they're easier to finance, the numbers have always tended to work sooner with that type of a product. And so I suspect that when we do start to see supply numbers begin to trend upward instead of continuing to trend downward, it will be because of additional supply at that segment."

I mean, we are encouraged by the fact that when the occupancy rebound this year has been as strong as it has been. But at the same time we're encouraged this last quarter by how strong the rate contribution was. We're probably -- if you look at how we've done, we're still not quite 50% back to, if you look at the drop that we've had from 73, 74 and occupancy in '07 down to 66 last year, we're working our way back, but we're probably if that's about halfway back on that recovery. So I would still be expecting next year that we would continue to progress back towards our prior-peak occupancy levels. But certainly, as you work your way through the year next year, rate will play an increasing role. And what's interesting is that as you look at what's happened to us this past quarter, is that change in business mix has been helpful but we've also been able to get absolute changes in rate within particular segment. And I don't see any reason why that trend won't continue into next year. So to sum that up, my guess is by the time we get to the end of next year, we probably would find that rate was a bigger contributor to RevPAR growth than occupancy, but both will contribute."

We are pleased to report another strong quarter, with solid RevPAR growth driven for the first time in a while by improvements in average rates and continued transaction activity as we completed great acquisitions in",1370,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another strong quarter, with solid RevPAR growth driven for the first time in a while by improvements in average rates and continued transaction activity as we completed great acquisitions in several key target markets. 
First, let's talk about our third quarter results. Our comparable hotel RevPAR for the third quarter increased 8.8%, driven by an increase in our average rate of 4.5% and an increase in occupancy of 2.9 percentage points. Our average rate was $152, and our average occupancy for the quarter was 73.3%.
Our properties benefited from strong group demand, which drove a 6.2% increase in comparable food and beverage revenues. Ancillary revenues, net of cancellation fees, increased by just 1.6%. Comparable hotel revenue growth of 6.9%, combined with an increase in comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins of 150 basis points resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $163 million for the third quarter, which represented an increase of $24 million from the prior year. FFO per diluted share after a reduction of $0.02 related to debt repayment and acquisition costs was $0.11 for the quarter. 
On a year-to-date basis, comparable hotel RevPAR increased 5.6%, and comparable S&P revenues grew just 4.3%. Total year-to-date revenue growth of 3.7% combined with comparable hotel-adjusted operating profit margins that declined 20 basis points resulted in a year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $539 million and year-to-date FFO per diluted share of $0.42.
RevPAR growth in our portfolio has been consistently strong since April of this year. As we have transitioned more fully into a recovery, the composition of that RevPAR growth has turned more favorable as the improvement has been increasingly driven by increases in average rates. We are also continuing to benefit from a shift in business mix towards higher-rated segments, and these improving demand trends allow us to be less reliant on booking discounted business.
While these trends were apparent in both our Group and Transient businesses during the third quarter, the actual beneficial impact differed. On the Transient front, our 8.6% revenue improvement was primarily driven by an increase in transient rate of nearly 7%, led by an 11% average rate increase in our Premium Corporate business. Our overall transient demand growth of nearly 2% was generated primarily by an increase of 34% in Special Corporate business, which more than offset a 7% reduction in discount room nights. We would expect to see additional strengthening on the rate side as our business mix continues to shift more towards the higher-rated segments and as the impact of last year's Special Corporate rates, which were determined during a weak environment, diminish and are replaced by higher-priced contracts.
On the Group side, the strengthening demand trends we have been enjoying all year carried into the third quarter as Group revenues improved by more than 9%. The bulk of this improvement was caused by an almost 8% increase in room nights, although we still benefited from a 1.3% increase in average rates, which was our first average rate increase in the Group sector since the fourth quarter of 2008. The demand growth was led by Association business, which grew by more than 11% and our Luxury Corporate segment, which increased by 27%. While we benefited from demand growth in all segments, the lowest increase was in the Discount segment.
Consistent with the pattern we have been experiencing this year, our booking cycle continues to be very short-term. Bookings in the quarter for the quarter exceeded last year's strong pace and were well above levels we experienced in 2007. Group booking activity for the fourth quarter is up nearly 6% compared to 2009 with the improvement occurring over the last 90 days, as our fourth quarter room night pace was negative at the start of the third quarter. As we look out to 2011, our booking pace for the combined first three quarters is up slightly, and we would expect that surplus to strengthen as we progress into the year.
On the investment front, we completed several transactions over the last few months, some of which we discussed with you during our call in July. In addition to the purchase of the Westin Chicago River North, which was announced on our last call, we closed on the acquisitions of the W New York Union Square and the Le Meridien Piccadilly, which is located in the Mayfair district of London. These three acquisitions represent a solid cross-section of the types of transactions we are seeking to complete, superb assets located in major urban gateway markets that can appeal to those business and leisure travelers. We are confident that these assets will outperform the industry over the course of the cycle.
In today's earnings release, we announced a fourth acquisition that matches that profile, the 245-room JW Marriott Hotel Rio de Janeiro, our first hotel in Brazil. This high-end property is in a prime location across from the Copacabana Beach and close to the city's central business district. The hotel has approximately 7,300 square feet of meeting space. It includes a 2,300 square foot ballroom. It also has a rooftop pool with spectacular views of the city and the coastline. This hotel represents our fourth investment in Latin America, and we are hopeful that it will facilitate further investments in the dynamic Brazilian market.
These four hotels were purchased for a combined price of $478 million and reflect a 2010 EBITDA multiple of slightly less than 14x. Collectively, we project our acquisition prices represent more than a 25% discount to replacement cost. This is a unique period of time in the acquisition market as the spread between unlevered return and our cost of capital has rarely been higher and the discount to replacement cost on acquisitions has seldom been more attractive.
We will continue to look for additional acquisition opportunities that meet our investment criteria. And while we continue to have a solid pipeline, our guidance for the remainder of the year does not include any additional deals beyond what we have announced today. Additionally, we have not included any further dispositions in our guidance for the remainder of the year.
Turning to our capital investment program. Expenditures for the third quarter totaled approximately $49 million and are $149 million year-to-date, including $17 million of return on investment projects for the quarter. For the full year, our expected capital expenditure estimate is $300 million to $320 million.
Now let me spend some time on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Overall, our strong performance in the third quarter and the solid booking activity for the fourth quarter suggest that RevPAR should increase between 5 ½% and 6 ½% for the year, which reflects an increase over our prior guidance. However, this improvement is slightly offset by a more cautious outlook with respect to Food and Beverage and ancillary revenue. 
The revenue guidance combined with the comparable adjusted margin change of flat to up 15 basis points, results in full year adjusted EBITDA of approximately $815 million to $830 million, an FFO per diluted share of $0.67 to $0.69, which has been reduced by $0.04 to $0.05 per diluted share for debt repayment and acquisition costs.
Given that we are in the very early stages of our budgeting process, we are not providing 2011 guidance at this point. However, as we look to next year, we believe that the positive trends we are seeing now will continue, resulting in improvements in RevPAR margins and EBITDA. We will give detailed 2011 guidance on our next call in February. 
In closing, we are pleased with our performance this year and certainly this quarter and are optimistic about the trends we are seeing in our industry and look forward to carrying the momentum into 2011. We remain focused on pricing strategies of our assets for continued improvement on the rates side. On the investment front we are excited about the transactions we have completed over the last several months and are continuing to aggressively look for investment opportunities both domestically and internationally.
Thank you. And now let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."

When looking at our portfolio based on property types, all of them performed very well for the quarter. 
Our urban hotels performed the best with a RevPAR increase of 9%. RevPAR for our resort conference hotels increased 8.7%, while RevPAR at our suburban and airport hotels increased 8.6% and 7.8%, respectively. The two best performing markets for the quarter were New Orleans and Orlando, where we have one large hotel in each market. 
The New Orleans property had a RevPAR increase of 28.3%, occupancy increased over 12 percentage points and ADR increased 8.3%. The hotel benefited from a significant increase in group room nights and contract business related to the Gulf oil spill cleanup.
For the fourth quarter, we expect the property to underperform the rest of the portfolio due to less citywide business. RevPAR for our Orlando property increased 26.7% due to an occupancy increase of 14 percentage points and a slight decrease in ADR. Group demand, particularly Association business, increased significantly. We expect the hotel to underperform the portfolio in the fourth quarter due to lower levels of Group business and the start of a rooms renovation at the hotel.
The Chicago market continued to outperform the portfolio with a 14.2% improvement in RevPAR. Although there were two fewer citywide events in the quarter, occupancy increased three percentage points, and ADR improved 9.4% as our hotels benefited from higher levels of in-house Group business. A positive shift in the mix of Transient business, as well as actual rate increases drove the ADR growth. We expect our Chicago hotels to perform in line with the portfolio in the fourth quarter.
Our Boston hotels, with a RevPAR increase of 14.5%, continue to perform exceptionally well. Occupancy increased 5.8 percentage points and ADR grew 6.9%. The outperformance was driven by nearly a 30% improvement in group and citywide room nights. Our five hotels in the market averaged nearly 87% occupancy for the quarter. However, we expect the Boston market to underperform the portfolio in the fourth quarter due to fewer citywide room nights and a ballroom renovation at the Sheraton Boston.
Our New York hotels had another great quarter with a RevPAR increase of 12.9% as rate increased 12.4% and occupancy increased slightly. For the quarter, our New York hotels had nearly 91% occupancy. At these levels, we have been limiting the number of groups and driving Transient business and rates. As a result, Transient ADR increased 15.4%. We expect New York City to have a very good fourth quarter even with rooms renovations at the New York Marriott Marquis and the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers. 
As we discussed on the second quarter call, we expected our Hawaiian hotels to finally turn the corner in the third quarter, and they did. RevPAR increased 11.8%. Occupancy improved 8.3 percentage points due primarily to a significant improvement in Group demand. 
The increase in airline capacity helped results for the quarter. While both of our hotels will have some of their rooms out of service due to renovations, we still expect them to continue to outperform the portfolio in the fourth quarter.
The Denver market continued to perform well, with a RevPAR improvement of 11.8%. A significant increase in Group and Transient demand drove occupancy up 7.2 percentage points. For the fourth quarter, we expect Denver to continue to outperform the portfolio as we expect both Group and Transient demand to remain strong.
RevPAR for our San Francisco hotels increased 11% due to higher levels of Transient demand. Occupancy was up 5.3 percentage points and ADR improved 3.9%. Improvement in Special Corporate and Corporate demand led to a Transient ADR increase of 6.5%. We expect our San Francisco hotels to perform in line with the portfolio in the fourth quarter.
RevPAR for our San Antonio hotels fell 7% as occupancy dropped 6.6 percentage points and rate increased 2.3%. The poor performance was due to lower Transient and Group demand. We expect our San Antonio hotels to rebound in the fourth quarter and outperform the portfolio due to a substantial increase in Group and citywide demand.
As expected, our Phoenix hotels struggled in the third quarter due to the renovation of a significant amount of the meeting space at two of our hotels and the construction of a new ballroom at the Westin Kierland. RevPAR declined 9.8% as occupancy fell 4.3 percentage points and ADR decreased 1.8%. We expect our Phoenix hotels to continue to underperform the portfolio as the renovation and construction projects at the Westin Kierland continue in the fourth quarter.
Year-to-date, New Orleans has been our top performing market with a RevPAR increase of 16.9%; followed by Boston, with an increase of 16.8%; New York, with an increase of 12.6%; and Miami-Fort Lauderdale, with a RevPAR increase of 10.1%. 
Our worst performing market was San Diego, with a RevPAR decrease of 5.8%. However, our San Diego hotels started to rebound in the third quarter, and we expect them to significantly outperform the portfolio in the fourth quarter.
For our European joint venture, RevPAR calculated in constant euros increased 10.3% for the quarter due to an eight percentage improvement in occupancy and a slight decline in ADR. The Crowne Plaza Amsterdam and The Westin Palace Madrid outperformed the rest of the portfolio, while the Renaissance Brussels was the poorest performer, primarily due to a rooms renovation. On a year-to-date basis, RevPAR calculated in constant euros increased 6.1%. 
For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels increased 150 basis points, our best performance of the year. This occurred despite the significant reduction in the level of cancellation and attrition fees and a meaningful increase in bonus expenses in 2010, which when combined, resulted in a 100 basis point reduction in margins. Rooms flow-through was excellent for the quarter at 80.1%, as flow-through benefited from the ADR increase and productivity improvements that led to flat wages and benefits on a per-occupied room basis. Food and Beverage flow-through was lower than expected as groups remained cautious with the ancillary spending, preferring to purchase lower margin items.
Unallocated costs increased 7% for the quarter. This increase was primarily driven by expenses that are variable with revenues, including credit card commissions, reward programs and cluster and shared service allocations. Utility costs increased 6.2% primarily due to higher electricity usage, particularly the northeast, where some of our major markets, such as Boston, New York and Washington, D.C. had a substantial increase in a number of 90-degree-plus days.
Property taxes declined 1%, while property insurance decreased approximately 20%. Looking out to the full year, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins to be up 15 basis points at the high end of the RevPAR range and flat at the low end of the range. These amounts have been reduced by 70 basis points for the year-over-year difference in cancellation and attrition fees and 30 basis points for incremental property level bonus expense.
We currently own a leasehold interest in 53 Courtyards and 18 Residence Inns, which were sold to Hospitality Properties Trust and leased back in 1995 and 1996. In 1998, we subleased these 71 properties to a third party, with initial lease terms expiring in 2010 and 2012. In the third quarter, the subtenants failed a network covenant, and we terminated the sublease in order to not trigger a default under our lease. Accordingly, we now act as owner under management agreement and we started to record property level revenues and expenses from the date of the sublease termination instead of rental income and rental expense. While the sublease terminations affected revenues and expenses, there was no effect on the quarter's operating profit or net income from the termination. We have recourse against the parent of the subtenants and the subtenants and expect them to continue to fund the majority of the deficit.
We gave notice that we will terminate the lease on the 18 Residence Inn properties effective December 31, 2010, at which time we expect that our $17 million of deferred proceeds plus some cash collateral will be returned by HPT. In 2010, we also intend to give notice that we will terminate the lease on the 53 Courtyards effective December 31, 2012, at which time our $50 million of deferred proceeds, plus some cash collateral, will also be returned.
During the quarter, we redeemed $225 million of our 7 1/8% Series K senior notes for $230 million. We finished the quarter with over $838 million of cash and cash equivalents and over $540 million of capacity on our line of credit. After taking into consideration the acquisition of the JW Marriott Rio de Janeiro, subsequent to the end of the third quarter, and the pending defeasance of the $115 million mortgage on the W Union Square later this month, we would have approximately $670 million in cash and cash equivalents.

I think what you're just seeing is customers being -- it's good news that the customers are meeting again. Groups are coming back to properties, and the events are happening. I think what we found over the course of the summer, and as we looked out into the fourth quarter, is that they were probably being a bit more cautious about what they spent on food and beverage, specifically on breaks, that seemed to be the areas we talked to the operators, where we were feeling the most impact. It's just coffee and water and soda instead of more elaborate food displays. And so, the net effect is that group spending per customer is down just a little bit. And I wouldn’t want to describe this as any kind of a sea change from our perspective but it was we were expecting a little bit more in the third quarter, and as we looked out to the fourth quarter, we realized that we should probably moderate our expectations a bit. The other thing that's going to happen on that side that I referred to in my comment is I think it's a little tied into the ancillary revenue, this issue, is on the ancillary revenue side, we're not seeing quite as much spending in spas and golf as we might have anticipated. With the strong increase in occupancy that we've had, we would have normally expected those revenues to trend up a little bit more aggressively. Now if you look at where we ended up, I think we're probably up, probably about four percentage or 4% increase in occupancy yet our ancillary revenues are only up about 1%. Again, I don't think it's a major issue, it’s just we were hoping that we were going to see a little bit more growth on that side. And I think what you're finding is consistent with the fact that groups are spending a little bit less on some food items, they're also spending a little bit less on some of the activities that are happening around events. And as we look into next year, I don't know that we have enough data yet to necessarily draw a firm conclusion. I would expect that if you rather than thinking about what happened in prior recoveries, typically what happens is that once -- first groups have to start to meet, then the next year, you start to see folks be willing to spend a little bit more on the event in order to make the event a little bit more special. And we tend to start to benefit from that, of course. The other thing that will hopefully start to happen, and so far we've only seen this happen in a couple of markets, is that at some point the dynamic around the competition for meeting space in hotels at certain high-targeted times will begin to allow us to, again, to charge meeting room rental. And that, of course, is a great -- the flow-through on that particular revenue item is excellent. We've been able to charge it in some markets this year, this last quarter, but not very many. As occupancies continue to improve, I think there's a greater likelihood we'll start to see that next year and that will factor into this equation, too."

There were some title challenges with that asset that needed to be resolved before Marriott could execute a sale transaction. And so once those were resolved, it was possible for the two of us to negotiate. But it was something that we had been interested in really as far back as two years ago. I think it's somewhat coincident or opportunistic in terms of the timing that we've had that of the first four properties we've bought, two of them have been located outside the U.S. and two are located inside the U.S. I still suspect that on general, the majority of the acquisitions that we complete will be domestic. It's just that we have been active in these other markets, we've been looking in these other places for a while, we felt comfortable with the opportunities when they presented themselves, and so we acted on them. But by and large, I'd say our pipeline still has more assets that we're looking at that are domestic in nature than those that are international."

And so far, we're not hearing that. And as we’ve talked a little bit, one of the things that might help offset some of those changes over the course of the year which Larry had talked about several times in his comments, we've had some pressure in the broad salary and wage area because of the bonus expense kind of coming back into our P&L as the properties perform much better than anticipated, and certainly much better than last year. We'll still have bonus expense for next year. But as you think about year-over-year changes, that bonus expense should not be as significant in the year-over-year context as it was in 2010."

I think that the comp gets slightly more difficult in Q4. But I think that the one thing we did comment on, as Larry went through the different markets, is that we do have some renovations happening at some of our larger hotels that are going to hit November and December of this year. Now the reason those renovations are targeted for that time of year is traditionally business demand levels are and volume levels are lower. So we hope that there will be less disruption. But in terms of thinking through what was going to likely happen in the quarter, we were thinking that we should at least provide for some room for conservatism in case the impact turned out to be greater than we expected. Now as we -- clearly, we've had a lot of questions in meetings and sort of, I think, there is in the industry about the potential impact of some of the slowing that we saw in the economy during the late spring and during the early summer and whether that's going to have any impact on our operations. And clearly that's something that we’ve been focused on. Now the short answer on that is that we continue to see very good demand. September, based on preliminary results, was up 9 ½%. September for us, meaning, September for our monthly hotels and period 10 for our Marriott International hotels. So that trend, that's favorable compared to where we are for the third quarter. Booking pace continues to follow the same pattern of being about in-line a quarter out and then getting very strong during that quarter preceding the actual quarter that happened, and then bookings in the quarter continue to be good. We're also comforted by the fact that as demand has continued to improve, we're finding more -- better and better ability to fullstop a limit providing discounts to customers to solicit business, and at the same time to begin to move rates. Of course, the broader economic or the broader fundamental in all of this is that supply is moderating consistently through the year and will be even lower as we work our way into next year. So the net of it is that it is something we've been watching carefully. We've been looking carefully at every monthly report we get to try to see if there is anything that’s suggesting that there’s weakness. And I think really what's happening, at least as it relates to our portfolio, which of course is very focused on urban markets and has always benefited a lot from corporate travel, is despite the fact that GDP growth has not been as strong as people might have hoped or certainly might have predicted early in the year, we're continuing to see that corporate investment and corporate profitability are very strong and frankly, are coming in better than where people thought in the beginning of the year and even better than where people thought at the beginning of the third quarter. We benefit from that trend, because whenever investment is up, corporate travel seems to be up. At least, that's what history suggests. And so I think that's why you're seeing the results that we're having. The good news for us as we look a little bit further forward is that the outlook for this point, for corporate investment for next year, is to be even stronger than what we're seeing this year."

Certainly, as you look around the world and focus on markets like Brazil, India, China, you certainly see a lot better economic growth than what we're projecting to see in the U.S. And we know that economic growth ultimately translates into hotel demand growth. And that's really the most fundamental reason why we have felt it was important to explore opportunities internationally. Today, International, probably when you total up the amount of investments that we have in our portfolio in international markets, it's roughly in the 7% to 8%. That's counting in Europe just our share of the JV and not the total magnitude of the assets that are there. But as we look into the future, if we continue to feel that we can invest successfully in those markets, every country is a little bit different and every market is a little bit different. So as we continue to prove to ourselves that we can successfully invest outside of the U.S., I think for the very reason you suggest, that we would feel comfortable in having that percentage increase in an effort to try to give us broader exposure to markets that are going to grow better than what the U.S. is going to grow."

I would feel comfortable that the increases in EBITDA that we would expect to benefit from would certainly keep asset pricing well above where it is today. I mean at the end of the day, pricing should, in most markets, move much closer to replacement cost. And as I mentioned in our comments, we think we're buying at a meaningful discount to replacement cost. The increasing interest rate or the low levels of interest rates have had some effect, certainly, on the ability of people to pay some of the prices that they've paid. This is not quite as debt-driven an acquisition environment right now as what we saw in the '05, '06 and '07 time frame. Leverage plays a role in deals but it's not the driver behind deals right now because you just can't get leverage at the same levels that you could get before. So net of it is if -- you'll probably see cap rates go up over the next two or three years, but I think some of that is going to be reflective of, it'll be a little bit because rates are little bit higher, and it'll be because as we start to progress through the growth phase that we all expect to see in these assets in '11, '12, and '13 there's usually a little bit of moderation that comes as the anticipated growth rate moderates too."

The availability of financing in today's environment for new construction is weaker than what we experienced in the early part of the last decade. So while financing conditions are trending in the right direction, I don't see a lot of lenders racing to provide loans for new hotels and that will be necessary in order for construction to really increase. So I think you're right from the standpoint that values have recovered maybe a bit more quickly than people were projecting. The bulk of the reason behind that is that cash flows are recovering more quickly than people had projected. That will ultimately support new construction, but I think we've got a fair amount of time before that's going to happen. Now having said that, that's a full-service discussion. I think it's even tougher in the luxury market. Luxury sell more, and Luxury the last time was subsidized by a lot of condominium construction, where the hotel was an amenity to a condo project. That's only going to make sense in markets that have a vibrant condo market, and I don't see that happening in the near-term in most of the major markets across the country. We probably will see some limited-service construction sooner than we'll see full-service constructions. Those properties are smaller, they're easier to finance, the numbers have always tended to work sooner with that type of a product. And so I suspect that when we do start to see supply numbers begin to trend upward instead of continuing to trend downward, it will be because of additional supply at that segment."

I mean, we are encouraged by the fact that one, the occupancy rebound this year has been as strong as it has been. But at the same time we're encouraged this last quarter by how strong the rate contribution was. We're probably -- if you look at how we've done, we're still not quite 50% back to -- if you look at the drop that we had from 73, 74 in occupancy in '07 down to 66 last year, we're working our way back, but we're probably at best about halfway back on that recovery. So I would still be expecting next year that we would continue to progress back towards our prior-peak occupancy level. But certainly, as you work your way through the year next year, rate will play an increasing role. And what's interesting is that as you look at what's happened to us this past quarter, is that change in business mix has been helpful but we've also been able to get absolute changes in rate within particular segment. And I don't see any reason why that trend won't continue into next year. So to sum that up, my guess is by the time we get to the end of next year, we probably would find that rate was a bigger contributor to RevPAR growth than occupancy, but both will contribute."
