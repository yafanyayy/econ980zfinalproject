I'm going to start the call with a few preliminary comments and then turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Larry Nichols. Larry's going to provide an overview of 2009 and recap our reserves performance for the year. Following Larry's remarks, our President, John Richels will review 2009 financial results and update our 2010 outlook. And then our Executive Vice President of Exploration and Production, Dave Hager, will cover fourth quarter operating highlights. We'll conclude the call in about an hour, so if we don't get to your questions in the Q&A period, please feel free to follow up with us later in the day. A replay of this call will be available later today through a link on our homepage, that's www.devonenergy.com.In November of 2009, we filed a Form 8-K with detailed guidance for 2010. During the call today, we're going to update some of that guidance and those updates will be posted to our website under the Estimates link in the Investors Relations area of the website. In addition, the 2009 Form 10-K, we expect to file that on February 26 and it will reflect this updated guidance. Before we get to the business of the call, we are obligated to remind you that the discussion of our expectations, plans, forecasts and estimates are all considered forward-looking statements under U.S. Securities law. And while we always make every effort to give you the very best data possible, there are many factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our estimates. For a discussion of those risk factors, please refer to our Form 8-K filed November 16, 2009. One final compliance item, we will make reference today in the call to various non-GAAP performance measures. When we refer to these measures, we are required to provide certain disclosures under Securities law. If you would like to review those disclosures, they are also available on the Devon website.Finally, I want to remind everyone that in November of 2009, we announced plans to divest all of our international and Gulf of Mexico assets. And as a result of these plans, accounting rules require our financial reporting to be somewhat illogical. The oil and gas production from the international operations that we are divesting are excluded for all periods presented, while the production from the Gulf of Mexico assets we are selling are included in our reported volumes and financials. Similarly, revenues, expenses for the international assets are collapsed into a single-line item at the end of the statement of operations and that line item is filed discontinued operations while the revenues and expenditures for the Gulf divestiture assets remain embedded in our continuing operations.To provide increased transparency in today's press release, you will find additional tables that provide a detailed statement of operations, as well as production and reserve data and cost-incurred figures attributable to the operations classified as discontinued. And again, that's only the international operations.Our comments today on the financial statements will generally conform to the presentation for continued operations. But when it's practical, we will provide commentary specifically targeting the North American on-shore operations that represent the go-forward Devon.The accounting treatment of the divestiture properties also muddies the water for Devon's fourth quarter comparison to consensus estimates. We polled to sell-side analysts that report estimates to First Call, and learned that about half the analysts included international operations while the other half excluded the impact of these operations. The mean estimate for the analysts who included discontinued operations was $1.29 per share. This compares to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.60 for the fourth quarter. The mean estimate for the analysts who excluded discontinued operations was $1.20 per share. And that figure compares to our adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $1.33 per diluted share. The reconciling items are included in our press release today. In either case, with or without the contribution of our international assets, our fourth quarter results significantly exceeded expectations. With those items out of the way, I'll turn the call over to Devon's CEO, Larry Nichols."
266510,78940833,50351,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2010",2010-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Vince and good morning, everyone. This year 2010 is a transition for Devon, a very much of a transition year as we divest our offshore and international assets and refocused all of our efforts on Devon's very powerful North American onshore growth",1188,"Thanks, Vince and good morning, everyone. This year 2010 is a transition for Devon, a very much of a transition year as we divest our offshore and international assets and refocused all of our efforts on Devon's very powerful North American onshore growth engine. Our philosophy of focusing on optimizing returns and refusing to get caught up in that growth-at-any-cost mentality is reflected in the very solid 2009 results that we reported today. We have achieved solid production growth while significantly reducing operating cost and delivering industry-leading finding and development costs. Including the properties we are divesting, we increased company-wide oil and gas production to a record 682,000 Boe per day. Production from our North American onshore properties also grew to a record 603,000 Boe per day, which is up 6.5% over 2008 production. At the same time, we drove unit operating cost from those North American onshore operations from our continuing operations, down 14% to just $7.16 per equivalent Boe per barrel. We generated $4.7 billion of cash flow from operations, funding most of our $5.1 billion in capital expenditures. With that capital, we drilled more than 1,100 successful wells, driving crude reserves to the highest level in our company's history and delivering outstanding reserve replacement results. Our Marketing and Midstream business delivered yet another year of better than forecasted results, reaching $512 million in operating profit. And finally, we maintained a very strong financial position, ending the year with a net debt to capitalization ratio of 29% and unused credit lines and cash on hand totaling $2.8 billion.In today's news release, we provided a summary reserve report data for continuing operations in accordance with accounting standards. Although the results from those continuing operations are impressive, what I wanted to talk a little bit about are Devon's North American onshore properties, which delivered even stronger reserve growth, reflecting the strength of Devon's property base going forward.Drill-bit reserve additions for North American onshore, and by drill-bit, I'm referring to discoveries, extensions and performance revisions, came in at 492 million Boe. These drill-bit additions were well over 200% of our 2009 onshore production. With drill-bit capital of $3.2 billion, including capitalized G&A and interest, our organic North American onshore finding and development cost were an industry-leading $6.59 per Boe.It is important to realize that one-year F&D costs can be somewhat arbitrary because capital expenditures and reserve bookings are often misaligned, and we are going to see that in 2008 and 2009. In 2009, we expect North American onshore reserves to add a total of about 320 million to 340 million Boe, with associated drill-bit capital of roughly $4.4 billion. This will give us F&D of a little over $13 per barrel for 2010. This variance comes primarily from the timing of bookings to reserves at Jackfish relative to the capital outlay. If you combine our 2009 results and our 2010 forecast, you'll come up with an average F&D for those two years of a little over $9 a barrel. And we think this is more indicative of our go-forward expectations and is still a number that will compare very favorably to our peer group.Price revisions, again for North American onshore properties only, gave us a net positive boost in 2009, adding another 176 million barrels. Positive oil price-related revisions, mainly coming from our Jackfish properties in Canada more than offset negative gas price revisions. These results underscore the importance of having a reserve and production base with a balance between natural gas and liquids. In fact, oil and natural gas liquids made up more than 40% of our total North American onshore reserves at the end of 2009. While some of our peers now aspire to achieve this kind of liquids-gas balance, Devon is already there. Looking at oil sources F&D, in other words, including both drill-bit additions and net price revisions, we added 669 million Boe onshore in North America, which is more than 3x our production and it's at a cost of $3.3 billion. As with only drill-bit only F&D, our oil sources F&D for 2009 is a little less than $5 of Boe which is also industry-leading.It is notable that Devon achieved these results without taking our proved undeveloped reserves to aggressive levels. While some companies have booked proven undeveloped reserves approaching 50%, and in fact in some cases even more than 50% of total reserves, Devon's company-wide proved undeveloped reserves are only 30% of total proved. Likewise, pro forma for the divestitures, in other words looking at only North American onshore, PUD is only 29% of total reserves. There had been a lot of talk recently about PUD additions as the result of SEC rule changes and the resulting impact on reported F&D costs. As a result, some analysts are computing F&D on a proved developed-only basis, or in other words, excluding PUD reserves. Devon's 2009 F&D on a proved developed basis is roughly $11.50 per Boe, again very, very strong performance.In summary, for our North American onshore, we added in 2009 2.6 billion equivalent barrels of proved reserves which represents 20% growth over year-end 2008 North American reserves. In fact, our year-end 2009 North American onshore reserves are almost 9% more than company-wide proved reserves at the end of 2008, including the assets that we are divesting. To say it another way, if we had sold all of our Gulf and international reserves at the very beginning of 2009, our activity in 2009 would not only have replaced the reserves that we sold and replaced our production for the year, but would also have given us growth for the company by 9%. That demonstrates the strength of our North American onshore portfolio. This result also increases Devon's reserve life index to 12 years.Before I turn the call over to John, I want to update you on the status of our Gulf and international divestitures. We announced our first step in December with our agreement to sell our interest in three lower tertiary [ph] prospects at Cascade, St. Malo and Jack to Maersk. As I was going to that announcement, partners in Cascade and St. Malo exercised their preferential rights. Maersk recently closed on the purchase of Jack as originally announced. This keeps the aggregate sale price for Devon's interest in these projects at $1.3 billion or $1.1 billion after-tax. Because we prepared our 2010 capital budget on the assumption that we would own the divestiture assets for the full year, the sale of those three assets reduces our 2010 capital budget by some $400 million. We now have data rooms open for all of the international and all of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets and we are in the process of preparing the remaining data room for our remaining Gulf properties. The level of interest is high, and we remain confident in the previously provided range of net after-tax proceeds of $4.5 billion to $7.5 billion. We expect to receive the bids for all the assets by midyear and to close the sales throughout the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to John Richels for our financial review and outlook. John?"

Today, I'll take you through a brief review of the key events and drivers that shaped our 2009 financial results and also take you through our outlook for 2010. As Vince mentioned earlier, we have reclassified",1739,"Thank you, Larry and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll take you through a brief review of the key events and drivers that shaped our 2009 financial results and also take you through our outlook for 2010. As Vince mentioned earlier, we have reclassified the assets, liabilities and results of operations for our international assets into discontinued operations for all accounting periods presented. As a result, I'll focus most of my comments on our reported continuing operations. And just to reiterate, our reported results from continuing operations include both the North American onshore assets that we are keeping and the Gulf of Mexico assets that we plan to divest. So let's start with production. Total 2009 company-wide production, including international, came in at 249 million equivalent barrels or some 11 million Boe greater than our beginning-of-the-year forecast. Looking at continuing operations alone and again, under accounting rules, that includes the production from the Gulf properties that we are divesting, 2009 production was 233 million oil equivalent barrels or approximately 639,000 Boes per day. That's 10 million barrels higher than our 2008 production from continuing operations and more than 1 million barrels above the guidance we provided in our most recent update.When you examine just the North American onshore assets, that is, the assets that we will be retaining in the repositioned company, you will see that 2009 production increased 36,600 equivalent barrels per day or about 6.5% over the full year 2008. This growth was achieved in spite of voluntarily reducing production in the second half of the year. The primary drivers of our onshore production growth in 2009 include our Jackfish SAGD project as well as our Barnett, Cana and our Cana-Woodford Shale plays. Reported production was also supplemented by lower crown royalty rates in Canada.Fourth quarter production from continuing operations came in at 56.1 million equivalent barrels or approximately 609,000 barrels per day. This result was about 22,000 equivalent barrels per day lower than the third quarter of 2009. The decline is almost entirely attributable to the impact of reduced drilling during the year and the voluntary volume reductions that we announced in mid-2009.In 2010, we expect production from continuing operations to range between 231 million and 235 million barrels. It's important to note that this estimate assumes that all of our producing Gulf of Mexico assets are sold on the last day of 2010. Since we actually expect to sell the properties throughout the year, we'll provide updated guidance as we announce those sales.Looking specifically at our retained asset base, that's the North American onshore region, we are raising our production guidance to some 221 million equivalent barrels of production or about 2 million Boes more than we have previously forecast. For the first quarter of 2010, we expect to produce between 55 million and 56 million barrels from continuing operations, including approximately 53 million barrels from our North American onshore portfolio. In response to higher activity levels, we expect to grow North American onshore production in each subsequent quarter of 2010. And beyond 2010, as we said when we were announcing the repositioning, we expect to continue to deliver significant economic growth without the need to issue incremental debt or equity.Moving to price realizations beginning with oil, in the fourth quarter of 2009, Devon's oil price realizations came in at the top end of our guidance range at approximately 84% of WTI or $63.84 per barrel. Once again, Canadian realizations were above our expectations due to a favorable supply-demand balance for heavier Canadian crudes.Looking at the full-year 2010, we have hedged 79,000 barrels of oil per day and that's about two thirds of our expected oil production from continuing operations. We utilized callers for those hedges with an average for of about $67 per barrel and a ceiling of about $96 per barrel.On the natural gas side, the benchmark Henry Hub gas price improved to an average of $4.16 per MCF during the fourth quarter. In addition to the higher index price, differentials for all of our major operating regions narrowed during the fourth quarter. Price realizations were especially strong for our Canadian gas production, averaging nearly 100% of Henry Hub. In total, our company-wide realized price, before the impact of hedges, came in at $3.80 per MCF or 91% of Henry Hub. That's a 34% increase in realized price over the last quarter. For the fourth quarter, cash settlements from the hedges increased Devon's company-wide realizations by $0.65 per MCF to an all-in price including hedges of $4.45 per MCF.We have approximately 1.4 BCF per day of gas hedged throughout 2010 with swaps on callers protecting a weighted average floor of $6.12 per MCF. In aggregate, our hedged position represents about 53% of our estimated natural gas production for the year. We also have a regional basis hedges on 150 million cubic feet a day of Canadian production and 70 million a day of Rockies gas. The average basis differential we locked in is $0.33 per MMBtu in Canada and $0.37 per MMBtu in the Rockies.Turning to our marketing and midstream operations, driven by higher commodity prices and strong cost controls, Devon's fourth quarter operating profit climbed to $133 million and brought our full year marketing and midstream profit up to $512 million. Looking ahead to 2010, we expect another solid year with an expected full-year operating profit of $450 million to $525 million.Before we move into a discussion of the specific expenses, I just want to point out a change to the presentation of a few expense categories in our income statement. To bring us in line with most of our peers and to provide more clarity into our recurring operating cost trends, we are now reporting ad valorem taxes for all periods presented on a new line item on the income statement entitled, Taxes Other Than Income Taxes. This new line item also contains production taxes and a few miscellaneous business taxes. Looking at that expense, it's the taxes other than income taxes line, that totaled $314 million in 2009. That's a $162 million decrease when compared to 2009 results. This decline is entirely due to lower commodity prices throughout 2009 resulting in decreased production taxes. In the upcoming year, we expect taxes other than income taxes to range between 4.5% to 5.5% of total oil, gas and NGO revenues.Turning to operating expenses, for 2009, our lease operating expenses came in at $1.7 billion or $7.16 per equivalent barrel produced. This represents the unit cost decrease of $1.13 per equivalent barrel or about 14%. The decrease reflects lower energy costs and downward price pressure for oilfield services and supplies, really across-the-board. Looking forward, we expect 2010 LOE per Boe to be in the range of $7.50 to $8.15 per barrel of production. For our North American onshore assets, we expect 2010 LOE rates to be in the bottom half of that guidance range. Devon's full-year 2009 DD&A expense for oil and gas properties totaled $1.8 billion or $7.86 per barrel. This result was within the guidance range we provided last November. For 2010, we anticipate our depletion rate to be between $7.60 and $8.10 per barrel of production.Moving on to G&A expenditures, our reported G&A expense for 2009 came in at $648 million, which is essentially flat with 2008. Looking ahead, we expect to achieve additional efficiencies in 2010 reducing G&A cost by about $50 million. Our decision to sell our Gulf and international assets required us to recognize $153 million of restructuring expenses in the fourth quarter. Of this amount, $105 million was recorded on the expense line item titled Restructuring Costs, while the remaining $48 million of the restructuring expenses are included in the Discontinued Operations line. In 2010, we expect to recognize between $50 million and $120 million of additional restructuring charges.Shifting to interest expense, interest expense for 2009 was $349 million, right in line with our expectations. For 2010, we expect interest expense to be roughly flat, somewhere between $325 million and $365 million. The final expense item I want to touch on is income taxes. Devon's recorded income tax expense for the fourth quarter was 36% of pretax income, the most significant item affecting our tax rate during the quarter was the decision to divest our international assets. This event triggered the recognition of $55 million of additional income tax expense during the quarter. When you back out the impact of the non-recurring items, Devon's adjusted fourth-quarter tax rate came in at 29%, with 13% being current and 16% deferred. For 2010, we expect our total income tax rate to be roughly 30%, split evenly between current and deferred taxes. In today's news release, we provided a table that reconciles the effects of items that are typically excluded from analyst estimates.So moving to the bottom line, fourth quarter earnings from continued operations, adjusted for special items came in at $596 million or $1.33 per diluted share. If you include results from our discontinued operations, the total adjusted earnings for the quarter came to $1.60 per diluted share. This result exceeded last quarter's earnings by 45% and has been already pointed out earlier far surpassed the Street's estimates. For the full year 2009, Devon's cash flow before balance sheet changes totaled $4.7 billion. We utilized this cash flow, along with cash on hand and short-term borrowings, to fund $4.6 billion of drill-bit capital and approximately $500 million of corporate and midstream expense. We exited 2009 with $2.8 billion of cash on hand and unused credit facilities. In addition to our strong liquidity, our balance sheet continues to improve and remains one of the strongest in the industry. At December 31, Devon's net debt to capitalization ratio decreased to 29%. That's actually about 21% as calculated under the terms of our bank credit agreements.Looking to 2010, we expect our overall balance sheet strength to improve even further as we begin to receive proceeds from the asset sales. In order to sustain growth and production, reserves and cash flow on the debt-adjusted share basis, one must optimize results to the entire value chain. That means owning high quality assets at low entry cost with reasonable royalty burdens while continually striving to drive costs from the system. Our 2009 results reflect the quality of our property portfolio and our focus on controlling costs. At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to Dave Hager for an update on operations. Dave?"

Our growth in oil and gas reserves and production has already been covered in this call and reflects the outstanding results achieved with our 2009 capital budget. We drilled 1,130 wells onshore in North America, i",1759,"Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. Our growth in oil and gas reserves and production has already been covered in this call and reflects the outstanding results achieved with our 2009 capital budget. We drilled 1,130 wells onshore in North America, including 1,077 development wells and 53 exploration wells. Essentially, all of the development wells were successful, and all but a couple of exploratory wells were successful. 2009 capital expenditures for exploration and development projects from our North American onshore operations totaled $3 billion, including $840 million in the fourth quarter. To reach the $3.2 billion of drill-bit capital that Larry referred to, you would add capitalized G&A and interest to the E&P total.From only 23 operated rigs running in late August, we gradually ramped up activity over the last four months of 2009 and we exited the year with 64 operated rigs running. We currently have 80 operated rigs running. On the oil side, at our 100% Devon-owned Jackfish thermal oil project in eastern Alberta, our daily production reached 33,700 barrels per day in late December, a little shy of 35,000 barrels per day facility capacity. The contribution from four new infield well pairs that are currently steaming should allow us to hit the 35,000-barrel per day capacity in the near future. Jackfish continues to be one of the best performing SAGD projects in the industry as measured by both production per well and steam-oil ratio. Construction of our Jackfish 2 project is now roughly two thirds complete with cost continuing to trend under budget. Jackfish 2 remains on schedule for first oil in 2011.Last quarter, we told you about our decision to move forward with our Jackfish 3 project. During the fourth quarter, we submitted the project summary document, the first step in the regulatory process.  We anticipate filing the actual regulatory application in the third quarter of 2010. Pending regulatory approval and formal sanctioning, we could begin site work by late 2011 with plant startup targeted for 2014. Devon has a 100% working interest in each of the three Jackfish projects.In our Lloydminster oil play in Alberta, we drilled 75 new wells, which brought our full year total to 239. Lloydminster production averaged 41,000 barrels equivalent per day in the fourth quarter, up 5% from the third quarter. This activity maintained full year production from Lloydminster equal to that of 2008. In 2010, we plan to spend $82 million running a two-rig program and drill approximately 140 wells in the Lloydminster area to roughly maintain current production levels. Moving to the Permian Basin and our Wolfberry oil play in West Texas, we have more than 140,000 prospective net acres. This play provides repeatable, low-risk, high-return drilling opportunities. We currently have three rigs running and plan to drill 80 wells this year. We have significant running room here, with more than 1,000 remained risk locations. On the Gas side of the business, we began ramping up activity in the Barnett Shale field in North Texas during the fourth quarter, and we're currently running at 16 Devon-operated rigs there. Our net production in the Barnett averaged just over 1 Bcf equivalent per day for the quarter. With our increased drilling activity and approximately 225 wells awaiting completion at year-end, we expect our Barnett production to gradually begin trending up. As we showed you in our Resource Update in November, we have no shortage of drilling opportunities in the Barnett. We recently completed our 2,000th horizontal well on the Barnett and yet, we still have over 7,000 remaining undrilled locations on our acreage. In 2010, we plan to invest about $1 billion of capital in the Barnett drilling, drilling 350 operated wells and participating in about 20 non-operated wells. We plan to add one additional operated rig during the first quarter, taking us to a 17-rig program that we expect to maintain for most of the year. We expect Devon's Barnett to be back up to its previous record production of 1.2 Bcf equivalent per day during the third quarter. From a reserve performance perspective, the Barnett Shale was a leading growth area for the company again in 2009. Extensions, discoveries and performance revisions in the Barnett accounted for 251 million Boe of additions, of which just 63 million barrels were related to the new SEC rule changes. These drillbit additions replaced more than three times our Barnett production of 69 million equivalent barrels for the year. Related drillbit capital was $820 million. At year-end, we had over 6 trillion cubic feet equivalent booked in the Barnett, with 78% developed and 22% proved undeveloped.Moving to the Woodford Shale and the Eastern Oklahoma's Arkoma Basin, we added three rigs in the fourth quarter and now have a total of five operated rigs running. We brought five new operated wells online during the quarter. Our net Arkoma-Woodford production average just over 70 million cubic feet per day for the fourth quarter. We plan to continue to grow production in the Arkoma-Woodford in 2010, investing $140 million of capital and drilling 51 operated wells. Our activity will focus on drilling 600-foot offset infill wells. Our technical evaluation of the Woodford continues to indicate that the optimum well configuration for maximum economic return calls for a lateral length of 4,000  to 5,000 feet. In the Cana-Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma, we recently added about 9,000 net acres to our position, including 4,500 that we purchased through a bankruptcy proceeding. Devon continues to be the largest leaseholder in the play, now with 118,000 net acres. We added one rig during the fourth quarter and are currently running seven operated rigs. We also plan to add two additional rigs in the second quarter. The additional rigs will allow us to further accelerate the process of derisking and securing our acreage. We continue to see outstanding results from Cana. In the fourth quarter, we brought six wells online with average 24-hour IP rates of 4.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day. Production history from our 22 long lateral horizontal wells drilled in the core of the play continue to improve and now support a tight curve approaching 11 Bcf equivalent per well, including 3 Bcf equivalent of natural gas liquids. At roughly $8 million to drill and complete in light of our low royalty burden and cost of entry, these are some of the most economic shale wells in North America from a full cycle return perspective. We grew fourth quarter net production from Cana to 45 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day, up 200% from the fourth quarter of 2008. We had a drillbit reserve additions at Cana totaling 55 million Boe, with related drillbit capital of $235 million. We increased total proved reserves in the play to almost 1/2 Tcf equivalent at year-end.With some 7 Tcf of risk resource potential, we expect many years of highly economic production and reserve growth from Cana. In 2010, we plan to invest about $300 million of capital and drill 43 operated Cana wells and exit the year with Devon's net production at over 100 million cubic feet equivalent per day. Construction will also continue on our processing facility, which remains on schedule for startup in early 2011. Moving to the Haynesville Shale, in the fourth quarter, we draw out our first Haynesville well on the southern acreage in San Augustine County. As we announced in early November, the Kardell 1H well average 24-hour continuous flow rate of 30.7 million cubic feet per day. After the first 90 days, the well has produced almost 1 Bcf equivalent and is currently producing a little over 3 million cubic feet a day. Although the Kardell is experiencing high decline, keep in mind that this is our first well in our southern portion of the play.On our Haynesville acreage in the greater Carthage area, we recently finished drilling operations on three wells in Shelby and Nacogdoches Counties. These three wells are currently being completed, and we expect to have results for you in the next quarter. This year, we plan to invest about $250 million of capital to further derisk primary term acreage in both the Southern and greater Carthage areas. We will run a five-rig program, drilling approximately 24 operated wells, with both Haynesville Shale and Bossier Shale targets. We are currently drilling our first two Bossier Shale wells. One on our southern acreage and the other in the greater Carthage acreage. In addition, we will participate in numerous non-operated wells focused primarily on our southern acreage where our working interests are much lower as a result of formation of drilling units with multiple partners.Southwest of the Carthage area, at Groesbeck, we've had a very successful development program over the last few years in the Nan-Su-Gail field. In the fourth quarter, we brought two additional high rate Bossier Sand, horizontal wells online at Nan-Su-Gail. The Peyton-Hill 2H [Mt. Peyton-FE Hill (SA)], IPd at 18 million cubic of gas a day and the IBB [ph] 6H, IPd at 12 million a day.Shifting to the Horn River Basin in Northern British Columbia, at a lease sale held this past December, we acquired an additional 17,000 net acres in the play, much of which is adjacent our existing leasehold position. This increases our total position in the play to approximately 170,000 net acres. We are running one rig in the Horn River and plan to drill seven horizontal wells and four vertical strut wells in 2010. We also expect to complete four of those horizontal wells this summer and expect to provide you with results later this year.And finally, although we intend to sell our Brazil position, I'd like to update you on our most recent success there. In addition to our Wahoo discovery and successful appraisal well on Block BM-C-30, we also made a significant pre-salt find on Block BM-C-32 during the fourth quarter. As we announced in mid-December, the initial Itaipu discovery well, located approximately six miles southeast to the giant Jubarte Field encountered at least 90 feet of net pre-salt pay with no oil and water content. We subsequently sidetracked the well to take a bypass core. These cores confirmed net light oil pay of 145 feet, significantly above the 90 feet we originally reported. Our preliminary mapping suggests Itaipu has up to one billion barrels of potential. Devon operates Itaipu with a 40% working interest. Additional appraisal work would provide more clarity, but early indications are very encouraging. At this point, I'm going to turn the call back over to Vince to open it up for Q&A."

Following Larry's remarks, our President, John Richels will review 2009 financial results and update our 2010 outlook. And then our Executive Vice President of Exploration and Production, Dave Hager, will cover fourth quarter operating highlights. We'll conclude the call in about an hour, so if we don't get to your questions in the Q&A period, please feel free to follow up with us later in the day. A replay of this call will be available later today through a link on our homepage, that's www.devonenergy.com.In November of 2009, we filed a Form 8-K with detailed guidance for 2010. During the call today, we're going to update some of that guidance and those updates will be posted to our website under the Estimates link in the Investors Relations area of the website. In addition, the 2009 Form 10-K, we expect to file that on February 26 and it will reflect this updated guidance. Before we get to the business of the call, we are obligated to remind you that the discussion of our expectations, plans, forecasts and estimates are all considered forward-looking statements under U.S. Securities law. And while we always make every effort to give you the very best data possible, there are many factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our estimates. For a discussion of those risk factors, please refer to our Form 8-K filed November 16, 2009. One final compliance item, we will make reference today in the call to various non-GAAP performance measures. When we refer to these measures, we are required to provide certain disclosures under Securities law. If you would like to review those disclosures, they are also available on the Devon website.Finally, I want to remind everyone that in November of 2009, we announced plans to divest all of our international and Gulf of Mexico assets. And as a result of these plans, accounting rules require our financial reporting to be somewhat illogical. The oil and gas production from the international operations that we are divesting are excluded for all periods presented, while the production from the Gulf of Mexico assets we are selling are included in our reported volumes and financials. Similarly, revenues, expenses for the international assets are collapsed into a single-line item at the end of the statement of operations and that line item is filed discontinued operations while the revenues and expenditures for the Gulf divestiture assets remain embedded in our continuing operations.To provide increased transparency in today's press release, you will find additional tables that provide a detailed statement of operations, as well as production and reserve data and cost-incurred figures attributable to the operations classified as discontinued. And again, that's only the international operations.Our comments today on the financial statements will generally conform to the presentation for continued operations. But when it's practical, we will provide commentary specifically targeting the North American on-shore operations that represent the go-forward Devon.The accounting treatment of the divestiture properties also muddies the water for Devon's fourth quarter comparison to consensus estimates. We polled to sell-side analysts that report estimates to First Call, and learned that about half the analysts included international operations while the other half excluded the impact of these operations. The mean estimate for the analysts who included discontinued operations was $1.29 per share. This compares to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.60 for the fourth quarter. The mean estimate for the analysts who excluded discontinued operations was $1.20 per share. And that figure compares to our adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $1.33 per diluted share. The reconciling items are included in our press release today. In either case, with or without the contribution of our international assets, our fourth quarter results significantly exceeded expectations. With those items out of the way, I'll turn the call over to Devon's CEO, Larry Nichols."

This year 2010 is a transition for Devon, a very much of a transition year as we divest our offshore and international assets and refocused all of our efforts on Devon's very powerful North American onshore growth",1188,"Thanks, Vince and good morning, everyone. This year 2010 is a transition for Devon, a very much of a transition year as we divest our offshore and international assets and refocused all of our efforts on Devon's very powerful North American onshore growth engine. Our philosophy of focusing on optimizing returns and refusing to get caught up in that growth-at-any-cost mentality is reflected in the very solid 2009 results that we reported today. We have achieved solid production growth while significantly reducing operating cost and delivering industry-leading finding and development costs. Including the properties we are divesting, we increased company-wide oil and gas production to a record 682,000 Boe per day. Production from our North American onshore properties also grew to a record 603,000 Boe per day, which is up 6.5% over 2008 production. At the same time, we drove unit operating cost from those North American onshore operations from our continuing operations, down 14% to just $7.16 per equivalent Boe per barrel. We generated $4.7 billion of cash flow from operations, funding most of our $5.1 billion in capital expenditures. With that capital, we drilled more than 1,100 successful wells, driving crude reserves to the highest level in our company's history and delivering outstanding reserve replacement results. Our Marketing and Midstream business delivered yet another year of better than forecasted results, reaching $512 million in operating profit. And finally, we maintained a very strong financial position, ending the year with a net debt to capitalization ratio of 29% and unused credit lines and cash on hand totaling $2.8 billion.In today's news release, we provided a summary reserve report data for continuing operations in accordance with accounting standards. Although the results from those continuing operations are impressive, what I wanted to talk a little bit about are Devon's North American onshore properties, which delivered even stronger reserve growth, reflecting the strength of Devon's property base going forward.Drill-bit reserve additions for North American onshore, and by drill-bit, I'm referring to discoveries, extensions and performance revisions, came in at 492 million Boe. These drill-bit additions were well over 200% of our 2009 onshore production. With drill-bit capital of $3.2 billion, including capitalized G&A and interest, our organic North American onshore finding and development cost were an industry-leading $6.59 per Boe.It is important to realize that one-year F&D costs can be somewhat arbitrary because capital expenditures and reserve bookings are often misaligned, and we are going to see that in 2008 and 2009. In 2009, we expect North American onshore reserves to add a total of about 320 million to 340 million Boe, with associated drill-bit capital of roughly $4.4 billion. This will give us F&D of a little over $13 per barrel for 2010. This variance comes primarily from the timing of bookings to reserves at Jackfish relative to the capital outlay. If you combine our 2009 results and our 2010 forecast, you'll come up with an average F&D for those two years of a little over $9 a barrel. And we think this is more indicative of our go-forward expectations and is still a number that will compare very favorably to our peer group.Price revisions, again for North American onshore properties only, gave us a net positive boost in 2009, adding another 176 million barrels. Positive oil price-related revisions, mainly coming from our Jackfish properties in Canada more than offset negative gas price revisions. These results underscore the importance of having a reserve and production base with a balance between natural gas and liquids. In fact, oil and natural gas liquids made up more than 40% of our total North American onshore reserves at the end of 2009. While some of our peers now aspire to achieve this kind of liquids-gas balance, Devon is already there. Looking at oil sources F&D, in other words, including both drill-bit additions and net price revisions, we added 669 million Boe onshore in North America, which is more than 3x our production and it's at a cost of $3.3 billion. As with only drill-bit only F&D, our oil sources F&D for 2009 is a little less than $5 of Boe which is also industry-leading.It is notable that Devon achieved these results without taking our proved undeveloped reserves to aggressive levels. While some companies have booked proven undeveloped reserves approaching 50%, and in fact in some cases even more than 50% of total reserves, Devon's company-wide proved undeveloped reserves are only 30% of total proved. Likewise, pro forma for the divestitures, in other words looking at only North American onshore, PUD is only 29% of total reserves. There had been a lot of talk recently about PUD additions as the result of SEC rule changes and the resulting impact on reported F&D costs. As a result, some analysts are computing F&D on a proved developed-only basis, or in other words, excluding PUD reserves. Devon's 2009 F&D on a proved developed basis is roughly $11.50 per Boe, again very, very strong performance.In summary, for our North American onshore, we added in 2009 2.6 billion equivalent barrels of proved reserves which represents 20% growth over year-end 2008 North American reserves. In fact, our year-end 2009 North American onshore reserves are almost 9% more than company-wide proved reserves at the end of 2008, including the assets that we are divesting. To say it another way, if we had sold all of our Gulf and international reserves at the very beginning of 2009, our activity in 2009 would not only have replaced the reserves that we sold and replaced our production for the year, but would also have given us growth for the company by 9%. That demonstrates the strength of our North American onshore portfolio. This result also increases Devon's reserve life index to 12 years.Before I turn the call over to John, I want to update you on the status of our Gulf and international divestitures. We announced our first step in December with our agreement to sell our interest in three lower tertiary [ph] prospects at Cascade, St. Malo and Jack to Maersk. As I was going to that announcement, partners in Cascade and St. Malo exercised their preferential rights. Maersk recently closed on the purchase of Jack as originally announced. This keeps the aggregate sale price for Devon's interest in these projects at $1.3 billion or $1.1 billion after-tax. Because we prepared our 2010 capital budget on the assumption that we would own the divestiture assets for the full year, the sale of those three assets reduces our 2010 capital budget by some $400 million. We now have data rooms open for all of the international and all of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets and we are in the process of preparing the remaining data room for our remaining Gulf properties. The level of interest is high, and we remain confident in the previously provided range of net after-tax proceeds of $4.5 billion to $7.5 billion. We expect to receive the bids for all the assets by midyear and to close the sales throughout the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to John Richels for our financial review and outlook. John?"

Today, I'll take you through a brief review of the key events and drivers that shaped our 2009 financial results and also take you through our outlook for 2010. As Vince mentioned earlier, we have reclassified",1739,"Thank you, Larry and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll take you through a brief review of the key events and drivers that shaped our 2009 financial results and also take you through our outlook for 2010. As Vince mentioned earlier, we have reclassified the assets, liabilities and results of operations for our international assets into discontinued operations for all accounting periods presented. As a result, I'll focus most of my comments on our reported continuing operations. And just to reiterate, our reported results from continuing operations include both the North American onshore assets that we are keeping and the Gulf of Mexico assets that we plan to divest. So let's start with production. Total 2009 company-wide production, including international, came in at 249 million equivalent barrels or some 11 million Boe greater than our beginning-of-the-year forecast. Looking at continuing operations alone and again, under accounting rules, that includes the production from the Gulf properties that we are divesting, 2009 production was 233 million oil equivalent barrels or approximately 639,000 Boes per day. That's 10 million barrels higher than our 2008 production from continuing operations and more than 1 million barrels above the guidance we provided in our most recent update.When you examine just the North American onshore assets, that is, the assets that we will be retaining in the repositioned company, you will see that 2009 production increased 36,600 equivalent barrels per day or about 6.5% over the full year 2008. This growth was achieved in spite of voluntarily reducing production in the second half of the year. The primary drivers of our onshore production growth in 2009 include our Jackfish SAGD project as well as our Barnett, Cana and our Cana-Woodford Shale plays. Reported production was also supplemented by lower crown royalty rates in Canada.Fourth quarter production from continuing operations came in at 56.1 million equivalent barrels or approximately 609,000 barrels per day. This result was about 22,000 equivalent barrels per day lower than the third quarter of 2009. The decline is almost entirely attributable to the impact of reduced drilling during the year and the voluntary volume reductions that we announced in mid-2009.In 2010, we expect production from continuing operations to range between 231 million and 235 million barrels. It's important to note that this estimate assumes that all of our producing Gulf of Mexico assets are sold on the last day of 2010. Since we actually expect to sell the properties throughout the year, we'll provide updated guidance as we announce those sales.Looking specifically at our retained asset base, that's the North American onshore region, we are raising our production guidance to some 221 million equivalent barrels of production or about 2 million Boes more than we have previously forecast. For the first quarter of 2010, we expect to produce between 55 million and 56 million barrels from continuing operations, including approximately 53 million barrels from our North American onshore portfolio. In response to higher activity levels, we expect to grow North American onshore production in each subsequent quarter of 2010. And beyond 2010, as we said when we were announcing the repositioning, we expect to continue to deliver significant economic growth without the need to issue incremental debt or equity.Moving to price realizations beginning with oil, in the fourth quarter of 2009, Devon's oil price realizations came in at the top end of our guidance range at approximately 84% of WTI or $63.84 per barrel. Once again, Canadian realizations were above our expectations due to a favorable supply-demand balance for heavier Canadian crudes.Looking at the full-year 2010, we have hedged 79,000 barrels of oil per day and that's about two thirds of our expected oil production from continuing operations. We utilized callers for those hedges with an average for of about $67 per barrel and a ceiling of about $96 per barrel.On the natural gas side, the benchmark Henry Hub gas price improved to an average of $4.16 per MCF during the fourth quarter. In addition to the higher index price, differentials for all of our major operating regions narrowed during the fourth quarter. Price realizations were especially strong for our Canadian gas production, averaging nearly 100% of Henry Hub. In total, our company-wide realized price, before the impact of hedges, came in at $3.80 per MCF or 91% of Henry Hub. That's a 34% increase in realized price over the last quarter. For the fourth quarter, cash settlements from the hedges increased Devon's company-wide realizations by $0.65 per MCF to an all-in price including hedges of $4.45 per MCF.We have approximately 1.4 BCF per day of gas hedged throughout 2010 with swaps on callers protecting a weighted average floor of $6.12 per MCF. In aggregate, our hedged position represents about 53% of our estimated natural gas production for the year. We also have a regional basis hedges on 150 million cubic feet a day of Canadian production and 70 million a day of Rockies gas. The average basis differential we locked in is $0.33 per MMBtu in Canada and $0.37 per MMBtu in the Rockies.Turning to our marketing and midstream operations, driven by higher commodity prices and strong cost controls, Devon's fourth quarter operating profit climbed to $133 million and brought our full year marketing and midstream profit up to $512 million. Looking ahead to 2010, we expect another solid year with an expected full-year operating profit of $450 million to $525 million.Before we move into a discussion of the specific expenses, I just want to point out a change to the presentation of a few expense categories in our income statement. To bring us in line with most of our peers and to provide more clarity into our recurring operating cost trends, we are now reporting ad valorem taxes for all periods presented on a new line item on the income statement entitled, Taxes Other Than Income Taxes. This new line item also contains production taxes and a few miscellaneous business taxes. Looking at that expense, it's the taxes other than income taxes line, that totaled $314 million in 2009. That's a $162 million decrease when compared to 2009 results. This decline is entirely due to lower commodity prices throughout 2009 resulting in decreased production taxes. In the upcoming year, we expect taxes other than income taxes to range between 4.5% to 5.5% of total oil, gas and NGO revenues.Turning to operating expenses, for 2009, our lease operating expenses came in at $1.7 billion or $7.16 per equivalent barrel produced. This represents the unit cost decrease of $1.13 per equivalent barrel or about 14%. The decrease reflects lower energy costs and downward price pressure for oilfield services and supplies, really across-the-board. Looking forward, we expect 2010 LOE per Boe to be in the range of $7.50 to $8.15 per barrel of production. For our North American onshore assets, we expect 2010 LOE rates to be in the bottom half of that guidance range. Devon's full-year 2009 DD&A expense for oil and gas properties totaled $1.8 billion or $7.86 per barrel. This result was within the guidance range we provided last November. For 2010, we anticipate our depletion rate to be between $7.60 and $8.10 per barrel of production.Moving on to G&A expenditures, our reported G&A expense for 2009 came in at $648 million, which is essentially flat with 2008. Looking ahead, we expect to achieve additional efficiencies in 2010 reducing G&A cost by about $50 million. Our decision to sell our Gulf and international assets required us to recognize $153 million of restructuring expenses in the fourth quarter. Of this amount, $105 million was recorded on the expense line item titled Restructuring Costs, while the remaining $48 million of the restructuring expenses are included in the Discontinued Operations line. In 2010, we expect to recognize between $50 million and $120 million of additional restructuring charges.Shifting to interest expense, interest expense for 2009 was $349 million, right in line with our expectations. For 2010, we expect interest expense to be roughly flat, somewhere between $325 million and $365 million. The final expense item I want to touch on is income taxes. Devon's recorded income tax expense for the fourth quarter was 36% of pretax income, the most significant item affecting our tax rate during the quarter was the decision to divest our international assets. This event triggered the recognition of $55 million of additional income tax expense during the quarter. When you back out the impact of the non-recurring items, Devon's adjusted fourth-quarter tax rate came in at 29%, with 13% being current and 16% deferred. For 2010, we expect our total income tax rate to be roughly 30%, split evenly between current and deferred taxes. In today's news release, we provided a table that reconciles the effects of items that are typically excluded from analyst estimates.So moving to the bottom line, fourth quarter earnings from continued operations, adjusted for special items came in at $596 million or $1.33 per diluted share. If you include results from our discontinued operations, the total adjusted earnings for the quarter came to $1.60 per diluted share. This result exceeded last quarter's earnings by 45% and has been already pointed out earlier far surpassed the Street's estimates. For the full year 2009, Devon's cash flow before balance sheet changes totaled $4.7 billion. We utilized this cash flow, along with cash on hand and short-term borrowings, to fund $4.6 billion of drill-bit capital and approximately $500 million of corporate and midstream expense. We exited 2009 with $2.8 billion of cash on hand and unused credit facilities. In addition to our strong liquidity, our balance sheet continues to improve and remains one of the strongest in the industry. At December 31, Devon's net debt to capitalization ratio decreased to 29%. That's actually about 21% as calculated under the terms of our bank credit agreements.Looking to 2010, we expect our overall balance sheet strength to improve even further as we begin to receive proceeds from the asset sales. In order to sustain growth and production, reserves and cash flow on the debt-adjusted share basis, one must optimize results to the entire value chain. That means owning high quality assets at low entry cost with reasonable royalty burdens while continually striving to drive costs from the system. Our 2009 results reflect the quality of our property portfolio and our focus on controlling costs. At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to Dave Hager for an update on operations. Dave?"

Our growth in oil and gas reserves and production has already been covered in this call and reflects the outstanding results achieved with our 2009 capital budget. We drilled 1,130 wells onshore in North America, i",1759,"Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. Our growth in oil and gas reserves and production has already been covered in this call and reflects the outstanding results achieved with our 2009 capital budget. We drilled 1,130 wells onshore in North America, including 1,077 development wells and 53 exploration wells. Essentially, all of the development wells were successful, and all but a couple of exploratory wells were successful. 2009 capital expenditures for exploration and development projects from our North American onshore operations totaled $3 billion, including $840 million in the fourth quarter. To reach the $3.2 billion of drill-bit capital that Larry referred to, you would add capitalized G&A and interest to the E&P total.From only 23 operated rigs running in late August, we gradually ramped up activity over the last four months of 2009 and we exited the year with 64 operated rigs running. We currently have 80 operated rigs running. On the oil side, at our 100% Devon-owned Jackfish thermal oil project in eastern Alberta, our daily production reached 33,700 barrels per day in late December, a little shy of 35,000 barrels per day facility capacity. The contribution from four new infield well pairs that are currently steaming should allow us to hit the 35,000-barrel per day capacity in the near future. Jackfish continues to be one of the best performing SAGD projects in the industry as measured by both production per well and steam-oil ratio. Construction of our Jackfish 2 project is now roughly two thirds complete with cost continuing to trend under budget. Jackfish 2 remains on schedule for first oil in 2011.Last quarter, we told you about our decision to move forward with our Jackfish 3 project. During the fourth quarter, we submitted the project summary document, the first step in the regulatory process.  We anticipate filing the actual regulatory application in the third quarter of 2010. Pending regulatory approval and formal sanctioning, we could begin site work by late 2011 with plant startup targeted for 2014. Devon has a 100% working interest in each of the three Jackfish projects.In our Lloydminster oil play in Alberta, we drilled 75 new wells, which brought our full year total to 239. Lloydminster production averaged 41,000 barrels equivalent per day in the fourth quarter, up 5% from the third quarter. This activity maintained full year production from Lloydminster equal to that of 2008. In 2010, we plan to spend $82 million running a two-rig program and drill approximately 140 wells in the Lloydminster area to roughly maintain current production levels. Moving to the Permian Basin and our Wolfberry oil play in West Texas, we have more than 140,000 prospective net acres. This play provides repeatable, low-risk, high-return drilling opportunities. We currently have three rigs running and plan to drill 80 wells this year. We have significant running room here, with more than 1,000 remained risk locations. On the Gas side of the business, we began ramping up activity in the Barnett Shale field in North Texas during the fourth quarter, and we're currently running at 16 Devon-operated rigs there. Our net production in the Barnett averaged just over 1 Bcf equivalent per day for the quarter. With our increased drilling activity and approximately 225 wells awaiting completion at year-end, we expect our Barnett production to gradually begin trending up. As we showed you in our Resource Update in November, we have no shortage of drilling opportunities in the Barnett. We recently completed our 2,000th horizontal well on the Barnett and yet, we still have over 7,000 remaining undrilled locations on our acreage. In 2010, we plan to invest about $1 billion of capital in the Barnett drilling, drilling 350 operated wells and participating in about 20 non-operated wells. We plan to add one additional operated rig during the first quarter, taking us to a 17-rig program that we expect to maintain for most of the year. We expect Devon's Barnett to be back up to its previous record production of 1.2 Bcf equivalent per day during the third quarter. From a reserve performance perspective, the Barnett Shale was a leading growth area for the company again in 2009. Extensions, discoveries and performance revisions in the Barnett accounted for 251 million Boe of additions, of which just 63 million barrels were related to the new SEC rule changes. These drillbit additions replaced more than three times our Barnett production of 69 million equivalent barrels for the year. Related drillbit capital was $820 million. At year-end, we had over 6 trillion cubic feet equivalent booked in the Barnett, with 78% developed and 22% proved undeveloped.Moving to the Woodford Shale and the Eastern Oklahoma's Arkoma Basin, we added three rigs in the fourth quarter and now have a total of five operated rigs running. We brought five new operated wells online during the quarter. Our net Arkoma-Woodford production average just over 70 million cubic feet per day for the fourth quarter. We plan to continue to grow production in the Arkoma-Woodford in 2010, investing $140 million of capital and drilling 51 operated wells. Our activity will focus on drilling 600-foot offset infill wells. Our technical evaluation of the Woodford continues to indicate that the optimum well configuration for maximum economic return calls for a lateral length of 4,000  to 5,000 feet. In the Cana-Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma, we recently added about 9,000 net acres to our position, including 4,500 that we purchased through a bankruptcy proceeding. Devon continues to be the largest leaseholder in the play, now with 118,000 net acres. We added one rig during the fourth quarter and are currently running seven operated rigs. We also plan to add two additional rigs in the second quarter. The additional rigs will allow us to further accelerate the process of derisking and securing our acreage. We continue to see outstanding results from Cana. In the fourth quarter, we brought six wells online with average 24-hour IP rates of 4.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day. Production history from our 22 long lateral horizontal wells drilled in the core of the play continue to improve and now support a tight curve approaching 11 Bcf equivalent per well, including 3 Bcf equivalent of natural gas liquids. At roughly $8 million to drill and complete in light of our low royalty burden and cost of entry, these are some of the most economic shale wells in North America from a full cycle return perspective. We grew fourth quarter net production from Cana to 45 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day, up 200% from the fourth quarter of 2008. We had a drillbit reserve additions at Cana totaling 55 million Boe, with related drillbit capital of $235 million. We increased total proved reserves in the play to almost 1/2 Tcf equivalent at year-end.With some 7 Tcf of risk resource potential, we expect many years of highly economic production and reserve growth from Cana. In 2010, we plan to invest about $300 million of capital and drill 43 operated Cana wells and exit the year with Devon's net production at over 100 million cubic feet equivalent per day. Construction will also continue on our processing facility, which remains on schedule for startup in early 2011. Moving to the Haynesville Shale, in the fourth quarter, we draw out our first Haynesville well on the southern acreage in San Augustine County. As we announced in early November, the Kardell 1H well average 24-hour continuous flow rate of 30.7 million cubic feet per day. After the first 90 days, the well has produced almost 1 Bcf equivalent and is currently producing a little over 3 million cubic feet a day. Although the Kardell is experiencing high decline, keep in mind that this is our first well in our southern portion of the play.On our Haynesville acreage in the greater Carthage area, we recently finished drilling operations on three wells in Shelby and Nacogdoches Counties. These three wells are currently being completed, and we expect to have results for you in the next quarter. This year, we plan to invest about $250 million of capital to further derisk primary term acreage in both the Southern and greater Carthage areas. We will run a five-rig program, drilling approximately 24 operated wells, with both Haynesville Shale and Bossier Shale targets. We are currently drilling our first two Bossier Shale wells. One on our southern acreage and the other in the greater Carthage acreage. In addition, we will participate in numerous non-operated wells focused primarily on our southern acreage where our working interests are much lower as a result of formation of drilling units with multiple partners.Southwest of the Carthage area, at Groesbeck, we've had a very successful development program over the last few years in the Nan-Su-Gail field. In the fourth quarter, we brought two additional high rate Bossier Sand, horizontal wells online at Nan-Su-Gail. The Peyton-Hill 2H [Mt. Peyton-FE Hill (SA)], IPd at 18 million cubic of gas a day and the IBB [ph] 6H, IPd at 12 million a day.Shifting to the Horn River Basin in Northern British Columbia, at a lease sale held this past December, we acquired an additional 17,000 net acres in the play, much of which is adjacent our existing leasehold position. This increases our total position in the play to approximately 170,000 net acres. We are running one rig in the Horn River and plan to drill seven horizontal wells and four vertical strut wells in 2010. We also expect to complete four of those horizontal wells this summer and expect to provide you with results later this year.And finally, although we intend to sell our Brazil position, I'd like to update you on our most recent success there. In addition to our Wahoo discovery and successful appraisal well on Block BM-C-30, we also made a significant pre-salt find on Block BM-C-32 during the fourth quarter. As we announced in mid-December, the initial Itaipu discovery well, located approximately six miles southeast to the giant Jubarte Field encountered at least 90 feet of net pre-salt pay with no oil and water content. We subsequently sidetracked the well to take a bypass core. These cores confirmed net light oil pay of 145 feet, significantly above the 90 feet we originally reported. Our preliminary mapping suggests Itaipu has up to one billion barrels of potential. Devon operates Itaipu with a 40% working interest. Additional appraisal work would provide more clarity, but early indications are very encouraging. At this point, I'm going to turn the call back over to Vince to open it up for Q&A."

I don't think it's clear at all that bringing the well on at a high rate had anything to do with the ultimate EURs. It's just the fact that the Haynesville is thinner down there. Now we are currently drilling two Bossier Shale wells down there. The Bossier Shale is thicker in this area and obviously, there have been some very nice Bossier Shale wells announced here recently.

Welcome to Devon's First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. Today's call will follow our usual format. I'll take care of a couple of housekeeping items and then Larry Nichols, our CEO, will give his thoughts on the quarter, as well as an update on our strategic repositioning. Following Larry's remarks, our President, John Richels, will provide a financial review and then Dave Hager, our Executive Vice President of Exploration and Production, will cover our capital budget and the operating highlights. We will follow with a Q&A period and as usual, we will hold the call to about an hour. As always, we ask that participants on the call to keep their questions in the Q&A session to one question and one follow-up. A replay of this call will be available later today through a link on our homepage. 
And also during the call, we will update some of our forward-looking estimates based on actual results for the first quarter. Since the revisions are pretty minor, we are not planning on issuing a new 8-K, but we will post these changes to the guidance area of our website. To find that, just click on the Guidance link found in the Investor Relations section of Devon's website.
Please note that all references in today's call to our plans, forecasts, expectations and estimates are forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law. And there are many factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those estimates. We encourage you to review the discussion of risk factors and uncertainties that is provided with our forecast in our Form 8-K.
One other compliance note, we'll use certain non-GAAP performance measures in today's call. When we use those measures, we're required to provide certain related disclosures. Those disclosures are also available on the Devon website. 
Finally, I want to remind you that our financial and operational reporting has been complicated by the restructuring that we're undergoing. Our plan to divest our international operations has triggered accounting rules for discontinued operations. Under those rules, we're required to exclude our international oil and gas production from our reported production volumes for all of the periods presented. The related revenues and expenses for our international operations are collapsed into a single line item at the end of our statement of operations. That line item is filed discontinued operations. For those of you interested in a more detailed review of the international results, we have supplied additional tables in our news release.
And to make matters worse, even though we are selling our assets in the Gulf of Mexico, the accounting standards for discontinued operations do not apply to this Gulf assets. The results of operations from those divestiture assets reside in our continuing operations up to the date of closing of the sale of those properties. Throughout the call, our comments will generally be directed to results from continuing operations but wherever possible, we'll provide additional commentary specifically targeting our North American onshore results or our keeper properties. Information is also provided in our press release to enable you to isolate certain results from Devon's North American onshore operations.
The accounting treatment of the divestiture properties also complicates the comparability of earnings estimates. About 2/3 of the analysts that reported estimates the first call this quarter excluded the impact of the discontinued operations. The mean estimate of earnings per share from analysts that excluded discontinued operations is $1.43 for the first quarter. That compares to our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1.65 per diluted share for the first quarter. For those analysts that included discontinued operations in their estimate, the mean estimate was $1.50 per share as compared to our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.85. So in either case, our first quarter results were significantly better than the Street's expectations.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Larry."

Clearly, the first quarter of this year was a very good one for Devon. First quarter production from our retained properties and that is, of course, the North American onshore properties grew to 587,000 Boe per day, which is up nearly 3% over the fourth quarter of 2009. And it's worth pointing out that 186,000 barrels per day of this production were roughly 1/3 is oil and NGLs.
With production near the top end of our guidance and with strong price realizations relative to benchmark prices and with lower costs in nearly every expense category, first quarter earnings handily beat Street estimates. Also our Marketing and Administering business delivered another solid quarter generating $133 million in operating profit. And finally, we continue to maintain a very strong financial position. We ended the quarter with one of the strongest balance sheets in the NP sector, following the repayment of $1.2 billion of commercial paper and ending the quarter with cash on hand of nearly $1.2 billion.
During the first quarter of 2010, we also made remarkable progress with the strategic repositioning that we announced just last November. Early in the quarter, we closed the sale of three lower tertiary projects for aggregate sales proceeds of $1.3 billion. Then in March, we announced the sale of our remaining assets in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Brazil and Azerbaijan to BP for $7 billion and other long-term commitments. Because of the confidentiality agreements, we're not at liberty to disclose at this time the allocation of value among the various components of the sale to BP. However, the deepwater Gulf assets are clearly a significant piece and this portion of the transaction is now closed. As a result, we're essentially out of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico as of today.
We also recently announced the sale of the last of our assets in the Gulf of Mexico, which are the shelf assets, to Apache for $1,050,000,000. And finally, last week, we announced the sale of our Panyu field in China to CNOOC [China National Offshore Oil Corporation] for $515 million. We expect both the shelf and the Panyu transactions to close during the second quarter. So we're making great progress in all these sales.
When we first announced our plan to strategically reposition Devon, we expect that total after-tax proceeds from the divestitures of somewhere between $4.5 billion and $7.5 billion. The transactions that we've announced to date ensure that we'll exceed the top end of that range, including the few remaining international assets that remain to be in our contract. We now expect total after-tax proceeds of approximately $8 billion.
To date, we have used $1.2 billion of the sales proceeds to retire all of our outstanding commercial paper balances. We're also using $500 million of the sales proceeds to increase significantly our resource potential and our steam-assisted gravity drainage oil with the purchase of 50% of BP's interest in Kirby oil sands leases, which is a transaction we expect to close by the end of this month, by the end of may. This balance of the sales proceeds leaves us with tremendous flexibility to retire debt, to fund incremental E&P projects and to buyback stock. Given our outlook for natural gas prices and our continuing refusal to get caught up in the growth-at-any-cost mentality, we will not accelerate our dry gas production growth. The dry gas wells we're drilling are focused mostly on securing our acreage position and our shale plays such as Haynesville and Horn River and evaluating that you few new play concept. However, given the prevalence of oil and liquid-rich gas opportunities within our portfolio, most of our 2010 capital budget is focused on oil and liquid rich plays. As Dave will address later in the call, we're allocating some capital to increase our footprint in some of our oil and liquid rich plays in and around existing areas of opportunities.
As we consider the alternatives for the deployment of capital, our objective is always to optimize growth per share on a debt-adjusted basis. There are, of course, many factors that affect the relative attractiveness of the various alternatives. Current circumstances make the repurchase of our own common shares very attractive. These conditions led us to the announcement we made today to initiate a significant share repurchase program. Devon's Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of about $3.5 billion of Devon's common shares. $3.5 billion worth of Devon's common shares. At today's share price, that represents about 12% of our shares. The pace of our purchases will, of course, depend upon marketing conditions as been our practice in previous year of repurchases. Having said that, though, we haven't taken steps to begin purchasing our shares immediately.
It is worth noting that when you take into account the divestiture proceeds and putting modest value of our Midstream business of 8x annual profit. The purchase of a Devon share today, well, at yesterday's closing price is $66.35, represents significantly less than $10 per Boe of post-divestiture proved reserves. These analyses attributes no value to our thousands of unproved locations across all of our shale plays. No value to the continued expansion of our Canadian oil projects, Jackfish and Kirby. And no value to the unproved acres we've established across North America, much of which was oil and liquid-rich areas. Suffice it to say, we believe that Devon stock represents a very compelling value.
With our transformation of Devon approaching completion, we cannot be more pleased with the way we have positioned Devon for the future. We have significantly reduced the company's risk profile. We have improved the company's overall cost structure. We have maintained a balance of natural gas and liquids production. We have established a deep inventory of development projects, both in oil and in liquid-rich gas. And we will emerge with one of the strongest balance sheets in our peer group. When the dust settles, Devon will have retained the projects in our portfolio with the most attractive risk-adjusted returns, with a balance sheet that will allow us to aggressively pursue the development of those projects and with a highly competitive overall cash structure. We will be well-positioned to weather any industry downturn.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John Richels for a financial review."
266510,78940834,59791,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May-05-2010",2010-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Larry. Good morning, everyone. Today, I want to take you through a brief review of the key drivers that affected our first quarter financial results and review how those factors influenced our outlook for the remainder of the year. As Vince mentio",1496,"Thanks, Larry. Good morning, everyone. Today, I want to take you through a brief review of the key drivers that affected our first quarter financial results and review how those factors influenced our outlook for the remainder of the year. As Vince mentioned earlier, we've reclassified the assets, liabilities and results of operations for our international assets in the discontinued operations for all accounting periods presented. As a result, I'll focus most of my comments on our reported continuing operations and just to reiterate, our reported results from continuing operations include both our retained North American onshore assets and the Gulf of Mexico assets that we are divesting.
Let's begin with a review of our production. In the first quarter of 2010, we produced 55.8 million oil equivalent barrels or 620,000 barrels per day. This result represents a 2% increase in daily production from continuing operations over the fourth quarter of 2009 and was really right in line with the guidance that we've provided in our previous earnings call.
When you look specifically at the assets that Devon is retaining that is our North American onshore properties, you'll find that production increased to 587,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2010, 3% over the fourth quarter of 2009. Our liquids rich Barnett, Cana and Arkoma-Woodford Shale plays, as well as increased oil production from our Permian Basin properties drove the production growth.
Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2010, we expect production from our retained North American onshore properties to increase to between 595,000 and 605,000 barrels per day. Since we have now closed the deepwater sale to BP, we expect that the Gulf of Mexico will only add an incremental 1 million to 2 million barrels of production in the second quarter depending upon the timing of the close of our shelf-divestiture package.
With respect for our 2010 production guidance for our North American onshore operations, we remain on track to deliver 221 million barrels equivalent. If you include the production from our Gulf of Mexico divestiture properties, we expect full year production from continuing operations to be in the neighborhood of 225 million to 226 million barrels.
Moving to price realizations beginning with oil, in the first quarter, the WTI Index price rose to an average of $78.54 per barrel. That's an 82% improvement over the first quarter of 2009. In addition to the higher benchmark price, regional differentials, as a percentage of WTI, narrowed pushing company-wide price realizations above the top end of our forecast range. The most notable regional outperformance occurred in Canada. This is because heavy oil differentials remained narrow in the first quarter due to strong demand.
In total, Devon's first quarter realized oil price came in at $67.58 per barrel or approximately 86% of WTI. That's a $36 per barrel improvement in our oil price realization compared to the year-ago quarter.
Looking to the remainder of 2010, we protected the price on over 70% of our North American onshore oil production using collars, with a weighted average floor of $67.47 per barrel and a ceiling of $96.48 per barrel.
On the natural gas side, the first quarter Henry Hub Index increased to an average of $5.30 per Mcf. Overall, the company-wide gas price realization before the impact of hedges were 91% of Henry Hub or $4.80 per Mcf. We had hedges covering about 1.4 billion cubic feet per day for the quarter, with weighted average protected price of $6.12 per Mcf.
Cash settlements from these hedges and our basis swaps increased Devon's realizations by $0.42 per Mcf, giving us an all-in price, including hedges of $5.22 per Mcf. For the second quarter, we now have hedges covering 1.5 Bcf per day, that's nearly 2/3 of our North American onshore production with a weighted average protected price of $5.88. A more detailed hedging schedule is available in the Guidance section of our website.
Turning now to our Marketing and Midstream business, once again, our Marketing and Midstream operations delivered strong results, generating $133 million of operating profit in the first quarter. Higher commodity prices and strong cost controls were the key performance drivers during the quarter. With the first quarter in hand, we're very well-positioned to achieve our full year forecast range of $450 million to $525 million. 
Let's move now to expenses. The company did a very good job of controlling costs during the first quarter. Our first quarter lease operating expenses from continuing operations totaled $414 million. This translates to $7.41 per barrel produced and that's about $0.10 below the low end of our guidance range for 2010. 
When compared to the first quarter of 2009, LOE expense declined by 6%, and that's in spite of significantly higher Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rates and increased energy costs. To illustrate the effect of that, if we exclude the impact of the strengthening Canadian dollar, first quarter LOE declined 13% compared to the first quarter of 2009 instead of that 6% that I mentioned earlier.
When you isolate the performance of Devon's go-forward North American onshore asset base, the per unit lease operating expense is even more competitive at $7.19 per barrel of production. This is especially impressive considering that roughly 1/3 of this quarter's production was liquids. Looking to the second quarter, we expect unit LOE from our retained assets to be between $7.20 and $7.50 per Boe.
Devon's reported DD&A expense for the first quarter was $426 million or $7.63 per barrel, near the low end of our guidance range. Looking ahead, the sale of our Gulf of Mexico assets will lower our go-forward DD&A rate. As a result, we expect our second quarter depletion expense to decline to a range of $7.30 to $7.50 per barrel produced.
Moving on to G&A expense, our first quarter G&A expense decreased to $138 million. That's about 16% reduction in G&A expenditures when compared to the first quarter of 2009. The year-over-year decline in G&A costs is largely attributable to operational efficiencies that were achieved through our restructuring.
Shifting to interest expense, interest expense was right in line with our expectations at about $86 million for the quarter. In the second quarter, due to the sale of our deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations, we will capitalize less interest. And as a result, even though our overall borrowing costs are declining, we're forecasting that our reported interest expense will rise to about $95 million.
The final expense item I'd like to touch on is income taxes. For the first quarter, we reported income tax expense from continuing operations of $514 million or 32% of pre-tax income. After backing out the impact of special items, you get an adjusted tax rate of 31%. And this is made up of current tax rate of 13% of pre-tax income and deferred taxes of 18%. This is in line with our full year forecast and similar to the rates we would expect for the remainder of the year. 
In today's earnings release, we have provided a table that reconciles the effects of the items that are typically excluded from analyst estimates. So moving to the bottom line, in the first quarter, our adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $740 million or $1.65 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings from discontinued operations added another $91 million or $0.20 per diluted share. So in aggregate, after backing out the items that are typically excluded from analyst estimates, our adjusted net earnings for the first quarter were $831 million or $1.85 per diluted share.
Our reported net earnings for the quarter were much higher, almost $1.2 billion, due primarily to the $334 million impact of unrealized gains on hedges. All in all, Devon delivered a very strong performance led by production at the top end of our guidance, strong price realizations for both oil and natural gas and very good cost control.
Before I turn the call over to Dave Hager for an operations update, I want to spend a few moments reviewing our financial position. During the quarter, we generated cash flow before balance sheet changes of $1.4 billion, up 45% over the first quarter of 2009.
In addition, we also received $1.3 billion of cash proceeds from the closing of the sales of three of our lower tertiary discoveries in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Looking briefly at our capital structure, we utilized our sources of cash to fund all of our capital expenditures for the quarter and repay $1.2 billion of commercial paper borrowings. As a result, at March 31, our net debt balances declined to $4.9 billion and our debt-to-capitalization ratio reached an 18-month low of 22%. We ended the first quarter with cash on hand of $1.2 billion as well.
Overall, we're very excited about Devon's future and we believe that we're extremely well-positioned to continue to deliver a strong per share growth in both the near and the long term. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Dave."
266510,78940834,59791,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May-05-2010",2010-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a quick recap of company-wide drilling activity. We had as many as 80 Devon-operated rigs running during the first quarter, but our winter drilling program in Canada wound down, we ended March with",1710,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a quick recap of company-wide drilling activity. We had as many as 80 Devon-operated rigs running during the first quarter, but our winter drilling program in Canada wound down, we ended March with 60 Devon-operated rigs running. This is about the level of activity we expect to maintain for the remainder of 2010.
During the first quarter, we drilled 454 wells, included 426 development wells and 28 exploration wells. All of the development wells were successful and all but one of the exploratory wells were successful.
Capital expenditures for exploration and development from our North America onshore operations totaled $1 billion for the quarter. Given the abundance of oil and liquids-rich gas opportunities in our portfolio, going into 2010, our initial capital budget for the year was already weighted towards oil and liquids-rich gas plays. As a result of the earlier-than-expected sales of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and international assets, our 2010 capital budget for the divestiture assets has decreased by roughly $900 million. This gives us the opportunity to reallocate some of this capital to capturing additional acreage in onshore oil and liquids-rich gas plays and potentially to increase drilling on some of these plays.
During 2010, we have either leased or in the process of leasing approximately 300,000 additional net acres in oil and liquids-rich plays. This include additional leasing in the Wolfberry and Cana plays, as well as significant acreage additions and potential new plays in the Permian and Rockies. We're currently conducting a mid-year capital review and if necessary, we'll provide updated capital guidance during our second quarter call.
Moving now to our quarterly operations highlights, at our 100% Devon-owned Jackfish thermal oil project in Eastern Alberta, our daily production reached facilities capacity during the first quarter. However, minor operational issues, which now have been addressed, limited our production for the quarter to an average of just over 26,000 barrels per day net of royalties. Jackfish continues to be one of the best performing SAGD projects in the industry. Construction of our Jackfish 2 project is now roughly three quarters complete and remains on budget. Had drilling continues and the project remains on schedule for first oil in late 2011. 
At Jackfish 3, we continue to work toward filing the regulatory application in the third quarter of this year. Pending regulatory approval and formal sanctioning, we could begin site work by late 2011 with plant startup targeted for 2014. I will remind you that like Jackfish 1 and 2, we expect Jackfish 3 to average 30,000 barrels per day net of royalties over the life of the project and to recover approximately 260 million barrels of oil after royalties.
Devon has 100% working interest in each of the three Jackfish projects. At Kirby, we are currently working through the details of our joint venture agreement with BP and expect to have a signed agreement in place later this month. Our first step on the Kirby oil sands leases will be to further evaluate the size of the resource and to determine the optimal number of development phases needed.
To accomplish these, we expect to drill approximately 170 delineation wells beginning as early as the third quarter. When you combine our three Jackfish projects and our potential on the Kirby leases, we estimate our net production from these projects will reach 150,000 to 175,000 barrels of oil per day by 2020. This represents a compound annual growth rate for our Canadian oil sands production in the high teens for the next decade.
In our Lloydminster oil play in Alberta, we drilled 67 new wells in the first quarter. Lloydminster production averaged 40,000 barrels equivalent per day in the quarter. In 2010, we plan to spend $82 million drilling approximately 140 wells to roughly maintain current production levels.
Moving to the Permian Basin and our Wolfberry light oil play in West Texas, we recently added 11,000 net acres and now have 160,000 prospective net acres in the play. With average well costs under $1.4 million, this play provides repeatable, low-risk, high-return drilling opportunities. In the first quarter, we added a fourth rig. Until recently, we focused our drilling in the Odessa South area, where during the first quarter, the Clara Edwards #11 was brought online, flowing 450 barrels of oil equivalent per day, our best well to date in this play. We are utilizing two of the four rigs to delineate the Wolfberry potential in other parts of our acreage position. We plan to drill approximately 80 Wolfberry wells this year and have significant running room, with more than 1,100 remaining risk locations.
Elsewhere in the Permian Basin, we are currently running four additional rigs drilling for oil or liquid-rich gas targets. We are adding another two horizontal rigs in May. This rigs are drilling both conventional and unconventional targets, as well as accelerating the derisking of our acreage positions in new plays. 
Right around our home city, here in Oklahoma City, we continue to be impressed by the growth we're seeing in an area that has not been on anyone's radar screen until a couple of years ago, the Cana-Woodford Shale. We recently added to our position and have continued to derisk our acreage and refine our technical view. As a result, we now have 180,000 net acres in what we believe is the best part of the play. We added two rigs last month, and we're currently running nine operated rigs. The additional rigs will allow us to accelerate further the process of derisking and securing our acreage. We continue to see outstanding results from Cana.
In the first quarter, we brought 16 wells online with average 24-hour IP rates of about 6 million cubic feet equivalent per day. We grew first quarter net production to over 73 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day, up 210% from the first quarter of 2009. By the end of the first quarter, our Cana production inclined to a record 100 million cubic feet equivalent per day.
During the quarter, we drilled the two highest IP rate wells to date in the field. The Bingham 127H  and Kurt 114H [ph], both came online with initial production rates over 10 million cubic feet per day equivalent and each are expected to have ultimate recoveries in excess of 10 billion cubic feet equivalent.
With our low cost of entry and low royalty burden, the Cana-Woodford continues to offer some of the strongest economics among North American shale plays. Our Cana economics are further enhanced by the liquid-rich nature of the gas over a good portion of the field. In the rich areas of the core, our liquids content is as high as 120 barrels per million cubic feet, of which roughly a quarter is condensate.
Production history from our 70 long lateral horizontal wells drilled in the core areas of play continue to support a tight curve approaching 11 Bcf equivalent per well, including 500,000 barrels of NGLs.
To capture this additional value, we are building a cryogenic liquids extraction plant at Cana. This facility, which remains on schedule for startup in early 2011, has an initial capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day and is expandable to accommodate our future production growth.
Moving to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas, we are currently running 18 Devon-operated rigs. We increased our drilling activity during the quarter, and we began working down our inventory of uncompleted wells. At the end of March, we are back to our normal inventory level of approximately 150 wells awaiting completion. We are focusing our Barnett drilling into more liquid-rich areas where it is not uncommon to have wells produce as much as 100 barrels of liquids per million cubic feet.
Our net production in the Barnett averaged 1.1 Bcf equivalent per day for the first quarter, up 5% from the fourth quarter of 2009. We continue to expect Devon's Barnett production to reach its previous high mark of 1.2 Bcf equivalent per day during the third quarter.
In the Woodford Shale in Eastern Oklahoma's Arkoma Basin, we are running four operated rigs and will continue at that pace for the remainder of 2010. We're achieving solid per well recoveries from our long lateral horizontals. In the first quarter, we brought eight operated well online, with an average IP of 5.5 million cubic feet per day. Devon's net production in the play climbed to a record 88 million cubic feet equivalent per day in the first quarter, up 23% from our fourth quarter average.
Shifting to the Haynesville Shale, in the first quarter, we completed three Haynesville wells located in Shelby and Nacogdoches Counties. These three wells have an average 24-hour IPs of about 6 million cubic feet per day. These rates are consistent with our previous results in the area, and further confirm that we have a repeatable economically attractive play under a normalized price environment on our 110,000 net acres in the greater Carthage area. Our activity for the remainder of 2010 will focus on securing and derisking our primary term acreage in the Southern and greater Carthage areas.
Moving to the Rockies, in the Washakie Basin in Wyoming, our net production averaged a record 135 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day in the first quarter, up 14% year-over-year. We were in two rigs throughout the first quarter and drilled 13 operated wells. Both of these high-efficiency rigs will continue to drill these high-return opportunities in the Washakie area this year.
And finally, in the Horn River Basin of Northern British Columbia, Devon has assembled a position of approximately 170,000 net acres in what appears to be some of the best parts in the play. We began drilling the first of seven horizontal wells in early April. We expect to complete four of these horizontal wells in the third quarter, and we'll provide you with those results later this year. The three horizontal-producing wells we do have online continue to perform better than expected during the first quarter. A significant planning effort is underway for a larger program in 2011. At this point, I'm going to turn the call back over to Vince to open it up for Q&A."

Welcome to Devon's First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. Today's call will follow our usual format. I'll take care of a couple of housekeeping items and then Larry Nichols, our CEO, will give his thoughts on the quarter, as well as an update on our strategic repositioning. Following Larry's remarks, our President, John Richels, will provide a financial review and then Dave Hager, our Executive Vice President of Exploration and Production, will cover our capital budget and the operating highlights. We will follow with a Q&A period and as usual, we will hold the call to about an hour. As always, we ask that participants on the call to keep their questions in the Q&A session to one question and one follow-up. A replay of this call will be available later today through a link on our homepage. 
And also during the call, we will update some of our forward-looking estimates based on actual results for the first quarter. Since the revisions are pretty minor, we are not planning on issuing a new 8-K, but we will post these changes to the guidance area of our website. To find that, just click on the Guidance link found in the Investor Relations section of Devon's website.
Please note that all references in today's call to our plans, forecasts, expectations and estimates are forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law. And there are many factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those estimates. We encourage you to review the discussion of risk factors and uncertainties that is provided with our forecast in our Form 8-K.
One other compliance note, we'll use certain non-GAAP performance measures in today's call. When we use those measures, we're required to provide certain related disclosures. Those disclosures are also available on the Devon website. 
Finally, I want to remind you that our financial and operational reporting has been complicated by the restructuring that we're undergoing. Our plan to divest our international operations has triggered accounting rules for discontinued operations. Under those rules, we're required to exclude our international oil and gas production from our reported production volumes for all of the periods presented. The related revenues and expenses for our international operations are collapsed into a single line item at the end of our statement of operations. That line item is filed discontinued operations. For those of you interested in a more detailed review of the international results, we have supplied additional tables in our news release.
And to make matters worse, even though we are selling our assets in the Gulf of Mexico, the accounting standards for discontinued operations do not apply to this Gulf assets. The results of operations from those divestiture assets reside in our continuing operations up to the date of closing of the sale of those properties. Throughout the call, our comments will generally be directed to results from continuing operations but wherever possible, we'll provide additional commentary specifically targeting our North American onshore results or our keeper properties. Information is also provided in our press release to enable you to isolate certain results from Devon's North American onshore operations.
The accounting treatment of the divestiture properties also complicates the comparability of earnings estimates. About 2/3 of the analysts that reported estimates the first call this quarter excluded the impact of the discontinued operations. The mean estimate of earnings per share from analysts that excluded discontinued operations is $1.43 for the first quarter. That compares to our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1.65 per diluted share for the first quarter. For those analysts that included discontinued operations in their estimate, the mean estimate was $1.50 per share as compared to our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.85. So in either case, our first quarter results were significantly better than the Street's expectations.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Larry.

266510,78940834,59793,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May-05-2010",2010-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Clearly, the first quarter of this year was a very good one for Devon. First quarter production from our retained properties and that is, of course, the North American onshore properties grew to 587,000 Boe per d",1056,"Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Clearly, the first quarter of this year was a very good one for Devon. First quarter production from our retained properties and that is, of course, the North American onshore properties grew to 587,000 Boe per day, which is up nearly 3% over the fourth quarter of 2009. And it's worth pointing out that 186,000 barrels per day of this production were roughly 1/3 is oil and NGLs.
With production near the top end of our guidance and with strong price realizations relative to benchmark prices and with lower costs in nearly every expense category, first quarter earnings handily beat Street estimates. Also our Marketing and Administering business delivered another solid quarter generating $133 million in operating profit. And finally, we continue to maintain a very strong financial position. We ended the quarter with one of the strongest balance sheets in the NP sector, following the repayment of $1.2 billion of commercial paper and ending the quarter with cash on hand of nearly $1.2 billion.
During the first quarter of 2010, we also made remarkable progress with the strategic repositioning that we announced just last November. Early in the quarter, we closed the sale of three lower tertiary projects for aggregate sales proceeds of $1.3 billion. Then in March, we announced the sale of our remaining assets in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Brazil and Azerbaijan to BP for $7 billion and other long-term commitments. Because of the confidentiality agreements, we're not at liberty to disclose at this time the allocation of value among the various components of the sale to BP. However, the deepwater Gulf assets are clearly a significant piece and this portion of the transaction is now closed. As a result, we're essentially out of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico as of today.
We also recently announced the sale of the last of our assets in the Gulf of Mexico, which are the shelf assets, to Apache for $1,050,000,000. And finally, last week, we announced the sale of our Panyu field in China to CNOOC [China National Offshore Oil Corporation] for $515 million. We expect both the shelf and the Panyu transactions to close during the second quarter. So we're making great progress in all these sales.
When we first announced our plan to strategically reposition Devon, we expect that total after-tax proceeds from the divestitures of somewhere between $4.5 billion and $7.5 billion. The transactions that we've announced to date ensure that we'll exceed the top end of that range, including the few remaining international assets that remain to be in our contract. We now expect total after-tax proceeds of approximately $8 billion.
To date, we have used $1.2 billion of the sales proceeds to retire all of our outstanding commercial paper balances. We're also using $500 million of the sales proceeds to increase significantly our resource potential and our steam-assisted gravity drainage oil with the purchase of 50% of BP's interest in Kirby oil sands leases, which is a transaction we expect to close by the end of this month, by the end of may. This balance of the sales proceeds leaves us with tremendous flexibility to retire debt, to fund incremental E&P projects and to buyback stock. Given our outlook for natural gas prices and our continuing refusal to get caught up in the growth-at-any-cost mentality, we will not accelerate our dry gas production growth. The dry gas wells we're drilling are focused mostly on securing our acreage position and our shale plays such as Haynesville and Horn River and evaluating that you few new play concept. However, given the prevalence of oil and liquid-rich gas opportunities within our portfolio, most of our 2010 capital budget is focused on oil and liquid rich plays. As Dave will address later in the call, we're allocating some capital to increase our footprint in some of our oil and liquid rich plays in and around existing areas of opportunities.
As we consider the alternatives for the deployment of capital, our objective is always to optimize growth per share on a debt-adjusted basis. There are, of course, many factors that affect the relative attractiveness of the various alternatives. Current circumstances make the repurchase of our own common shares very attractive. These conditions led us to the announcement we made today to initiate a significant share repurchase program. Devon's Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of about $3.5 billion of Devon's common shares. $3.5 billion worth of Devon's common shares. At today's share price, that represents about 12% of our shares. The pace of our purchases will, of course, depend upon marketing conditions as been our practice in previous year of repurchases. Having said that, though, we haven't taken steps to begin purchasing our shares immediately.
It is worth noting that when you take into account the divestiture proceeds and putting modest value of our Midstream business of 8x annual profit. The purchase of a Devon share today, well, at yesterday's closing price is $66.35, represents significantly less than $10 per Boe of post-divestiture proved reserves. These analyses attributes no value to our thousands of unproved locations across all of our shale plays. No value to the continued expansion of our Canadian oil projects, Jackfish and Kirby. And no value to the unproved acres we've established across North America, much of which was oil and liquid-rich areas. Suffice it to say, we believe that Devon stock represents a very compelling value.
With our transformation of Devon approaching completion, we cannot be more pleased with the way we have positioned Devon for the future. We have significantly reduced the company's risk profile. We have improved the company's overall cost structure. We have maintained a balance of natural gas and liquids production. We have established a deep inventory of development projects, both in oil and in liquid-rich gas. And we will emerge with one of the strongest balance sheets in our peer group. When the dust settles, Devon will have retained the projects in our portfolio with the most attractive risk-adjusted returns, with a balance sheet that will allow us to aggressively pursue the development of those projects and with a highly competitive overall cash structure. We will be well-positioned to weather any industry downturn.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John Richels for a financial review.

Today, I want to take you through a brief review of the key drivers that affected our first quarter financial results and review how those factors influenced our outlook for the remainder of the year. As Vince mentio",1496,"Thanks, Larry. Good morning, everyone. Today, I want to take you through a brief review of the key drivers that affected our first quarter financial results and review how those factors influenced our outlook for the remainder of the year. As Vince mentioned earlier, we've reclassified the assets, liabilities and results of operations for our international assets in the discontinued operations for all accounting periods presented. As a result, I'll focus most of my comments on our reported continuing operations and just to reiterate, our reported results from continuing operations include both our retained North American onshore assets and the Gulf of Mexico assets that we are divesting.
Let's begin with a review of our production. In the first quarter of 2010, we produced 55.8 million oil equivalent barrels or 620,000 barrels per day. This result represents a 2% increase in daily production from continuing operations over the fourth quarter of 2009 and was really right in line with the guidance that we've provided in our previous earnings call.
When you look specifically at the assets that Devon is retaining that is our North American onshore properties, you'll find that production increased to 587,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2010, 3% over the fourth quarter of 2009. Our liquids rich Barnett, Cana and Arkoma-Woodford Shale plays, as well as increased oil production from our Permian Basin properties drove the production growth.
Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2010, we expect production from our retained North American onshore properties to increase to between 595,000 and 605,000 barrels per day. Since we have now closed the deepwater sale to BP, we expect that the Gulf of Mexico will only add an incremental 1 million to 2 million barrels of production in the second quarter depending upon the timing of the close of our shelf-divestiture package.
With respect for our 2010 production guidance for our North American onshore operations, we remain on track to deliver 221 million barrels equivalent. If you include the production from our Gulf of Mexico divestiture properties, we expect full year production from continuing operations to be in the neighborhood of 225 million to 226 million barrels.
Moving to price realizations beginning with oil, in the first quarter, the WTI Index price rose to an average of $78.54 per barrel. That's an 82% improvement over the first quarter of 2009. In addition to the higher benchmark price, regional differentials, as a percentage of WTI, narrowed pushing company-wide price realizations above the top end of our forecast range. The most notable regional outperformance occurred in Canada. This is because heavy oil differentials remained narrow in the first quarter due to strong demand.
In total, Devon's first quarter realized oil price came in at $67.58 per barrel or approximately 86% of WTI. That's a $36 per barrel improvement in our oil price realization compared to the year-ago quarter.
Looking to the remainder of 2010, we protected the price on over 70% of our North American onshore oil production using collars, with a weighted average floor of $67.47 per barrel and a ceiling of $96.48 per barrel.
On the natural gas side, the first quarter Henry Hub Index increased to an average of $5.30 per Mcf. Overall, the company-wide gas price realization before the impact of hedges were 91% of Henry Hub or $4.80 per Mcf. We had hedges covering about 1.4 billion cubic feet per day for the quarter, with weighted average protected price of $6.12 per Mcf.
Cash settlements from these hedges and our basis swaps increased Devon's realizations by $0.42 per Mcf, giving us an all-in price, including hedges of $5.22 per Mcf. For the second quarter, we now have hedges covering 1.5 Bcf per day, that's nearly 2/3 of our North American onshore production with a weighted average protected price of $5.88. A more detailed hedging schedule is available in the Guidance section of our website.
Turning now to our Marketing and Midstream business, once again, our Marketing and Midstream operations delivered strong results, generating $133 million of operating profit in the first quarter. Higher commodity prices and strong cost controls were the key performance drivers during the quarter. With the first quarter in hand, we're very well-positioned to achieve our full year forecast range of $450 million to $525 million. 
Let's move now to expenses. The company did a very good job of controlling costs during the first quarter. Our first quarter lease operating expenses from continuing operations totaled $414 million. This translates to $7.41 per barrel produced and that's about $0.10 below the low end of our guidance range for 2010. 
When compared to the first quarter of 2009, LOE expense declined by 6%, and that's in spite of significantly higher Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rates and increased energy costs. To illustrate the effect of that, if we exclude the impact of the strengthening Canadian dollar, first quarter LOE declined 13% compared to the first quarter of 2009 instead of that 6% that I mentioned earlier.
When you isolate the performance of Devon's go-forward North American onshore asset base, the per unit lease operating expense is even more competitive at $7.19 per barrel of production. This is especially impressive considering that roughly 1/3 of this quarter's production was liquids. Looking to the second quarter, we expect unit LOE from our retained assets to be between $7.20 and $7.50 per Boe.
Devon's reported DD&A expense for the first quarter was $426 million or $7.63 per barrel, near the low end of our guidance range. Looking ahead, the sale of our Gulf of Mexico assets will lower our go-forward DD&A rate. As a result, we expect our second quarter depletion expense to decline to a range of $7.30 to $7.50 per barrel produced.
Moving on to G&A expense, our first quarter G&A expense decreased to $138 million. That's about 16% reduction in G&A expenditures when compared to the first quarter of 2009. The year-over-year decline in G&A costs is largely attributable to operational efficiencies that were achieved through our restructuring.
Shifting to interest expense, interest expense was right in line with our expectations at about $86 million for the quarter. In the second quarter, due to the sale of our deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations, we will capitalize less interest. And as a result, even though our overall borrowing costs are declining, we're forecasting that our reported interest expense will rise to about $95 million.
The final expense item I'd like to touch on is income taxes. For the first quarter, we reported income tax expense from continuing operations of $514 million or 32% of pre-tax income. After backing out the impact of special items, you get an adjusted tax rate of 31%. And this is made up of current tax rate of 13% of pre-tax income and deferred taxes of 18%. This is in line with our full year forecast and similar to the rates we would expect for the remainder of the year. 
In today's earnings release, we have provided a table that reconciles the effects of the items that are typically excluded from analyst estimates. So moving to the bottom line, in the first quarter, our adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $740 million or $1.65 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings from discontinued operations added another $91 million or $0.20 per diluted share. So in aggregate, after backing out the items that are typically excluded from analyst estimates, our adjusted net earnings for the first quarter were $831 million or $1.85 per diluted share.
Our reported net earnings for the quarter were much higher, almost $1.2 billion, due primarily to the $334 million impact of unrealized gains on hedges. All in all, Devon delivered a very strong performance led by production at the top end of our guidance, strong price realizations for both oil and natural gas and very good cost control.
Before I turn the call over to Dave Hager for an operations update, I want to spend a few moments reviewing our financial position. During the quarter, we generated cash flow before balance sheet changes of $1.4 billion, up 45% over the first quarter of 2009.
In addition, we also received $1.3 billion of cash proceeds from the closing of the sales of three of our lower tertiary discoveries in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Looking briefly at our capital structure, we utilized our sources of cash to fund all of our capital expenditures for the quarter and repay $1.2 billion of commercial paper borrowings. As a result, at March 31, our net debt balances declined to $4.9 billion and our debt-to-capitalization ratio reached an 18-month low of 22%. We ended the first quarter with cash on hand of $1.2 billion as well.
Overall, we're very excited about Devon's future and we believe that we're extremely well-positioned to continue to deliver a strong per share growth in both the near and the long term. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Dave.

266510,78940834,59793,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May-05-2010",2010-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a quick recap of company-wide drilling activity. We had as many as 80 Devon-operated rigs running during the first quarter, but our winter drilling program in Canada wound down, we ended March with",1710,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a quick recap of company-wide drilling activity. We had as many as 80 Devon-operated rigs running during the first quarter, but our winter drilling program in Canada wound down, we ended March with 60 Devon-operated rigs running. This is about the level of activity we expect to maintain for the remainder of 2010.
During the first quarter, we drilled 454 wells, included 426 development wells and 28 exploration wells. All of the development wells were successful and all but one of the exploratory wells were successful.
Capital expenditures for exploration and development from our North America onshore operations totaled $1 billion for the quarter. Given the abundance of oil and liquids-rich gas opportunities in our portfolio, going into 2010, our initial capital budget for the year was already weighted towards oil and liquids-rich gas plays. As a result of the earlier-than-expected sales of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and international assets, our 2010 capital budget for the divestiture assets has decreased by roughly $900 million. This gives us the opportunity to reallocate some of this capital to capturing additional acreage in onshore oil and liquids-rich gas plays and potentially to increase drilling on some of these plays.
During 2010, we have either leased or in the process of leasing approximately 300,000 additional net acres in oil and liquids-rich plays. This include additional leasing in the Wolfberry and Cana plays, as well as significant acreage additions and potential new plays in the Permian and Rockies. We're currently conducting a mid-year capital review and if necessary, we'll provide updated capital guidance during our second quarter call.
Moving now to our quarterly operations highlights, at our 100% Devon-owned Jackfish thermal oil project in Eastern Alberta, our daily production reached facilities capacity during the first quarter. However, minor operational issues, which now have been addressed, limited our production for the quarter to an average of just over 26,000 barrels per day net of royalties. Jackfish continues to be one of the best performing SAGD projects in the industry. Construction of our Jackfish 2 project is now roughly three quarters complete and remains on budget. Had drilling continues and the project remains on schedule for first oil in late 2011. 
At Jackfish 3, we continue to work toward filing the regulatory application in the third quarter of this year. Pending regulatory approval and formal sanctioning, we could begin site work by late 2011 with plant startup targeted for 2014. I will remind you that like Jackfish 1 and 2, we expect Jackfish 3 to average 30,000 barrels per day net of royalties over the life of the project and to recover approximately 260 million barrels of oil after royalties.
Devon has 100% working interest in each of the three Jackfish projects. At Kirby, we are currently working through the details of our joint venture agreement with BP and expect to have a signed agreement in place later this month. Our first step on the Kirby oil sands leases will be to further evaluate the size of the resource and to determine the optimal number of development phases needed.
To accomplish these, we expect to drill approximately 170 delineation wells beginning as early as the third quarter. When you combine our three Jackfish projects and our potential on the Kirby leases, we estimate our net production from these projects will reach 150,000 to 175,000 barrels of oil per day by 2020. This represents a compound annual growth rate for our Canadian oil sands production in the high teens for the next decade.
In our Lloydminster oil play in Alberta, we drilled 67 new wells in the first quarter. Lloydminster production averaged 40,000 barrels equivalent per day in the quarter. In 2010, we plan to spend $82 million drilling approximately 140 wells to roughly maintain current production levels.
Moving to the Permian Basin and our Wolfberry light oil play in West Texas, we recently added 11,000 net acres and now have 160,000 prospective net acres in the play. With average well costs under $1.4 million, this play provides repeatable, low-risk, high-return drilling opportunities. In the first quarter, we added a fourth rig. Until recently, we focused our drilling in the Odessa South area, where during the first quarter, the Clara Edwards #11 was brought online, flowing 450 barrels of oil equivalent per day, our best well to date in this play. We are utilizing two of the four rigs to delineate the Wolfberry potential in other parts of our acreage position. We plan to drill approximately 80 Wolfberry wells this year and have significant running room, with more than 1,100 remaining risk locations.
Elsewhere in the Permian Basin, we are currently running four additional rigs drilling for oil or liquid-rich gas targets. We are adding another two horizontal rigs in May. This rigs are drilling both conventional and unconventional targets, as well as accelerating the derisking of our acreage positions in new plays. 
Right around our home city, here in Oklahoma City, we continue to be impressed by the growth we're seeing in an area that has not been on anyone's radar screen until a couple of years ago, the Cana-Woodford Shale. We recently added to our position and have continued to derisk our acreage and refine our technical view. As a result, we now have 180,000 net acres in what we believe is the best part of the play. We added two rigs last month, and we're currently running nine operated rigs. The additional rigs will allow us to accelerate further the process of derisking and securing our acreage. We continue to see outstanding results from Cana.
In the first quarter, we brought 16 wells online with average 24-hour IP rates of about 6 million cubic feet equivalent per day. We grew first quarter net production to over 73 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day, up 210% from the first quarter of 2009. By the end of the first quarter, our Cana production inclined to a record 100 million cubic feet equivalent per day.
During the quarter, we drilled the two highest IP rate wells to date in the field. The Bingham 127H  and Kurt 114H [ph], both came online with initial production rates over 10 million cubic feet per day equivalent and each are expected to have ultimate recoveries in excess of 10 billion cubic feet equivalent.
With our low cost of entry and low royalty burden, the Cana-Woodford continues to offer some of the strongest economics among North American shale plays. Our Cana economics are further enhanced by the liquid-rich nature of the gas over a good portion of the field. In the rich areas of the core, our liquids content is as high as 120 barrels per million cubic feet, of which roughly a quarter is condensate.
Production history from our 70 long lateral horizontal wells drilled in the core areas of play continue to support a tight curve approaching 11 Bcf equivalent per well, including 500,000 barrels of NGLs.
To capture this additional value, we are building a cryogenic liquids extraction plant at Cana. This facility, which remains on schedule for startup in early 2011, has an initial capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day and is expandable to accommodate our future production growth.
Moving to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas, we are currently running 18 Devon-operated rigs. We increased our drilling activity during the quarter, and we began working down our inventory of uncompleted wells. At the end of March, we are back to our normal inventory level of approximately 150 wells awaiting completion. We are focusing our Barnett drilling into more liquid-rich areas where it is not uncommon to have wells produce as much as 100 barrels of liquids per million cubic feet.
Our net production in the Barnett averaged 1.1 Bcf equivalent per day for the first quarter, up 5% from the fourth quarter of 2009. We continue to expect Devon's Barnett production to reach its previous high mark of 1.2 Bcf equivalent per day during the third quarter.
In the Woodford Shale in Eastern Oklahoma's Arkoma Basin, we are running four operated rigs and will continue at that pace for the remainder of 2010. We're achieving solid per well recoveries from our long lateral horizontals. In the first quarter, we brought eight operated well online, with an average IP of 5.5 million cubic feet per day. Devon's net production in the play climbed to a record 88 million cubic feet equivalent per day in the first quarter, up 23% from our fourth quarter average.
Shifting to the Haynesville Shale, in the first quarter, we completed three Haynesville wells located in Shelby and Nacogdoches Counties. These three wells have an average 24-hour IPs of about 6 million cubic feet per day. These rates are consistent with our previous results in the area, and further confirm that we have a repeatable economically attractive play under a normalized price environment on our 110,000 net acres in the greater Carthage area. Our activity for the remainder of 2010 will focus on securing and derisking our primary term acreage in the Southern and greater Carthage areas.
Moving to the Rockies, in the Washakie Basin in Wyoming, our net production averaged a record 135 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day in the first quarter, up 14% year-over-year. We were in two rigs throughout the first quarter and drilled 13 operated wells. Both of these high-efficiency rigs will continue to drill these high-return opportunities in the Washakie area this year.
And finally, in the Horn River Basin of Northern British Columbia, Devon has assembled a position of approximately 170,000 net acres in what appears to be some of the best parts in the play. We began drilling the first of seven horizontal wells in early April. We expect to complete four of these horizontal wells in the third quarter, and we'll provide you with those results later this year. The three horizontal-producing wells we do have online continue to perform better than expected during the first quarter. A significant planning effort is underway for a larger program in 2011. At this point, I'm going to turn the call back over to Vince to open it up for Q&A.

That would be the sublet well, where that frac should start around the end of May or so. We also have a couple of wells that are currently drilling down -- that well, by the way, is a Bossier Shale well that's awaiting frac-ing. We also have two more wells that we're drilling currently down in San Augustine County, one a Bossier Shale well, one a Haynesville Shale well.

Welcome to Devon's First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. Today's call will follow our usual format. I'll take care of a couple of housekeeping items and then Larry Nichols, our CEO, will give his thoughts on the quarter, as well as an update on our strategic repositioning. Following Larry's remarks, our President, John Richels, will provide a financial review and then Dave Hager, our Executive Vice President of Exploration and Production, will cover our capital budget and the operating highlights. We will follow with a Q&A period and as usual, we will hold the call to about an hour. As always, we ask that participants on the call to keep their questions in the Q&A session to one question and one follow-up. A replay of this call will be available later today through a link on our homepage. 
And also during the call, we will update some of our forward-looking estimates based on actual results for the first quarter. Since the revisions are pretty minor, we are not planning on issuing a new 8-K, but we will post these changes to the guidance area of our website. To find that, just click on the Guidance link found in the Investor Relations section of Devon's website.
Please note that all references in today's call to our plans, forecasts, expectations and estimates are forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law. And there are many factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those estimates. We encourage you to review the discussion of risk factors and uncertainties that is provided with our forecast in our Form 8-K.
One other compliance note, we'll use certain non-GAAP performance measures in today's call. When we use those measures, we're required to provide certain related disclosures. Those disclosures are also available on the Devon website. 
Finally, I want to remind you that our financial and operational reporting has been complicated by the restructuring that we're undergoing. Our plan to divest our international operations has triggered accounting rules for discontinued operations. Under those rules, we're required to exclude our international oil and gas production from our reported production volumes for all of the periods presented. The related revenues and expenses for our international operations are collapsed into a single line item at the end of our statement of operations. That line item is filed discontinued operations. For those of you interested in a more detailed review of the international results, we have supplied additional tables in our news release.
And to make matters worse, even though we are selling our assets in the Gulf of Mexico, the accounting standards for discontinued operations do not apply to this Gulf assets. The results of operations from those divestiture assets reside in our continuing operations up to the date of closing of the sale of those properties. Throughout the call, our comments will generally be directed to results from continuing operations but wherever possible, we'll provide additional commentary specifically targeting our North American onshore results or our keeper properties. Information is also provided in our press release to enable you to isolate certain results from Devon's North American onshore operations.
The accounting treatment of the divestiture properties also complicates the comparability of earnings estimates. About 2/3 of the analysts that reported estimates the first call this quarter excluded the impact of the discontinued operations. The mean estimate of earnings per share from analysts that excluded discontinued operations is $1.43 for the first quarter. That compares to our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1.65 per diluted share for the first quarter. For those analysts that included discontinued operations in their estimate, the mean estimate was $1.50 per share as compared to our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.85. So in either case, our first quarter results were significantly better than the Street's expectations.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Larry."
266510,78940834,65548,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May-05-2010",2010-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Clearly, the first quarter of this year was a very good one for Devon. First quarter production from our retained properties and that is, of course, the North American onshore properties, grew to 587,000 Boe per",1058,"Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Clearly, the first quarter of this year was a very good one for Devon. First quarter production from our retained properties and that is, of course, the North American onshore properties, grew to 587,000 Boe per day, which is up nearly 3% over the fourth quarter of 2009. And it's worth pointing out that 186,000 barrels per day of this production were roughly 1/3 is oil and NGLs.
With production near the top end of our guidance and with strong price realizations relative to benchmark prices and with lower costs in nearly every expense category, first quarter earnings handily beat Street estimates. Also our Marketing and Administering business delivered another solid quarter generating $133 million in operating profit. And finally, we continue to maintain a very strong financial position. We ended the quarter with one of the strongest balance sheets in the NP sector, following the repayment of $1.2 billion of commercial paper and ending the quarter with cash on hand of nearly $1.2 billion.
During the first quarter of 2010, we also made remarkable progress with the strategic repositioning that we announced just last November. Early in the quarter, we closed the sale of three lower tertiary projects for aggregate sales proceeds of $1.3 billion. Then in March, we announced the sale of our remaining assets in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Brazil and Azerbaijan to BP for $7 billion and other long-term commitments. Because of the confidentiality agreements, we're not at liberty to disclose at this time the allocation of value among the various components of the sale to BP. However, the deepwater Gulf assets are clearly a significant piece and this portion of the transaction is now closed. As a result, we are essentially out of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico as of today.
We also recently announced the sale of the last of our assets in the Gulf of Mexico, which are the shelf assets, to Apache for $1,050,000,000. And finally, last week, we announced the sale of our Panyu field in China to CNOOC [China National Offshore Oil Corporation] for $515 million. We expect both the shelf and the Panyu transactions to close during the second quarter. So we're making great progress in all these sales.
When we first announced our plan to strategically reposition Devon, we expected total after-tax proceeds from the divestitures of somewhere between $4.5 billion and $7.5 billion. The transactions that we've announced to date ensure that we will exceed the top end of that range, including the few remaining international assets that remain to get under contract. We now expect total after-tax proceeds of approximately $8 billion.
To date, we have used $1.2 billion of the sales proceeds to retire all of our outstanding commercial paper balances. We are also using $500 million of the sales proceeds to increase significantly our resource potential and our steam-assisted gravity drainage oil with the purchase of 50% of BP's interest in Kirby oil sands leases, which is a transaction we expect to close by the end of this month, by the end of May. This balance of the sales proceeds leaves us with tremendous flexibility to retire debt, to fund incremental E&P projects and to buy back stock. Given our outlook for natural gas prices and our continuing refusal to get caught up in the growth-at-any-cost mentality, we will not accelerate our dry gas production growth. The dry gas wells we are drilling are focused mostly on securing our acreage position in our shale plays such as Haynesville and Horn River and evaluating a few new play concepts. However, given the prevalence of oil and liquid-rich gas opportunities within our portfolio, most of our 2010 capital budget is focused on oil and liquid-rich plays. As Dave will address later in the call, we are allocating some capital to increase our footprint in some of our oil and liquid-rich plays in and around existing areas of opportunities.
As we consider the alternatives for the deployment of capital, our objective is always to optimize growth per share on a debt-adjusted basis. There are, of course, many factors that affect the relative attractiveness of the various alternatives. Current circumstances make the repurchase of our own common shares very attractive. These conditions led us to the announcement we made today to initiate a significant share repurchase program. Devon's Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of about $3.5 billion of Devon's common shares. $3.5 billion worth of Devon's common shares. At today's share price, that represents about 12% of our shares. The pace of our purchases will, of course, depend upon marketing conditions as been our practice in previous year of repurchases. Having said that, though, we haven't taken steps to begin purchasing our shares immediately.
It is worth noting that when you take into account the divestiture proceeds and putting modest value of our Midstream business of 8x annual profit. The purchase of a Devon share today, well, at yesterday's closing price is $66.35, represents significantly less than $10 per Boe of post-divestiture proved reserves. These analyses attributes no value to our thousands of unproved locations across all of our shale plays. No value to the continued expansion of our Canadian oil projects, Jackfish and Kirby. And no value to the unproved acres we've established across North America, much of which was oil and liquid-rich areas. Suffice it to say, we believe that Devon stock represents a very compelling value.
With our transformation of Devon approaching completion, we cannot be more pleased with the way we have positioned Devon for the future. We have significantly reduced the company's risk profile. We have improved the company's overall cost structure. We have maintained a balance of natural gas and liquids production. We have established a deep inventory of development projects, both in oil and in liquid-rich gas. And we will emerge with one of the strongest balance sheets in our peer group. When the dust settles, Devon will have retained the projects in our portfolio with the most attractive risk-adjusted returns, with a balance sheet that will allow us to aggressively pursue the development of those projects and with a highly competitive overall cash structure. We will be well positioned to weather any industry downturn.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John Richels for a financial review."
266510,78940834,65548,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May-05-2010",2010-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Larry. Good morning, everyone. Today, I want to take you through a brief review of the key drivers that affected our first quarter financial results and review how those factors influenced our outlook for the remainder of the year. As Vince mentio",1498,"Thanks, Larry. Good morning, everyone. Today, I want to take you through a brief review of the key drivers that affected our first quarter financial results and review how those factors influenced our outlook for the remainder of the year. As Vince mentioned earlier, we've reclassified the assets, liabilities and results of operations for our international assets in the discontinued operations for all accounting periods presented. As a result, I'll focus most of my comments on our reported continuing operations and just to reiterate, our reported results from continuing operations include both our retained North American onshore assets and the Gulf of Mexico assets that we are divesting.
Let's begin with a review of our production. In the first quarter of 2010, we produced 55.8 million oil equivalent barrels or 620,000 barrels per day. This result represents a 2% increase in daily production from continuing operations over the fourth quarter of 2009 and was really right in line with the guidance that we've provided in our previous earnings call.
When you look specifically at the assets that Devon is retaining that is our North American onshore properties, you'll find that production increased to 587,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2010, 3% over the fourth quarter of 2009. Our liquids rich Barnett, Cana and Arkoma-Woodford Shale plays, as well as increased oil production from our Permian Basin properties drove the production growth.
Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2010, we expect production from our retained North American onshore properties to increase to between 595,000 and 605,000 barrels per day. Since we have now closed the deepwater sale to BP, we expect that the Gulf of Mexico will only add an incremental 1 million to 2 million barrels of production in the second quarter depending upon the timing of the close of our shelf-divestiture package.
With respect for our 2010 production guidance for our North American onshore operations, we remain on track to deliver 221 million barrels equivalent. If you include the production from our Gulf of Mexico divestiture properties, we expect full year production from continuing operations to be in the neighborhood of 225 million to 226 million barrels.
Moving to price realizations beginning with oil, in the first quarter, the WTI Index price rose to an average of $78.54 per barrel. That's an 82% improvement over the first quarter of 2009. In addition to the higher benchmark price, regional differentials, as a percentage of WTI, narrowed pushing company-wide price realizations above the top end of our forecast range. The most notable regional outperformance occurred in Canada. This is because heavy oil differentials remained narrow in the first quarter due to strong demand.
In total, Devon's first quarter realized oil price came in at $67.58 per barrel or approximately 86% of WTI. That's a $36 per barrel improvement in our oil price realization compared to the year-ago quarter.
Looking to the remainder of 2010, we protected the price on over 70% of our North American onshore oil production using collars, with a weighted average floor of $67.47 per barrel and a ceiling of $96.48 per barrel.
On the natural gas side, the first quarter Henry Hub Index increased to an average of $5.30 per Mcf. Overall, the company-wide gas price realization before the impact of hedges were 91% of Henry Hub or $4.80 per Mcf. We had hedges covering about 1.4 billion cubic feet per day for the quarter, with weighted average protected price of $6.12 per Mcf.
Cash settlements from these hedges and our basis swaps increased Devon's realizations by $0.42 per Mcf, giving us an all-in price, including hedges of $5.22 per Mcf. For the second quarter, we now have hedges covering 1.5 Bcf per day, that's nearly 2/3 of our North American onshore production with a weighted average protected price of $5.88. A more detailed hedging schedule is available in the Guidance section of our website.
Turning now to our Marketing and Midstream business, once again, our Marketing and Midstream operations delivered strong results, generating $133 million of operating profit in the first quarter. Higher commodity prices and strong cost controls were the key performance drivers during the quarter. With the first quarter in hand, we're very well positioned to achieve our full year forecast range of $450 million to $525 million. 
Let's move now to expenses. The company did a very good job of controlling costs during the first quarter. Our first quarter lease operating expenses from continuing operations totaled $414 million. This translates to $7.41 per barrel produced and that's about $0.10 below the low end of our guidance range for 2010. 
When compared to the first quarter of 2009, LOE expense declined by 6%, and that's in spite of significantly higher Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rates and increased energy costs. To illustrate the effect of that, if we exclude the impact of the strengthening Canadian dollar, first quarter LOE declined 13% compared to the first quarter of 2009 instead of that 6% that I mentioned earlier.
When you isolate the performance of Devon's go-forward North American onshore asset base, the per unit lease operating expense is even more competitive at $7.19 per barrel of production. This is especially impressive considering that roughly 1/3 of this quarter's production was liquids. Looking to the second quarter, we expect unit LOE from our retained assets to be between $7.20 and $7.50 per Boe.
Devon's reported DD&A expense for the first quarter was $426 million or $7.63 per barrel, near the low end of our guidance range. Looking ahead, the sale of our Gulf of Mexico assets will lower our go-forward DD&A rate. As a result, we expect our second quarter depletion expense to decline to a range of $7.30 to $7.50 per barrel produced.
Moving on to G&A expense, our first quarter G&A expense decreased to $138 million. That's about 16% reduction in G&A expenditures when compared to the first quarter of 2009. The year-over-year decline in G&A costs is largely attributable to operational efficiencies that were achieved through our restructuring.
Shifting to interest expense, interest expense was right in line with our expectations at about $86 million for the quarter. In the second quarter, due to the sale of our deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations, we will capitalize less interest. And as a result, even though our overall borrowing costs are declining, we're forecasting that our reported interest expense will rise to about $95 million.
The final expense item I'd like to touch on is income taxes. For the first quarter, we reported income tax expense from continuing operations of $514 million or 32% of pre-tax income. After backing out the impact of special items, you get an adjusted tax rate of 31%. And this is made up of current tax rate of 13% of pre-tax income and deferred taxes of 18%. This is in line with our full year forecast and similar to the rates we would expect for the remainder of the year. 
In today's earnings release, we have provided a table that reconciles the effects of the items that are typically excluded from analyst estimates. So moving to the bottom line, in the first quarter, our adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $740 million or $1.65 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings from discontinued operations added another $91 million or $0.20 per diluted share. So in aggregate, after backing out the items that are typically excluded from analyst estimates, our adjusted net earnings for the first quarter were $831 million or $1.85 per diluted share.
Our reported net earnings for the quarter were much higher, almost $1.2 billion, due primarily to the $334 million impact of unrealized gains on hedges. All in all, Devon delivered a very strong performance led by production at the top end of our guidance, strong price realizations for both oil and natural gas and very good cost control.
Before I turn the call over to Dave Hager for an operations update, I want to spend a few moments reviewing our financial position. During the quarter, we generated cash flow before balance sheet changes of $1.4 billion, up 45% over the first quarter of 2009.
In addition, we also received $1.3 billion of cash proceeds from the closing of the sales of three of our lower tertiary discoveries in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Looking briefly at our capital structure, we utilized our sources of cash to fund all of our capital expenditures for the quarter and repay $1.2 billion of commercial paper borrowings. As a result, at March 31, our net debt balances declined to $4.9 billion and our debt-to-capitalization ratio reached an 18-month low of 22%. We ended the first quarter with cash on hand of $1.2 billion as well.
Overall, we're very excited about Devon's future and we believe that we're extremely well positioned to continue to deliver a strong per share growth in both the near and the long term. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Dave."
266510,78940834,65548,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May-05-2010",2010-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a quick recap of company-wide drilling activity. We had as many as 80 Devon-operated rigs running during the first quarter, but our winter drilling program in Canada wound down, we ended March with",1710,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a quick recap of company-wide drilling activity. We had as many as 80 Devon-operated rigs running during the first quarter, but our winter drilling program in Canada wound down, we ended March with 60 Devon-operated rigs running. This is about the level of activity we expect to maintain for the remainder of 2010.
During the first quarter, we drilled 454 wells, included 426 development wells and 28 exploration wells. All of the development wells were successful and all but one of the exploratory wells were successful.
Capital expenditures for exploration and development from our North America onshore operations totaled $1 billion for the quarter. Given the abundance of oil and liquids-rich gas opportunities in our portfolio, going into 2010, our initial capital budget for the year was already weighted towards oil and liquids-rich gas plays. As a result of the earlier-than-expected sales of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and international assets, our 2010 capital budget for the divestiture assets has decreased by roughly $900 million. This gives us the opportunity to reallocate some of this capital to capturing additional acreage in onshore oil and liquids-rich gas plays and potentially to increase drilling on some of these plays.
During 2010, we have either leased or in the process of leasing approximately 300,000 additional net acres in oil and liquids-rich plays. This include additional leasing in the Wolfberry and Cana plays, as well as significant acreage additions and potential new plays in the Permian and Rockies. We're currently conducting a mid-year capital review and if necessary, we'll provide updated capital guidance during our second quarter call.
Moving now to our quarterly operations highlights, at our 100% Devon-owned Jackfish thermal oil project in Eastern Alberta, our daily production reached facilities capacity during the first quarter. However, minor operational issues, which now have been addressed, limited our production for the quarter to an average of just over 26,000 barrels per day net of royalties. Jackfish continues to be one of the best performing SAGD projects in the industry. Construction of our Jackfish 2 project is now roughly three quarters complete and remains on budget. Had drilling continues and the project remains on schedule for first oil in late 2011. 
At Jackfish 3, we continue to work toward filing the regulatory application in the third quarter of this year. Pending regulatory approval and formal sanctioning, we could begin site work by late 2011 with plant startup targeted for 2014. I will remind you that like Jackfish 1 and 2, we expect Jackfish 3 to average 30,000 barrels per day net of royalties over the life of the project and to recover approximately 260 million barrels of oil after royalties.
Devon has 100% working interest in each of the three Jackfish projects. At Kirby, we are currently working through the details of our joint venture agreement with BP and expect to have a signed agreement in place later this month. Our first step on the Kirby oil sands leases will be to further evaluate the size of the resource and to determine the optimal number of development phases needed.
To accomplish this, we expect to drill approximately 170 delineation wells beginning as early as the third quarter. When you combine our three Jackfish projects and our potential on the Kirby leases, we estimate our net production from these projects will reach 150,000 to 175,000 barrels of oil per day by 2020. This represents a compound annual growth rate for our Canadian oil sands production in the high teens for the next decade.
In our Lloydminster oil play in Alberta, we drilled 67 new wells in the first quarter. Lloydminster production averaged 40,000 barrels equivalent per day in the quarter. In 2010, we plan to spend $82 million drilling approximately 140 wells to roughly maintain current production levels.
Moving to the Permian Basin and our Wolfberry light oil play in West Texas. We recently added 11,000 net acres and now have 160,000 prospective net acres in the play. With average well costs under $1.4 million, this play provides repeatable, low-risk, high-return drilling opportunities. In the first quarter, we added a fourth rig. Until recently, we focused our drilling in the Odessa South area, where during the first quarter, the Clara Edwards #11 was brought online, flowing 450 barrels of oil equivalent per day, our best well to date in this play. We are utilizing two of the four rigs to delineate the Wolfberry potential in other parts of our acreage position. We plan to drill approximately 80 Wolfberry wells this year and have significant running room, with more than 1,100 remaining risk locations.
Elsewhere in the Permian Basin, we are currently running four additional rigs drilling for oil or liquid-rich gas targets. We are adding another two horizontal rigs in May. These rigs are drilling both conventional and unconventional targets, as well as accelerating the derisking of our acreage positions in new plays. 
Right around our home city, here in Oklahoma City, we continue to be impressed by the growth we are seeing in an area that has not been on anyone's radar screen until a couple of years ago: the Cana-Woodford Shale. We recently added to our position and have continued to derisk our acreage and refine our technical view. As a result, we now have 180,000 net acres in what we believe is the best part of the play. We added two rigs last month, and we're currently running nine operated rigs. The additional rigs will allow us to accelerate further the process of derisking and securing our acreage. We continue to see outstanding results from Cana.
In the first quarter, we brought 16 wells online with average 24-hour IP rates of about 6 million cubic feet equivalent per day. We grew first quarter net production to over 73 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day, up 210% from the first quarter of 2009. By the end of the first quarter, our Cana production inclined to a record 100 million cubic feet equivalent per day.
During the quarter, we drilled the two highest IP rate wells to date in the field: the Bingham 127H  and Kurt's 114H. Both came online with initial production rates over 10 million cubic feet per day equivalent and each are expected to have ultimate recoveries in excess of 10 billion cubic feet equivalent.
With our low cost of entry and low royalty burden, the Cana-Woodford continues to offer some of the strongest economics among North American shale plays. Our Cana economics are further enhanced by the liquid-rich nature of the gas over a good portion of the field. In the rich areas of the core, our liquids content is as high as 120 barrels per million cubic feet, of which roughly a quarter is condensate.
Production history from our 70 long lateral horizontal wells drilled in the core areas of play continue to support a type curve approaching 11 Bcf equivalent per well, including 500,000 barrels of NGLs.
To capture this additional value, we are building a cryogenic liquids extraction plant at Cana. This facility, which remains on schedule for start-up in early 2011, has an initial capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day and is expandable to accommodate our future production growth.
Moving to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas. We are currently running 18 Devon-operated rigs. We increased our drilling activity during the quarter, and we began working down our inventory of uncompleted wells. At the end of March, we were back to our normal inventory level of approximately 150 wells awaiting completion. We are focusing our Barnett drilling into more liquid-rich areas where it is not uncommon to have wells produce as much as 100 barrels of liquids per million cubic feet.
Our net production in the Barnett averaged 1.1 Bcf equivalent per day for the first quarter, up 5% from the fourth quarter of 2009. We continue to expect Devon's Barnett production to reach its previous high mark of 1.2 Bcf equivalent per day during the third quarter.
In the Woodford Shale in Eastern Oklahoma's Arkoma Basin, we are running four operated rigs and will continue at that pace for the remainder of 2010. We're achieving solid per well recoveries from our long lateral horizontals. In the first quarter, we brought eight operated well online, with an average IP of 5.5 million cubic feet per day. Devon's net production in the play climbed to a record 88 million cubic feet equivalent per day in the first quarter, up 23% from our fourth quarter average.
Shifting to the Haynesville Shale, in the first quarter, we completed three Haynesville wells located in Shelby and Nacogdoches Counties. These three wells have an average 24-hour IPs of about 6 million cubic feet per day. These rates are consistent with our previous results in the area, and further confirm that we have a repeatable economically attractive play under a normalized price environment on our 110,000 net acres in the greater Carthage area. Our activity for the remainder of 2010 will focus on securing and derisking our primary term acreage in the Southern and greater Carthage areas.
Moving to the Rockies, in the Washakie Basin in Wyoming, our net production averaged a record 135 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day in the first quarter, up 14% year-over-year. We were in two rigs throughout the first quarter and drilled 13 operated wells. Both of these high-efficiency rigs will continue to drill these high-return opportunities in the Washakie area this year.
And finally, in the Horn River Basin of Northern British Columbia, Devon has assembled a position of approximately 170,000 net acres in what appears to be some of the best parts in the play. We began drilling the first of seven horizontal wells in early April. We expect to complete four of these horizontal wells in the third quarter, and we'll provide you with those results later this year. The three horizontal-producing wells we do have online continue to perform better than expected during the first quarter. A significant planning effort is underway for a larger program in 2011. At this point, I'm going to turn the call back over to Vince to open it up for Q&A."

It's not there today, but I can certainly envision that some time in the future. And I'd just emphasize, not so much on acquisitions because of the leases that a lot of companies bought. But if you look at the underlying leases that some of these leases are letting go, that could be an opportunity."

Welcome to Devon's Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I will begin with some housekeeping items as usual and then I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, John Richels for his overview. Following John's remarks, Dave Hager, our Head of Exploration and Production will provide an operations update. And then finally, after Dave's comment, Jeff Agosta, our Chief Financial Officer, will review Devon's financial results and our outlook. At that point, we'll open it up to Q&A. 
I want to point out that our Chairman, Larry Nichols, and other seniors members of the management team are with us today as well for the Q&A session. And as a reminder, we will ask each of you in the Q&A session to limit your questions to one and one follow-up. We'll keep the call to an hour, so if we don't get to your question, we'll be around the rest of the day to answer any questions you may have remaining.
A replay of this call will be available today through a link on Devon's homepage. During the call today, we will update some of our forward-looking estimates based on the actual results for the first half of the year and our revised outlook for the second half of 2010. In addition to the updates that we're going to provide in the call, we will find an 8-K later today that will have the details of our updated 2010 guidance. And the Guidance section of our Web site at devonenergy.com will also have the updated forward-looking information. That information is under the Guidance link found within the Investor Relations section of the Web site.
Before we get to the discussion of the quarter, we're obligated to remind you that this discussion will contain information of our expectations, plans, forecasts, estimates; all of this is considered forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law. And while we strive to give you the very best estimates possible, there are many factors that could cause our actual results to differ from the guidance that we're going to provide. And so we would encourage you to review the discussion of risk factors that can be found in the 8-K that we are filing today.
One other compliance item: We will refer to various non-GAAP performance measures in today's call. When we use these measures, we're required to provide additional disclosures under U.S. securities law. If you would like to review those disclosures, they are available on our Web site. I also want to remind everybody that the strategic repositioning that we are currently in the midst of affects the financial and operational data for all periods reported. Our decision to divest the international operations resulted in the related production being excluded from our reported production volumes for all periods presented. The revenues and expenses associated with those international operations are collapsed into a single line item at the end of our statement of operations labeled discontinued operations.
Conversely, while we have divested all of our assets and operations in the Gulf of Mexico, oddly enough, the Gulf results are required to be reported in our results from continuing operations through the close of the sales. Said another way, the results from continuing operations reported today include both our North American Onshore assets that we are retaining and the results from our divested Gulf of Mexico operations through the date of the closing of those sales.
Most of our comments today on the call will focus on the results from continuing operations but we will also provide some additional commentary, specifically referencing our North American Onshore results and we provided the information on the press release that enables you to isolate those results so that you can see what our go-forward business will look like.
For those interested in a more detailed review of our international results, we've also provided information in today's press release regarding that. As far as the straight earnings forecast go, most analysts reporting estimates to First Call have excluded discontinued operations. The mean estimate of those analysts, that is the mean estimate for earnings excluding discontinued operations, was $1.39 for the quarter. Our adjusted earnings came in $0.05 lower at $1.34 per share. Main driver was higher-than-expected deferred tax rate in the second quarter. Second quarter included a true up in deferred taxes for the first six months of the year.
This non-cash deferred tax expense did not affect our cash flow in the second quarter. And after the adjusting items, cash flow from continuing operations came in at $3.02 per share, which was above the First Call estimate of $2.80 per share. With those items out of the way, I'm going to turn the call over to John Richels."

The second quarter was another very solid quarter for Devon. Second quarter production from retained properties, that is our North American Onshore properties, exceeded our guidance growing to about 620,000 Boe p",1265,"Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter was another very solid quarter for Devon. Second quarter production from retained properties, that is our North American Onshore properties, exceeded our guidance growing to about 620,000 Boe per day, and that's up nearly 6% over the first quarter of 2010.
With the better-than-expected performance from our retained properties, we’re raising our 2010 production guidance for our retained properties by 2 million to 3 million barrels to a revised range of 223 million and 224 million barrels equivalent.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter. That's a 40% increase over the second quarter of 2009. And second quarter net earnings were more than double that of the prior year coming in at $706 million, or $685 million after adjusting items. And finally, our Marketing and Midstream business delivered another solid quarter, generating $125 million in operating profits.
Perhaps equally important is the progress we made during the second quarter with the strategic repositioning that we announced last November. In the second quarter, we completed our exit from the Gulf of Mexico and finalized our sale of the Panyu field in China. To date, we’ve received aggregate pretax proceeds of approximately $4.6 billion. The remaining $5.3 billion of signed transactions yet to close consists of our divestitures in Azerbaijan and Brazil and our remaining assets in China.
Last week, we received the necessary approvals for the $2 billion sale of our interest in the ACG [Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli] field in Azerbaijan to BP and the closing of that transaction is now scheduled for August the 16. In Brazil, the sale to BP continues to move through the multi-layer approval process of the Brazilian government and we remain on track to close that around year end.
Aggregate proceeds from the divestitures will approximate $10 billion, or roughly $8 billion after-tax, and this is well above the $4.5 billion to $7.5 billion of after-tax net proceeds that we expected when we announced our repositioning last November. As we've always said, our objective is to redeploy our capital through the combination of the E&P projects, share repurchases and debt repayment that optimizes growth on a per-debt adjusted share basis. Year-to-date, we've reduced our debt balances by some $1.7 billion, which includes the repayment of all of our commercial paper balances and $350 million of senior notes.
In addition to repaying debt, we've been active with our share repurchase program that was announced in early May. During May and June, we repurchased 7.6 million common shares at a cost of $495 million. And if you include the shares we purchased in July, we now have purchased 11.9 million shares at a cost of $761 million. This represents nearly 3% of our outstanding shares. At this pace, we're well on track to complete the entire $3.5 billion share repurchase initiative within the 12- to 18-month timeframe we initially expected.
As we indicated when we announced the strategic repositioning last November, we're also investing a portion of the divestiture proceeds in our go-forward North American Onshore business. As part of the asset sales to BP, we announced that we were applying $500 million of the sales proceeds to purchase 50% of BP's interest in the Kirby oil sands leases, which are immediately adjacent to our highly successful Jackfish project. We finalized the joint venture agreement with BP during the second quarter and we changed the name from Kirby to Pike just to avoid confusion with some other industry projects in the Kirby area. This acquisition substantially increases our footprint in SAGD [Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage] oil and extends Devon's visible growth in SAGD oil production for the remainder of the decade.
Dave will talk more about the activity that we have planned at Pike later on in the call. We're also investing a portion of the divestiture proceeds to deepen our oil and our liquids-rich gas inventory North America. In fact, for the year 2010, we have leased or are in the process of leasing more than 450,000 net acres in oil or condensate-rich plays in addition to the Kirby-Pike acreage. Almost half of this acreage lies in the Permian Basin, where we have leased 58,000 additional net acres in our Wolfberry oil play, 115,000 additional net acres in the Avalon Shale play and 19,000 additional acres in the third Bone Spring play. The balance of the acreage is in oil plays in the Permian Basin and elsewhere that we won't be ready to talk about until we’ve completed our leasing programs.
During the second quarter, we are also leasing additional acreage in the Cana play. Recently, we entered into agreements to acquire about 50,000 additional net acres in the liquids-rich portion of the Cana. This brings our position in the Cana to roughly 230,000 net acres, representing many years of drilling inventory. As many of you know, some industry observers have characterized our Cana play in Western Oklahoma as one of the most economic shale plays in North America. The liquids-rich portion of the play offers a significant oil or condensate component, as well as natural gas liquids.
When we entered the year, we expected our 2010 E&P capital including expenditures associated with the divestitures assets to total about $5.6 billion. Originally, you might recall we expected to spend $1.5 billion of this budget on the assets being divested. However, the faster-than-expected progress with the Gulf divestitures and our upcoming close of the sale of ACG has allowed us to redirect about $800 million of that capital to Onshore North America, primarily for the new resource capture in the areas that I just covered.
In addition, we've allocated roughly $200 million of the divestiture proceeds to our 2010 capital budget. That brings our 2010 E&P capital budget to $5.8 billion, including the $700 million of capital that we're spending this year on the divestiture properties. Of course, this does not include the $500 million Kirby-Pike acquisition, which was done as part of the BP transaction. 
It's worth noting that while the $700 million of capital associated with the divestiture properties will be reported as capital spending by Devon in 2010, the terms of the purchase and sale agreements allow us to recover that capital from the purchasers in the form of purchase price adjustments.
When we analyzed our 2010 North American Onshore E&P capital spend in terms of product mix, roughly 80% is focused on crude oil, condensate and liquids-rich projects. Of this 80%, roughly half is focused on crude oil and condensate projects and the other half is focused on projects where natural gas liquids production is the dominant driver of the economic. The balance, that is the remaining 20% of our budget, is largely focused on securing term acreage or de-risking natural gas plays in our existing portfolio.
When you step back and view the repositioning of the company as a whole, following the close of the pending asset sales, we will have sold roughly 10% of Devon's crude reserves and production with after-tax proceeds from these divestitures exceeding 20% of our enterprise value. Assuming completion of the balance of the share repurchase program at today's stock price, we will have reduced our share count by 12%, while significantly strengthening our balance sheet and deepening our inventory in some of the highest margin oil, condensate and liquids-rich gas plays in North America. This puts us in an extremely competitive position for the future regardless of the macro environment.
With that, I'll turn the call over to David Hager for a review of our quarterly operating highlights. David?"

Capital expenditures for exploration and development from our North American Onshore operations were $1.1 billion for the second quarter, bringing our total through the first six months to $2.1 billion, excluding the Kirby-Pike acquisition. This level of activity increased second quarter production from retained properties by 6% over the previous quarter and 8% over the fourth quarter of 2009.
Moving now to our quarterly operations highlights, in our 100% Devon-owned Jackfish thermal oil project in Eastern Alberta, our second quarter daily production averaged a little over 29,000 barrels per day net of royalties. Following the close of the quarter on July 10, we had a minor wellhead release of steam and bitumen. A small hole in the wellhead likely caused by sand erosion resulted in the release. Cleanup is about 90% complete and we expect to finish it in the next couple of weeks.
Our technical team has completed an ultrasonic testing of all the Jackfish wellheads and determined that the issue is isolated to the three wellheads on one pad. We will be making the necessary modifications to the wellheads, and subject to regulatory approval, expect to bring the effective pad back on stream in the next couple of weeks. The production impact from the incident is minimal – about 5,000 barrels per day while the pad is offline. However, third and fourth quarter Jackfish production will be impacted by a plant turnaround scheduled to begin in September. Accordingly, our net Jackfish production is expected to average about 23,000 barrels per day for the second half of 2010.
With construction of Jackfish 2 roughly 85% complete, the project is about $100 million under budget and remains on schedule for first oil in late 2011. We expect total project costs through startup for Jackfish 2 to come in below the industry average at approximately $30,000 per flowing barrel. For Jackfish 3, we expect to file the regulatory application in the next few weeks. Pending regulatory approval and formal sanctioning, we could begin site work by late 2011 with plant startup targeted for late 2014. I will remind you that Devon has a 100% working interest in each of these three Jackfish projects.
At Kirby-Pike, this is our 50-50 SAGD joint venture with BP that Devon operates. We estimate gross recoverable resources there of up to 1.5 billion barrels. To determine the optimal number of development phases needed, we will initiate a drilling program and begin shooting 3D seismic over the Kirby-Pike acreage later this year. With the addition of Kirby or Pike to Jackfish, we expect to grow our net SAGD production to 150,000 to 175,000 barrels per day by 2020.
In our Lloydminster oil play in Alberta, we drilled 14 new wells in the second quarter. Lloydminster production averaged 41,000 barrels equivalent per day in the quarter, a 4% increase over the first quarter. 
Moving to the Permian Basin, as John mentioned earlier, we have been actively acquiring acreage in several of our key oil plays. In our Wolfberry light oil play in West Texas, we have added 58,000 net acres since the beginning of the year and now have 200,000 prospective net acres in the play. We have four operated rigs running and drilled 26 wells during the second quarter. The second quarter activity included our best well to date in the play, the Helen Crump B, 11 came online, flowing over 500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. While we are still in the early stages of evaluating our large Wolfberry acreage position, results to date have been encouraging.
Also in the Permian Basin, we have been building a position in the Avalon Shale play. To date, we have assembled 235,000 perspective net acres in this condensate- and liquids-rich gas play. Although we are still in the early evaluation of the play, initial drilling results indicate an attractive, repeatable play with outstanding economics. The best wells we have drilled to date have IP-ed at over 500 barrels of condensate per day, 500 barrels of NGLs per day and 3 million to 5 million cubic feet per day of gas. Well costs in the play run between $3.3 million and $4 million. We expect Avalon wells to have average IPs of 300 barrels of condensate per day, 300 barrels of NGLs per day and 2 million cubic feet of gas per day in the heart of the play. We expect per-well recoveries to average over 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent. These characteristics give the Avalon Shale great return potential. We expect to participate in 32 Avalon wells this year, including 20 that we will operate.
Although we have not talked much about our Granite Wash position in the past, we delivered some very encouraging results there during the second quarter. We brought two Devon-operated Granite Wash wells online with an average 24-hour IP of 29 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including  585 barrels of oil or condensate and 1,330 barrels of NGLs. With the recent success in both the Cherokee and Granite Wash A sands, we are stepping up our activity in the area. We currently have two rigs running in the play and plan to add a third rig that we will move from the Barnett later this month. We have an inventory of about 150 Cherokee and Granite Wash A locations and 200 additional undrilled locations and other Granite Wash formations. Since we hold our position in the Granite Wash with existing production, we are under no pressure to drill. However, given the attractive rate of returns generated by these wells in this environment, we are reallocating capital to this play. We now plan to drill 16 Granite Wash wells this year.
Moving to the Cana-Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma, as John indicated, we are in the process of acquiring a significant amount of additional acreage in this play. Most of this new acreage is primarily term and located in the liquids-rich portion of the play. We are currently running nine operated rigs and will bring additional rigs into the play over the next few months to secure this term acreage.
We continue to see outstanding results from Cana and believe that the field offers some of the best economics among gas plays in North American shale. In the second quarter, we brought 10 operated wells online with average 24-hour IP rates of 6.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 86 barrels of condensate and 350 barrels per day of NGLs. 
Second quarter net production from Cana averaged a record 105 million cubic feet of equivalent per day, included in 1,000 barrels per day of condensate and 3,000 barrels of NGLs. This was up 43% on a sequential-quarter basis.
Earlier this year, we initiated an in-field [ph] pilot program at Cana to help us better understand optimal well spacing. This was a joint project with another operator that consists of nine total horizontal wells being drilled and completed within one square mile. Five of these wells were spaced at 500 feet apart and the other four wells at 660 feet apart. Excluding the first well in the section that had been producing for some time, the average 30-day IP from the eight new wells was 5.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 46 barrels of condensate per day and 245 barrels of NGLs per day. These results are encouraging. We will continue to monitor the performance from these wells to determine if the results support this reduced well spacing.
Moving to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas, we are currently running 17 Devon-operated rigs. But as I mentioned, we'll be moving one of these rigs to the Granite Wash later this month. But we plan to run the remaining 16 rigs in the Barnett for the rest of 2010. We continue to be very selective with our Barnett drilling, focusing our activity in the liquids-rich areas. Our net production in the Barnett exceeded 1.1 Bcf equivalent per day, including 39,000 barrels per day of NGLs and condensate. Although hidden by the rounding, the second quarter daily rate was up 3% from the first quarter. We continue to expect our Barnett production to reach our previous record production of 1.2 Bcf equivalent per day during the third quarter. 
Shifting to the Haynesville Shale, after de-risking much of our held-by production acreage in the Carthage area during 2009, our 2010 activity has focused on our term acreage in the southern area. In addition to the Haynesville potential, we are evaluating the southern acreage for Bossier Shale and James Lime potential.
In San Augustine County, we brought our first Bossier Shale well online in the second quarter with a 24-hour IP of about 8 million cubic feet per day. In Southern Shelby County, the Haynesville Motley #1H was brought online at more than 7 cubic feet per day. To help secure our acreage in the southern area, we have begun farming in industry partners on a promoted basis on some of our term acreage. Given the service cost environment in the Haynesville and a deep inventory of other attractive opportunities in our portfolio, we believe this is the most prudent path to take.
And finally, in the Horn River Basin of Northern British Columbia, we continue to methodically secure our 170,000 net acres with drilling. We have drilled but not yet completed four of the seven planned horizontal wells for this year. We plan to bring these four new wells on to production by year end and the remaining three in the first quarter of 2011. Our producing wells at Horn River continue to perform very well, supporting an EUR [estimated ultimately recoverable] of 7 to 8 Bcf equivalent per well. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?"

Today, I will take you through a brief review of the key drivers that affected our second quarter financial results and provide our outlook for the second half of the year. As Vince mentioned earlier we have recla",1320,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will take you through a brief review of the key drivers that affected our second quarter financial results and provide our outlook for the second half of the year. As Vince mentioned earlier we have reclassified the assets, liabilities and results of operations from our international assets into discontinued operations for all accounting periods presented. As a result, most of my comments will focus on our reported continuing operations. Our reported results from continuing ops include both our retained North American Onshore assets and a partial quarter's result from our Gulf of Mexico operations that we exited during the second quarter. 
Looking first at production, in the second quarter of 2010, Devon produced 58.5 million barrels of oil equivalent from continuing ops, or approximately 643,000 Boe per day. Excluding volumes from the Gulf, our retained North American Onshore properties produced 620,000 Boe per day. This exceeded the high end of the guidance range provided during last quarter's conference call by roughly 15,000 Boe per day, about 9,000 of which was attributable to a favorable royalty adjustment on a natural gas production in Canada related to prior periods. The balance of the production beat is due to better-than-expected results from both the U.S. Onshore business and Canada.
Based on our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the second half of the year, we now expect full year production from our North American Onshore properties to climb to between 223 million and 224 million barrels of oil equivalent. We expect our production to range between 610,000 and 620,000 Boe per day in the third quarter, and 625,000 and 635,000 Boe per day in the fourth quarter.
The midpoint of our third quarter estimate reflects an increase in sequential quarter production after adjusting the second quarter for the out-of-period royalty adjustment that we reported.
Moving to price realizations, in the second quarter, the WTI Oil Index remains strong, averaging $78.16 per barrel. That is a 31% increase from the second quarter of 2009. During the quarter, regional differentials widened compared to the first quarter, especially with our heavier crudes in Canada. However, our second quarter oil price realizations were right in line with the midpoint of our guidance at 80% of WTI, or $62.35 per barrel.
For the third quarter, we expect our oil price realizations to approximate 95% of WTI for the U.S. and 70% for Canada. In the second half of 2010, we have 79,000 barrels per day, or roughly 70% of our expected oil production, hedged with an average floor of $67.47 and an average ceiling of $96.48 per barrel. Looking ahead to 2011, we have collars in place for 33,000 barrels per day with floors of $75 and average ceiling of $109 per barrel.
On the natural gas side, the second quarter Henry Hub Index averaged $4.09 per Mcf. Our company-wide gas price realizations before the impact of hedges were 89% of Henry Hub, or $3.62 per Mcf. In the second quarter, we had 61% of our natural gas production hedged with a weighted average protected price of $5.82. Cash settlements from this hedging position boosted our average realization by $1.06 per Mcf, bringing the second quarter price up to $4.68. For the remainder of 2010, our natural gas hedging position will continue to protect roughly 60% of gas production at an average price of $5.98 in the third quarter and $5.87 in the fourth quarter. For 2011, thus far, we have entered into price swap hedges totaling 225 million cubic feet per day at an average price of $5.54 per Mcf. Later this year, we expect to add to our 2011 hedge position.
Looking briefly at NGLs, our price per barrel in the second quarter averaged $30.90, or about 40%  of WTI. We expect third quarter realizations to be similar to the second quarter. Seasonal factors should improve NGL realization somewhat in Q4. However, supply growth in the U.S. could put negative pressure on NGL prices over the longer-term.
Shifting now to expenses, second quarter lease operating expense came in at $442 million. This equates to $7.56 per barrel, or 2% higher than the first quarter of this year. Looking ahead to the second half, with higher-cost Gulf properties now divested, we anticipate LOE will decline to between $7.20 and $7.50 per Boe.
For the second quarter, our DD&A expense for oil and gas properties came in at $7.28 a barrel, a 5% decline from last quarter. Overall, our DD&A rate benefited from the sale of our Gulf assets, which lowered our depletion base. For the remainder of 2010, we are forecasting that DD&A expense will be between $6.90 and $7.20 per Boe.
Moving on to G&A expense, we continued to reduce G&A expenditures in the most recent quarter. Second quarter G&A was $130 million, or 25% lower than the year-ago quarter. For the first half of the year, G&A declined by nearly $70 million when compared to 2009. This reduction is largely attributable to lower personnel costs and efficiencies realized through our strategic repositioning. Based on the positive results for the first two quarters of 2010, we are now lowering the top end of our full-year guidance by $20 million. Our new full-year estimate for G&A is a range of $580 million to $600 million.
Looking at interest expense, we reported $111 million for the second quarter. Of that expense, $19 million resulted from the early retirement of the $350 million of 7.25% senior notes, which we redeemed in June. Excluding this one-time charge, second quarter interest expense totaled $92 million. For the remainder of 2010, we expect interest expense to decline to a range of $80 million to $85 million per quarter.
Looking at income taxes, our reported second quarter income tax expense from continuing operations came in at $261 million. This implies a 43% tax rate on $613 million of pretax income of from continuing ops. The most significant item that influenced our quarterly tax rate was a non-cash $52 million charge related to the expected repatriation of foreign earnings. Additionally, a non-recurring taxable gain on the sale of our Gulf assets affected our current and deferred tax allocation for the quarter. This gain on sale shifted $622 million of second quarter tax expense from deferred into current.
When you back out the impact of all the unusual items that are generally excluded from analyst estimates, you've get an adjusted tax rate for the second quarter of 35%. This rate on non-GAAP earnings includes a true-up adjustment to bring the year-to-date tax rate up to the 30% we now expect for the full year. In today's news release, we provided a table that reconciles the effective items that are generally excluded from analyst estimates.
Going to the bottom line, earnings from continuing ops adjusted for special items came in at $597 million, or $1.34 per diluted share. Operating cash flow from continuing ops totaled $1.3 billion for the second quarter, a 40% increase over the second quarter of 2009. In addition to our operating cash flow, we also received $3.3 billion of pretax cash proceeds from the closing of divestitures in the Gulf and China. We utilized these sources of cash to repurchase for $495 million of common stock, reduce debt balances by $461 million and fund all of our capital demands, including the $500 million acquisition of 50% of BPs interest in Kirby-Pike.
We ended the quarter with cash on hand of nearly $3 billion in a net debt to adjusted cap ratio at a multi-year low of only 14%. Overall, we are extremely well-positioned to continue to operate our business from a position of considerable financial strength.
Continuing to execute on the plan we announced last November, positions us for strong growth per debt adjusted share in 2011 and beyond. At this point, I will turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A."

Obviously, we’re going to enter a busy winter with our additional strut drilling and 3D seismic we’re going to do out there, as well some engineering work. But given all that, I can give you kind of a rough and tentative timetable. Provided that we have adequate reservoir delineation through this winter’s drilling program, we could have an application for the first phase of Pike somewhere in late 2011. Now how large that phase is has not yet been determined and it will depend somewhat on the results with this winter's drilling program. But then with that, you might have regulatory approval somewhere in early 2013, and then you could begin facilities construction, have first team somewhere around mid-2015 and potentially reaching peak production probably on that first phase somewhere in late 2016. All of that’s a tentative schedule and have a lot of work to go yet to know if we can accomplish that. But again, that’d be the first phase, and whether the first phase is 35,000 barrels a day or 70,000 barrels a day or something like that, we don't know yet. We have to do the work this winter and that will give us a lot better handle on that."

Historically, we've tried to stay somewhere between 40% and 50% on long-term rigs. The bigger issue is really the cost has to do with the frac-ing costs. And those costs went up significantly. And while they started being played high in the Eagle Ford and the Haynesville, that has certainly progressed to the rest of the country now. Our experience has been in dealing with these people that providing services that they don't want to lock in any long-term projects unless it’s at a real premium price.

Welcome to Devon's Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I will begin with some housekeeping items as usual and then I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, John Richels for his overview.",797,"Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Devon's Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I will begin with some housekeeping items as usual and then I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, John Richels for his overview. Following John's remarks, Dave Hager, our Head of Exploration and Production will provide an operations update. And then finally, after Dave's comment, Jeff Agosta, our Chief Financial Officer, will review Devon's financial results and our outlook. At that point, we'll open it up to Q&A. 
I want to point out that our Chairman, Larry Nichols, and other seniors members of the management team are with us today as well for the Q&A session. And as a reminder, we will ask each of you in the Q&A session to limit your questions to one and one follow-up. We'll keep the call to an hour, so if we don't get to your question, we'll be around the rest of the day to answer any questions you may have remaining.
A replay of this call will be available today through a link on Devon's homepage. During the call today, we will update some of our forward-looking estimates based on the actual results for the first half of the year and our revised outlook for the second half of 2010. In addition to the updates that we're going to provide in the call, we will find an 8-K later today that will have the details of our updated 2010 guidance. And the Guidance section of our Web site at devonenergy.com will also have the updated forward-looking information. That information is under the Guidance link found within the Investor Relations section of the Web site.
Before we get to the discussion of the quarter, we're obligated to remind you that this discussion will contain information of our expectations, plans, forecasts, estimates; all of this is considered forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law. And while we strive to give you the very best estimates possible, there are many factors that could cause our actual results to differ from the guidance that we're going to provide. And so we would encourage you to review the discussion of risk factors that can be found in the 8-K that we are filing today.
One other compliance item: We will refer to various non-GAAP performance measures in today's call. When we use these measures, we're required to provide additional disclosures under U.S. securities law. If you would like to review those disclosures, they are available on our Web site. I also want to remind everybody that the strategic repositioning that we are currently in the midst of affects the financial and operational data for all periods reported. Our decision to divest the international operations resulted in the related production being excluded from our reported production volumes for all periods presented. The revenues and expenses associated with those international operations are collapsed into a single line item at the end of our statement of operations labeled discontinued operations.
Conversely, while we have divested all of our assets and operations in the Gulf of Mexico, oddly enough, the Gulf results are required to be reported in our results from continuing operations through the close of the sales. Said another way, the results from continuing operations reported today include both our North American Onshore assets that we are retaining and the results from our divested Gulf of Mexico operations through the date of the closing of those sales.
Most of our comments today on the call will focus on the results from continuing operations but we will also provide some additional commentary, specifically referencing our North American Onshore results and we provided the information on the press release that enables you to isolate those results so that you can see what our go-forward business will look like.
For those interested in a more detailed review of our international results, we've also provided information in today's press release regarding that. As far as the straight earnings forecast go, most analysts reporting estimates to First Call have excluded discontinued operations. The mean estimate of those analysts, that is the mean estimate for earnings excluding discontinued operations, was $1.39 for the quarter. Our adjusted earnings came in $0.05 lower at $1.34 per share. Main driver was higher-than-expected deferred tax rate in the second quarter. Second quarter included a true up in deferred taxes for the first six months of the year.
This non-cash deferred tax expense did not affect our cash flow in the second quarter. And after the adjusting items, cash flow from continuing operations came in at $3.02 per share, which was above the First Call estimate of $2.80 per share. With those items out of the way, I'm going to turn the call over to John Richels.

The second quarter was another very solid quarter for Devon. Second quarter production from retained properties, that is our North American Onshore properties, exceeded our guidance growing to about 620,000 Boe p",1265,"Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter was another very solid quarter for Devon. Second quarter production from retained properties, that is our North American Onshore properties, exceeded our guidance growing to about 620,000 Boe per day, and that's up nearly 6% over the first quarter of 2010.
With the better-than-expected performance from our retained properties, we’re raising our 2010 production guidance for our retained properties by 2 million to 3 million barrels to a revised range of 223 million and 224 million barrels equivalent.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter. That's a 40% increase over the second quarter of 2009. And second quarter net earnings were more than double that of the prior year coming in at $706 million, or $685 million after adjusting items. And finally, our Marketing and Midstream business delivered another solid quarter, generating $125 million in operating profits.
Perhaps equally important is the progress we made during the second quarter with the strategic repositioning that we announced last November. In the second quarter, we completed our exit from the Gulf of Mexico and finalized our sale of the Panyu field in China. To date, we’ve received aggregate pretax proceeds of approximately $4.6 billion. The remaining $5.3 billion of signed transactions yet to close consists of our divestitures in Azerbaijan and Brazil and our remaining assets in China.
Last week, we received the necessary approvals for the $2 billion sale of our interest in the ACG [Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli] field in Azerbaijan to BP and the closing of that transaction is now scheduled for August the 16. In Brazil, the sale to BP continues to move through the multi-layer approval process of the Brazilian government and we remain on track to close that around year end.
Aggregate proceeds from the divestitures will approximate $10 billion, or roughly $8 billion after-tax, and this is well above the $4.5 billion to $7.5 billion of after-tax net proceeds that we expected when we announced our repositioning last November. As we've always said, our objective is to redeploy our capital through the combination of the E&P projects, share repurchases and debt repayment that optimizes growth on a per-debt adjusted share basis. Year-to-date, we've reduced our debt balances by some $1.7 billion, which includes the repayment of all of our commercial paper balances and $350 million of senior notes.
In addition to repaying debt, we've been active with our share repurchase program that was announced in early May. During May and June, we repurchased 7.6 million common shares at a cost of $495 million. And if you include the shares we purchased in July, we now have purchased 11.9 million shares at a cost of $761 million. This represents nearly 3% of our outstanding shares. At this pace, we're well on track to complete the entire $3.5 billion share repurchase initiative within the 12- to 18-month timeframe we initially expected.
As we indicated when we announced the strategic repositioning last November, we're also investing a portion of the divestiture proceeds in our go-forward North American Onshore business. As part of the asset sales to BP, we announced that we were applying $500 million of the sales proceeds to purchase 50% of BP's interest in the Kirby oil sands leases, which are immediately adjacent to our highly successful Jackfish project. We finalized the joint venture agreement with BP during the second quarter and we changed the name from Kirby to Pike just to avoid confusion with some other industry projects in the Kirby area. This acquisition substantially increases our footprint in SAGD [Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage] oil and extends Devon's visible growth in SAGD oil production for the remainder of the decade.
Dave will talk more about the activity that we have planned at Pike later on in the call. We're also investing a portion of the divestiture proceeds to deepen our oil and our liquids-rich gas inventory North America. In fact, for the year 2010, we have leased or are in the process of leasing more than 450,000 net acres in oil or condensate-rich plays in addition to the Kirby-Pike acreage. Almost half of this acreage lies in the Permian Basin, where we have leased 58,000 additional net acres in our Wolfberry oil play, 115,000 additional net acres in the Avalon Shale play and 19,000 additional acres in the third Bone Spring play. The balance of the acreage is in oil plays in the Permian Basin and elsewhere that we won't be ready to talk about until we’ve completed our leasing programs.
During the second quarter, we are also leasing additional acreage in the Cana play. Recently, we entered into agreements to acquire about 50,000 additional net acres in the liquids-rich portion of the Cana. This brings our position in the Cana to roughly 230,000 net acres, representing many years of drilling inventory. As many of you know, some industry observers have characterized our Cana play in Western Oklahoma as one of the most economic shale plays in North America. The liquids-rich portion of the play offers a significant oil or condensate component, as well as natural gas liquids.
When we entered the year, we expected our 2010 E&P capital including expenditures associated with the divestitures assets to total about $5.6 billion. Originally, you might recall we expected to spend $1.5 billion of this budget on the assets being divested. However, the faster-than-expected progress with the Gulf divestitures and our upcoming close of the sale of ACG has allowed us to redirect about $800 million of that capital to Onshore North America, primarily for the new resource capture in the areas that I just covered.
In addition, we've allocated roughly $200 million of the divestiture proceeds to our 2010 capital budget. That brings our 2010 E&P capital budget to $5.8 billion, including the $700 million of capital that we're spending this year on the divestiture properties. Of course, this does not include the $500 million Kirby-Pike acquisition, which was done as part of the BP transaction. 
It's worth noting that while the $700 million of capital associated with the divestiture properties will be reported as capital spending by Devon in 2010, the terms of the purchase and sale agreements allow us to recover that capital from the purchasers in the form of purchase price adjustments.
When we analyzed our 2010 North American Onshore E&P capital spend in terms of product mix, roughly 80% is focused on crude oil, condensate and liquids-rich projects. Of this 80%, roughly half is focused on crude oil and condensate projects and the other half is focused on projects where natural gas liquids production is the dominant driver of the economic. The balance, that is the remaining 20% of our budget, is largely focused on securing term acreage or de-risking natural gas plays in our existing portfolio.
When you step back and view the repositioning of the company as a whole, following the close of the pending asset sales, we will have sold roughly 10% of Devon's crude reserves and production with after-tax proceeds from these divestitures exceeding 20% of our enterprise value. Assuming completion of the balance of the share repurchase program at today's stock price, we will have reduced our share count by 12%, while significantly strengthening our balance sheet and deepening our inventory in some of the highest margin oil, condensate and liquids-rich gas plays in North America. This puts us in an extremely competitive position for the future regardless of the macro environment.
With that, I'll turn the call over to David Hager for a review of our quarterly operating highlights. David?

I'll begin with a quick recap of the company-wide drilling activity. We exited the second quarter with 65 Devon-operated rigs running. During the second quarter, we drilled 315 wells, including 306 development wells a",1682,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a quick recap of the company-wide drilling activity. We exited the second quarter with 65 Devon-operated rigs running. During the second quarter, we drilled 315 wells, including 306 development wells and nine exploration wells. All of these wells were successful.
Capital expenditures for exploration and development from our North American Onshore operations were $1.1 billion for the second quarter, bringing our total through the first six months to $2.1 billion, excluding the Kirby-Pike acquisition. This level of activity increased second quarter production from retained properties by 6% over the previous quarter and 8% over the fourth quarter of 2009.
Moving now to our quarterly operations highlights, in our 100% Devon-owned Jackfish thermal oil project in Eastern Alberta, our second quarter daily production averaged a little over 29,000 barrels per day net of royalties. Following the close of the quarter on July 10, we had a minor wellhead release of steam and bitumen. A small hole in the wellhead likely caused by sand erosion resulted in the release. Cleanup is about 90% complete and we expect to finish it in the next couple of weeks.
Our technical team has completed an ultrasonic testing of all the Jackfish wellheads and determined that the issue is isolated to the three wellheads on one pad. We will be making the necessary modifications to the wellheads, and subject to regulatory approval, expect to bring the effective pad back on stream in the next couple of weeks. The production impact from the incident is minimal - about 5,000 barrels per day while the pad is offline. However, third and fourth quarter Jackfish production will be impacted by a plant turnaround scheduled to begin in September. Accordingly, our net Jackfish production is expected to average about 23,000 barrels per day for the second half of 2010.
With construction of Jackfish 2 roughly 85% complete, the project is about $100 million under budget and remains on schedule for first oil in late 2011. We expect total project costs through startup for Jackfish 2 to come in below the industry average at approximately $30,000 per flowing barrel. For Jackfish 3, we expect to file the regulatory application in the next few weeks. Pending regulatory approval and formal sanctioning, we could begin site work by late 2011 with plant startup targeted for late 2014. I will remind you that Devon has a 100% working interest in each of these three Jackfish projects.
At Kirby-Pike, this is our 50-50 SAGD joint venture with BP that Devon operates. We estimate gross recoverable resources there of up to 1.5 billion barrels. To determine the optimal number of development phases needed, we will initiate a drilling program and begin shooting 3D seismic over the Kirby-Pike acreage later this year. With the addition of Kirby or Pike to Jackfish, we expect to grow our net SAGD production to 150,000 to 175,000 barrels per day by 2020.
In our Lloydminster oil play in Alberta, we drilled 14 new wells in the second quarter. Lloydminster production averaged 41,000 barrels equivalent per day in the quarter, a 4% increase over the first quarter. 
Moving to the Permian Basin, as John mentioned earlier, we have been actively acquiring acreage in several of our key oil plays. In our Wolfberry light oil play in West Texas, we have added 58,000 net acres since the beginning of the year and now have 200,000 prospective net acres in the play. We have four operated rigs running and drilled 26 wells during the second quarter. The second quarter activity included our best well to date in the play, the Helen Crump B, 11 came online, flowing over 500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. While we are still in the early stages of evaluating our large Wolfberry acreage position, results to date have been encouraging.
Also in the Permian Basin, we have been building a position in the Avalon Shale play. To date, we have assembled 235,000 perspective net acres in this condensate- and liquids-rich gas play. Although we are still in the early evaluation of the play, initial drilling results indicate an attractive, repeatable play with outstanding economics. The best wells we have drilled to date have IP-ed at over 500 barrels of condensate per day, 500 barrels of NGLs per day and 3 million to 5 million cubic feet per day of gas. Well costs in the play run between $3.3 million and $4 million. We expect Avalon wells to have average IPs of 300 barrels of condensate per day, 300 barrels of NGLs per day and 2 million cubic feet of gas per day in the heart of the play. We expect per-well recoveries to average over 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent. These characteristics give the Avalon Shale great return potential. We expect to participate in 32 Avalon wells this year, including 20 that we will operate.
Although we have not talked much about our Granite Wash position in the past, we delivered some very encouraging results there during the second quarter. We brought two Devon-operated Granite Wash wells online with an average 24-hour IP of 29 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including  585 barrels of oil or condensate and 1,330 barrels of NGLs. With the recent success in both the Cherokee and Granite Wash A sands, we are stepping up our activity in the area. We currently have two rigs running in the play and plan to add a third rig that we will move from the Barnett later this month. We have an inventory of about 150 Cherokee and Granite Wash A locations and 200 additional undrilled locations and other Granite Wash formations. Since we hold our position in the Granite Wash with existing production, we are under no pressure to drill. However, given the attractive rate of returns generated by these wells in this environment, we are reallocating capital to this play. We now plan to drill 16 Granite Wash wells this year.
Moving to the Cana-Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma, as John indicated, we are in the process of acquiring a significant amount of additional acreage in this play. Most of this new acreage is primarily term and located in the liquids-rich portion of the play. We are currently running nine operated rigs and will bring additional rigs into the play over the next few months to secure this term acreage.
We continue to see outstanding results from Cana and believe that the field offers some of the best economics among gas plays in North American shale. In the second quarter, we brought 10 operated wells online with average 24-hour IP rates of 6.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 86 barrels of condensate and 350 barrels per day of NGLs. 
Second quarter net production from Cana averaged a record 105 million cubic feet of equivalent per day, included in 1,000 barrels per day of condensate and 3,000 barrels of NGLs. This was up 43% on a sequential-quarter basis.
Earlier this year, we initiated an in-field [ph] pilot program at Cana to help us better understand optimal well spacing. This was a joint project with another operator that consists of nine total horizontal wells being drilled and completed within one square mile. Five of these wells were spaced at 500 feet apart and the other four wells at 660 feet apart. Excluding the first well in the section that had been producing for some time, the average 30-day IP from the eight new wells was 5.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 46 barrels of condensate per day and 245 barrels of NGLs per day. These results are encouraging. We will continue to monitor the performance from these wells to determine if the results support this reduced well spacing.
Moving to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas, we are currently running 17 Devon-operated rigs. But as I mentioned, we'll be moving one of these rigs to the Granite Wash later this month. But we plan to run the remaining 16 rigs in the Barnett for the rest of 2010. We continue to be very selective with our Barnett drilling, focusing our activity in the liquids-rich areas. Our net production in the Barnett exceeded 1.1 Bcf equivalent per day, including 39,000 barrels per day of NGLs and condensate. Although hidden by the rounding, the second quarter daily rate was up 3% from the first quarter. We continue to expect our Barnett production to reach our previous record production of 1.2 Bcf equivalent per day during the third quarter. 
Shifting to the Haynesville Shale, after de-risking much of our held-by production acreage in the Carthage area during 2009, our 2010 activity has focused on our term acreage in the southern area. In addition to the Haynesville potential, we are evaluating the southern acreage for Bossier Shale and James Lime potential.
In San Augustine County, we brought our first Bossier Shale well online in the second quarter with a 24-hour IP of about 8 million cubic feet per day. In Southern Shelby County, the Haynesville Motley #1H was brought online at more than 7 cubic feet per day. To help secure our acreage in the southern area, we have begun farming in industry partners on a promoted basis on some of our term acreage. Given the service cost environment in the Haynesville and a deep inventory of other attractive opportunities in our portfolio, we believe this is the most prudent path to take.
And finally, in the Horn River Basin of Northern British Columbia, we continue to methodically secure our 170,000 net acres with drilling. We have drilled but not yet completed four of the seven planned horizontal wells for this year. We plan to bring these four new wells on to production by year end and the remaining three in the first quarter of 2011. Our producing wells at Horn River continue to perform very well, supporting an EUR [estimated ultimately recoverable] of 7 to 8 Bcf equivalent per well. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?

Today, I will take you through a brief review of the key drivers that affected our second quarter financial results and provide our outlook for the second half of the year. As Vince mentioned earlier we have recla",1320,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will take you through a brief review of the key drivers that affected our second quarter financial results and provide our outlook for the second half of the year. As Vince mentioned earlier we have reclassified the assets, liabilities and results of operations from our international assets into discontinued operations for all accounting periods presented. As a result, most of my comments will focus on our reported continuing operations. Our reported results from continuing ops include both our retained North American Onshore assets and a partial quarter's result from our Gulf of Mexico operations that we exited during the second quarter. 
Looking first at production, in the second quarter of 2010, Devon produced 58.5 million barrels of oil equivalent from continuing ops, or approximately 643,000 Boe per day. Excluding volumes from the Gulf, our retained North American Onshore properties produced 620,000 Boe per day. This exceeded the high end of the guidance range provided during last quarter's conference call by roughly 15,000 Boe per day, about 9,000 of which was attributable to a favorable royalty adjustment on a natural gas production in Canada related to prior periods. The balance of the production beat is due to better-than-expected results from both the U.S. Onshore business and Canada.
Based on our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the second half of the year, we now expect full year production from our North American Onshore properties to climb to between 223 million and 224 million barrels of oil equivalent. We expect our production to range between 610,000 and 620,000 Boe per day in the third quarter, and 625,000 and 635,000 Boe per day in the fourth quarter.
The midpoint of our third quarter estimate reflects an increase in sequential quarter production after adjusting the second quarter for the out-of-period royalty adjustment that we reported.
Moving to price realizations, in the second quarter, the WTI Oil Index remains strong, averaging $78.16 per barrel. That is a 31% increase from the second quarter of 2009. During the quarter, regional differentials widened compared to the first quarter, especially with our heavier crudes in Canada. However, our second quarter oil price realizations were right in line with the midpoint of our guidance at 80% of WTI, or $62.35 per barrel.
For the third quarter, we expect our oil price realizations to approximate 95% of WTI for the U.S. and 70% for Canada. In the second half of 2010, we have 79,000 barrels per day, or roughly 70% of our expected oil production, hedged with an average floor of $67.47 and an average ceiling of $96.48 per barrel. Looking ahead to 2011, we have collars in place for 33,000 barrels per day with floors of $75 and average ceiling of $109 per barrel.
On the natural gas side, the second quarter Henry Hub Index averaged $4.09 per Mcf. Our company-wide gas price realizations before the impact of hedges were 89% of Henry Hub, or $3.62 per Mcf. In the second quarter, we had 61% of our natural gas production hedged with a weighted average protected price of $5.82. Cash settlements from this hedging position boosted our average realization by $1.06 per Mcf, bringing the second quarter price up to $4.68. For the remainder of 2010, our natural gas hedging position will continue to protect roughly 60% of gas production at an average price of $5.98 in the third quarter and $5.87 in the fourth quarter. For 2011, thus far, we have entered into price swap hedges totaling 225 million cubic feet per day at an average price of $5.54 per Mcf. Later this year, we expect to add to our 2011 hedge position.
Looking briefly at NGLs, our price per barrel in the second quarter averaged $30.90, or about 40%  of WTI. We expect third quarter realizations to be similar to the second quarter. Seasonal factors should improve NGL realization somewhat in Q4. However, supply growth in the U.S. could put negative pressure on NGL prices over the longer-term.
Shifting now to expenses, second quarter lease operating expense came in at $442 million. This equates to $7.56 per barrel, or 2% higher than the first quarter of this year. Looking ahead to the second half, with higher-cost Gulf properties now divested, we anticipate LOE will decline to between $7.20 and $7.50 per Boe.
For the second quarter, our DD&A expense for oil and gas properties came in at $7.28 a barrel, a 5% decline from last quarter. Overall, our DD&A rate benefited from the sale of our Gulf assets, which lowered our depletion base. For the remainder of 2010, we are forecasting that DD&A expense will be between $6.90 and $7.20 per Boe.
Moving on to G&A expense, we continued to reduce G&A expenditures in the most recent quarter. Second quarter G&A was $130 million, or 25% lower than the year-ago quarter. For the first half of the year, G&A declined by nearly $70 million when compared to 2009. This reduction is largely attributable to lower personnel costs and efficiencies realized through our strategic repositioning. Based on the positive results for the first two quarters of 2010, we are now lowering the top end of our full-year guidance by $20 million. Our new full-year estimate for G&A is a range of $580 million to $600 million.
Looking at interest expense, we reported $111 million for the second quarter. Of that expense, $19 million resulted from the early retirement of the $350 million of 7.25% senior notes, which we redeemed in June. Excluding this one-time charge, second quarter interest expense totaled $92 million. For the remainder of 2010, we expect interest expense to decline to a range of $80 million to $85 million per quarter.
Looking at income taxes, our reported second quarter income tax expense from continuing operations came in at $261 million. This implies a 43% tax rate on $613 million of pretax income of from continuing ops. The most significant item that influenced our quarterly tax rate was a non-cash $52 million charge related to the expected repatriation of foreign earnings. Additionally, a non-recurring taxable gain on the sale of our Gulf assets affected our current and deferred tax allocation for the quarter. This gain on sale shifted $622 million of second quarter tax expense from deferred into current.
When you back out the impact of all the unusual items that are generally excluded from analyst estimates, you've get an adjusted tax rate for the second quarter of 35%. This rate on non-GAAP earnings includes a true-up adjustment to bring the year-to-date tax rate up to the 30% we now expect for the full year. In today's news release, we provided a table that reconciles the effective items that are generally excluded from analyst estimates.
Going to the bottom line, earnings from continuing ops adjusted for special items came in at $597 million, or $1.34 per diluted share. Operating cash flow from continuing ops totaled $1.3 billion for the second quarter, a 40% increase over the second quarter of 2009. In addition to our operating cash flow, we also received $3.3 billion of pretax cash proceeds from the closing of divestitures in the Gulf and China. We utilized these sources of cash to repurchase for $495 million of common stock, reduce debt balances by $461 million and fund all of our capital demands, including the $500 million acquisition of 50% of BPs interest in Kirby-Pike.
We ended the quarter with cash on hand of nearly $3 billion in a net debt to adjusted cap ratio at a multi-year low of only 14%. Overall, we are extremely well-positioned to continue to operate our business from a position of considerable financial strength.
Continuing to execute on the plan we announced last November, positions us for strong growth per debt adjusted share in 2011 and beyond. At this point, I will turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A.

When you look at our asset base, as you know, it tends to have some fairly similar characteristics, with kind of fairly low entry costs and a relatively low royalty burden. And so we tried to continue to focus on that. The, roughly, $700 million or so that we will have spent this year on acquisitions really helps to augment that base and gives us the kind of critical mass in those areas that we need in order to really be as efficient as we can. So we have intended to try to get into bidding wars in kind of some of the high-profile plays because we just don’t think that we can be competitive in that environment in any event.

Obviously, we’re going to enter a busy winter with our additional strut drilling and 3D seismic we’re going to do out there, as well some engineering work. But given all that, I can give you kind of a rough and tentative timetable. Provided that we have adequate reservoir delineation through this winter’s drilling program, we could have an application for the first phase of Pike somewhere in late 2011. Now how large that phase is has not yet been determined and it will depend somewhat on the results with this winter's drilling program. But then with that, you might have regulatory approval somewhere in early 2013, and then you could begin facilities construction, have first team somewhere around mid-2015 and potentially reaching peak production probably on that first phase somewhere in late 2016. All of that’s a tentative schedule and have a lot of work to go yet to know if we can accomplish that. But again, that’d be the first phase, and whether the first phase is 35,000 barrels a day or 70,000 barrels a day or something like that, we don't know yet.

And to the extent that additional acreage at reasonable prices is available in these very attractive plays, we would continue to take on additional acreage. We always have to work towards balance of resource capture and research development. And we’re very mindful of that. While we’ve had some opportunities to beef up our positions here, we will balance the capital going forward.

I think Dave said we are running 65 rigs; so obviously, we have a lot of rigs that are not under long-term contract. And while we may move some of those rigs under long-term contracts up a little bit, I don’t think it would be very much. Historically, we've tried to stay somewhere between 40% and 50% on long-term rigs. The bigger issue is really the cost has to do with the frac-ing costs. And those costs went up significantly. And while they started being played high in the Eagle Ford and the Haynesville, that has certainly progressed to the rest of the country now. Our experience has been in dealing with these people that providing services that they don't want to lock in any long-term projects unless it’s at a real premium price. Even in today’s market, they still believe costs are going to go up. And so we have not had really any positive response from any of those service providers in terms of wanting to lock in long-term contracts at current prices. So I don't imagine we will probably do that. There are some things that we are locking in. We’re locking in some fuel prices for some of our rigs and things of that nature, but some of the bigger service costs, in terms of the frac-ing and stuff, I don’t see that, that’s going to happen anytime soon.

Welcome to Devon's Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I will begin with some housekeeping items as usual and then I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, John Richels for his overview. Following John's remarks, Dave Hager, our Head of Exploration and Production will provide an operations update. And then finally, after Dave's comment, Jeff Agosta, our Chief Financial Officer, will review Devon's financial results and our outlook. At that point, we'll open it up to Q&A. 
I want to point out that our Chairman, Larry Nichols, and other seniors members of the management team are with us today as well for the Q&A session. And as a reminder, we will ask each of you in the Q&A session to limit your questions to one and one follow-up. We'll keep the call to an hour, so if we don't get to your question, we'll be around the rest of the day to answer any questions you may have remaining.
A replay of this call will be available today through a link on Devon's homepage. During the call today, we will update some of our forward-looking estimates based on the actual results for the first half of the year and our revised outlook for the second half of 2010. In addition to the updates that we're going to provide in the call, we will find an 8-K later today that will have the details of our updated 2010 guidance. And the Guidance section of our website at devonenergy.com will also have the updated forward-looking information. That information is under the Guidance link found within the Investor Relations section of the website.
Before we get to the discussion of the quarter, we're obligated to remind you that this discussion will contain information of our expectations, plans, forecasts, estimates; all of this is considered forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law. And while we strive to give you the very best estimates possible, there are many factors that could cause our actual results to differ from the guidance that we're going to provide. And so we would encourage you to review the discussion of risk factors that can be found in the 8-K that we are filing today.
One other compliance item: We will refer to various non-GAAP performance measures in today's call. When we use these measures, we're required to provide additional disclosures under U.S. securities law. If you would like to review those disclosures, they are available on our website. I also want to remind everybody that the strategic repositioning that we are currently in the midst of affects the financial and operational data for all periods reported. Our decision to divest the international operations resulted in the related production being excluded from our reported production volumes for all periods presented. The revenues and expenses associated with those international operations are collapsed into a single line item at the end of our statement of operations labeled discontinued operations.
Conversely, while we have divested all of our assets and operations in the Gulf of Mexico, oddly enough, the Gulf results are required to be reported in our results from continuing operations through the close of the sales. Said another way, the results from continuing operations reported today include both our North American Onshore assets that we are retaining and the results from our divested Gulf of Mexico operations through the date of the closing of those sales.
Most of our comments today on the call will focus on the results from continuing operations but we will also provide some additional commentary, specifically referencing our North American Onshore results and we provided the information on the press release that enables you to isolate those results so that you can see what our go-forward business will look like.
For those interested in a more detailed review of our international results, we've also provided information in today's press release regarding that. As far as the straight earnings forecast go, most analysts reporting estimates to First Call have excluded discontinued operations. The mean estimate of those analysts, that is the mean estimate for earnings excluding discontinued operations was $1.39 for the quarter. Our adjusted earnings came in $0.05 lower at $1.34 per share. Main driver was higher-than-expected deferred tax rate in the second quarter. Second quarter included a true-up in deferred taxes for the first six months of the year.
This non-cash deferred tax expense did not affect our cash flow in the second quarter. And after the adjusting items, cash flow from continuing operations came in at $3.02 per share, which was well above the First Call estimate of $2.80 per share. 
With those items out of the way, I'm going to turn the call over to John Richels."

The second quarter was another very solid quarter for Devon. Second quarter production from retained properties, that is our North American Onshore properties, exceeded our guidance growing to about 620,000 Boe p",1265,"Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter was another very solid quarter for Devon. Second quarter production from retained properties, that is our North American Onshore properties, exceeded our guidance growing to about 620,000 Boe per day, and that's up nearly 6% over the first quarter of 2010.
With the better-than-expected performance from our retained properties, we’re raising our 2010 production guidance for our retained properties by 2 million to 3 million barrels to a revised range of 223 million to 224 million barrels equivalent.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter. That's a 40% increase over the second quarter of 2009. And second quarter net earnings were more than double that of the prior year coming in at $706 million or $685 million after adjusting items. And finally, our Marketing and Midstream business delivered another solid quarter, generating $125 million in operating profits.
Perhaps equally important is the progress we made during the second quarter with the strategic repositioning that we announced last November. In the second quarter, we completed our exit from the Gulf of Mexico and finalized our sale of the Panyu field in China. To date, we’ve received aggregate pretax proceeds of approximately $4.6 billion. The remaining $5.3 billion of signed transactions yet to close consists of our divestitures in Azerbaijan in Brazil and our remaining assets in China.
Last week, we received the necessary approvals for the $2 billion sale of our interest in the ACG [Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli] field in Azerbaijan to BP and the closing of that transaction is now scheduled for August the 16. In Brazil, the sale to BP continues to move through the multi-layer approval process of the Brazilian government and we remain on track to close that around year end.
Aggregate proceeds from the divestitures will approximate $10 billion or roughly $8 billion after-tax, and this is well above the $4.5 billion to $7.5 billion of after-tax net proceeds that we expected when we announced our repositioning last November. As we have always said, our objective is to redeploy our capital through the combination of E&P projects, share repurchases and debt repayment that optimizes growth on a per-debt adjusted share basis. Year-to-date, we've reduced our debt balances by some $1.7 billion, which includes the repayment of all of our commercial paper balances and $350 million of senior notes.
In addition to repaying debt, we've been active with our share repurchase program that was announced in early May. During May and June, we repurchased 7.6 million common shares at a cost of $495 million. And if you include the shares we purchased in July, we now have purchased 11.9 million shares at a cost of $761 million. This represents nearly 3% of our outstanding shares. At this pace, we're well on track to complete the entire $3.5 billion share repurchase initiative within the 12- to 18-month timeframe we initially expected.
As we indicated when we announced the strategic repositioning last November, we're also investing a portion of the divestiture proceeds in our go-forward North American Onshore business. As part of the asset sales to BP, we announced that we were applying $500 million of the sales proceeds to purchase 50% of BP's interest in the Kirby oil sands leases, which are immediately adjacent to our highly successful Jackfish project. We finalized the joint venture agreement with BP during the second quarter and we changed the name from Kirby to Pike just to avoid confusion with some other industry projects in the Kirby area. This acquisition substantially increases our footprint in SAGD [Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage] oil and extends Devon's visible growth in SAGD oil production for the remainder of the decade.
Dave will talk more about the activity that we have planned at Pike later on in the call. We're also investing a portion of the divestiture proceeds to deepen our oil and our liquids-rich gas inventory North America. In fact, for the year 2010, we have leased or are in the process of leasing more than 450,000 net acres in oil or condensate-rich plays in addition to the Kirby-Pike acreage. Almost half of this acreage lies in the Permian Basin, where we have leased 58,000 additional net acres in our Wolfberry oil play, 115,000 additional net acres in the Avalon Shale play and 19,000 additional acres in the third Bone Spring play. The balance of the acreage is in oil plays in the Permian Basin and elsewhere that we won't be ready to talk about until we’ve completed our leasing programs.
During the second quarter, we are also leasing additional acreage in the Cana play. Recently, we entered into agreements to acquire about 50,000 additional net acres in the liquids-rich portion of the Cana. This brings our position in the Cana to roughly 230,000 net acres, representing many years of drilling inventory. As many of you know, some industry observers have characterized our Cana play in Western Oklahoma as one of the most economic shale plays in North America. The liquids-rich portion of the play offers a significant oil or condensate component, as well as natural gas liquids.
When we entered the year, we expected our 2010 E&P capital including expenditures associated with the divestitures assets to total about $5.6 billion. Originally, you might recall we expected to spend $1.5 billion of this budget on the assets being divested. However, the faster-than-expected progress with the Gulf divestitures and our upcoming close of the sale of ACG has allowed us to redirect about $800 million of that capital to Onshore North America, primarily for the new resource capture in the areas that I just covered.
In addition, we've allocated roughly $200 million of the divestiture proceeds to our 2010 capital budget. That brings our 2010 E&P capital budget to $5.8 billion, including the $700 million of capital that we're spending this year on the divestiture properties. Of course, this does not include the $500 million Kirby-Pike acquisition, which was done as part of the BP transaction. 
It's worth noting that while the $700 million of capital associated with the divestiture properties will be reported as capital spending by Devon in 2010, the terms of the purchase and sale agreements allow us to recover that capital from the purchasers in the form of purchase price adjustments.
When we analyzed our 2010 North American Onshore E&P capital spend in terms of product mix, roughly 80% is focused on crude oil, condensate and liquids-rich projects. Of this 80%, roughly half is focused on crude oil and condensate projects and the other half is focused on projects where natural gas liquids production is the dominant driver of the economic. The balance, that is the remaining 20% of our budget, is largely focused on securing term acreage or de-risking natural gas plays in our existing portfolio.
When you step back and view the repositioning of the company as a whole, following the close of the pending asset sales, we will have sold roughly 10% of Devon's crude reserves and production with after-tax proceeds from these divestitures exceeding 20% of our enterprise value. Assuming completion of the balance of the share repurchase program at today's stock price, we will have reduced our share count by 12%, while significantly strengthening our balance sheet and deepening our inventory in some of the highest margin oil, condensate and liquids-rich gas plays in North America. This puts us in an extremely competitive position for the future regardless of the macro environment.
With that, I'll turn the call over to David Hager for a review of our quarterly operating highlights. David?"
266510,78940835,74717,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-04-2010",2010-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a quick recap of the company-wide drilling activity. We exited the second quarter with 65 Devon-operated rigs running.

We exited the second quarter with 65 Devon-operated rigs running. During the second quarter, we drilled 315 wells, including 306 development wells and nine exploration wells. All of these wells were successful.
Capital expenditures for exploration and development from our North American Onshore operations were $1.1 billion for the second quarter, bringing our total through the first six months to $2.1 billion, excluding the Kirby-Pike acquisition. This level of activity increased second quarter production from retained properties by 6% over the previous quarter and 8% over the fourth quarter of 2009.
Moving now to our quarterly operations highlights, in our 100% Devon-owned Jackfish thermal oil project in Eastern Alberta, our second quarter daily production averaged a little over 29,000 barrels per day net of royalties. Following the close of the quarter on July 10, we had a minor wellhead release of steam and bitumen. A small hole in the wellhead likely caused by sand erosion resulted in the release. Cleanup is about 90% complete and we expect to finish it in the next couple of weeks.
Our technical team has completed an ultrasonic testing of all the Jackfish wellheads and determined that the issue is isolated to the three wellheads on one pad. We will be making the necessary modifications to the wellheads, and subject to regulatory approval, expect to bring the effective pad back on stream in the next couple of weeks. The production impact from the incident is minimal – about 5,000 barrels per day while the pad is offline. However, third and fourth quarter Jackfish production will be impacted by a plant turnaround scheduled to begin in September. Accordingly, our net Jackfish production is expected to average about 23,000 barrels per day for the second half of 2010.
With construction of Jackfish 2 roughly 85% complete, the project is about $100 million under budget and remains on schedule for first oil in late 2011. We expect total project costs through startup for Jackfish 2 to come in below the industry average at approximately $30,000 per flowing barrel. For Jackfish 3, we expect to file the regulatory application in the next few weeks. Pending regulatory approval and formal sanctioning, we could begin site work by late 2011 with plant startup targeted for late 2014. I will remind you that Devon has a 100% working interest in each of these three Jackfish projects.
At Kirby-Pike, this is our 50-50 SAGD joint venture with BP that Devon operates. We estimate gross recoverable resources there of up to 1.5 billion barrels. To determine the optimal number of development phases needed, we will initiate a drilling program and begin shooting 3D seismic over the Kirby-Pike acreage later this year. With the addition of Kirby or Pike to Jackfish, we expect to grow our net SAGD production to 150,000 to 175,000 barrels per day by 2020.
In our Lloydminster oil play in Alberta, we drilled 14 new wells in the second quarter. Lloydminster production averaged 41,000 barrels equivalent per day in the quarter, a 4% increase over the first quarter. 
Moving to the Permian Basin, as John mentioned earlier, we have been actively acquiring acreage in several of our key oil plays. In our Wolfberry light oil play in West Texas, we have added 58,000 net acres since the beginning of the year and now have 200,000 prospective net acres in the play. We have four operated rigs running and drilled 26 wells during the second quarter. The second quarter activity included our best well to date in the play, the Helen Crump B, 11 came online, flowing over 500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. While we are still in the early stages of evaluating our large Wolfberry acreage position, results to date have been encouraging.
Also in the Permian Basin, we have been building a position in the Avalon Shale play. To date, we have assembled 235,000 perspective net acres in this condensate- and liquids-rich gas play. Although we are still in the early evaluation of the play, initial drilling results indicate an attractive, repeatable play with outstanding economics. The best wells we have drilled to date have IP-ed at over 500 barrels of condensate per day, 500 barrels of NGLs per day and 3 million to 5 million cubic feet per day of gas. Well costs in the play run between $3.3 million and $4 million. We expect Avalon wells to have average IPs of 300 barrels of condensate per day, 300 barrels of NGLs per day and 2 million cubic feet of gas per day in the heart of the play. We expect per-well recoveries to average over 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent. These characteristics give the Avalon Shale great return potential. We expect to participate in 32 Avalon wells this year, including 20 that we will operate.
Although we have not talked much about our Granite Wash position in the past, we delivered some very encouraging results there during the second quarter. We brought two Devon-operated Granite Wash wells online with an average 24-hour IP of 29 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including  585 barrels of oil or condensate and 1,330 barrels of NGLs. With the recent success in both the Cherokee and Granite Wash A sands, we are stepping up our activity in the area. We currently have two rigs running in the play and plan to add a third rig that we will move from the Barnett later this month. We have an inventory of about 150 Cherokee and Granite Wash A locations and 200 additional undrilled locations and other Granite Wash formations. Since we hold our position in the Granite Wash with existing production, we are under no pressure to drill. However, given the attractive rate of returns generated by these wells in this environment, we are reallocating capital to this play. We now plan to drill 16 Granite Wash wells this year.
Moving to the Cana-Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma. As John indicated, we are in the process of acquiring a significant amount of additional acreage in this play. Most of this new acreage is primary term and located in the liquids-rich portion of the play. We are currently running nine operated rigs and will bring additional rigs into the play over the next few months to secure this term acreage.
We continue to see outstanding results from Cana and believe that the field offers some of the best economics among gas plays in North American shale. In the second quarter, we brought 10 operated wells online with average 24-hour IP rates of 6.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 86 barrels of condensate and 350 barrels per day of NGLs. 
Second quarter net production from Cana averaged a record 105 million cubic feet of equivalent per day, including 1,000 barrels per day of condensate and 3,000 barrels of NGLs. This was up 43% on a sequential-quarter basis.
Earlier this year, we initiated an infill pilot program at Cana to help us better understand optimal well spacing. This was a joint project with another operator that consists of nine total horizontal wells being drilled and completed within one square mile. Five of these wells were spaced at 500 feet apart and the other four wells at 660 feet apart. Excluding the first well in the section that had been producing for some time, the average 30-day IP from the eight new wells was 5.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 46 barrels of condensate per day and 245 barrels of NGLs per day. These results are encouraging. We will continue to monitor the performance from these wells to determine if the results support this reduced well spacing.
Moving to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas. We are currently running 17 Devon-operated rigs. But as I mentioned, we'll be moving one of these rigs to the Granite Wash later this month. But we plan to run the remaining 16 rigs in the Barnett for the rest of 2010. We continue to be very selective with our Barnett drilling, focusing our activity in the liquids-rich areas. Our net production in the Barnett exceeded 1.1 Bcf equivalent per day, including 39,000 barrels per day of NGLs and condensate. Although hidden by the rounding, the second quarter daily rate was up 3% from the first quarter. We continue to expect our Barnett production to reach our previous record production of 1.2 Bcf equivalent per day during the third quarter. 
Shifting to the Haynesville Shale. After de-risking much of our held-by production acreage in the Carthage area during 2009, our 2010 activity has focused on our term acreage in the southern area. In addition to the Haynesville potential, we are evaluating the southern acreage for Bossier Shale and James Lime potential.
In San Augustine County, we brought our first Bossier Shale well online in the second quarter with a 24-hour IP of about 8 million cubic feet per day. In Southern Shelby County, the Haynesville Motley #1H was brought online at more than 7 cubic feet per day. To help secure our acreage in the southern area, we have begun farming in industry partners on a promoted basis on some of our term acreage. Given the service cost environment in the Haynesville and a deep inventory of other attractive opportunities in our portfolio, we believe this is the most prudent path to take.
And finally, in the Horn River Basin of Northern British Columbia, we continue to methodically secure our 170,000 net acres with drilling. We have drilled but not yet completed four of the seven planned horizontal wells for this year. We plan to bring these four new wells on to production by year end and the remaining three in the first quarter of 2011. Our producing wells at Horn River continue to perform very well, supporting an EUR [estimated ultimately recoverable] of 7 to 8 Bcf equivalent per well. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?"

Today, I will take you through a brief review of the key drivers that affected our second quarter financial results and provide our outlook for the second half of the year. As Vince mentioned earlier we have recla",1320,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will take you through a brief review of the key drivers that affected our second quarter financial results and provide our outlook for the second half of the year. As Vince mentioned earlier we have reclassified the assets, liabilities and results of operations from our international assets into discontinued operations for all accounting periods presented. As a result, most of my comments will focus on our reported continuing operations. Our reported results from continuing ops include both our retained North American Onshore assets and a partial quarter's result from our Gulf of Mexico operations that we exited during the second quarter. 
Looking first at production, in the second quarter of 2010, Devon produced 58.5 million barrels of oil equivalent from continuing ops, or approximately 643,000 Boe per day. Excluding volumes from the Gulf, our retained North American Onshore properties produced 620,000 Boe per day. This exceeded the high end of the guidance range provided during last quarter's conference call by roughly 15,000 Boe per day, about 9,000 of which was attributable to a favorable royalty adjustment on a natural gas production in Canada related to prior periods. The balance of the production beat is due to better-than-expected results from both the U.S. Onshore business and Canada.
Based on our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the second half of the year, we now expect full year production from our North American Onshore properties to climb to between 223 million and 224 million barrels of oil equivalent. We expect our production to range between 610,000 and 620,000 Boe per day in the third quarter, and 625,000 and 635,000 Boe per day in the fourth quarter.
The midpoint of our third quarter estimate reflects an increase in sequential quarter production after adjusting the second quarter for the out-of-period royalty adjustment that we reported.
Moving to price realizations, in the second quarter, the WTI Oil Index remains strong, averaging $78.16 per barrel. That is a 31% increase from the second quarter of 2009. During the quarter, regional differentials widened compared to the first quarter, especially with our heavier crudes in Canada. However, our second quarter oil price realizations were right in line with the midpoint of our guidance at 80% of WTI, or $62.35 per barrel.
For the third quarter, we expect our oil price realizations to approximate 95% of WTI for the U.S. and 70% for Canada. In the second half of 2010, we have 79,000 barrels per day, or roughly 70% of our expected oil production, hedged with an average floor of $67.47 and an average ceiling of $96.48 per barrel. Looking ahead to 2011, we have collars in place for 33,000 barrels per day with floors of $75 and average ceiling of $109 per barrel.
On the natural gas side, the second quarter Henry Hub Index averaged $4.09 per Mcf. Our company-wide gas price realizations before the impact of hedges were 89% of Henry Hub, or $3.62 per Mcf. In the second quarter, we had 61% of our natural gas production hedged with a weighted average protected price of $5.82. Cash settlements from this hedging position boosted our average realization by $1.06 per Mcf, bringing the second quarter price up to $4.68. For the remainder of 2010, our natural gas hedging position will continue to protect roughly 60% of gas production at an average price of $5.98 in the third quarter and $5.87 in the fourth quarter. For 2011, thus far, we have entered into price swap hedges totaling 225 million cubic feet per day at an average price of $5.54 per Mcf. Later this year, we expect to add to our 2011 hedge position.
Looking briefly at NGLs, our price per barrel in the second quarter averaged $30.90, or about 40%  of WTI. We expect third quarter realizations to be similar to the second quarter. Seasonal factors should improve NGL realization somewhat in Q4. However, supply growth in the U.S. could put negative pressure on NGL prices over the longer-term.
Shifting now to expenses, second quarter lease operating expense came in at $442 million. This equates to $7.56 per barrel, or 2% higher than the first quarter of this year. Looking ahead to the second half, with higher-cost Gulf properties now divested, we anticipate LOE will decline to between $7.20 and $7.50 per Boe.
For the second quarter, our DD&A expense for oil and gas properties came in at $7.28 a barrel, a 5% decline from last quarter. Overall, our DD&A rate benefited from the sale of our Gulf assets, which lowered our depletion base. For the remainder of 2010, we are forecasting that DD&A expense will be between $6.90 and $7.20 per Boe.
Moving on to G&A expense, we continued to reduce G&A expenditures in the most recent quarter. Second quarter G&A was $130 million, or 25% lower than the year-ago quarter. For the first half of the year, G&A declined by nearly $70 million when compared to 2009. This reduction is largely attributable to lower personnel costs and efficiencies realized through our strategic repositioning. Based on the positive results for the first two quarters of 2010, we are now lowering the top end of our full-year guidance by $20 million. Our new full-year estimate for G&A is a range of $580 million to $600 million.
Looking at interest expense, we reported $111 million for the second quarter. Of that expense, $19 million resulted from the early retirement of the $350 million of 7.25% senior notes, which we redeemed in June. Excluding this one-time charge, second quarter interest expense totaled $92 million. For the remainder of 2010, we expect interest expense to decline to a range of $80 million to $85 million per quarter.
Looking at income taxes, our reported second quarter income tax expense from continuing operations came in at $261 million. This implies a 43% tax rate on $613 million of pretax income of from continuing ops. The most significant item that influenced our quarterly tax rate was a non-cash $52 million charge related to the expected repatriation of foreign earnings. Additionally, a non-recurring taxable gain on the sale of our Gulf assets affected our current and deferred tax allocation for the quarter. This gain on sale shifted $622 million of second quarter tax expense from deferred into current.
When you back out the impact of all the unusual items that are generally excluded from analyst estimates, you've get an adjusted tax rate for the second quarter of 35%. This rate on non-GAAP earnings includes a true-up adjustment to bring the year-to-date tax rate up to the 30% we now expect for the full year. In today's news release, we provided a table that reconciles the effective items that are generally excluded from analyst estimates.
Going to the bottom line, earnings from continuing ops adjusted for special items came in at $597 million, or $1.34 per diluted share. Operating cash flow from continuing ops totaled $1.3 billion for the second quarter, a 40% increase over the second quarter of 2009. In addition to our operating cash flow, we also received $3.3 billion of pretax cash proceeds from the closing of divestitures in the Gulf and China. We utilized these sources of cash to repurchase for $495 million of common stock, reduce debt balances by $461 million and fund all of our capital demands, including the $500 million acquisition of 50% of BPs interest in Kirby-Pike.
We ended the quarter with cash on hand of nearly $3 billion in a net debt to adjusted cap ratio at a multi-year low of only 14%. Overall, we are extremely well-positioned to continue to operate our business from a position of considerable financial strength.
Continuing to execute on the plan we announced last November, positions us for strong growth per debt adjusted share in 2011 and beyond. At this point, I will turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A."

Obviously, we’re going to enter a busy winter with our additional strut drilling and 3D seismic we’re going to do out there, as well some engineering work. But given all that, I can give you kind of a rough and tentative timetable. Provided that we have adequate reservoir delineation through this winter’s drilling program, we could have an application for the first phase of Pike somewhere in late 2011. Now how large that phase is has not yet been determined and it will depend somewhat on the results with this winter's drilling program. But then with that, you might have regulatory approval somewhere in early 2013, and then you could begin facilities construction, have first team somewhere around mid-2015 and potentially reaching peak production probably on that first phase somewhere in late 2016. All of that’s a tentative schedule and have a lot of work to go yet to know if we can accomplish that. But again, that’d be the first phase, and whether the first phase is 35,000 barrels a day or 70,000 barrels a day or something like that, we don't know yet.

Obviously, at least in the short-term over the next year or two, we do believe there could be some additional pressure on liquid prices, primarily ethane. There’s limited market in terms of they make plastics and they’re using refineries and that's about it. It doesn’t have the degree of flexibility that a propane product would have. So we do think that there is a possibility if there's a continued increase in capital spend on these projects throughout the industry, that you could see some downward pressure, primarily on the ethane side of the business. But we just still think that it will trade at a 20% to 25% premium to natural gas, if you're looking at gas prices in the $5 to $5.50 range. So little bit of downward pressure, but still trade at a premium."

Historically, we've tried to stay somewhere between 40% and 50% on our long-term rigs. The bigger issue is really the cost has to do with the frac-ing costs. And those costs went up significantly. And while they started being played high in the Eagle Ford and the Haynesville, that has certainly progressed to the rest of the country now. Our experience has been in dealing with these people that providing the services that they don't want to lock in any long-term projects unless it’s at a real premium price. Even in today’s market, they still believe costs are going to go up. And so we have not had really any positive response from any of those service providers in terms of wanting to lock in long-term contracts at current prices. So I don't imagine we will probably do that. There are some things that we are locking in. We’re locking in some fuel prices for some of our rigs and things of that nature, but some of the bigger service costs, in terms of the frac-ing and stuff, I don’t see that that’s going to happen any time soon."

Following John's remarks, Dave Hager, our EVP of Exploration and Production will cover the operating highlights and then finally, following Dave's comments, Jeff Agosta, our Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results and our outlook. At that point, we'll open the call up to your questions. Our Executive Chairman, Larry Nichols and other senior members of the management team are with us today for the Q&A session. And as a courtesy to the other participants, we ask that each of you limit your questions to one initial inquiry and one follow-up. We'll limit the call to about an hour, and we will be around for the rest of the day to answer questions after the call. 
A replay of this call will be available later today through a link on Devon's homepage. During the call today, we will provide some color on some of our forward-looking estimates based on the actual results for the first nine months of the year, and our outlook for the balance of 2011 and 2012. We will not be issuing a revised 8-K today, because our outlook for the remainder of the year falls within the updated ranges we provided in the Form 8-K that we filed last August. To access a comprehensive summary of our current guidance, which includes any refinements we make today, you can go to devonenergy.com and click on the Guidance link found within the Investor Relations section of our website. 
Please note that all references today for our plans, forecasts, expectations and estimates, are considered forward-looking statements under U.S. Securities law. And while we always like to provide you with the very best data possible, many factors could cause our actual results to differ from those estimates. You can find a discussion of risk factors related or estimates in the Form 8-K that contains these forecasts. One other compliance note, we'll refer to various non-GAAP performance measures in today's call. When we use these measures, we are required under Securities law to provide certain additional disclosures and those are available for your review on Devon's website. 
By now, most of you are aware that our decision to sell our international assets triggered the accounting rules for discontinued operations. We have therefore excluded international production volumes for all periods presented as well as the revenues and expenses associated with those. Those are collapsed into a single line item at the end of the statement of operations. That line item is labeled Discontinued Operations. For those interested in a more detailed view of our international results, you will find an additional table in today's news release that includes a detailed statement of operations and the related production volumes that are attributable to the international properties. 
As a reminder, the third quarter is our first reporting period without financial or operating results from the Gulf of Mexico. While the international divestiture properties are considered discontinued operations, the Gulf of Mexico divestiture assets are included in results from continuing operations for previous periods. For that reason, we are providing supplemental information in our press release that isolates the results from Devon's North American Onshore operations or, in other words, the go-forward business. 
As far as straight earnings estimates ago, the majority of analysts chose to report estimates to First Call that included only our North American Onshore operations. The mean estimate from those analysts that focused on continuing operations was $1.25 a share for the quarter, that compares to our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1.31 per share. So our actual results beat the street estimate by $0.06 or about 5%. With those items out of the way, I'll turn the call over to President and CEO John Richels."
266510,98042994,84752,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Vince and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2010, Devon delivered another very solid performance both operationally and financially.Production from our North American Onshore properties totaled 613,000 barrels of oil equivalent pe",985,"Thanks, Vince and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2010, Devon delivered another very solid performance both operationally and financially.
Production from our North American Onshore properties totaled 613,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, a 4% increase over the third quarter of 2009. This production growth was driven by an 11% increase in oil and natural gas liquids production. In the current environment, oil and NGLs now account for roughly half of Devon's total oil gas and NGL sales revenue. Strong realized prices for our oil production and improved cost efficiencies resulting from the repositioning drove our adjusted earnings from continuing operations up more than 40% over the year-ago quarter to $571 million or $1.31 per diluted share. 
Cash flow for balance sheet changes climbed 47% over the third quarter of last year and combined with the divestiture proceeds Devon's total cash inflows for the third quarter approached $4 billion, far exceeding our total capital demands for the quarter. As a result, we exited the month of September with an enviable position of $4 billion of cash on hand and a bulletproof balance sheet. 
And on the operations front, we continued successful execution of our focused North American Onshore strategy as evidenced by quarterly production records at our liquids-rich Barnett and Cana shale plays and a multiyear production high from our Permian Basin properties. We also continue to make significant strides during the quarter towards completing the strategic repositioning that we announced just one year ago. In the third quarter, we completed the sales of our interest in the ACG field in Azerbaijan and our remaining assets in China. So to date, we've received aggregate pretax divestiture proceeds of approximately $6.8 billion. 
The only significant divestiture package remaining, that's our Brazilian assets, is under contract for $3.2 billion. This transaction is pending approval by the Brazilian government and all indications are that this transaction will close as expected around year end. Following the closing, we'll have realized total proceeds from our divestiture program exceeding $10 billion or roughly $8 billion after-tax. 
As we have always said, our objective in redeploying the divestiture proceeds is to optimize growth on a debt-adjusted per share basis. To accomplish this objective we've taken a balanced approach by directing $1.7 billion of sales proceeds to reduce debt and by allocating $1.2 billion to capture acreage opportunities across our North American Onshore property base principally in oil- and liquids-rich areas. 
In addition, we initiated a $3.5 billion share repurchase program last May. At today's stock price, $3.5 billion equates to approximately 12% of our outstanding common shares. Through today, we've purchased over 15 million shares for right around $1 billion. This puts us on pace to complete the buyback within the 12- to 18-month timeframe that we originally announced.
Buying back Devon stock is an especially attractive alternative given our current stock price. Our share is currently priced in the mid-60s, translate into a net enterprise value of $110 per proven barrel. And this analysis attributes no value to the thousands of unproved locations that we have within our 13 million net acre resource base in North America. 
Now before I turn the call over to Dave, just want to address a subject that we received a number of questions about, and that is our capital budget and our production profile for 2011.  Given the significant divergence of oil and natural gas prices, similar to what we did in 2010, we expect to focus more than 90% of our 2011 capital on oil and liquids-rich opportunities within our existing portfolio. Although we're still in the process of finalizing our 2011 capital budget and have not yet submitted it to our board for approval, directionally, we have a pretty good idea where we want to go. 
First, recapping 2010, we previously indicated that we expected full year E&P capital to total roughly $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion for our North American Onshore business. We're still comfortable with that range but taking into account continued upward cost pressures in the sector, we now expect to be in the top half of that range. This level of CapEx, I'll just remind you, includes a total of $1.2 billion of acreage capture that includes the $500 million that we invested to acquire the Pike oil sands acreage and about $700 million of additional leasing primarily in oil- and liquids-rich plays in the Permian and Mid-Continent. We would not expect to repeat this spend rate for leasehold acquisition in 2011. Adjusting for that gets you to a normalized spend for 2010 of roughly $4.5 billion for our go-forward North American Onshore E&P capital budget. 
Based on this starting point and assuming a similar level of drilling activity in 2011, with some inflation for service cost, I would expect our 2011 E&P capital budget to fall between $4.5 billion and $4.9 billion. When you take into account Midstream and other capital, our total 2011 capital demands should be somewhere in the neighborhood of $5.5 billion $5.9 billion. And with that level of spending, we would expect overall production growth of 68% led by a roughly 20% growth in oil and NGL volumes.
I want to make this very clear. Our asset base has the capacity to grow at a much higher rate next year but top line growth is not what we are optimizing. We're focused on optimizing our growth per debt-adjusted share. We simply refuse to get caught up in the growth-at-any cost mentality.
Given the current environment, we can deliver optimum results through investing in our liquids-focused capital program, buying back our stock and taking a disciplined approach to our debt balances.
In 2011, we expect these actions to boost production per debt-adjusted share growth into the mid-teens. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Hager, for a review of our quarterly operating highlights. David?"
266510,98042994,84752,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. I will begin with a quick recap of company-wide drilling activity. We exited the third quarter with 67 Devon-operated rigs running and during the quarter, we drilled 407 wells.

We exited the third quarter with 67 Devon-operated rigs running and during the quarter, we drilled 407 wells. These include 384 development wells and 23 exploration wells. All but three of the wells were successful.
Capital expenditures for exploration and development from our North American Onshore operations were $1.4 billion for the third quarter, bringing our total through the first nine months to $3.5 billion excluding the Pike acquisition. This level of activity increased third quarter production from retained properties by 4% over the third quarter of 2009, led by an 11% increase in oil and liquids production over the 2009 quarter. 
Moving now to our quarterly operating highlights. First, at our Jackfish thermal oil project in Eastern Alberta, our third quarter daily production averaged a little over 21,000 barrels per day net of royalties. As we indicated in our last quarterly call, Jackfish was taken down for three weeks during the third quarter for scheduled maintenance. Following the turnaround, plant operations were restored on September 30. However, it will take a few weeks to fully restore the steam chambers and climb back to plant capacity. Accordingly, fourth quarter production at Jackfish is expected to average about 23,000 barrels per day net of royalties. Construction of Jackfish 2 is roughly 90% complete and continuing to trend under budget. We expect to begin injecting steam in the second quarter of next year delivering first oil in late 2011 with production ramping throughout 2012.  Our third Jackfish project, Jackfish 3 has now been sanctioned, and we filed a regulatory application during the third quarter. Pending regulatory approval, we could begin site work by late next year with plant startups target for 2015. Detailed engineering work is already underway and we have locked down prices on roughly 85% of the major equipment orders. Devon operates the Jackfish projects and owns 100% working interest. 
At Pike, this is our SAGD oil sands joint venture with BP that we formerly called Kirby. We have begun the appraisal drilling required to determine the optimum development configuration. We expect to complete appraisal drilling this winter with the goal of launching the regulatory process for the first phase of development around the end of 2011. Between Jackfish and Pike, we expect to grow our SAGD oil production to between 150,000 to 175,000 barrels per day by 2020. 
In our Lloydminster oil play in Alberta, we drilled 53 new wells in the third quarter holding production steady at roughly 40,000 barrels equivalent per day in the quarter.
Moving to the Permian Basin. Our net production averaged just over 44,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, up 18% over the third quarter of 2009 and 6% over the second quarter of 2010. Our third quarter oil and NGL production in the Permian was up 23% over 2009 and accounted for roughly 70% of our total Permian volumes.
The growth in liquids speaks to the quality and flexibly of our Property portfolio. As we mentioned last quarter, we are adding to the depth of this portfolio with approximately 200,000 additional acres in several oil- and liquids-rich plays to lease year. We have ramped up activity in several of our key oil plays and now have 17 rigs running in the Permian.
One of these projects is our Wolfberry light oil play where we recently added a fifth rig. We drilled 27 wells during the third quarter including one of our best wells to date in the play, which had a 30-day IP of 500 barrels per day. Our net Wolfberry production has increased nearly 150% since the beginning of  the year to approximately 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our focus over the coming months will be to continue the evaluation of our 200,000 net acre Wolfberry position.
Also in the Permian Basin. We have four rigs running in the Avalon Shale play. Devon has assembled over 200,000 prospective net acres in this condensate- and liquids-rich gas play. So far this year, we have participated in 18 Avalon wells and have a production data on a total of 30 wells covering a wide geographic area. While we are still in the early stages of evaluation of this play, the data support EURs of 400,000 to 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day depending on location within the broader play area, lateral length, et cetera. We expect to participate in 14 additional Avalon wells this year. We're encouraged with the results we have seen and we'll keep you updated as we gain additional information. 
Another focus area in the Permian is the Bone Spring oil play, where Devon has 170,000 net acres. The Bone Spring is an oil play historically developed by vertical drilling. However, with the application of today's horizontal techniques, we have recently seeing some outstanding wells.  In the third quarter, we drilled and completed the strawberry 7 federal 4H [ph]  that we brought online at more than 700 barrels of oil per day. Early results from the six horizontal wells we have drilled to date in this play indicate EURs could have average around 300,000 barrels of equivalent, the cost of $3.8 million per well. We currently have three rigs running in the Bone Spring and expect to drill approximately 20 wells in the play this year. We are also running five additional rigs in the Permian targeting various conventional formations primarily with horizontal wells.
Moving north to the Texas Panhandle, where Devon has approximately 58,000 net acres in the Granite Wash play, we stepped up drilling activity during the quarter with the addition of a third rig that was relocated from the Barnett Shale. In the third quarter, we brought three Devon-operated wells online with average IP rates of 4,290 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 605 barrels of oil or condensate and 1,450 barrels of NGLs. With the attractive rate of returns generated by these wells, it's likely that we'll add additional rigs in the Granite Wash as we head into 2011.
Moving to the Cana-Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma, we continue to add to our acreage position during the quarter and now have approximately 240,000 net acres, focused in the best parts of the play. This has increased our risk resource potential at Cana to more than 10 trillion cubic feet equivalent. In order to continue to derisk our position and secure term acreage that we acquired this year, we have significantly ramped up our drilling activity over the past few months. We currently have 19 operated rigs running and expect to add two additional rigs by year end. We continue to see outstanding results from Cana. In the third quarter, we brought 11 operated wells online with average 24-hour IP rates of 5.3 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including an average of 175 barrels of NGLs and condensate. 
Third quarter net production from Cana averaged a record 117 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day, including 1,300 barrels of condensate per day and 4,000 barrels of NGLs. This is a 12% increase on a sequential quarter basis. By year end 2011, we expect to drive our net Cana production up more than 100% to 250 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 14,000 barrels per day of condensate and NGLs. In addition to enhancing upstream economics, the liquids-rich portion of the Cana field also create opportunities from a midstream perspective. 
To capture this value, just as we have in the Barnett and Arkoma, we are building a gas processing facility. Construction of the Cana plant is essentially complete and we expect to begin processing next month. The facility will have an initial processing capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day and will be capable of extracting up to 15,000 barrels of NGLs per day. The plant's processing capacity is expandable to 600 million a day as our volumes from the field grow. 
Shifting to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas. In the third quarter, our net production reached the previous all-time high of 1.2 Bcf equivalent per day, including over 40,000 barrels of NGLs and condensate per day. This illustrates the depth of our inventory in contrast to that of many of our peers. With virtually no lease expiration issues and thousands of remaining high-quality locations, we have considerable capital flexibility in the Barnett. It is likely that we will choose to run a 12-rig program in 2011 with a focus on the liquids-rich portion of the play. This level of activity should allow us to maintain our current production level. With most of our activity in the Barnett now focused on drilling multiple wells from a single pad, we are finding that we are able to achieve even greater levels of efficiency. We have also continued to improve drilling efficiency and recently set a new record of eight days from spud to rig release for three recent Barnett wells. We are currently running 16 operated rigs in the Barnett, but we'll relocate four of these late next month.
Moving to the Haynesville Shale. After derisking much of our held-by production acreage in the Carthage area during 2009, our 2010 activity has focused on our term acreage in the southern area. However, given the rising service cost environment in the Haynesville, and a deep inventory of other attractive opportunities in our portfolio, our term acreage in the Haynesville does not directly attract capital within our portfolio. Therefore, we are continuing to bring in industry partners that are interested in developing this acreage. Keep in mind, the Haynesville drilling we did in 2009 in the Carthage area confirmed that we have a repeatable, economically attractive play under a more normalized gas price environment. Since this acreage is held by production, we have the luxury of pursuing this resource when the gas price and the cost environment is most favorable.
And finally, in the Horn River Basin of Northern British Columbia, we have now drilled all seven horizontal wells that we planned for this year. Four of these wells have been completed and we expect to have them tied in and producing by year end. Our producing wells at Horn River continue to perform better than expected, supporting an average EUR of 7 to 8 Bcf equivalent per well. Given that the Horn River is dry gas, we plan to spend minimal capital there in 2011. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?"

As Vince mentioned earlier, we have reclassified the assets, liabilities and results of operations from our international assets into discontinued operations for all accounting periods presented. Since we completed our exit from the Gulf of Mexico during the second quarter, our third quarter results from continuing ops represent just our North American Onshore operations. Or in other words, the result of the repositioned Devon. 
Looking first to production. In the third quarter, we produced 56.4 million oil equivalent barrels or approximately 613,000 barrels per day. This was in line with the production forecast range we've provided during last quarter's call and about 1% less than last quarter's production for our North American Onshore assets. You may recall that during last quarter's call, we told you that production from the second quarter had benefited from a 9,000 barrel per day royalty adjustment related to prior periods.
Also, due to a scheduled plant turnaround, Jackfish was off-line for three weeks during the third quarter. As a result, average daily production from Jackfish was 8,000 barrels per day lower on a sequential quarter basis. Removing the out-of-period royalty adjustment, and the impact of Jackfish maintenance, sequential quarter production was up almost 2%. On a year-over-year basis, third quarter production for our North American Onshore assets increased 22,000 barrels per day or 4%. As mentioned before, an 11% increase in oil and NGL production drove the favorable comparison. 
Looking ahead, our high-quality North American Onshore assets remain on track to deliver full year production of 223 million to 224 million equivalent barrels. This implies fourth quarter production of 625,000 to 635,000 Boe per day, or roughly 10% over fourth quarter 2009 production. 
Moving to price realizations, starting with oil. In the third quarter, the WTI Index averaged $76.08 per barrel an 11% increase over to third quarter of 2009. Company-wide oil price realizations were near the top end of our guidance range at 82% of WTI. The most notable regional performance was the narrowing of heavy oil differentials in Canada. On the natural gas side, the third quarter benchmark Henry Hub gas price averaged $4.38 per Mcf. But out of third quarter realized gas price before the impact of hedges was 84% of Henry Hub, or $3.67. Cash settlements from our hedging position and regional basis swaps increased our overall price realizations by $1, bringing our all-in price including hedges to $4.67. 
For the fourth quarter of this year, we remain well hedged with approximately 60% of our natural gas production locked in at a weighted average price of $5.87 per Mcf. We also have roughly 70% of our fourth quarter oil production collared with an average floor of $67.47 per barrel and an average ceiling of $96.48. Looking to 2011, we recently added 300 million per day to our gas hedge position, bringing our total up to 525 million cubic feet per day for the year swapped at a weighted average price of $5.56. As part of these recent additions, we sold call options on 12,000 barrels of oil per day for 2011 and '12 at $95 per barrel, and call options on 300 million cubic feet per day of gas for 2012 at $6 per Mcf. Also for 2011, we have collars in place on 33,000 barrels of oil per day where the floor is $75 per barrel and an average ceiling of $109.
We will be posting a schedule on our website after the call with all the details of our hedge position. Looking briefly at NGLs. Our price per barrel in the third quarter averaged $29.01 or about 38% of the WTI Index price. This compares to average realizations of about 40% of WTI in the previous quarter. We expect seasonal factors to provide a modest boost to NGL prices in the fourth quarter. 
Turning now to our Marketing and Midstream division. They continue to deliver impressive results. For the third quarter, our operating profit totaled $125 million, a 20% increase over third quarter 2009. Increased throughput and higher commodity prices drove the improvement. For the fourth quarter, we expect our Marketing and Midstream operating profit to be in the range of $110 million to $130 million. This will bring our full year operating profit to roughly $500 million. 
Looking now at the main expense items for the quarter. As we move forward with a strategic repositioning, we are seeing the efficiency gains flow through to our reported results. On a sequential quarter basis, most expenses decreased during the third quarter on both an absolute and a unit of production basis. Lease operating expenses totaled $415 million in the third quarter or $7.35 per Boe. This represents a 3% decrease from last quarter. This rate is indicative of what we would expect for the fourth quarter. 
Shifting to G&A. G&A expenses continue to be well contained in the third quarter, totaling $131 million. For the first nine months of the year, our G&A costs have declined by $73 million, or 15%, when compared to the same period of 2009. Based on the actual performance for the first three quarters, we now expect our full year 2010 G&A expense to be near the bottom end of our previous forecast range of $580 million to $600 million. 
Turning to interest expense. For the third quarter, it came in at $83 million, right in line with our expectations. When compared to the third quarter of 2009, interest expense decreased by 8% due to lower debt balances. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect interest expense to approximate $80 million. DD&A expense for oil and gas properties declined by 7% from last quarter to $397 million. The improvement in DD&A resulted from the sale of Gulf of Mexico assets. For the fourth quarter, we expect DD&A expense to range between $7 and $7.25 per barrel. 
The final expense item I will touch on is income taxes. After backing out the impact of items that are typically excluded from analyst forecasts, our adjusted third quarter tax rate on earnings from continuing operations came in at 33% of adjusted pretax income. This tax rate consisted of deferred taxes equal to 40% of pretax income and current taxes of a negative 7% for the quarter. This atypical distribution of current and deferred taxes was due to an adjustment related to the filing of our 2009 tax return. Essentially, our 2009 tax return indicated more carryover benefits available for 2010 than we had previously estimated.
The cumulative impact for the first nine months of the year was recorded in the third quarter. In spite of the unusual third quarter tax rate, our adjusted tax rate for the first nine months of 2010 was similar to what we now expect for the full year, with a total rate of 33% of pretax earnings, composed of a 6% current tax rate, and a 27% deferred tax rate. In today's news release, we have provided a table that reconciles the effects of items that are typically excluded from analyst estimates. 
Moving now to the bottom line. Non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations totaled $571 million or $1.31 per diluted share. Higher oil and gas revenues along with strong cost controls increased our adjusted earnings from continuing operations by over 40% when compared to the third quarter of 2009. As Vince mentioned earlier, this result also exceeded the comparable First Call mean number by $0.06. Before we open the call to Q&A, I would like to conclude with a quick review of our financial position.
During the third quarter, Devon generated cash flow before balance sheet changes of $1.8 billion, a 47% increase over the year-ago quarter. Additionally, we received $2 billion of cash from the sale of assets in Azerbaijan and China. After funding our total capital demands for the quarter of $1.8 billion and repurchasing $499 million of common stock, our cash balances increased by over $1 billion during the quarter, reaching a total of $4 billion. With that level of cash, and total debt of roughly $5.6 billion, we clearly maintained a great deal of financial strength and flexibility."

Welcome to Devon's third quarter 2010 earnings call and webcast. Today's call will follow our usual format. I'll begin with some preliminary housekeeping and compliance items and then our President and CEO, John Richels will provide his perspective. Following John's remarks, Dave Hager, our EVP of Exploration and Production will cover the operating highlights and then finally, following Dave's comments, Jeff Agosta, our Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results and our outlook. At that point, we'll open the call up to your questions. Our Executive Chairman, Larry Nichols and other senior members of the management team are with us today for the Q&A session. And as a courtesy to the other participants, we ask that each of you limit your questions to one initial inquiry and one follow-up. We'll limit the call to about an hour, and we will be around for the rest of the day to answer questions after the call. 
A replay of this call will be available later today through a link on Devon's homepage. During the call today, we will provide some color on some of our forward-looking estimates based on the actual results for the first nine months of the year, and our outlook for the balance of 2011 and 2012. We will not be issuing a revised 8-K today, because our outlook for the remainder of the year falls within the updated ranges we provided in the Form 8-K that we filed last August. To access a comprehensive summary of our current guidance, which includes any refinements we make today, you can go to devonenergy.com and click on the Guidance link found within the Investor Relations section of our website. 
Please note that all references today for our plans, forecasts, expectations and estimates, are considered forward-looking statements under U.S. Securities law. And while we always like to provide you with the very best data possible, many factors could cause our actual results to differ from those estimates. You can find a discussion of risk factors related or estimates in the Form 8-K that contains these forecasts. One other compliance note, we'll refer to various non-GAAP performance measures in today's call. When we use these measures, we are required under Securities law to provide certain additional disclosures and those are available for your review on Devon's website. 
By now, most of you are aware that our decision to sell our international assets triggered the accounting rules for discontinued operations. We have therefore excluded international production volumes for all periods presented as well as the revenues and expenses associated with those. Those are collapsed into a single line item at the end of the statement of operations. That line item is labeled Discontinued Operations. For those interested in a more detailed view of our international results, you will find an additional table in today's news release that includes a detailed statement of operations and the related production volumes that are attributable to the international properties. 
As a reminder, the third quarter is our first reporting period without financial or operating results from the Gulf of Mexico. While the international divestiture properties are considered discontinued operations, the Gulf of Mexico divestiture assets are included in results from continuing operations for previous periods. For that reason, we are providing supplemental information in our press release that isolates the results from Devon's North American Onshore operations or, in other words, the go-forward business. 
As far as straight earnings estimates ago, the majority of analysts chose to report estimates to First Call that included only our North American Onshore operations. The mean estimate from those analysts that focused on continuing operations was $1.25 a share for the quarter, that compares to our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1.31 per share. So our actual results beat the street estimate by $0.06 or about 5%. With those items out of the way, I'll turn the call over to President and CEO John Richels.

266510,98042994,84768,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Vince and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2010, Devon delivered another very solid performance both operationally and financially.Production from our North American Onshore properties totaled 613,000 barrels of oil equivalent pe",985,"Thanks, Vince and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2010, Devon delivered another very solid performance both operationally and financially.
Production from our North American Onshore properties totaled 613,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, a 4% increase over the third quarter of 2009. This production growth was driven by an 11% increase in oil and natural gas liquids production. In the current environment, oil and NGLs now account for roughly half of Devon's total oil gas and NGL sales revenue. Strong realized prices for our oil production and improved cost efficiencies resulting from the repositioning drove our adjusted earnings from continuing operations up more than 40% over the year-ago quarter to $571 million or $1.31 per diluted share. 
Cash flow for balance sheet changes climbed 47% over the third quarter of last year and combined with the divestiture proceeds Devon's total cash inflows for the third quarter approached $4 billion, far exceeding our total capital demands for the quarter. As a result, we exited the month of September with an enviable position of $4 billion of cash on hand and a bulletproof balance sheet. 
And on the operations front, we continued successful execution of our focused North American Onshore strategy as evidenced by quarterly production records at our liquids-rich Barnett and Cana shale plays and a multiyear production high from our Permian Basin properties. We also continue to make significant strides during the quarter towards completing the strategic repositioning that we announced just one year ago. In the third quarter, we completed the sales of our interest in the ACG field in Azerbaijan and our remaining assets in China. So to date, we've received aggregate pretax divestiture proceeds of approximately $6.8 billion. 
The only significant divestiture package remaining, that's our Brazilian assets, is under contract for $3.2 billion. This transaction is pending approval by the Brazilian government and all indications are that this transaction will close as expected around year end. Following the closing, we'll have realized total proceeds from our divestiture program exceeding $10 billion or roughly $8 billion after-tax. 
As we have always said, our objective in redeploying the divestiture proceeds is to optimize growth on a debt-adjusted per share basis. To accomplish this objective we've taken a balanced approach by directing $1.7 billion of sales proceeds to reduce debt and by allocating $1.2 billion to capture acreage opportunities across our North American Onshore property base principally in oil- and liquids-rich areas. 
In addition, we initiated a $3.5 billion share repurchase program last May. At today's stock price, $3.5 billion equates to approximately 12% of our outstanding common shares. Through today, we've purchased over 15 million shares for right around $1 billion. This puts us on pace to complete the buyback within the 12- to 18-month timeframe that we originally announced.
Buying back Devon stock is an especially attractive alternative given our current stock price. Our share is currently priced in the mid-60s, translate into a net enterprise value of $110 per proven barrel. And this analysis attributes no value to the thousands of unproved locations that we have within our 13 million net acre resource base in North America. 
Now before I turn the call over to Dave, just want to address a subject that we received a number of questions about, and that is our capital budget and our production profile for 2011.  Given the significant divergence of oil and natural gas prices, similar to what we did in 2010, we expect to focus more than 90% of our 2011 capital on oil and liquids-rich opportunities within our existing portfolio. Although we're still in the process of finalizing our 2011 capital budget and have not yet submitted it to our board for approval, directionally, we have a pretty good idea where we want to go. 
First, recapping 2010, we previously indicated that we expected full year E&P capital to total roughly $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion for our North American Onshore business. We're still comfortable with that range but taking into account continued upward cost pressures in the sector, we now expect to be in the top half of that range. This level of CapEx, I'll just remind you, includes a total of $1.2 billion of acreage capture that includes the $500 million that we invested to acquire the Pike oil sands acreage and about $700 million of additional leasing primarily in oil- and liquids-rich plays in the Permian and Mid-Continent. We would not expect to repeat this spend rate for leasehold acquisition in 2011. Adjusting for that gets you to a normalized spend for 2010 of roughly $4.5 billion for our go-forward North American Onshore E&P capital budget. 
Based on this starting point and assuming a similar level of drilling activity in 2011, with some inflation for service cost, I would expect our 2011 E&P capital budget to fall between $4.5 billion and $4.9 billion. When you take into account Midstream and other capital, our total 2011 capital demands should be somewhere in the neighborhood of $5.5 billion $5.9 billion. And with that level of spending, we would expect overall production growth of 68% led by a roughly 20% growth in oil and NGL volumes.
I want to make this very clear. Our asset base has the capacity to grow at a much higher rate next year but top line growth is not what we are optimizing. We're focused on optimizing our growth per debt-adjusted share. We simply refuse to get caught up in the growth-at-any cost mentality.
Given the current environment, we can deliver optimum results through investing in our liquids-focused capital program, buying back our stock and taking a disciplined approach to our debt balances.
In 2011, we expect these actions to boost production per debt-adjusted share growth into the mid-teens. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Hager, for a review of our quarterly operating highlights. David?

I will begin with a quick recap of company-wide drilling activity. We exited the third quarter with 67 Devon-operated rigs running and during the quarter, we drilled 407 wells.

We exited the third quarter with 67 Devon-operated rigs running and during the quarter, we drilled 407 wells. These include 384 development wells and 23 exploration wells. All but three of the wells were successful.
Capital expenditures for exploration and development from our North American Onshore operations were $1.4 billion for the third quarter, bringing our total through the first nine months to $3.5 billion excluding the Pike acquisition. This level of activity increased third quarter production from retained properties by 4% over the third quarter of 2009, led by an 11% increase in oil and liquids production over the 2009 quarter. 
Moving now to our quarterly operating highlights. First, at our Jackfish thermal oil project in Eastern Alberta, our third quarter daily production averaged a little over 21,000 barrels per day net of royalties. As we indicated in our last quarterly call, Jackfish was taken down for three weeks during the third quarter for scheduled maintenance. Following the turnaround, plant operations were restored on September 30. However, it will take a few weeks to fully restore the steam chambers and climb back to plant capacity. Accordingly, fourth quarter production at Jackfish is expected to average about 23,000 barrels per day net of royalties. Construction of Jackfish 2 is roughly 90% complete and continuing to trend under budget. We expect to begin injecting steam in the second quarter of next year delivering first oil in late 2011 with production ramping throughout 2012.  Our third Jackfish project, Jackfish 3 has now been sanctioned, and we filed a regulatory application during the third quarter. Pending regulatory approval, we could begin site work by late next year with plant startups target for 2015. Detailed engineering work is already underway and we have locked down prices on roughly 85% of the major equipment orders. Devon operates the Jackfish projects and owns 100% working interest. 
At Pike, this is our SAGD oil sands joint venture with BP that we formerly called Kirby. We have begun the appraisal drilling required to determine the optimum development configuration. We expect to complete appraisal drilling this winter with the goal of launching the regulatory process for the first phase of development around the end of 2011. Between Jackfish and Pike, we expect to grow our SAGD oil production to between 150,000 to 175,000 barrels per day by 2020. 
In our Lloydminster oil play in Alberta, we drilled 53 new wells in the third quarter holding production steady at roughly 40,000 barrels equivalent per day in the quarter.
Moving to the Permian Basin. Our net production averaged just over 44,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, up 18% over the third quarter of 2009 and 6% over the second quarter of 2010. Our third quarter oil and NGL production in the Permian was up 23% over 2009 and accounted for roughly 70% of our total Permian volumes.
The growth in liquids speaks to the quality and flexibly of our Property portfolio. As we mentioned last quarter, we are adding to the depth of this portfolio with approximately 200,000 additional acres in several oil- and liquids-rich plays to lease year. We have ramped up activity in several of our key oil plays and now have 17 rigs running in the Permian.
One of these projects is our Wolfberry light oil play where we recently added a fifth rig. We drilled 27 wells during the third quarter including one of our best wells to date in the play, which had a 30-day IP of 500 barrels per day. Our net Wolfberry production has increased nearly 150% since the beginning of  the year to approximately 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our focus over the coming months will be to continue the evaluation of our 200,000 net acre Wolfberry position.
Also in the Permian Basin. We have four rigs running in the Avalon Shale play. Devon has assembled over 200,000 prospective net acres in this condensate- and liquids-rich gas play. So far this year, we have participated in 18 Avalon wells and have a production data on a total of 30 wells covering a wide geographic area. While we are still in the early stages of evaluation of this play, the data support EURs of 400,000 to 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day depending on location within the broader play area, lateral length, et cetera. We expect to participate in 14 additional Avalon wells this year. We're encouraged with the results we have seen and we'll keep you updated as we gain additional information. 
Another focus area in the Permian is the Bone Spring oil play, where Devon has 170,000 net acres. The Bone Spring is an oil play historically developed by vertical drilling. However, with the application of today's horizontal techniques, we have recently seeing some outstanding wells.  In the third quarter, we drilled and completed the strawberry 7 federal 4H [ph]  that we brought online at more than 700 barrels of oil per day. Early results from the six horizontal wells we have drilled to date in this play indicate EURs could have average around 300,000 barrels of equivalent, the cost of $3.8 million per well. We currently have three rigs running in the Bone Spring and expect to drill approximately 20 wells in the play this year. We are also running five additional rigs in the Permian targeting various conventional formations primarily with horizontal wells.
Moving north to the Texas Panhandle, where Devon has approximately 58,000 net acres in the Granite Wash play, we stepped up drilling activity during the quarter with the addition of a third rig that was relocated from the Barnett Shale. In the third quarter, we brought three Devon-operated wells online with average IP rates of 4,290 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 605 barrels of oil or condensate and 1,450 barrels of NGLs. With the attractive rate of returns generated by these wells, it's likely that we'll add additional rigs in the Granite Wash as we head into 2011.
Moving to the Cana-Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma, we continue to add to our acreage position during the quarter and now have approximately 240,000 net acres, focused in the best parts of the play. This has increased our risk resource potential at Cana to more than 10 trillion cubic feet equivalent. In order to continue to derisk our position and secure term acreage that we acquired this year, we have significantly ramped up our drilling activity over the past few months. We currently have 19 operated rigs running and expect to add two additional rigs by year end. We continue to see outstanding results from Cana. In the third quarter, we brought 11 operated wells online with average 24-hour IP rates of 5.3 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including an average of 175 barrels of NGLs and condensate. 
Third quarter net production from Cana averaged a record 117 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day, including 1,300 barrels of condensate per day and 4,000 barrels of NGLs. This is a 12% increase on a sequential quarter basis. By year end 2011, we expect to drive our net Cana production up more than 100% to 250 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 14,000 barrels per day of condensate and NGLs. In addition to enhancing upstream economics, the liquids-rich portion of the Cana field also create opportunities from a midstream perspective. 
To capture this value, just as we have in the Barnett and Arkoma, we are building a gas processing facility. Construction of the Cana plant is essentially complete and we expect to begin processing next month. The facility will have an initial processing capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day and will be capable of extracting up to 15,000 barrels of NGLs per day. The plant's processing capacity is expandable to 600 million a day as our volumes from the field grow. 
Shifting to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas. In the third quarter, our net production reached the previous all-time high of 1.2 Bcf equivalent per day, including over 40,000 barrels of NGLs and condensate per day. This illustrates the depth of our inventory in contrast to that of many of our peers. With virtually no lease expiration issues and thousands of remaining high-quality locations, we have considerable capital flexibility in the Barnett. It is likely that we will choose to run a 12-rig program in 2011 with a focus on the liquids-rich portion of the play. This level of activity should allow us to maintain our current production level. With most of our activity in the Barnett now focused on drilling multiple wells from a single pad, we are finding that we are able to achieve even greater levels of efficiency. We have also continued to improve drilling efficiency and recently set a new record of eight days from spud to rig release for three recent Barnett wells. We are currently running 16 operated rigs in the Barnett, but we'll relocate four of these late next month.
Moving to the Haynesville Shale. After derisking much of our held-by production acreage in the Carthage area during 2009, our 2010 activity has focused on our term acreage in the southern area. However, given the rising service cost environment in the Haynesville, and a deep inventory of other attractive opportunities in our portfolio, our term acreage in the Haynesville does not directly attract capital within our portfolio. Therefore, we are continuing to bring in industry partners that are interested in developing this acreage. Keep in mind, the Haynesville drilling we did in 2009 in the Carthage area confirmed that we have a repeatable, economically attractive play under a more normalized gas price environment. Since this acreage is held by production, we have the luxury of pursuing this resource when the gas price and the cost environment is most favorable.
And finally, in the Horn River Basin of Northern British Columbia, we have now drilled all seven horizontal wells that we planned for this year. Four of these wells have been completed and we expect to have them tied in and producing by year end. Our producing wells at Horn River continue to perform better than expected, supporting an average EUR of 7 to 8 Bcf equivalent per well. Given that the Horn River is dry gas, we plan to spend minimal capital there in 2011. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?

Today, I will begin by looking at some of the key drivers that shaped our third quarter financial results and review how these factors impact our outlook for the upcoming quarter and 2011. As Vince mentioned earli",1388,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will begin by looking at some of the key drivers that shaped our third quarter financial results and review how these factors impact our outlook for the upcoming quarter and 2011. As Vince mentioned earlier, we have reclassified the assets, liabilities and results of operations from our international assets into discontinued operations for all accounting periods presented. Since we completed our exit from the Gulf of Mexico during the second quarter, our third quarter results from continuing ops represent just our North American Onshore operations. Or in other words, the result of the repositioned Devon. 
Looking first to production. In the third quarter, we produced 56.4 million oil equivalent barrels or approximately 613,000 barrels per day. This was in line with the production forecast range we've provided during last quarter's call and about 1% less than last quarter's production for our North American Onshore assets. You may recall that during last quarter's call, we told you that production from the second quarter had benefited from a 9,000 barrel per day royalty adjustment related to prior periods.
Also, due to a scheduled plant turnaround, Jackfish was off-line for three weeks during the third quarter. As a result, average daily production from Jackfish was 8,000 barrels per day lower on a sequential quarter basis. Removing the out-of-period royalty adjustment, and the impact of Jackfish maintenance, sequential quarter production was up almost 2%. On a year-over-year basis, third quarter production for our North American Onshore assets increased 22,000 barrels per day or 4%. As mentioned before, an 11% increase in oil and NGL production drove the favorable comparison. 
Looking ahead, our high-quality North American Onshore assets remain on track to deliver full year production of 223 million to 224 million equivalent barrels. This implies fourth quarter production of 625,000 to 635,000 Boe per day, or roughly 10% over fourth quarter 2009 production. 
Moving to price realizations, starting with oil. In the third quarter, the WTI Index averaged $76.08 per barrel an 11% increase over to third quarter of 2009. Company-wide oil price realizations were near the top end of our guidance range at 82% of WTI. The most notable regional performance was the narrowing of heavy oil differentials in Canada. On the natural gas side, the third quarter benchmark Henry Hub gas price averaged $4.38 per Mcf. But out of third quarter realized gas price before the impact of hedges was 84% of Henry Hub, or $3.67. Cash settlements from our hedging position and regional basis swaps increased our overall price realizations by $1, bringing our all-in price including hedges to $4.67. 
For the fourth quarter of this year, we remain well hedged with approximately 60% of our natural gas production locked in at a weighted average price of $5.87 per Mcf. We also have roughly 70% of our fourth quarter oil production collared with an average floor of $67.47 per barrel and an average ceiling of $96.48. Looking to 2011, we recently added 300 million per day to our gas hedge position, bringing our total up to 525 million cubic feet per day for the year swapped at a weighted average price of $5.56. As part of these recent additions, we sold call options on 12,000 barrels of oil per day for 2011 and '12 at $95 per barrel, and call options on 300 million cubic feet per day of gas for 2012 at $6 per Mcf. Also for 2011, we have collars in place on 33,000 barrels of oil per day where the floor is $75 per barrel and an average ceiling of $109.
We will be posting a schedule on our website after the call with all the details of our hedge position. Looking briefly at NGLs. Our price per barrel in the third quarter averaged $29.01 or about 38% of the WTI Index price. This compares to average realizations of about 40% of WTI in the previous quarter. We expect seasonal factors to provide a modest boost to NGL prices in the fourth quarter. 
Turning now to our Marketing and Midstream division. They continue to deliver impressive results. For the third quarter, our operating profit totaled $125 million, a 20% increase over third quarter 2009. Increased throughput and higher commodity prices drove the improvement. For the fourth quarter, we expect our Marketing and Midstream operating profit to be in the range of $110 million to $130 million. This will bring our full year operating profit to roughly $500 million. 
Looking now at the main expense items for the quarter. As we move forward with a strategic repositioning, we are seeing the efficiency gains flow through to our reported results. On a sequential quarter basis, most expenses decreased during the third quarter on both an absolute and a unit of production basis. Lease operating expenses totaled $415 million in the third quarter or $7.35 per Boe. This represents a 3% decrease from last quarter. This rate is indicative of what we would expect for the fourth quarter. 
Shifting to G&A. G&A expenses continue to be well contained in the third quarter, totaling $131 million. For the first nine months of the year, our G&A costs have declined by $73 million, or 15%, when compared to the same period of 2009. Based on the actual performance for the first three quarters, we now expect our full year 2010 G&A expense to be near the bottom end of our previous forecast range of $580 million to $600 million. 
Turning to interest expense. For the third quarter, it came in at $83 million, right in line with our expectations. When compared to the third quarter of 2009, interest expense decreased by 8% due to lower debt balances. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect interest expense to approximate $80 million. DD&A expense for oil and gas properties declined by 7% from last quarter to $397 million. The improvement in DD&A resulted from the sale of Gulf of Mexico assets. For the fourth quarter, we expect DD&A expense to range between $7 and $7.25 per barrel. 
The final expense item I will touch on is income taxes. After backing out the impact of items that are typically excluded from analyst forecasts, our adjusted third quarter tax rate on earnings from continuing operations came in at 33% of adjusted pretax income. This tax rate consisted of deferred taxes equal to 40% of pretax income and current taxes of a negative 7% for the quarter. This atypical distribution of current and deferred taxes was due to an adjustment related to the filing of our 2009 tax return. Essentially, our 2009 tax return indicated more carryover benefits available for 2010 than we had previously estimated.
The cumulative impact for the first nine months of the year was recorded in the third quarter. In spite of the unusual third quarter tax rate, our adjusted tax rate for the first nine months of 2010 was similar to what we now expect for the full year, with a total rate of 33% of pretax earnings, composed of a 6% current tax rate, and a 27% deferred tax rate. In today's news release, we have provided a table that reconciles the effects of items that are typically excluded from analyst estimates. 
Moving now to the bottom line. Non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations totaled $571 million or $1.31 per diluted share. Higher oil and gas revenues along with strong cost controls increased our adjusted earnings from continuing operations by over 40% when compared to the third quarter of 2009. As Vince mentioned earlier, this result also exceeded the comparable First Call mean number by $0.06. Before we open the call to Q&A, I would like to conclude with a quick review of our financial position.
During the third quarter, Devon generated cash flow before balance sheet changes of $1.8 billion, a 47% increase over the year-ago quarter. Additionally, we received $2 billion of cash from the sale of assets in Azerbaijan and China. After funding our total capital demands for the quarter of $1.8 billion and repurchasing $499 million of common stock, our cash balances increased by over $1 billion during the quarter, reaching a total of $4 billion. With that level of cash, and total debt of roughly $5.6 billion, we clearly maintained a great deal of financial strength and flexibility.

Welcome to Devon's third quarter 2010 earnings call and webcast. Today's call will follow our usual format. I'll begin with some preliminary housekeeping and compliance items and then our President and CEO, John Richels will provide his perspective. Following John's remarks, Dave Hager, our EVP of Exploration and Production will cover the operating highlights and then finally, following Dave's comments, Jeff Agosta, our Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results and our outlook. At that point, we'll open the call up to your questions. Our Executive Chairman, Larry Nichols and other senior members of the management team are with us today for the Q&A session. And as a courtesy to the other participants, we ask that each of you limit your questions to one initial inquiry and one follow-up. We'll limit the call to about an hour, and we will be around for the rest of the day to answer questions after the call. 
A replay of this call will be available later today through a link on Devon's homepage. During the call today, we will provide some color on some of our forward-looking estimates based on the actual results for the first nine months of the year, and our outlook for the balance of 2011 and 2012. We will not be issuing a revised 8-K today, because our outlook for the remainder of the year falls within the updated ranges we provided in the Form 8-K that we filed last August. To access a comprehensive summary of our current guidance, which includes any refinements we make today, you can go to devonenergy.com and click on the Guidance link found within the Investor Relations section of our website. 
Please note that all references today for our plans, forecasts, expectations and estimates, are considered forward-looking statements under U.S. Securities law. And while we always like to provide you with the very best data possible, many factors could cause our actual results to differ from those estimates. You can find a discussion of risk factors related or estimates in the Form 8-K that contains these forecasts. One other compliance note, we'll refer to various non-GAAP performance measures in today's call. When we use these measures, we are required under Securities law to provide certain additional disclosures and those are available for your review on Devon's website. 
By now, most of you are aware that our decision to sell our international assets triggered the accounting rules for discontinued operations. We have therefore excluded international production volumes for all periods presented as well as the revenues and expenses associated with those. Those are collapsed into a single line item at the end of the statement of operations. That line item is labeled Discontinued Operations. For those interested in a more detailed view of our international results, you will find an additional table in today's news release that includes a detailed statement of operations and the related production volumes that are attributable to the international properties. 
As a reminder, the third quarter is our first reporting period without financial or operating results from the Gulf of Mexico. While the international divestiture properties are considered discontinued operations, the Gulf of Mexico divestiture assets are included in results from continuing operations for previous periods. For that reason, we are providing supplemental information in our press release that isolates the results from Devon's North American Onshore operations or, in other words, the go-forward business. 
As far as straight earnings estimates ago, the majority of analysts chose to report estimates to First Call that included only our North American Onshore operations. The mean estimate from those analysts that focused on continuing operations was $1.25 a share for the quarter, that compares to our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1.31 per share. So our actual results beat the street estimate by $0.06 or about 5%. With those items out of the way, I'll turn the call over to President and CEO John Richels."
266510,98042994,84859,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Vince and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2010, Devon delivered another very solid performance both operationally and financially.Production from our North American Onshore properties totaled 613,000 barrels of oil equivalent pe",985,"Thanks, Vince and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2010, Devon delivered another very solid performance both operationally and financially.
Production from our North American Onshore properties totaled 613,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, a 4% increase over the third quarter of 2009. This production growth was driven by an 11% increase in oil and natural gas liquids production. In the current environment, oil and NGLs now account for roughly half of Devon's total oil gas and NGL sales revenue. Strong realized prices for our oil production and improved cost efficiencies resulting from the repositioning drove our adjusted earnings from continuing operations up more than 40% over the year-ago quarter to $571 million or $1.31 per diluted share. 
Cash flow for balance sheet changes climbed 47% over the third quarter of last year and combined with the divestiture proceeds Devon's total cash inflows for the third quarter approached $4 billion, far exceeding our total capital demands for the quarter. As a result, we exited the month of September with an enviable position of $4 billion of cash on hand and a bulletproof balance sheet. 
And on the operations front, we continued successful execution of our focused North American Onshore strategy as evidenced by quarterly production records at our liquids-rich Barnett and Cana shale plays and a multiyear production high from our Permian Basin properties. We also continue to make significant strides during the quarter towards completing the strategic repositioning that we announced just one year ago. In the third quarter, we completed the sales of our interest in the ACG field in Azerbaijan and our remaining assets in China. So to date, we've received aggregate pretax divestiture proceeds of approximately $6.8 billion. 
The only significant divestiture package remaining, that's our Brazilian assets, is under contract for $3.2 billion. This transaction is pending approval by the Brazilian government and all indications are that this transaction will close as expected around year end. Following the closing, we'll have realized total proceeds from our divestiture program exceeding $10 billion or roughly $8 billion after-tax. 
As we have always said, our objective in redeploying the divestiture proceeds is to optimize growth on a debt-adjusted per share basis. To accomplish this objective we've taken a balanced approach by directing $1.7 billion of sales proceeds to reduce debt and by allocating $1.2 billion to capture acreage opportunities across our North American Onshore property base principally in oil- and liquids-rich areas. 
In addition, we initiated a $3.5 billion share repurchase program last May. At today's stock price, $3.5 billion equates to approximately 12% of our outstanding common shares. Through today, we've purchased over 15 million shares for right around $1 billion. This puts us on pace to complete the buyback within the 12- to 18-month timeframe that we originally announced.
Buying back Devon stock is an especially attractive alternative given our current stock price. Our share is currently priced in the mid-60s, translate into a net enterprise value of $110 per proven barrel. And this analysis attributes no value to the thousands of unproved locations that we have within our 13 million net acre resource base in North America. 
Now before I turn the call over to Dave, just want to address a subject that we received a number of questions about, and that is our capital budget and our production profile for 2011.  Given the significant divergence of oil and natural gas prices, similar to what we did in 2010, we expect to focus more than 90% of our 2011 capital on oil and liquids-rich opportunities within our existing portfolio. Although we're still in the process of finalizing our 2011 capital budget and have not yet submitted it to our board for approval, directionally, we have a pretty good idea where we want to go. 
First, recapping 2010, we previously indicated that we expected full year E&P capital to total roughly $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion for our North American Onshore business. We're still comfortable with that range but taking into account continued upward cost pressures in the sector, we now expect to be in the top half of that range. This level of CapEx, I'll just remind you, includes a total of $1.2 billion of acreage capture that includes the $500 million that we invested to acquire the Pike oil sands acreage and about $700 million of additional leasing primarily in oil- and liquids-rich plays in the Permian and Mid-Continent. We would not expect to repeat this spend rate for leasehold acquisition in 2011. Adjusting for that gets you to a normalized spend for 2010 of roughly $4.5 billion for our go-forward North American Onshore E&P capital budget. 
Based on this starting point and assuming a similar level of drilling activity in 2011, with some inflation for service cost, I would expect our 2011 E&P capital budget to fall between $4.5 billion and $4.9 billion. When you take into account Midstream and other capital, our total 2011 capital demands should be somewhere in the neighborhood of $5.5 billion $5.9 billion. And with that level of spending, we would expect overall production growth of 68% led by a roughly 20% growth in oil and NGL volumes.
I want to make this very clear. Our asset base has the capacity to grow at a much higher rate next year but top line growth is not what we are optimizing. We're focused on optimizing our growth per debt-adjusted share. We simply refuse to get caught up in the growth-at-any cost mentality.
Given the current environment, we can deliver optimum results through investing in our liquids-focused capital program, buying back our stock and taking a disciplined approach to our debt balances.
In 2011, we expect these actions to boost production per debt-adjusted share growth into the mid-teens. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Hager, for a review of our quarterly operating highlights. David?"
266510,98042994,84859,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. I will begin with a quick recap of company-wide drilling activity. We exited the third quarter with 67 Devon-operated rigs running and during the quarter, we drilled 407 wells. These include 384 development wells a",1764,"Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. I will begin with a quick recap of company-wide drilling activity. We exited the third quarter with 67 Devon-operated rigs running and during the quarter, we drilled 407 wells. These include 384 development wells and 23 exploration wells. All but three of the wells were successful.
Capital expenditures for exploration and development from our North American Onshore operations were $1.4 billion for the third quarter, bringing our total through the first nine months to $3.5 billion excluding the Pike acquisition. This level of activity increased third quarter production from retained properties by 4% over the third quarter of 2009, led by an 11% increase in oil and liquids production over the 2009 quarter. 
Moving now to our quarterly operating highlights. First, at our Jackfish thermal oil project in Eastern Alberta, our third quarter daily production averaged a little over 21,000 barrels per day net of royalties. As we indicated in our last quarterly call, Jackfish was taken down for three weeks during the third quarter for scheduled maintenance. Following the turnaround, plant operations were restored on September 30. However, it will take a few weeks to fully restore the steam chambers and climb back to plant capacity. Accordingly, fourth quarter production at Jackfish is expected to average about 23,000 barrels per day net of royalties. Construction of Jackfish 2 is roughly 90% complete and continuing to trend under budget. We expect to begin injecting steam in the second quarter of next year delivering first oil in late 2011 with production ramping throughout 2012.  Our third Jackfish project, Jackfish 3 has now been sanctioned, and we filed a regulatory application during the third quarter. Pending regulatory approval, we could begin site work by late next year with plant startups target for 2015. Detailed engineering work is already underway and we have locked down prices on roughly 85% of the major equipment orders. Devon operates the Jackfish projects and owns 100% working interest. 
At Pike, this is our SAGD oil sands joint venture with BP that we formerly called Kirby. We have begun the appraisal drilling required to determine the optimum development configuration. We expect to complete appraisal drilling this winter with the goal of launching the regulatory process for the first phase of development around the end of 2011. Between Jackfish and Pike, we expect to grow our SAGD oil production to between 150,000 to 175,000 barrels per day by 2020. 
In our Lloydminster oil play in Alberta, we drilled 53 new wells in the third quarter holding production steady at roughly 40,000 barrels equivalent per day in the quarter.
Moving to the Permian Basin. Our net production averaged just over 44,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, up 18% over the third quarter of 2009 and 6% over the second quarter of 2010. Our third quarter oil and NGL production in the Permian was up 23% over 2009 and accounted for roughly 70% of our total Permian volumes.
The growth in liquids speaks to the quality and flexibly of our Property portfolio. As we mentioned last quarter, we are adding to the depth of this portfolio with approximately 200,000 additional acres in several oil- and liquids-rich plays to lease year. We have ramped up activity in several of our key oil plays and now have 17 rigs running in the Permian.
One of these projects is our Wolfberry light oil play where we recently added a fifth rig. We drilled 27 wells during the third quarter including one of our best wells to date in the play, which had a 30-day IP of 500 barrels per day. Our net Wolfberry production has increased nearly 150% since the beginning of  the year to approximately 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our focus over the coming months will be to continue the evaluation of our 200,000 net acre Wolfberry position.
Also in the Permian Basin. We have four rigs running in the Avalon Shale play. Devon has assembled over 200,000 prospective net acres in this condensate- and liquids-rich gas play. So far this year, we have participated in 18 Avalon wells and have a production data on a total of 30 wells covering a wide geographic area. While we are still in the early stages of evaluation of this play, the data support EURs of 400,000 to 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day depending on location within the broader play area, lateral length, et cetera. We expect to participate in 14 additional Avalon wells this year. We're encouraged with the results we have seen and we'll keep you updated as we gain additional information. 
Another focus area in the Permian is the Bone Spring oil play, where Devon has 170,000 net acres. The Bone Spring is an oil play historically developed by vertical drilling. However, with the application of today's horizontal techniques, we have recently seeing some outstanding wells.  In the third quarter, we drilled and completed the strawberry 7 federal 4H [ph]  that we brought online at more than 700 barrels of oil per day. Early results from the six horizontal wells we have drilled to date in this play indicate EURs could have average around 300,000 barrels of equivalent, the cost of $3.8 million per well. We currently have three rigs running in the Bone Spring and expect to drill approximately 20 wells in the play this year. We are also running five additional rigs in the Permian targeting various conventional formations primarily with horizontal wells.
Moving north to the Texas Panhandle, where Devon has approximately 58,000 net acres in the Granite Wash play, we stepped up drilling activity during the quarter with the addition of a third rig that was relocated from the Barnett Shale. In the third quarter, we brought three Devon-operated wells online with average IP rates of 4,290 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 605 barrels of oil or condensate and 1,450 barrels of NGLs. With the attractive rate of returns generated by these wells, it's likely that we'll add additional rigs in the Granite Wash as we head into 2011.
Moving to the Cana-Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma, we continue to add to our acreage position during the quarter and now have approximately 240,000 net acres, focused in the best parts of the play. This has increased our risk resource potential at Cana to more than 10 trillion cubic feet equivalent. In order to continue to derisk our position and secure term acreage that we acquired this year, we have significantly ramped up our drilling activity over the past few months. We currently have 19 operated rigs running and expect to add two additional rigs by year end. We continue to see outstanding results from Cana. In the third quarter, we brought 11 operated wells online with average 24-hour IP rates of 5.3 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including an average of 175 barrels of NGLs and condensate. 
Third quarter net production from Cana averaged a record 117 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day, including 1,300 barrels of condensate per day and 4,000 barrels of NGLs. This is a 12% increase on a sequential quarter basis. By year end 2011, we expect to drive our net Cana production up more than 100% to 250 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 14,000 barrels per day of condensate and NGLs. In addition to enhancing upstream economics, the liquids-rich portion of the Cana field also create opportunities from a midstream perspective. 
To capture this value, just as we have in the Barnett and Arkoma, we are building a gas processing facility. Construction of the Cana plant is essentially complete and we expect to begin processing next month. The facility will have an initial processing capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day and will be capable of extracting up to 15,000 barrels of NGLs per day. The plant's processing capacity is expandable to 600 million a day as our volumes from the field grow. 
Shifting to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas. In the third quarter, our net production reached the previous all-time high of 1.2 Bcf equivalent per day, including over 40,000 barrels of NGLs and condensate per day. This illustrates the depth of our inventory in contrast to that of many of our peers. With virtually no lease expiration issues and thousands of remaining high-quality locations, we have considerable capital flexibility in the Barnett. It is likely that we will choose to run a 12-rig program in 2011 with a focus on the liquids-rich portion of the play. This level of activity should allow us to maintain our current production level. With most of our activity in the Barnett now focused on drilling multiple wells from a single pad, we are finding that we are able to achieve even greater levels of efficiency. We have also continued to improve drilling efficiency and recently set a new record of eight days from spud to rig release for three recent Barnett wells. We are currently running 16 operated rigs in the Barnett, but we'll relocate four of these late next month.
Moving to the Haynesville Shale. After derisking much of our held-by production acreage in the Carthage area during 2009, our 2010 activity has focused on our term acreage in the southern area. However, given the rising service cost environment in the Haynesville, and a deep inventory of other attractive opportunities in our portfolio, our term acreage in the Haynesville does not directly attract capital within our portfolio. Therefore, we are continuing to bring in industry partners that are interested in developing this acreage. Keep in mind, the Haynesville drilling we did in 2009 in the Carthage area confirmed that we have a repeatable, economically attractive play under a more normalized gas price environment. Since this acreage is held by production, we have the luxury of pursuing this resource when the gas price and the cost environment is most favorable.
And finally, in the Horn River Basin of Northern British Columbia, we have now drilled all seven horizontal wells that we planned for this year. Four of these wells have been completed and we expect to have them tied in and producing by year end. Our producing wells at Horn River continue to perform better than expected, supporting an average EUR of 7 to 8 Bcf equivalent per well. Given that the Horn River is dry gas, we plan to spend minimal capital there in 2011. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?"
266510,98042994,84859,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will begin by looking at some of the key drivers that shaped our third quarter financial results and review how these factors impact our outlook for the upcoming quarter and 2011. As Vince mentioned earli",1475,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will begin by looking at some of the key drivers that shaped our third quarter financial results and review how these factors impact our outlook for the upcoming quarter and 2011. As Vince mentioned earlier, we have reclassified the assets, liabilities and results of operations from our international assets into discontinued operations for all accounting periods presented. Since we completed our exit from the Gulf of Mexico during the second quarter, our third quarter results from continuing ops represent just our North American Onshore operations. Or in other words, the result of the repositioned Devon. 
Looking first to production. In the third quarter, we produced 56.4 million oil equivalent barrels or approximately 613,000 barrels per day. This was in line with the production forecast range we've provided during last quarter's call and about 1% less than last quarter's production for our North American Onshore assets. You may recall that during last quarter's call, we told you that production from the second quarter had benefited from a 9,000 barrel per day royalty adjustment related to prior periods.
Also, due to a scheduled plant turnaround, Jackfish was off-line for three weeks during the third quarter. As a result, average daily production from Jackfish was 8,000 barrels per day lower on a sequential quarter basis. Removing the out-of-period royalty adjustment, and the impact of Jackfish maintenance, sequential quarter production was up almost 2%. On a year-over-year basis, third quarter production for our North American Onshore assets increased 22,000 barrels per day or 4%. As mentioned before, an 11% increase in oil and NGL production drove the favorable comparison. 
Looking ahead, our high-quality North American Onshore assets remain on track to deliver full year production of 223 million to 224 million equivalent barrels. This implies fourth quarter production of 625,000 to 635,000 Boe per day, or roughly 10% over fourth quarter 2009 production. 
Moving to price realizations, starting with oil. In the third quarter, the WTI Index averaged $76.08 per barrel an 11% increase over to third quarter of 2009. Company-wide oil price realizations were near the top end of our guidance range at 82% of WTI. The most notable regional performance was the narrowing of heavy oil differentials in Canada. On the natural gas side, the third quarter benchmark Henry Hub gas price averaged $4.38 per Mcf. But out of third quarter realized gas price before the impact of hedges was 84% of Henry Hub, or $3.67. Cash settlements from our hedging position and regional basis swaps increased our overall price realizations by $1, bringing our all-in price including hedges to $4.67. 
For the fourth quarter of this year, we remain well hedged with approximately 60% of our natural gas production locked in at a weighted average price of $5.87 per Mcf. We also have roughly 70% of our fourth quarter oil production collared with an average floor of $67.47 per barrel and an average ceiling of $96.48. Looking to 2011, we recently added 300 million per day to our gas hedge position, bringing our total up to 525 million cubic feet per day for the year swapped at a weighted average price of $5.56. As part of these recent additions, we sold call options on 12,000 barrels of oil per day for 2011 and '12 at $95 per barrel, and call options on 300 million cubic feet per day of gas for 2012 at $6 per Mcf. Also for 2011, we have collars in place on 33,000 barrels of oil per day where the floor is $75 per barrel and an average ceiling of $109.
We will be posting a schedule on our website after the call with all the details of our hedge position. Looking briefly at NGLs. Our price per barrel in the third quarter averaged $29.01 or about 38% of the WTI Index price. This compares to average realizations of about 40% of WTI in the previous quarter. We expect seasonal factors to provide a modest boost to NGL prices in the fourth quarter. 
Turning now to our Marketing and Midstream division. They continue to deliver impressive results. For the third quarter, our operating profit totaled $125 million, a 20% increase over third quarter 2009. Increased throughput and higher commodity prices drove the improvement. For the fourth quarter, we expect our Marketing and Midstream operating profit to be in the range of $110 million to $130 million. This will bring our full year operating profit to roughly $500 million. 
Looking now at the main expense items for the quarter. As we move forward with a strategic repositioning, we are seeing the efficiency gains flow through to our reported results. On a sequential quarter basis, most expenses decreased during the third quarter on both an absolute and a unit of production basis. Lease operating expenses totaled $415 million in the third quarter or $7.35 per Boe. This represents a 3% decrease from last quarter. This rate is indicative of what we would expect for the fourth quarter. 
Shifting to G&A. G&A expenses continue to be well contained in the third quarter, totaling $131 million. For the first nine months of the year, our G&A costs have declined by $73 million, or 15%, when compared to the same period of 2009. Based on the actual performance for the first three quarters, we now expect our full year 2010 G&A expense to be near the bottom end of our previous forecast range of $580 million to $600 million. 
Turning to interest expense. For the third quarter, it came in at $83 million, right in line with our expectations. When compared to the third quarter of 2009, interest expense decreased by 8% due to lower debt balances. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect interest expense to approximate $80 million. DD&A expense for oil and gas properties declined by 7% from last quarter to $397 million. The improvement in DD&A resulted from the sale of Gulf of Mexico assets. For the fourth quarter, we expect DD&A expense to range between $7 and $7.25 per barrel. 
The final expense item I will touch on is income taxes. After backing out the impact of items that are typically excluded from analyst forecasts, our adjusted third quarter tax rate on earnings from continuing operations came in at 33% of adjusted pretax income. This tax rate consisted of deferred taxes equal to 40% of pretax income and current taxes of a negative 7% for the quarter. This atypical distribution of current and deferred taxes was due to an adjustment related to the filing of our 2009 tax return. Essentially, our 2009 tax return indicated more carryover benefits available for 2010 than we had previously estimated.
The cumulative impact for the first nine months of the year was recorded in the third quarter. In spite of the unusual third quarter tax rate, our adjusted tax rate for the first nine months of 2010 was similar to what we now expect for the full year, with a total rate of 33% of pretax earnings, composed of a 6% current tax rate, and a 27% deferred tax rate. In today's news release, we have provided a table that reconciles the effects of items that are typically excluded from analyst estimates. 
Moving now to the bottom line. Non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations totaled $571 million or $1.31 per diluted share. Higher oil and gas revenues along with strong cost controls increased our adjusted earnings from continuing operations by over 40% when compared to the third quarter of 2009. As Vince mentioned earlier, this result also exceeded the comparable First Call mean number by $0.06. Before we open the call to Q&A, I would like to conclude with a quick review of our financial position.
During the third quarter, Devon generated cash flow before balance sheet changes of $1.8 billion, a 47% increase over the year-ago quarter. Additionally, we received $2 billion of cash from the sale of assets in Azerbaijan and China. After funding our total capital demands for the quarter of $1.8 billion and repurchasing $499 million of common stock, our cash balances increased by over $1 billion during the quarter, reaching a total of $4 billion. With that level of cash, and total debt of roughly $5.6 billion, we clearly maintained a great deal of financial strength and flexibility.
Overall, we believe our measured approach to the business and our balanced, high-quality property base place Devon in an advantageous position during this period of uncertain gas prices. Our deep and diverse inventory of oil and liquids opportunities provides us with great flexibility in allocating capital and response to market conditions. We remain committed to exercising capital discipline, maximizing our margins, maintaining our balance sheet strength and optimizing our growth per debt-adjusted share. At this point, we'll turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A."

As you recall a year ago, when we announced our repositioning, we indicated that as a result of the fact we had kind of starved our North American asset base for a couple of years, we would take some portion of the proceeds from our asset sales and invest them in both 2010 and 2011 in our capital program. So depending on what kind of price forecasts you look at for next year, that will result in some investments next year that's in addition to our cash flow for the year. And that was always intended. What the exact level of that turns out to be, as I mentioned, will depend on what commodity prices are next year. But we clearly have the financial strength to do that and it's an appropriate thing for us to do given that we're investing in very solid return projects. And then I'll ask Dave to maybe answer the question on the ramp up."

And again, we haven't finalized that board approval on our budget but we do have some ideas here as on what we think the rig count may look like. It's actually pretty steady through all of our divisions with the exception of Canada, where of course you have increased drilling activity in the winter until you have a higher recount in Canada during the winter months. So Canada first quarter will probably have on the order of around 20 rigs working, about 11 or so we're anticipating in the thermal-type activity primarily at Pike, where we'll be doing strat wells and then we'll have a couple of rigs at Lloydminster. And then about seven or eight working on other various places throughout Canada, some Cardium oil plays, some deep-basin plays, et cetera, but around 20 and then now fall off in the second, third, fourth quarters to around eight to 10 range on an overall basis. The other three divisions we have Central, Southern and Western will be pretty constant. Let me just give you some numbers for that. At Cana, we mentioned we're going to be up around 21 by year end. We actually plan to average around 23 rigs in Cana next year. And we mentioned at Barnett, we plan to run about 12-rig program, which would keep production flat there. We have about three to four rigs working in the Granite Wash  area. Then at our Southern division, down in the Haynesville, we mentioned that we are really going down to essentially no activity there. We will have a total about five rigs working various opportunities throughout South Texas area total for the year. Then we have about 20 rigs in what we call our Western division, with about 17 of those rigs working the Permian Basin area. About 17 of those, about three of them, in the Rockies area. There's a couple working oil opportunities up in the Powder River and one working Washing Key [ph]. If you want a little further breakdown on the 17 rigs in the Permian that we're going to have working there next year, we'll probably have about five rigs working in the Wolfberry play, about three working the Avalon, four working Bone Springs, and about five working other opportunities we have in the Permian, including Delaware, Wolfcamp, Tubb, other conventional plays we have there. So hopefully, that gives you all the details you need a not-yet-approved budget, but a kind of a planned out budget for 2011."

Now we think that we can have increased efficiencies in our operations is going to lower that. And we're planning in our budgeting process for about a 10% increased cost environment versus 2010. An important thing to remember is we are a very strong player in a vast majority of the plays where we are active, whether it's the Barnett or to Cana, or even out in the Permian Basin. And so we command to a large degree, I guess, attention, as you might say, and that we can -- we've had good luck with our -- we have a strong position of getting good cooperation with the service companies to lock in our -- particularly, the pressure pumping side. So in those areas that I mentioned, we really aren't having a significant problem. The only area we've had much of a problem with delays on frac dates such they would be in the Haynesville, where we are not a large player compared to others. And we don't want to become a large payer because we think the economics are not attractive there compared to other areas of our portfolio. And so we've had some delays. We do have frac dates locked in for about our eight remaining wells in the Haynesville between now and the end of the year.

At that point, we'll open the call up to your questions. Our Executive Chairman, Larry Nichols and other senior members of the management team are with us today for the Q&A session. And as a courtesy to the other participants, we ask that each of you limit your questions to one initial inquiry and one follow-up. We'll limit the call to about an hour, and we will be around for the rest of the day to answer questions after the call. 
A replay of this call will be available later today through a link on Devon's homepage. During the call today, we will provide some color on some of our forward-looking estimates based on the actual results for the first nine months of the year, and our outlook for the balance of 2011 and 2012. We will not be issuing a revised 8-K today, because our outlook for the remainder of the year falls within the updated ranges we provided in the Form 8-K that we filed last August. To access a comprehensive summary of our current guidance, which includes any refinements we make today, you can go to devonenergy.com and click on the Guidance link found within the Investor Relations section of our website. 
Please note that all references today for our plans, forecasts, expectations and estimates, are considered forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law. And while we always like to provide you with the very best data possible, many factors could cause our actual results to differ from those estimates. You can find a discussion of risk factors related or estimates in the Form 8-K that contains these forecasts. One other compliance note, we'll refer to various non-GAAP performance measures in today's call. When we use these measures, we are required under securities law to provide certain additional disclosures and those are available for your review on Devon's website. 
By now, most of you are aware that our decision to sell our international assets triggered the accounting rules for discontinued operations. We have therefore excluded international production volumes for all periods presented as well as the revenues and expenses associated with those. Those are collapsed into a single line item at the end of the statement of operations. That line item is labeled Discontinued Operations. For those interested in a more detailed view of our international results, you will find an additional table in today's news release that includes a detailed statement of operations and the related production volumes that are attributable to the international properties. 
As a reminder, the third quarter is our first reporting period without financial or operating results from the Gulf of Mexico. While the international divestiture properties are considered discontinued operations, the Gulf of Mexico divestiture assets are included in results from continuing operations for previous periods. For that reason, we are providing supplemental information in our press release that isolates the results from Devon's North American Onshore operations or, in other words, the go-forward business. 
As far as Street earnings estimates go, the majority of analysts chose to report estimates to First Call that included only our North American Onshore operations. The mean estimate from those analysts that focused on continuing operations was $1.25 a share for the quarter, that compares to our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1.31 per share. So our actual results beat the street estimate by $0.06 or about 5%. With those items out of the way, I'll turn the call over to President and CEO John Richels."
266510,98042994,85207,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Vince. And good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2010, Devon delivered another very solid performance both operationally and financially.Production from our North American Onshore properties totaled 613,000 barrels of oil equivalent p",991,"Thanks, Vince. And good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2010, Devon delivered another very solid performance both operationally and financially.
Production from our North American Onshore properties totaled 613,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, a 4% increase over the third quarter of 2009. This production growth was driven by an 11% increase in oil and natural gas liquids production. In the current environment, oil and NGLs now account for roughly half of Devon's total oil gas and NGL sales revenue. Strong realized prices for our oil production and improved cost efficiencies resulting from the repositioning drove our adjusted earnings from continuing operations up more than 40% over the year-ago quarter to $571 million or $1.31 per diluted share. 
Cash flow before balance sheet changes climbed 47% over the third quarter of last year and combined with the divestiture proceeds, Devon's total cash inflows for the third quarter approached $4 billion, far exceeding our total capital demands for the quarter. As a result, we exited the month of September with an enviable position of $4 billion of cash on hand and a bulletproof balance sheet. 
And on the operations front, we continued successful execution of our focused North American Onshore strategy as evidenced by quarterly production records at our liquids-rich Barnett and Cana shale plays and a multi-year production high from our Permian Basin properties. We also continue to make significant strides during the quarter towards completing the strategic repositioning that we announced just one year ago. In the third quarter, we completed the sales of our interest in the ACG field in Azerbaijan and our remaining assets in China. So to date, we've received aggregate pretax divestiture proceeds of approximately $6.8 billion. 
The only significant divestiture package remaining, that's our Brazilian assets, is under contract for $3.2 billion. This transaction is pending approval by the Brazilian government and all indications are that this transaction will close as expected around year-end. Following the closing, we'll have realized total proceeds from our divestiture program exceeding $10 billion or roughly $8 billion after-tax. 
As we have always said, our objective in redeploying the divestiture proceeds is to optimize growth on a debt-adjusted per share basis. To accomplish this objective we've taken a balanced approach by directing $1.7 billion of sales proceeds to reduce debt and by allocating $1.2 billion to capture acreage opportunities across our North American Onshore property base principally in oil- and liquids-rich areas. 
In addition, we initiated a $3.5 billion share repurchase program last May. At today's stock price, $3.5 billion equates to approximately 12% of our outstanding common shares. Through today, we've purchased over 15 million shares for right around $1 billion. This puts us on pace to complete the buyback within the 12- to 18-month timeframe that we originally announced.
Buying back Devon stock is an especially attractive alternative given our current stock price. Our share is currently priced in the mid-60s, translate into a net enterprise value of $110 per proven barrel. And this analysis attributes no value to the thousands of unproved locations that we have within our 13 million net acre resource base in North America. 
Now before I turn the call over to Dave, I just want to address a subject that we received a number of questions about, and that is our capital budget and our production profile for 2011.  Given the significant divergence of oil and natural gas prices, similar to what we did in 2010, we expect to focus more than 90% of our 2011 capital on oil and liquids-rich opportunities within our existing portfolio. Although we're still in the process of finalizing our 2011 capital budget and have not yet submitted it to our board for approval, directionally, we have a pretty good idea of where we want to go. 
First, recapping 2010, we previously indicated that we expected full year E&P capital to total roughly $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion for our North American Onshore business. We're still comfortable with it, with that range but taking into account continued upward cost pressures in the sector, we now expect to be in the top half of that range. This level of CapEx, I'll just remind you, includes a total of $1.2 billion of acreage capture that includes the $500 million that we invested to acquire the Pike oil sands acreage and about $700 million of additional leasing primarily in oil- and liquids-rich plays in the Permian and Mid-Continent. We would not expect to repeat this spend rate for leasehold acquisition in 2011. Adjusting for that, gets you to a normalized spend for 2010 of roughly $4.5 billion for our go-forward North American Onshore E&P capital budget. 
Based on this starting point and assuming a similar level of drilling activity in 2011, with some inflation for service costs, I would expect our 2011 E&P capital budget to fall between $4.5 billion and $4.9 billion. When you take into account Midstream and other capital, our total 2011 capital demands should be somewhere in the neighborhood of $5.5 billion to $5.9 billion. And with that level of spending, we would expect overall production growth of 6% to 8% led by a roughly 20% growth in oil and NGL volumes.
I want to make this very clear. Our asset base has the capacity to grow at a much higher rate next year but top line growth is not what we are optimizing. We're focused on optimizing our growth per debt-adjusted share. We simply refuse to get caught up in the growth-at-any cost mentality.
Given the current environment, we can deliver optimum results through investing in our liquids-focused capital program, buying back our stock and taking a disciplined approach to our debt balances.
In 2011, we expect these actions to boost production per debt-adjusted share growth into the mid-teens. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Hager, for a review of our quarterly operating highlights. David?"
266510,98042994,85207,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. And good morning, everyone. I will begin with a quick recap of company-wide drilling activity. We exited the third quarter with 67 Devon-operated rigs running and during the quarter, we drilled 407 wells. These include 384 development wells",1762,"Thanks, John. And good morning, everyone. I will begin with a quick recap of company-wide drilling activity. We exited the third quarter with 67 Devon-operated rigs running and during the quarter, we drilled 407 wells. These include 384 development wells and 23 exploration wells. All but three of the wells were successful.
Capital expenditures for exploration and development from our North American Onshore operations were $1.4 billion for the third quarter, bringing our total through the first nine months to $3.5 billion excluding the Pike acquisition. This level of activity increased third quarter production from retained properties by 4% over the third quarter of 2009, led by an 11% increase in oil and liquids production over the 2009 quarter. 
Moving now to our quarterly operating highlights. First, at our Jackfish thermal oil project in Eastern Alberta, our third quarter daily production averaged a little over 21,000 barrels per day net of royalties. As we indicated in our last quarterly call, Jackfish was taken down for three weeks during the third quarter for scheduled maintenance. Following the turnaround, plant operations were restored on September 30. However, it will take a few weeks to fully restore the steam chambers and climb back to plant capacity. Accordingly, fourth quarter production at Jackfish is expected to average about 23,000 barrels per day net of royalties. Construction of Jackfish 2 is roughly 90% complete and continuing to trend under budget. We expect to begin injecting steam in the second quarter of next year delivering first oil in late 2011 with production ramping throughout 2012.  Our third Jackfish project, Jackfish 3 has now been sanctioned, and we filed a regulatory application during the third quarter. Pending regulatory approval, we could begin site work by late next year with plant startups targeted for 2015. Detailed engineering work is already underway and we have locked down prices on roughly 85% of the major equipment orders. Devon operates the Jackfish projects and owns 100% working interest. 
At Pike, this is our SAGD oil sands joint venture with BP that we formerly called Kirby, we have begun the appraisal drilling required to determine the optimum development configuration. We expect to complete appraisal drilling this winter with the goal of launching the regulatory process for the first phase of development around the end of 2011. Between Jackfish and Pike, we expect to grow our SAGD oil production to between 150,000 to 175,000 barrels per day by 2020. 
In our Lloydminster oil play in Alberta, we drilled 53 new wells in the third quarter holding production steady at roughly 40,000 barrels equivalent per day in the quarter.
Moving to the Permian Basin. Our net production averaged just over 44,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, up 18% over the third quarter of 2009 and 6% over the second quarter of 2010. Our third quarter oil and NGL production in the Permian was up 23% over 2009 and accounted for roughly 70% of our total Permian volumes.
The growth in liquids speaks to the quality and flexibly of our Property portfolio. As we mentioned last quarter, we are adding to the depth of this portfolio with approximately 200,000 additional acres in several oil- and liquids-rich plays to lease year. We have ramped up activity in several of our key oil plays and now have 17 rigs running in the Permian.
One of these projects is our Wolfberry light oil play where we recently added a fifth rig. We drilled 27 wells during the third quarter including one of our best wells to date in the play, which had a 30-day IP of 500 barrels per day. Our net Wolfberry production has increased nearly 150% since the beginning of the year to approximately 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our focus over the coming months will be to continue the evaluation of our 200,000 net acre Wolfberry position.
Also in the Permian Basin, we have four rigs running in the Avalon Shale play. Devon has assembled over 200,000 prospective net acres in this condensate- and liquids-rich gas play. So far this year, we have participated in 18 Avalon wells and have a production data on a total of 30 wells covering a wide geographic area. While we are still in the early stages of evaluation of this play, the data support EURs of 400,000 to 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day depending on location within the broader play area, lateral length, et cetera. We expect to participate in 14 additional Avalon wells this year. We're encouraged with the results we have seen and we'll keep you updated as we gain additional information. 
Another focus area in the Permian is the Bone Spring oil play, where Devon has 170,000 net acres. The Bone Spring is an oil play historically developed by vertical drilling. However, with the application of today's horizontal techniques, we have recently seen some outstanding wells.  In the third quarter, we drilled and completed the Strawberry 7 Federal 4H that we brought online at more than 700 barrels of oil per day. Early results from the six horizontal wells we have drilled to date in this play indicate EURs could have average around 300,000 barrels of equivalent, the cost of $3.8 million per well. We currently have three rigs running in the Bone Spring and expect to drill approximately 20 wells in the play this year. We are also running five additional rigs in the Permian targeting various conventional formations primarily with horizontal wells.
Moving north to the Texas Panhandle, where Devon has approximately 58,000 net acres in the Granite Wash play, we stepped up drilling activity during the quarter with the addition of a third rig that was relocated from the Barnett Shale. In the third quarter, we brought three Devon-operated wells online with average IP rates of 4,290 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 605 barrels of oil or condensate and 1,450 barrels of NGLs. With the attractive rate of returns generated by these wells, it's likely that we'll add additional rigs in the Granite Wash as we head into 2011.
Moving to the Cana-Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma, we continue to add to our acreage position during the third quarter and now have approximately 240,000 net acres, focused in the best parts of the play. This has increased our risked resource potential at Cana to more than 10 trillion cubic feet equivalent. In order to continue to de-risk our position and secure the term acreage that we acquired this year, we have significantly ramped up our drilling activity over the past few months. We currently have 19 operated rigs running and expect to add two additional rigs by year-end. We continue to see outstanding results from Cana. In the third quarter, we brought 11 operated wells online with average 24-hour IP rates of 5.3 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including an average of 175 barrels of NGLs and condensate. 
Third quarter net production from Cana averaged a record 117 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day, including 1,300 barrels of condensate per day and 4,000 barrels of NGLs. This is a 12% increase on a sequential quarter basis. By year-end 2011, we expect to drive our net Cana production up more than 100% to 250 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 14,000 barrels per day of condensate and NGLs. In addition to enhancing upstream economics, the liquids-rich portion of the Cana field also create opportunities from a midstream perspective. 
To capture this value, just as we have in the Barnett and Arkoma, we are building a gas processing facility. Construction of the Cana plant is essentially complete and we expect to begin processing next month. The facility will have an initial processing capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day and will be capable of extracting up to 15,000 barrels of NGLs per day. The plant's processing capacity is expandable to 600 million a day as our volumes from the field grow. 
Shifting to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas. In the third quarter, our net production reached the previous all-time high of 1.2 Bcf equivalent per day, including over 40,000 barrels of NGLs and condensate per day. This illustrates the depth of our inventory in contrast to that of many of our peers. With virtually no lease expiration issues and thousands of remaining high-quality locations, we have considerable capital flexibility in the Barnett. It is likely that we will choose to run a 12-rig program in 2011 with a focus on the liquids-rich portion of the play. This level of activity should allow us to maintain our current production level. With most of our activity in the Barnett now focused on drilling multiple wells from a single pad, we are finding that we are able to achieve even greater levels of efficiency. We have also continued to improve drilling efficiency and recently set a new record of eight days from spud to rig release for three recent Barnett wells. We are currently running 16 operated rigs in the Barnett, but we'll relocate four of these late next month.
Moving to the Haynesville Shale. After de-risking much of our held-by production acreage in the Carthage area during 2009, our 2010 activity has focused on our term acreage in the southern area. However, given the rising service costs environment in the Haynesville, and a deep inventory of other attractive opportunities in our portfolio, our term acreage in the Haynesville does not directly attract capital within our portfolio. Therefore, we are continuing to bring in industry partners that are interested in developing this acreage. Keep in mind, the Haynesville drilling we did in 2009 in the Carthage area confirmed that we have a repeatable, economically attractive play under a more normalized gas price environment. Since this acreage is held by production, we have the luxury of pursuing this resource when the gas price and the cost environment is most favorable.
And finally, in the Horn River Basin of Northern British Columbia, we have now drilled all seven horizontal wells that we planned for this year. Four of these wells have been completed and we expect to have them tied in and producing by year-end. Our producing wells at Horn River continue to perform better than expected, supporting an average EUR of 7 to 8 Bcf equivalent per well. Given that the Horn River is dry gas, we plan to spend minimal capital there in 2011. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?"
266510,98042994,85207,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dave. And good morning, everyone. Today, I will begin by looking at some of the key drivers that shaped our third quarter financial results and review how these factors impact our outlook for the upcoming quarter and 2011. As Vince mentioned earli",1475,"Thanks, Dave. And good morning, everyone. Today, I will begin by looking at some of the key drivers that shaped our third quarter financial results and review how these factors impact our outlook for the upcoming quarter and 2011. As Vince mentioned earlier, we have reclassified the assets, liabilities and results of operations from our international assets into discontinued operations for all accounting periods presented. Since we completed our exit from the Gulf of Mexico during the second quarter, our third quarter results from continuing ops represent just our North American Onshore operations. Or in other words, the result of the repositioned Devon. 
Looking first to production. In the third quarter, we produced 56.4 million oil equivalent barrels or approximately 613,000 barrels per day. This was in line with the production forecast range we've provided during last quarter's call and about 1% less than last quarter's production for our North American Onshore assets. You may recall that during last quarter's call, we told you that production from the second quarter had benefited from a 9,000 barrel per day royalty adjustment related to prior periods.
Also, due to a scheduled plant turnaround, Jackfish was off-line for three weeks during the third quarter. As a result, average daily production from Jackfish was 8,000 barrels per day lower on a sequential quarter basis. Removing the out-of-period royalty adjustment, and the impact of Jackfish maintenance, sequential quarter production was up almost 2%. On a year-over-year basis, third quarter production for our North American Onshore assets increased 22,000 barrels per day or 4%. As mentioned before, an 11% increase in oil and NGL production drove the favorable comparison. 
Looking ahead, our high-quality North American Onshore assets remain on track to deliver full year production of 223 million to 224 million equivalent barrels. This implies fourth quarter production of 625,000 to 635,000 Boe per day, or roughly 10% over fourth quarter 2009 production. 
Moving to price realizations, starting with oil. In the third quarter, the WTI Index averaged $76.08 per barrel, an 11% increase over the third quarter of 2009. Company-wide oil price realizations were near the top end of our guidance range at 82% of WTI. The most notable regional performance was the narrowing of heavy oil differentials in Canada. On the natural gas side, the third quarter benchmark Henry Hub gas price averaged $4.38 per Mcf. But our third quarter realized gas price, before the impact of hedges, was 84% of Henry Hub, or $3.67. Cash settlements from our hedging position and regional basis swaps increased our overall price realizations by $1.00, bringing our all-in price, including hedges, to $4.67. 
For the fourth quarter of this year, we remain well hedged with approximately 60% of our natural gas production locked in at a weighted average price of $5.87 per Mcf. We also have roughly 70% of our fourth quarter oil production collared with an average floor of $67.47 per barrel and an average ceiling of $96.48. Looking to 2011, we recently added 300 million per day to our gas hedge position, bringing our total up to 525 million cubic feet per day for the year swapped at a weighted average price of $5.56. As part of these recent additions, we sold call options on 12,000 barrels of oil per day for 2011 and '12 at $95 per barrel, and call options on 300 million cubic feet per day of gas for 2012 at $6 per Mcf. Also for 2011, we have collars in place on 33,000 barrels of oil per day with a floor of $75 per barrel and an average ceiling of $109.
We will be posting a schedule on our website after the call with all the details of our hedged position. Looking briefly at NGLs, our price per barrel in the third quarter averaged $29.01 or about 38% of the WTI Index price. This compares to average realizations of about 40% of WTI in the previous quarter. We expect seasonal factors to provide a modest boost to NGL prices in the fourth quarter. 
Turning now to our Marketing and Midstream divisions. They continue to deliver impressive results. For the third quarter, our operating profit totaled $125 million, a 20% increase over third quarter 2009. Increased throughput and higher commodity prices drove the improvement. For the fourth quarter, we expect our Marketing and Midstream operating profit to be in the range of $110 million to $130 million. This will bring our full year operating profit to roughly $500 million. 
Looking now at the main expense items for the quarter. As we move forward with a strategic repositioning, we are seeing the efficiency gains flow through to our reported results. On a sequential quarter basis, most expenses decreased during the third quarter on both an absolute and a unit of production basis. Lease operating expenses totaled $415 million in the third quarter or $7.35 per Boe. This represents a 3% decrease from last quarter. This rate is indicative of what we would expect for the fourth quarter. 
Shifting to G&A. G&A expenses continue to be well contained in the third quarter, totaling $131 million. For the first nine months of the year, our G&A costs have declined by $73 million, or 15%, when compared to the same period of 2009. Based on the actual performance for the first three quarters, we now expect our full year 2010 G&A expense to be near the bottom end of our previous forecast range of $580 million to $600 million. 
Turning to interest expense. For the third quarter, it came in at $83 million, right in line with our expectations. When compared to the third quarter of 2009, interest expense decreased by 8% due to lower debt balances. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect interest expense to approximate $80 million. DD&A expense for oil and gas properties declined by 7% from last quarter to $397 million. The improvement in DD&A resulted from the sale of Gulf of Mexico assets. For the fourth quarter, we expect DD&A expense to range between $7.00 and $7.25 per barrel. 
The final expense item I will touch on is income taxes. After backing out the impact of items that are typically excluded from analyst forecasts, our adjusted third quarter tax rate on earnings from continuing operations came in at 33% of adjusted pretax income. This tax rate consisted of deferred taxes equal to 40% of pretax income and current taxes of a negative 7% for the quarter. This atypical distribution of current and deferred taxes was due to an adjustment related to the filing of our 2009 tax return. Essentially, our 2009 tax return indicated more carryover benefits available for 2010 than we had previously estimated.
The cumulative impact for the first nine months of the year was recorded in the third quarter. In spite of the unusual third quarter tax rate, our adjusted tax rate for the first nine months of 2010 was similar to what we now expect for the full year, with a total rate of 33% of pretax earnings, composed of a 6% current tax rate, and a 27% deferred tax rate. In today's news release, we have provided a table that reconciles the effects of items that are typically excluded from analyst estimates. 
Moving now to the bottom line. Non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations totaled $571 million or $1.31 per diluted share. Higher oil and gas revenues along with strong cost controls increased our adjusted earnings from continuing operations by over 40% when compared to the third quarter of 2009. As Vince mentioned earlier, this result also exceeded the comparable First Call mean number by $0.06. Before we open the call to Q&A, I would like to conclude with a quick review of our financial position.
During the third quarter, Devon generated cash flow before balance sheet changes of $1.8 billion, a 47% increase over the year-ago quarter. Additionally, we received $2 billion of cash from the sale of assets in Azerbaijan and China. After funding our total capital demands for the quarter of $1.8 billion and repurchasing $499 million of common stock, our cash balances increased by over $1 billion during the quarter, reaching a total of $4 billion. With that level of cash, and total debt of roughly $5.6 billion, we clearly maintain a great deal of financial strength and flexibility.
Overall, we believe our measured approach to the business and our balanced, high-quality property base, place Devon in an advantageous position during this period of uncertain gas prices. Our deep and diverse inventory of oil and liquids opportunities provides us with great flexibility in allocating capital in response to market conditions. We remain committed to exercising capital discipline, maximizing our margins, maintaining our balance sheet strength and optimizing our growth per debt-adjusted share. At this point, I  will turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A."

As you recall a year ago, when we announced our repositioning, we indicated that as a result of the fact we had kind of starved our North American asset base for a couple of years, we would take some portion of the proceeds from our asset sales and invest them in both 2010 and 2011 in our capital program. So depending on what kind of price forecasts you look at for next year, that will result in some investment next year that's in addition to our cash flow for the year. And that was always intended. What the exact level of that turns out to be, as I mentioned, will depend on what commodity prices are next year. But we clearly have the financial strength to do that and it's an appropriate thing for us to do given that we're investing in very solid return projects. And then I'll ask Dave to maybe answer the question on the ramp up."

And again, we haven't finalized and have board approval on our budget, but we do have some ideas here as on what we think the rig count may look like. It's actually pretty steady through all of our divisions with the exception of Canada, where of course you have increased drilling activity in the winter and so you have a higher rig count in Canada during the winter months. So Canada first quarter will probably have on the order of around 20 rigs working, about 11 or so we're anticipating in the thermal-type activity primarily at Pike, where we'll be doing strat wells and then we'll have a couple of rigs at Lloydminster. And then about seven or eight working on other various plays throughout Canada. Some Cardium oil plays, some deep-basin plays, et cetera, but around 20 and that’ll fall off in the second, third, fourth quarters to around eight to 10 range on an overall basis. The other three divisions we have Central, Southern and Western will be pretty constant. Let me just give you some numbers for that. At Cana, we mentioned we're going to be up around 21 by year-end. We actually plan to average around 23 rigs in Cana next year. And we mentioned in Barnett, we plan to run about 12-rig program, which would keep production flat there. We have about three to four rigs working in the Granite Wash  area. Then down in our Southern division, down in Haynesville, we mentioned that we are really going down to essentially no activity there. We will have a total about five rigs working various opportunities throughout our South Texas area total for the year. Then we have about 20 rigs in what we call our Western division, with about 17 of those rigs working the Permian Basin area. About 17 of those, about three of them, in the Rockies area. There's a couple working oil opportunities up in the Powder River and one working Washakie. If you want a little further breakdown on the 17 rigs in the Permian that we're going to have working there next year, we'll probably have about five rigs working in the Wolfberry play, about three working the Avalon, four working Bone Springs, and about five working other opportunities we have in the Permian, including Delaware, Wolfcamp, Tubb, other conventional plays we have there. So hopefully, that gives you all the details you need a not-yet-approved budget, but a kind of a planned out budget for 2011."

Now we think that we can have increased efficiencies in our operations is going to lower that. And we're planning in our budgeting process for about a 10% increased cost environment versus 2010. An important thing to remember is we are a very strong player in a vast majority of the plays where we are active, whether it’s the Barnett or the Cana, or even out in the Permian Basin. And so we command to a large degree, I guess, attention, as you might say, and that we can -- we've had good luck with our -- we have a strong position of getting good cooperation with the service companies to lock in our -- particularly, the pressure pumping side. So in those areas that I mentioned, we really aren't having a significant problem. The only area we've had much of a problem with delays on frac dates such they would be in the Haynesville, where we are not a large player compared to others. And we don't want to become a large payer because we think the economics are not attractive there compared to other areas of our portfolio. And so we've had some delays. We do have frac dates locked in for about our eight remaining wells in the Haynesville between now and the end of the year. But it's just not a big problem for us overall to get frac dates locked in, although we obviously are -- as I said, we plan on about 10% cost increase, 11% versus 10%."
