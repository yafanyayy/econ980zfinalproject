Our earnings per share were $0.59 or $712 million on an operating basis there $0.55 or $667 million. In Q4, our balance sheet remains strong as evidenced by the fact that we had a much lower provision and we actually had a small securities gain. This is the first time we've had a securities gain in a quarterly results since the second quarter of '07. So it's welcome to finally see that bit of a turnaround and a pretty solid indication of how differently we should view the securities market versus a year ago or two years ago.Several of our core businesses are showing some improvement with a particularly strong quarter in asset management. However, the persistently low interest rate environment around the world continues to challenge our net interest revenue. It also impacts fee revenue due to fee waivers that are pretty substantial in our company. Todd is going to talk a little bit more about that a little later on. Fee revenue was actually up 2% versus the prior quarter, excluding the net impact of third quarter asset sales. We had excellent growth in assets and wealth management fees. They were up 13%. We had a net long-term asset flows of $14 billion, which was the biggest increase since 2006 and performance fees were up $58 million. Our security servicing fees excluding SEC lending revenue was actually up 1% led by core fees and asset servicing as well as in issuer services.  Securities lending spreads and FX volatility remain soft. NII was up slightly mostly due to our small increase in our balance sheet size. Expenses were a little higher than recent levels on an operating basis. They were down 1% year-over-year but up 6% sequentially. The sequential increase was largely driven by a seasonal increase in business development. The Insight acquisition, including benefit adjustments, higher legal and FDIC expenses. In other words, you shouldn't view it as a run rate. They were unusually high. We do want to point out that on a full year basis, incentive expense was actually down 20% versus 2008. We took a restructuring charge of $139 million to allow us to continue to drive efficiencies in future quarters and it was more than offset by a one-time tax gain in our financials. During the quarter, we also completed the previously announced restructuring of our investment portfolio to reduce risks that has helped put our biggest security issues behind us and going forward, they should be modest in size, if at all. We also declared victory on our merger integration outperforming our original goals handily. We're continuing to win new business and pipelines are actually good. In addition to a strong new flows and asset management and asset servicing, we won $400 billion in new assets under custody. In wealth management, we had our 16th consecutive quarter of net positive client asset close. In DRs [Depositary Receipts] and corporate trust, we continue to win business away from our competitors. In fact, we won -- two more DR issuers move their established program from competitors to us during the quarter. In broker-dealer services, we continue to gain market share both internationally and domestically. And in Pershing, we've had great success in converting business opportunities and 2010 should be another good year.We continue to love our business model. We are well positioned for improving stock and debt markets for increased global capital flows and for new issuance levels. And of course, any increase in short-term interest rates will greatly increase our fees in net interest income. Finally, we expect a better year in 2010 versus 2009. So at this point, let's hand it off to Todd to go deeper into the numbers and then we'll come back for questions. Todd?"

As Bob indicated, our core businesses are showing signs of improvement and our asset management results were particularly strong. As I get into the numbers, my comments will follow the Quarterly Earnings Review beginning on Page 3.You can see our continuing EPS was $0.59 on a reported basis and that includes a benefit of $0.04 related to a discrete tax items and the securities gain Bob just mentioned. It was partially offset by a charge related to our reengineering initiatives and M&I expenses.That gets us to an operating EPS of $0.55 for the quarter. Operating earnings benefited approximately $0.05 to $0.06 from a lower effective tax rate, which was driven by a higher proportion of foreign earnings. Operating earnings were negatively impacted $0.02 to $0.03 by adjustments to benefits expenses and a seasonal increase in certain expense items. Thus, I view our core operating earnings in the $0.51 to $0.53 range. Net interest revenue was up 1%. Fee revenue decreased 1% but if you exclude asset sales that we made in the third quarter, fee revenue increased 2% sequentially and provision for credit losses declined $82 million.If you turn to Page 5 of the review, you can see the assets under management and assets under custody rose for the quarter and securities on loan decline. The decline in securities lending assets was probably a year-end event. We expect the decline to be temporary. Assets under management was up 15% largely driven by the Insight acquisition. However, we are pleased to see a $14 billion increase in long-term flows. Turning to Page 6 of the earnings review, which shows fee growth. The securities servicing fees, if you exclude securities lending revenue were up 1% quarter-over-quarter and essentially flat from last year. And asset servicing core fees were up 4% sequentially, reflecting higher market values and net new business as assets under custody were up 1%. Securities lending fees were up $14 million sequentially and a $138 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. Both declines reflect lower spreads and lower volumes. Spreads were off 33% sequentially and 80% year-over-year. Average volumes were up 4% sequentially. Spreads are now at historically low levels and we expect them to improve as interest rates move.During the quarter, we won a incremental $400 billion in new business and asset servicing and the pipeline remains strong. Issuer services fees were up 3% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher DR revenue and that was offset somewhat by lower money market related distribution fees and corporate trust. Clearing fees declined 6% over the prior quarter and 20% over the prior year. Once again, resulting from lower money market related distribution fees as well as lower trading volumes.One of the key drivers of our total performance was a strong quarter in asset management. Asset wealth management fees were up 13% sequentially and 5% over last year. Both increases reflect the impact of the acquisition of Insight in the fourth quarter, stronger investment performance and improved market values, which is partially offset by a reduction in money market related fees due to outflows and money market products and higher fee waivers due to impact of lower interest rates. Asset under management increased 15% over the prior quarter while outpacing the rate of growth in the equity markets. If we look at the Asset Management business, AUM here reached $1.04 trillion in the quarter. Assets under management benefited from the Insight acquisition that mentioned and the net long-term benefits of $14 billion in the quarter, primarily reflecting the benefit from the strength in global equity and fixed income products. Assets under management were negatively impacted by short-term outflows. Note that the Insight acquisition closed on November 2, so we're not yet seeing a full quarter impact on our earnings.Finally, as mentioned above, the new zero rate environment continues to impact money market distribution fees in several of our businesses. Fee waivers are currently costing us about $0.04 per quarter and are unlikely to change until the central banks increase rates.FX and other trading revenue was flat sequentially and down 52% compared to the record fourth quarter of 2008. The sequential results reflect a higher FX revenue and lower fixed income trading revenue. The decrease year-over-year reflects lower FX revenue, driven by reduced volatility, as well as a lower valuation of credit derivatives to hedge the loan portfolio.Turning to net interest revenue which is detailed on Page 7 of the earnings review. NIR and the related margin continued to be impacted by persistently low short-term interest rates globally and our strategy to invest in high quality relatively short duration assets. NIR increased 1% sequentially primarily reflecting a higher level of interest-earning assets. The net interest margin was 1.77% compared with 1.85% in the prior quarter. The decrease in the margin reflects an increase in interest-earning assets driven by deposit growth. In the current rate environment, we cannot invest new deposits at historical spreads. Thus, the net interest margin will vary slightly with the overall size of the balance sheet. In the quarter, there was modest accretion of the restructured assets which was largely offset by lower hedging gains. In 2010, we expect the portfolio of restructuring to contribute approximately $200 million in net interest income and that's slightly better than the high end of our original estimates.Turning to non-interest expense on Page 8, you can see that operating expenses were up 6% sequentially and this was primarily reflecting seasonally higher business development expenses including branding costs. The impact of the Insight acquisition, employee benefit adjustments and higher legal and FDIC expenses. On Page 9 of the earnings review, we provide detail on our securities portfolio. The first table details activity in the fourth quarter of '09 and the second is our traditional table showing amortized costs, fair value and ratings.During the fourth quarter, we successfully completed the investment portfolio restructuring. The net impact of that was a $15 million pretax securities gain. First of all, what we did is we moved $5 billion in fair value of our investment securities portfolio into a Grantor Trust. As you can see from the schedule, the Grantor Trust contains Alt-A, prime and subprime RMBS which had been previously written down to fair values as part of the third quarter efforts. As a result of this transaction, we received $771 million in cash for a Class A senior tranche that was sold to third parties and we retained the Class B certificates with a fair value of $4.2 billion as you can see in the table. The securities held in the Grantor Trust have been marked down to approximately $0.60 on the dollar, so the likelihood of future impairments is low. In fact, we expect to recover a significant amount of the write-down over time. The Grantor Trust resulted in a $39 million net loss in the fourth quarter. In addition to completing the Grantor Trust, we sold an additional $2.9 billion fair value of securities and most of that was from the Watch List and that was for a gain of $54 million. The following table represents the fourth quarter 2009 activity related to restructuring as well as the investments we made in the quarter. And as you can see from the table, the Watch List declined 38% in the quarter and it's now down over 50% from the fees [ph]. Although it's been painful, we're pleased with the restructurings execution and comfortable with the level of risk in the portfolio.In December, we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $139 million. The charge was comprised of $102 million for severance costs along with $37 million of asset write-offs. The severance costs are related to the execution of our global location strategy, which will involve migrating positions to global growth centers and eliminating certain positions. Since there will be additional costs as well as some benefits related to these initiatives in 2010, we will not actually start to see the net benefit until the beginning of 2011.Our regulatory capital ratios remained strong. Tier 1 increased 60 basis points to 12% and Tier 1 common increased 60 basis points to 10 1/2%. TCE remains stable at 5.2% and the acquisition of Insight absorbed approximately 15 basis points and our tangible assets were higher due to lower levels of cash with central banks and an increase in deposits. In terms of our loan portfolio on Page 11, the provision for credit losses declined from $147 million to $65 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting improved credit migration over the period. Going forward, we expect the quarterly provision to be roughly in the same range we've seen in this quarter. During the quarter, the total reserve for credit increased $30 million to $32 million and net charge-offs totaled $33 million.Our results for the quarter including net income tax benefit of $41 million, which consists primarily of a $51 million benefit from proportionately higher foreign earnings and a $133 million benefit from a discrete tax item, which is related to a tax loss on mortgages. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter on an operating basis was 22% and that included the $51 million benefit I noted earlier. We would expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30% to 32% in 2010. Turning to Page 19. During December, we declared victory on our merger. Year-to-date, we at achieved $251 million in annualized revenue synergies well above our full year target. And we also realized $206 million in expense synergies during the quarter, an incremental increase of $10 million from the third quarter.Looking ahead to 2010, we are pleased to see revenue momentum in our core Asset Management and Securities Servicing businesses though our revenue continues to be impacted by the persistently low interest rate environment. In fact, we estimate that 100 basis point increase in overnight rate should add about $500 million of pretax earnings to our annual run rate and that assumes no change in client deposit and money market activities.So once interest rates start to rise, we will benefit greatly. In the meantime, we're focused on improving our performance by increasing revenues, controlling costs and reducing earnings volatility.Let me provide a little color on each. I'll start on the revenue front. Here, we are actively identifying opportunities to consolidate market share and enhance our global capabilities to create more growth. There are also natural ties that exist between many of our product capabilities. We're working to more effectively package various services for ceratin client segments, which will enable us to offer more comprehensive solutions that our competitors simply can't match. Our second initiative is to grow margins by improving our operating models. Across the company, we're looking at which jobs really need to be performed in major metropolitan areas and which to be done equally well in one of our growth centers.  The expense benefits from our 2010 moves will begin to show up in 2011. Parallel to this, we are continuing our ongoing reengineering and process automation efforts looking across the company as a whole. Third is to continue to limit the risks on our balance sheet, something you saw that was previously announced securities portfolio restructuring that we completed in fourth quarter. We've also nearly completed rightsizing our largest credit exposures which will also reduce earnings volatility. And on Friday, we closed on the sale of our Florida bank. Together these three initiatives will improve our performance and the consistency of our earnings going forward. With that, I'll turn it back to Bob."

So at a 100 basis points, we were covered just about all the waivers that were -- the fee waivers that were currently waving. In terms of net interest income, there's a real benefit there is from the lack of compression on some of the low rates so we'll pay for deposits. For example, Fed funds minus 50 basis points which as you can see is impossible to do. So they're interest-sensitive deposits but we'll recover that as soon as we do see a move in rates. So that $500 million was the run rate given an immediate 100 basis point move in the overnight central bank rates."

I don't get the impression that there's going to be a lot of dividend increases in the short term in the U.S. That might be something that we'll look at in the second half.

And ultimately, it's going to encourage people to reduce liquidity, to reduce the fee, and that's not a very good thing to do in the early phases of a fragile-economic recovery. And there's other things too like, I worry a lot about creating an unlevel playing field with non-U.S. banks because it essentially make U.S. banks competitive in raising foreign deposits, and we're a global industry. And if our competitors in Europe don't have to pay the fee and we're trying to raise deposits in Europe, it's very expensive and we're uncompetitive.

Is it fair for us to start to call a bottom in terms of where the servicing fees might be given that there's probably some fee waivers that are pressuring those. It seems like with alternative Asset Management starting to show a little bit more robust and that your presence in the hedge fund community, it seems like Clearing Services might be an area of potential growth from at least where we are today. Can you give me your sense of where we sit today as of the fourth quarter and what we should be starting to expect for servicing fees in Clearing Services outside of just the normal fee waiver?"

Our earnings per share were $0.59 or $712 million. On an operating basis they were $0.55 or $657 million. In Q4 the balance sheet remained strong as evidenced by the fact that we had much lower provision and we actually had a small security gain. This is the first time we have had a security gain in a quarterly result since the second quarter of 2007 so it is welcome to finally see that bit of a turnaround and a pretty solid indication of how differently we should view the securities markets versus a year ago or two years ago. 
Several of our core businesses are showing some improvement with a particular strong quarter in asset management. However, the persistently low interest rate environment around the world continues to challenge our net interest revenue and also impacts fee revenue due to fee waivers that are pretty substantial in our company. Todd can talk a little bit about that later on. 
Fee revenue was actually up 2% versus the prior quarter excluding the net impact of third quarter asset sales. We had excellent growth in assets in wealth management fees. They were up 13%. We had net long-term asset flows of $14 billion which was the biggest increase since 2006 and performance fees were up $58 million. Our security servicing fees excluding tech lending revenue was actually up 1% led by core fees in asset servicing as well as in issuer services. 
Securities lending spread and FX volatility remains soft. NII was up slightly mostly due to the small increase in our balance sheet size. Expenses were a little higher than recent levels on an operating basis. They were down 1% year-over-year but up 6% sequentially. The sequential increase was largely driven by a seasonal increase in business development, the Insight acquisition, employee benefit adjustments, higher legal and FDIC expenses. In other words you shouldn’t view it as a run rate and they were unusually high. We do want to point out on a full year basis incentive expense is actually down 20% versus 2008. 
We took a restructuring charge of $139 million to allow us to continue to drive efficiencies in future quarters and it was more than offset by a one-time tax gain in our financials. During the quarter we also completed the previously announced restructuring of our investment portfolio to reduce risk. That has helped to put our biggest securities issued behind us and going forward they should be modest in size if at all. 
We also declared victory on our merger integration outperforming our original goals handily. We are continuing to win new business and the pipelines are actually good. In addition to strong new flows in asset management, in asset servicing we won $400 billion in new assets under custody. In wealth management we had our 16th consecutive quarter of net positive client asset growth. In DRs and corporate trust we have continued to win business away from our competitors. In fact two more DR issuers moved their established programs from our competitors to us during the quarter. 
In broker dealer services we continue to gain market share both internationally and domestically and in Pershing we have had great success in converting business opportunities and 2010 should be another good year. We continue to deliver our business model. We are well positioned for improving stock and debt markets, increase and growth in capital flows and for issuance levels. Of course any increase in short-term interest rates will greatly increase our fees and net interest income. 
Finally, we expect a better year in 2010 versus 2009. At this point let’s hand it off to Todd to go deeper into the numbers and then we will come back for questions. Todd?

135506,84102835,46249,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-20-2010",2010-01-20,"Earnings Calls","The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation","Executives","Thanks Bob. Good morning everyone. As Bob indicated our core businesses are showing signs of improvement and our asset management results were particularly strong.

As Bob indicated our core businesses are showing signs of improvement and our asset management results were particularly strong. As I get into the numbers my comments will follow the quarterly earnings review beginning on page 3.
You can see our continuing EPS was $0.59 on a reported basis and that includes the benefit of $0.04 related to a discrete tax item and the securities gain Bob just mentioned. It was partially offset by a charge related to our re-engineering initiatives and M&I expenses. That gets us to an operating EPS of $0.55 for the quarter. Operating earnings benefited approximately $0.05 to $0.06 from a lower effective tax rate which was driven by a higher proportion of foreign earnings. Operating earnings were negatively impacted $0.02 to $0.03 by adjustments to benefit expenses and a seasonal increase in certain expense items. Thus I view our core operating earnings in the $0.51 to $0.53 range. 
Net interest revenue was up 1%. Fee revenue decreased 1% but if you exclude asset sales that we made in the third quarter fee revenue increased 2% sequentially. Provision for credit losses declined $82 million. 
If you turn to page 5 of the review, you can see the assets under management and assets under custody rose for the quarter and securities on loan declined. The decline of securities lending assets is probably a year-end event. We expect the decline to be temporary. Assets under management was up 15% largely driven by the Insight acquisition. However, we are pleased to see a $14 billion increase in long-term flows. 
Turning to page 6 of the earnings review it shows fee growth. Securities servicing fees if you exclude securities lending revenue were up 1% quarter-over-quarter and essentially flat from last year. Asset servicing core fees were up 4% sequentially reflecting higher market values and net new business as assets under custody were up 1%. Securities lending fees were up $14 million sequentially and $138 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. Both declines reflect lower spreads and lower volumes. Spreads were off 33% sequentially and 80% year-over-year. Average volumes were [up] 4% sequentially. 
Spreads are now at historically low levels and we expect them to improve as interest rates move. During the quarter we won an incremental $400 billion in new business in asset servicing and the pipeline remains strong. Issuer servicer fees were up 3% sequentially primarily reflecting higher DR revenue and that was offset somewhat by lower money market related distribution fees in corporate trusts.  Clearing fees declined 6% over the prior quarter and 20% over the prior year once again relating from lower money market distribution fees as well as lower trading volumes. 
One of the key drivers of our total performance was a strong quarter in asset management. Asset and wealth management fees were up 13% sequentially and 5% over the last year. Both increases reflect the impact of the acquisition of Insight in the fourth quarter, stronger investment performance and improved market values which was partially offset by a reduction in money market related fees due to outflows in money market products and higher fee waivers due to the impact of lower interest rates. 
Assets under management increased 15% over the prior quarter, well outpacing the rate of growth in the equity markets. If we look at the asset management business AUM reached $1.04 trillion on the quarter. Assets under management benefited from the Insight acquisition as mentioned and the net long term benefits of $14 billion in the quarter primarily reflecting the benefit from the strength in global equity and fixed income products. Assets under management were negatively impacted by short-term outflows. Note that the Insight acquisition closed on November 2nd so we are not yet seeing a full quarter impact on our earnings. 
Finally, as mentioned above the near zero rate environment continues to impact money market distribution fees in several of our businesses. Fee waivers are currently costing us about $0.04 per quarter and are unlikely to change until the central banks increase rates.
FX and other trading revenue was flat sequentially and down 52% compared to the record fourth quarter of 2008. The sequential results reflect higher FX revenue and lower fixed income trading revenue. The decrease year-over-year reflects lower FX revenue driven by reduced volatility as well as the lower valuation of credit derivatives to hedge the loan portfolio. 
Turning to net interest revenue which is detailed on page 7 of the earnings review, NIR and the related margin continue to be impacted by persistently low short-term interest rates globally and our strategy to invest in high quality, relatively short duration assets. NIR increased 1% sequentially primarily reflecting a higher level of interest earning assets. Net interest margin was 1.77% compared with 1.85% in the prior quarter. The decrease in the margin reflects an increase interest earning assets driven by deposit growth. In the current rate environment we cannot invest new deposits at historical spreads. Thus the net interest margin will vary slightly with the overall size of the balance sheet. 
In the quarter there was modest accretion of the restructured assets which was largely offset by lower hedging gains. In 2010 we expect the portfolio restructuring to contribute approximately $200 million of net interest income and that is slightly better than the high end of our original estimates. 
Turning to noninterest expense on page 8 you can see that operating expenses were up 6% sequentially and this was primarily reflecting seasonally higher business development expenses including branding costs, the impact of the Insight acquisition, employee benefit adjustments and higher legal and FDIC expenses. 
On page 9 of the earnings review we provide detail on our securities portfolio. The first table details activity in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the second is our traditional table showing amortized cost, fair value and ratings. During the fourth quarter we successfully completed the investment portfolio restructuring. The net impact of that was a $15 million pre-tax securities gain. 
First of all, what we did was we moved $5 billion in fair value of our investment security portfolio into a Grantor Trust. As you can see from the schedule, the Grantor Trust contains Alt-A, prime and subprime RMBS which had been previously written down to fair value as part of the third quarter efforts. As a result of this transaction we received $771 million in cash for a Class A senior tranche that was sold to third parties and we retained the Class B certificates with a fair value of $4.2 billion, as you can see in the table. 
The securities held in the Grantor Trust have been marked down to approximately $0.60 on the dollar so the likelihood of future impairments is low. In fact, we expect to recover a significant amount of the write down over time. The Grantor Trust resulted in a $39 million net loss in the fourth quarter. In addition to completing the Grantor Trust, we sold an additional $2.9 billion fair value of securities and most of that was from the watch list and that was for a gain of $54 million. 
The following table represents the fourth quarter 2009 activity related to restructuring as well as the investments we made in the quarter. As you can see from the table the watch list declined 38% in the quarter and is now down over 50% from the peak. Although it has been painful, we are pleased with the restructuring’s execution and comfortable with the level of risk in the portfolio. 
In December we reported a pre-tax restructuring charge of $139 million. The charge was comprised of $102 million for severance costs along with $37 million of asset write offs. The severance costs are related to the execution of our global location strategy which will involve migrating positions to global growth centers and eliminating certain positions. Since there will be additional costs as well as some benefit related to these initiatives in 2010 we will not actually start to see the net benefit until the beginning of 2011. 
Our regulatory capital ratios remain strong. Tier 1 increased 60 basis points to 12% and Tier 1 common increased 60 basis points to 10.5%. TCE remained stable at 5.2 as the acquisition of Insight was worth approximately 15 basis points and our tangible assets were higher due to the lower levels of cash with central banks and an increase in deposits. 
In terms of our loan portfolio on page 11 the provision for credit losses declined from $147 million to $65 million in the fourth quarter reflecting improved credit migration over the period. Going forward we expect the quarterly provision to be roughly in the same range we have seen in this quarter. During the quarter the total reserve for credit increased $32 million and net charge offs totaled $33 million. 
Our results for the quarter include a net income tax benefit of $41 million which consists primarily of a $51 million benefit from proportionately higher foreign earnings and a $133 million benefit from a discrete tax item which is related to a tax loss on mortgages. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter on an operating basis was 22% and that included the $51 million benefit noted earlier. We would expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30-32% in 2010. 
Turning to page 19, during December we declared victory on our merger. Year-to-date we achieved $251 million in annualized revenue synergies, well above our full year target, and we also realized $206 million in expense synergies during the quarter, an incremental increase of $10 million from the third quarter. 
Looking ahead to 2010 we are pleased to see revenue momentum in our core asset management and security servicing businesses though our revenue continues to be impacted by a persistently low interest rate environment. In fact, we estimate that a 100 basis point increase in overnight ratings should add about $500 million in pre-tax earnings to our annual run rate. That assumes no change in client deposit and money market activities. So once interest rates start to rise we will benefit greatly. 
In the meantime we are focused on improving our performance by increasing revenues, controlling costs and reducing earnings volatility. Let me provide a little color on each. I will start on the revenue front. Here we are actively identifying opportunities to consolidate market share and enhance our global capabilities to create more growth. There are also natural ties that exist between many of our product capabilities. We are working to more effectively package various services for certain client segments which will enable us to offer more comprehensive solutions that our competitors simply cannot match. 
Our second initiative is to grow margins by improving our operating models. Across the company we are looking at which jobs really need to be performed in major metropolitan areas and which can be done equally well in one of our growth centers. The expense benefit from our 2010 moves will begin to show up in 2011. Parallel to this we are continuing our ongoing re-engineering and process automation efforts looking across the company as a whole. 
  Third is to continue to limit the risk on our balance sheet, something that you saw with the previously announced portfolio restructuring that we completed in the fourth quarter. We have also nearly completed right sizing our largest credit exposures which will also reduce earnings volatility and on Friday we closed on the sale of our Florida bank. 
Together these three initiatives will improve our performance and the consistency of our earnings going forward. With that I will turn it back to Bob.

So when I indicated 100 basis points that’s if rates move instantaneously and that would be the next regular run rate. 
So 100 basis points we recover just about all the fee waivers that we are currently waiving. In terms of net interest income the real benefit there is from the lack of compression on some of the low rates. So we will pay for deposits, for example, Fed funds minus 50 basis points which as you can see is impossible to do so they are interest sensitive deposits and we will recover that as soon as we do see a move in rates. So that $500 million was the run rate given an immediate 100 basis point move in the overnight central bank rates.

There is really no spread there. This is as narrow as we have ever seen it historically. That would probably change if we just saw an overall movement in rates. It would also change if there was a move back to risk premiums. So you have kind of got the worst combination. No core interest rate and no risk premium in the market right now.

So we will tend to focus on those bases and we will do it globally. Again our hurdles are tough but we will be disciplined. 
We will also be very careful of our capital ratios. We don’t want to run them down far either. What I think about our relative priorities, I am getting the sense from yourself, analysts and shareholders that you want us to invest in our businesses so we can grow them over time. Particularly right now given where we are hopefully more of a secular low in the securities markets or close to it. I don’t get the impression there is going to be a lot of dividend increases in the short-term in the US. That might be something we will look at in the second half and frankly that would be a higher priority for us versus buying back stock. 
We would expect given the quality of our balance sheet now and our core earnings capabilities that we will be generating a lot of capital in due course but those will be issues we will be thinking about more in the second half of the year.

I always worry about the unintended consequences of material actions and things that may result from that. Of course we always worry about how it will impact jobs if we can’t pass on costs. I know shareholders are going to want the industry to reduce costs and the most obvious place to do that is against the workforce. I also think it impairs the ability for less healthy banks to be able to lend which of course has been one of the key stories that bank clients have had to deal with over the last two years. It also because it is essentially a tax on balance sheet size it is also going to really encourage the banks to reduce the size of their balance sheets and ultimately it is going to encourage people to reduce liquidity, to reduce the fee. That is not a very good thing to do in the early phases of an overall economic recovery. There are other things too. 
I worry a lot about creating an unlevel playing field with non-US banks because it essentially makes US banks competitive in raising foreign deposits. We are in a global industry and if our competitors in Europe don’t have to pay a fee and we are trying to raise deposits in Europe it is very expensive and we are uncompetitive. Level playing field is extremely important in our industry. Lastly, it actually discourages acquisitions because I don’t know if you really thought it through but you would end up paying a fee on goodwill and intangibles. 
So there are a lot of things that really need to be thought through here that I don’t think are good for our industry or for the country.

That is a space where obviously we can compete very, very effectively to help them be more successful. 
That was the last question we had. Thank you very much for joining the call. We very much appreciate the questions. Have a good day.

Our earnings per share were $0.59 or $712 million on an operating basis there $0.55 or $667 million. In Q4, our balance sheet remains strong as evidenced by the fact that we had a much lower provision and we actually had a small securities gain. This is the first time we've had a securities gain in a quarterly results since the second quarter of '07. So it's welcome to finally see that bit of a turnaround and a pretty solid indication of how differently we should view the securities market versus a year ago or two years ago.Several of our core businesses are showing some improvement with a particularly strong quarter in asset management. However, the persistently low interest rate environment around the world continues to challenge our net interest revenue. It also impacts fee revenue due to fee waivers that are pretty substantial in our company. Todd is going to talk a little bit more about that a little later on. Fee revenue was actually up 2% versus the prior quarter, excluding the net impact of third quarter asset sales. We had excellent growth in assets and wealth management fees. They were up 13%. We had a net long-term asset flows of $14 billion, which was the biggest increase since 2006 and performance fees were up $58 million. Our security servicing fees excluding SEC lending revenue was actually up 1% led by core fees and asset servicing as well as in issuer services.  Securities lending spreads and FX volatility remain soft. NII was up slightly mostly due to our small increase in our balance sheet size. Expenses were a little higher than recent levels on an operating basis. They were down 1% year-over-year but up 6% sequentially. The sequential increase was largely driven by a seasonal increase in business development. The Insight acquisition, including benefit adjustments, higher legal and FDIC expenses. In other words, you shouldn't view it as a run rate. They were unusually high. We do want to point out that on a full year basis, incentive expense was actually down 20% versus 2008. We took a restructuring charge of $139 million to allow us to continue to drive efficiencies in future quarters and it was more than offset by a one-time tax gain in our financials. During the quarter, we also completed the previously announced restructuring of our investment portfolio to reduce risks that has helped put our biggest security issues behind us and going forward, they should be modest in size, if at all. We also declared victory on our merger integration outperforming our original goals handily. We're continuing to win new business and pipelines are actually good. In addition to a strong new flows and asset management and asset servicing, we won $400 billion in new assets under custody. In wealth management, we had our 16th consecutive quarter of net positive client asset close. In DRs [Depositary Receipts] and corporate trust, we continue to win business away from our competitors. In fact, we won -- two more DR issuers move their established program from competitors to us during the quarter. In broker-dealer services, we continue to gain market share both internationally and domestically. And in Pershing, we've had great success in converting business opportunities and 2010 should be another good year.We continue to love our business model. We are well positioned for improving stock and debt markets for increased global capital flows and for new issuance levels. And of course, any increase in short-term interest rates will greatly increase our fees in net interest income. Finally, we expect a better year in 2010 versus 2009. So at this point, let's hand it off to Todd to go deeper into the numbers and then we'll come back for questions. Todd?"

As Bob indicated, our core businesses are showing signs of improvement and our asset management results were particularly strong.

As Bob indicated, our core businesses are showing signs of improvement and our asset management results were particularly strong. As I get into the mindset of the numbers, my comments will follow the Quarterly Earnings Review beginning on Page 3.You can see our continuing EPS was $0.59 on a reported basis, and that includes a benefit of $0.04 related to a discrete tax item and the securities gain Bob just mentioned. It was partially offset by a charge related to our reengineering initiatives and M&I expenses.That gets us to an operating EPS of $0.55 for the quarter. Operating earnings benefited approximately $0.05 to $0.06 from a lower effective tax rate, which was driven by a higher proportion of foreign earnings. Operating earnings were negatively impacted $0.02 to $0.03 by adjustments to benefits expenses and the seasonal increase in certain expense items. Thus, I view our core operating earnings in the $0.51 to $0.53 range. Net interest revenue was up 1%. Fee revenue decreased 1% but if you exclude asset sales that we made in the third quarter, fee revenue increased 2% sequentially, and provision for credit losses declined $82 million.Now if you turn to Page 5 of the review, you can see the assets under management and assets under custody rose for the quarter and securities on loan declined. The decline in securities lending assets was probably a year-end event. We expect the decline to be temporary. Assets under management was up 15% largely driven by the Insight acquisition. However, we're pleased to see a $14 billion increase in long-term flows. Turning to Page 6 of the earnings review, which shows fee growth. The securities servicing fees, if you exclude securities lending revenue were up 1% quarter-over-quarter and essentially flat from last year. In asset servicing, core fees were up 4% sequentially, reflecting higher market values and net new business as assets under custody were up 1%. Securities lending fees were up $14 million sequentially and $138 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. Both declines reflect lower spreads and lower volumes. Spreads were off 33% sequentially and 80% year-over-year. Average volumes were up 4% sequentially. Spreads are now at historically low levels and we expect them to improve as interest rates move.During the quarter, we won an incremental $400 billion in new business and asset servicing, and the pipeline remained strong. Issuer services fees were up 3% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher DR revenue, and that was offset somewhat by lower money market related distribution fees and corporate trust. Clearing fees declined 6% over the prior quarter and 20% over the prior year. Once again, resulting from lower money market related distribution fees as well as lower trading volumes.One of the key drivers of our total performance was a strong quarter in asset management. Asset wealth management fees were up 13% sequentially and 5% over last year. Both increases reflect the impact of the acquisition of Insight in the fourth quarter, stronger investment performance and improved market values, which is partially offset by a reduction in money market related fees due to outflows in money market products and higher fee waivers due to the impact of lower interest rates. Assets under management increased 15% over the prior quarter while outpacing the rate of growth in the equity markets. If we look at the Asset Management business, AUM here reached $1.04 trillion in the quarter. Assets under management benefited from the Insight acquisition I'd mentioned and the net long-term benefits of $14 billion in the quarter, primarily reflecting the benefit from the strength in global equity and fixed income products. Assets under management were negatively impacted by short-term outflows. Note that the Insight acquisition closed on November 2, so we're not yet seeing a full quarter impact on our earnings.Finally, as mentioned above, the new zero rate environment continues to impact money market distribution fees in several of our businesses. Fee waivers are currently costing us about $0.04 per quarter and are unlikely to change until the central banks increase rates.FX and other trading revenue was flat sequentially and down 52% compared to the record fourth quarter of 2008. The sequential results reflect a higher FX revenue and lower fixed income trading revenue. The decrease year-over-year reflects lower FX revenue, driven by reduced volatility, as well as a lower valuation of credit derivatives to hedge the loan portfolio.Turning to net interest revenue which is detailed on Page 7 of the earnings review. NIR and the related margin continued to be impacted by persistently low short-term interest rates globally and our strategy to invest in high quality relatively short duration assets. NIR increased 1% sequentially, primarily reflecting a higher level of interest-earning assets. The net interest margin was 1.77% compared with 1.85% in the prior quarter. The decrease in the margin reflects an increase in interest-earning assets driven by deposit growth. In the current rate environment, we cannot invest new deposits at historical spreads. Thus, the net interest margin will vary slightly with the overall size of the balance sheet. In the quarter, there was modest accretion of the restructured assets which was largely offset by lower hedging gains. In 2010, we expect the portfolio of restructuring to contribute approximately $200 million in net interest income, and that's slightly better than the high end of our original estimates.Turning to non-interest expense on Page 8, you can see that operating expenses were up 6% sequentially. And this was primarily reflecting seasonally higher business development expenses including branding costs, the impact of the Insight acquisition, employee benefit adjustments and higher legal and FDIC expenses. On Page 9 of the earnings review, we provide detail on our securities portfolio. The first table details activity in the fourth quarter of '09 and the second is our traditional table showing amortized costs, fair value and ratings.During the fourth quarter, we successfully completed the investment portfolio restructuring. The net impact of that was a $15 million pretax securities gain. First of all, what we did is we moved $5 billion in fair value of our investment securities portfolio into a Grantor Trust. As you can see from the schedule, the Grantor Trust contains Alt-A, prime and subprime RMBS which had been previously written down to fair value as part of the third quarter efforts. As a result of this transaction, we received $771 million in cash for a Class A senior tranche that was sold to third parties and we retained the Class B certificates with a fair value of $4.2 billion as you can see in the table. The securities held in the Grantor Trust have been marked down to approximately $0.60 on the dollar, so the likelihood of future impairments is low. In fact, we expect to recover a significant amount of the write-down over time. The Grantor Trust resulted in a $39 million net loss in the fourth quarter. In addition to completing the Grantor Trust, we sold an additional $2.9 billion fair value of securities and most of that was from the Watch List, and that was for a gain of $54 million. The following table represents the fourth quarter 2009 activity related to restructuring as well as the investments we made in the quarter. And as you can see from the table, the Watch List declined 38% in the quarter and it's now down over 50% from the peak. Although it's been painful, we're pleased with the restructurings execution and comfortable with the level of risk in the portfolio.In December, we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $139 million. The charge was comprised of $102 million for severance costs, along with $37 million of asset write-offs. The severance costs are related to the execution of our global location strategy, which will involve migrating positions to global growth centers and eliminating certain positions. Since there will be additional costs as well as some benefits related to these initiatives in 2010, we will not actually start to see the net benefit until the beginning of 2011.Our regulatory capital ratios remained strong. Tier 1 increased 60 basis points to 12% and Tier 1 common increased 60 basis points to 10 1/2%. TCE remains stable at 5.2% and the acquisition of Insight absorbed approximately 15 basis points, and our tangible assets were higher due to lower levels of cash with central banks and an increase in deposits. In terms of our loan portfolio on Page 11, the provision for credit losses declined from $147 million to $65 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting improved credit migration over the period. Going forward, we expect the quarterly provision to be roughly in the same range we've seen in this quarter. During the quarter, the total reserve for credit increased $30 million to $32 million and net charge-offs totaled $33 million.Our results for the quarter include a net income tax benefit of $41 million, which consists primarily of a $51 million benefit from proportionately higher foreign earnings and a $133 million benefit from a discrete tax item, which is related to a tax loss on mortgages. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter on an operating basis was 22% and that included the $51 million benefit I noted earlier. We would expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30% to 32% in 2010. Turning to Page 19. During December, we declared victory on our merger. Year-to-date, we at achieved $251 million in annualized revenue synergies well above our full year target. And we also realized $206 million in expense synergies during the quarter, an incremental increase of $10 million from the third quarter.Looking ahead to 2010, we are pleased to see revenue momentum in our core Asset Management and Securities Servicing businesses though our revenue continues to be impacted by the persistently low interest rate environment. In fact, we estimate that 100 basis point increase in overnight rate should add about $500 million of pretax earnings to our annual run rate and that assumes no change in client deposit and money market activities.So once interest rates start to rise, we will benefit greatly. In the meantime, we're focused on improving our performance by increasing revenues, controlling costs and reducing earnings volatility.Let me provide a little color on each. I'll start on the revenue front. Here, we are actively identifying opportunities to consolidate market share and enhance our global capabilities to create more growth. There are also natural ties that exist between many of our product capabilities. We're working to more effectively package various services for ceratin client segments, which will enable us to offer more comprehensive solutions that our competitors simply can't match. Our second initiative is to grow margins by improving our operating models. Across the company, we're looking at which jobs really need to be performed in major metropolitan areas and which to be done equally well in one of our growth centers.  The expense benefits from our 2010 moves will begin to show up in 2011. Parallel to this, we are continuing our ongoing reengineering and process automation efforts looking across the company as a whole. Third is to continue to limit the risks on our balance sheet, something you saw that was previously announced securities portfolio restructuring that we completed in fourth quarter. We've also nearly completed rightsizing our largest credit exposures which will also reduce earnings volatility. And on Friday, we closed on the sale of our Florida bank. Together these three initiatives will improve our performance and the consistency of our earnings going forward. With that, I'll turn it back to Bob."

So when I indicated a 100 basis points, that's if rates move instantaneously and that would be the next regular [ph] run rate. So at a 100 basis points, we were covered just about all the waivers that were -- the fee waivers that were currently waving. In terms of net interest income, there's a real benefit there is from the lack of compression on some of the low rates so we'll pay for deposits. For example, Fed funds minus 50 basis points which as you can see is impossible to do. So they're interest-sensitive deposits but we'll recover that as soon as we do see a move in rates. So that $500 million was the run rate given an immediate 100 basis point move in the overnight central bank rates."

The difference between the demand for Treasuries and kind of the risk-free rate and the overnight rate. There's really no spread there and this is as narrow as we've ever seen it historically.

But when I think about our relative priorities, I'm getting the sense from yourselves, from analysts and shareholders that you want us to invest in our businesses, so we can grow them overtime. Particularly right now, given where we're hopefully at more of a secular low in the securities markets or close to it. I don't get the impression that there's going to be a lot of dividend increases in the short term in the U.S. That might be something that we'll look at in the second half. And frankly, that it would be a higher priority for us versus buying back stock.

I always worry about the unintended consequences of reading material actions and think that may result from that end. Of course, you always worry about how it would impact jobs such that you can't pass on costs. And I know shareholders are going to want the industry to reduce the costs and the most obvious place to do that is against the workforce. And I also think that impairs the ability for less healthy banks to be able to lend, which of course, has been one of the key stories that banks have been trying to deal with over the last two years. And also really because it's essentially a tax on balance sheet size, it's also going to really encourage the banks to reduce the size of their balance sheets. And ultimately, it's going to encourage people to reduce liquidity, to reduce the fee, and that's not a very good thing to do in the early phases of a fragile-economic recovery. And there's other things too like, I worry a lot about creating an unlevel playing field with non-U.S. banks because it essentially make U.S. banks competitive in raising foreign deposits, and we're a global industry. And if our competitors in Europe don't have to pay the fee and we're trying to raise deposits in Europe, it's very expensive and we're uncompetitive. Level playing field is extremely important in our industry. And Lastly, it actually discourages acquisitions because, I hope you really work -- thought [ph] it through, but you'd end up paying the fee on goodwill and intangibles. So there's a lot of things that really need to be thought through here that I don't think are good for our industry or for the country."

We saw a positive long-term flows in both institutional and retail. And what you're seeing, I think, is a return to the market of institutions offsetting at least, if not more than our share. It's a pretty sophisticated clients looking at their programs in a holistic way, which means that the inflows will be coming to us in pretty sizable chunks as we go through 2010 and 2011."

Our EPS for the quarter was $0.49 or $601 million. On an operating basis that was $0.59 or $715 million. Earnings were reduced by about 10% mainly due to increased litigation reserves for several existing matters. 
Overall I would characterize the quarter as an encouraging quarter. Fee revenue was positively impacted by higher market values and we demonstrated superb asset quality in both our loan and security portfolios. Offsetting this was money market fee waivers, lower trading volume and lower volatility quarter-over-quarter. 
As you know our business model is really levered to rates edging up and financial flows beginning to normalize at higher levels and we have yet to see that at this point. Fee revenue has been unchanged sequentially, mostly due to seasonality in some of our businesses which are somewhat unique and off 6% versus a year ago. Asset and wealth management fees were up 13% over a year ago. 
We had net positive long-term flows of $16 billion in client assets. Asset servicing fee revenue grew by 17% year-over-year. Security lending spreads and FX volatility levels remain muted. NII is down slightly compared to last year but up 6% sequentially principally reflecting the higher yields related to the restructured assets in our securities portfolio. Operating expenses remain very well controlled. 
Together with our success in winning new business we achieved another quarter of positive operating leverage. On the new business front in addition to strong inflows and asset management we had new asset servicing wins of over $200 billion in assets under custody cutting across all client segments and geographies whether it is corporate, financial institutions, endowments or international. 
[Inaudible] a number of mandates which we expect to be able to announcement shortly and wealth management had its 17th consecutive quarter of net long-term client asset inflows. Realize too that since the beginning of our financial crisis a couple of years ago we have been successful in creating new products to help our clients fulfill more difficult and stringent reporting requirements. A couple of examples might include our new portfolio of stress testing capabilities and our Derivatives 360 product which improves the transparency and helps clients reduce risk overall. Both of these products are strengthening our ties with clients and creating new revenue streams for the company overall. 
Credit quality trends are improving nicely. You may notice the provision is down 46% and nonperforming assets were down 17% sequentially and our unrealized pre-tax loss on the investment portfolio is not quite at break-even yet but it is down 77% from year-end which was the last three months. 
Service levels remain very strong. The last annual R&M survey of custody clients and fund managers BNY Mellon Asset Servicing was ranked number one overall in six key categories and ahead of our peer group in a further seven categories. In Global Investor Magazine’s annual FX survey we were ranked number one in 25 categories including four overall performance categories and 14 of the 20 service categories. This is the third consecutive year in which we have essentially dominated this survey. 
On the capital side all of our key capital ratios strengthened during the quarter. You may have noted that our Tier 1 common and our Tier 1 capital are up over 100 basis points sequentially. As you know we are using our capital to make accretive acquisitions and to support organic growth in both our core asset management and security servicing businesses. Our asset management results this quarter are already benefiting from the acquisition of Insight which was closed last November. 
In this quarter you may recall that we announced two asset servicing acquisitions; Global Investment Services with operations primarily in the U.S. but also in Ireland and Poland and BHF Asset Servicing in Germany. Both of these deals are expected to close in the third quarter and will be immediately accretive to earnings. Also as previously reported we still intend raise about $700 million in common equity to fund these purchases and also to maintain strong capital ratios in spite of the spreads we did see in the first quarter. 
So in summary what I would say the positives for this quarter are that nice year-over-year growth in revenue, AUM and assets under custody. Second we had new business inflows which are encouraging. Credit quality is excellent. Expense control is evident and capital generation is strong. 
Maybe with that I will turn it over to Todd so he can review the numbers with you in more detail.

As I get into the numbers my comments will follow the quarterly earnings review that begins on page 3. Our continuing EPS was $0.49 on a reported basis. It was reduced by a total of $0.10 due to an increase in our litigation reserve and M&I expenses. That gives us an operating EPS of $0.59 for the quarter. 
Let’s look at a few key items on a sequential basis. Net interest revenue was up 6%. Fee revenue was flat but up 6% year-over-year. Non-interest expenses were down 5% and that resulted in 600 basis points of positive operating leverage for the linked quarter. The provision for credit losses declined $39 million and credit quality trends in the investment portfolio showed improvement. As Bob mentioned all of our capital ratios strengthened. To put the quarter in perspective we generated above trend net interest and investment income of approximately $0.05 and I will review those items in more detail shortly. 
Turning to page 5 of the review you can see during the quarter our asset management business generated $16 billion of positive long-term flows. Also during the quarter equity appreciation was basically offset by the stronger U.S. dollar. Our AUM composition has a better balance than last year which should lead to higher fee realization going forward. Assets under custody which was flat sequentially was helped by increased equity and new business offset by the stronger U.S. dollar as well as our concentration in the fixed income markets. Securities on loan were modestly up at period end. 
Turning to page 6 of the earnings review we show fee growth. Securities servicing fees excluding securities lending fee revenue was down 3% quarter-over-quarter and down 2% year-over-year. Asset servicing fees were down 2% sequentially due primarily to lower volumes and the stronger U.S. dollar and up 17% year-over-year reflecting higher market values and net new business. During the quarter we won an incremental $205 billion in new business in asset servicing and the pipeline remains healthy. 
Security lending fees were down $1 million sequentially and $55 million compared with the first quarter of 2009. Both declines reflect lower volumes and lower spreads. Issuer service fees were down 10% sequentially and that was primarily reflecting the seasonally lower DR revenues from the first quarter and lower corporate trust fees driven by the continuing impact of money market fee waivers. On a positive note if you look a trust fees and excluding money market related distribution fees trust fees are actually up 1% sequentially and year-over-year. 
Clearing fees were up 3% over the prior quarter and were down 9% over the prior year resulting from lower volumes and also from money market fee waivers. Asset and wealth management fees excluding performance fees were up 1% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. Both increases reflect improved equity values, stronger investment performance, the Insight acquisition and the impact of long-term inflows partially offset by reduction in fees due to money market outflows and fee waivers due to the very low interest rate environment. The sequential increase was also negatively impacted by a stronger U.S. dollar. Money market fee waivers reduced fee revenue during the quarter by about 5% or $117 million impacting security servicing fees and asset wealth management fees. This is expected to continue until we see the Central Banks increase short-term rates. 
FX and other trading revenue was up 7% sequentially reflecting higher fixed income trading revenue and lower mark to market adjustments on credit default swaps that we used to hedge the loan portfolio. The increase was partially offset by lower FX revenue which was down 14% compared to the first quarter of 2009 reflecting lower volatility partially offset by volumes. 
Investment and other income was driven by above trend gains on continuing dispositions of the lease assets and a positive FX valuation for the quarter. We would expect lease gains to be lower going forward. 
Turning to page 7 of the earnings review, net interest revenue and the related margins reflect the positive impact of the higher yields related to the restructuring investments in the securities portfolio and higher hedging gains. This was partially offset by persistently low short-term interest rates globally. The margin was also impacted by our risk reduction strategy which is helping to drive lower credit and impairment charges in the long run. Net interest revenue increased 6% sequentially and was down 1% over the year ago quarter. The net interest margin was 1.89% compared with 1.77% in the prior quarter. The increase primarily reflects the higher yield in the Grantor Trust partially offset by the lower rates. 
As a reminder in the third and fourth quarters we restructured the investment securities portfolio. That enabled us to sell the securities that we didn’t think would perform well and retain the securities we thought had good potential for recovery. So those retained securities were mark to market and put in a Grantor Trust. The Grantor Trust accretion for the quarter was higher than we had anticipated due to higher projected cash flows. The future yield on these assets will be driven by the level of interest rates and also the credit performance of the underlying securities. An added benefit is that the Trust will actually help hedge interest rate sensitivity. If rates rise the yield will decline and if rates go down the yields should improve. 
In addition, we expect the Trust’s principal will amortize over a 5-6 year period so the NII benefit will decline modestly quarter by quarter as the principle reduces on this high yielding asset. We now estimate the restructuring will actually increase interest income at least for this year by about $320 million. NII has also benefited from hedging gains which are not likely to continue. We expect the impact on hedging gains and accretion to reduce the current quarterly run rate on NII by about $25-30 million. Of course the other key driver of our net interest margin will be when and if the Fed decides to raise rates. We continue to estimate that 100 basis point immediate increase in the funds rate will add $500 million to our pre-tax assuming no change in client behavior. 
Turning to non-interest expense on page 8 you can see we did a good job of controlling expenses. Excluding the increase in the litigation reserve relating to several existing matters, operating expenses were down 5% sequentially primarily reflecting lower professional and consulting fees and fees from the seasonally lower business development spend and decreases in nearly all other expense categories. 
On January 1 we adopted FAS 167. This new statement will increase our balance sheet by approximately 1% or $2.7 billion for the consolidation of certain asset management funds, fee capital investments and securitizations. The changes make it a bit difficult to compare prior results. There is $22 million on a net basis in effective revenue. $16 million would have been in investment income and $6 million in asset and wealth management revenue. The non-controlling interest is a negative number. It is not a cost, it is just basically the performance of our client assets that we manage and are required to consolidate. 
On page 9 of the earnings review we provide detail on our securities portfolio. The table provides amortized costs, fair value and ratings. Watch list securities continued to decline from the prior quarter. The restructured securities are included under the Grantor Trust and their market value has improved nicely as did every other asset class. Portfolio value was up about $750 million sequentially and nearly $8 billion year-over-year and has continued to improve in the current quarter. 
During the quarter we enjoyed significant growth in capital and a reduction in risk weighted assets. As a result, our key regulatory ratio strengthened meaningfully. Tier 1 increased 110 basis points to 13.2. Tier 1 common also increased 110 basis points to 11.6 and our tangible common equity increased 90 basis points to 6.1. In terms of our loan portfolio on page 11 we are pleased to see our risk reduction efforts have begun to pay dividends. The provision for credit losses declined from $65 million to $35 million in the first quarter and that is driven by a decrease in higher risk weighted loans and nonperforming loans. During the quarter the total reserves for credit totaled $10 million and net charge offs totaled $25 million. 
The effective tax rate in the quarter on an operating basis was approximately 29%. If you exclude the impact of litigation reserves, the restructuring charge and M&I expenses the effective tax rate was closer to 31%. We would expect our effective tax rate to come in around the same area in the second quarter, around 31%. 
Looking ahead and recognizing how the equity markets are moving we are optimistic that revenue momentum in asset management will continue in the coming quarters. In addition DRs and sec lending should benefit from seasonality. Both NIR and fees continue to be impacted by the low interest rate environment so any rise in rates will substantially improve performance. We expect net interest margin to be around 170-180 and in terms of credit we have been giving up yields but improving quality. Because of that strategy we expect our lower credit provision to be sustainable. 
Two expense items to note, our operating expenses in the second quarter will reflect the impact of the U.K. bonus tax which is approximately $25 million and we awarded our annual company-wide merit increase of approximately 2% on April 1 so that will also come into our numbers. As Bob mentioned we are using some of the excess capital that we are generating to make accretive transactions that contribute to the growth of our asset management and security servicing businesses and we would expect to start to see some of the benefits of the GIS and BHF acquisitions in the third quarter. In the meantime the key to our performance will be continuing to win new business, controlling costs and delivering outstanding client service; all of which we have been successful in doing. 
With that I will turn it back to Bob.

Having said that we believe in having a really strong balance sheet and we want to make sure we can continue to invest organically and maybe after March at least some small acquisitions. The way I kind of think about it is this is less than 2% of our market cap. It is like 1.8%. So it is not a lot of money incrementally and we don’t need it until the third quarter and we haven’t been in a rush frankly since the last quarter and our stock is higher.

EPS for the quarter was $0.49 or $601 million. On an operating basis, that was $0.59 or $715 million. Earnings were reduced by about 10% mainly due to increased litigation reserves for several existing matters. 
Overall, I characterize the quarter as an encouraging quarter. Fee revenue was positive and impacted by higher market values, and we demonstrated superb asset quality in both our loan and security portfolios. Offsetting this was money market fee waivers, lower trading volume and lower volatility, quarter-over-quarter. As you know, our business model is really levered to rates edging up and financial flows beginning to normalize at higher levels, and we have yet to see that at this point. 
Fee revenue has been unchanged sequentially and mostly due to seasonality in some of our businesses, which are somewhat unique, and up 6% versus a year ago. Asset and Wealth Management fees were up 13% over a year ago. We had net positive long-term flows of $16 billion in assets and client assets. Asset Servicing fee revenue grew by 17% year-over-year. Security lending spread and FX volatility levels remain muted. NII is down slightly compared to last year, but up 6% sequentially, principally reflecting the higher yield related to the restructured assets in our securities portfolio.  Operating expenses remained very well controlled. 
Together with our success in winning new business, we achieved another quarter of positive operating leverage. On the new business front, in addition to strong inflows in Asset Management, we had new Asset Servicing wins of over $200 billion in assets under custody, cutting across all client segments and geographies, whether it corporates, financial institutions, endowments or international. Pershing won a number of mandates, which we expect to be able to announce shortly. And Wealth Management had its 17th consecutive quarter of net long-term client asset inflows. 
We realized too that since the beginning of our financial crisis a couple of years ago, we've been successful in creating new products to help our clients fulfill more difficult and stringent reporting requirements. A couple of examples might include our new portfolio stress testing capabilities and our Derivative 360 product, which improves the transparency and helps clients reduce risks overall. Both of these products are strengthening our ties with clients and creating new revenues streams for the company overall. 
Credit quality trends are improving nicely. You may have noticed that the provision was down 46%, and non-performing assets were down 17% sequentially. And our unrealized pretax loss on the investment portfolio is not quite at break-even yet, but it's down 77% from year end, just in the last three months. 
Service levels remained very strong. In the last annual R&M Survey of custody clients and fund managers, BNY Mellon Asset Servicing was ranked number one overall in six key categories and ahead of our peer group in a further seven categories. In Global Investor Magazine's annual FX Survey, we are ranked number one in 25 categories, including four overall performance categories and 14 of the 20 service categories. This is the third consecutive year in which we've essentially dominated this survey. 
On the capital side, all of our key capital ratios strengthened during the quarter. You may have noted that our Tier 1 common and our Tier 1 capital are up over 100 basis points sequentially. As you know, we're using our capital to make accretive acquisitions and to support organic growth in both our core Asset Management and Security Servicing businesses. 
Our Asset Management results this quarter are already benefiting from the acquisition of Insight, which we closed last November. In this quarter, you may recall that we announced two Asset Servicing acquisitions: Global Investor Services, with operations primarily in the U.S., but also in our Ireland and Poland; and BHF Asset Servicing in Germany. Both of these deals are expected to close in the third quarter and will be immediately accretive to earnings. 
Also as previously reported, we still intend to raise about $700 million in common equity to fund these purchases and also to maintain strong capital ratios, in spite of the strength that we did see in the first quarter. 
So in summary, what I say the positives from this quarter is that we had nice year-over-year growth in revenue, AUM and assets under custody. Second, we had new business inflows, which are encouraging. Credit quality is excellent, expense control is evident and capital generation is strong. 
So maybe with that, I'll turn it over to Todd, so he can do the numbers with you in more detail."

As again at the numbers, my comments will follow the Quarterly Earnings Review that begins on Page 3. Our continuing EPS was $0.49 on a reported basis. It was reduced by a total of $0.10 due to an increase in our litigation reserve and M&I expenses. That gets us to an operating EPS of $0.59 for the quarter. 
Let's look at a few key items on a sequential basis. Net interest revenue was up 6%. Fee revenue was flat, but up 6% year-over-year. Non-interest expenses were down 5%. And that resulted in 600 basis points of positive operating leverage for the link quarter. The provision for credit losses declined $30 million and credit quality trends in the investment portfolio both showed good improvement. And as Bob had mentioned, all of our capital ratios strengthened. 
To put the quarter in perspective, we generated above trend's net interest and investment income of approximately $0.05. And I'll review those items in more detail shortly. 
Turning to Page 5 of the review, you can see that during the quarter, our Asset Management business generated $16 billion of positive long-term flows. Also during the quarter, equity appreciation was basically offset by the stronger U.S. dollar. 
Our AUM composition has a better balance than last year, which should lead to higher fee realization going forward. Assets under custody, which was flat sequentially, was helped by increased equity prices and new business, offset by the stronger U.S. dollar as well as our concentration in the fixed income markets. Securities on loan were modestly up at period end. 
Turning to Page 6 of the earnings review, which shows fee growth. Securities Servicing fees, excluding securities lending revenue, were down 3% quarter-over-quarter and down 2% year-over-year. And Asset Servicing fees were down 2% sequentially, due primarily to lower volumes and the stronger U.S. dollar, and up 17% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values and net new business. 
During the quarter, we won an incremental $205 billion in new business in Asset Servicing and the pipeline remains healthy. Security lending fees were down $1 million sequentially and $55 million compared with the first quarter of 2009. Both declines reflect lower volumes and lower spreads. 
Issuer Service fees were down 10% sequentially, and that was primarily reflecting the seasonally lower DR revenues in the first quarter and lower Corporate Trust fees driven by the continuing impact of money markets fee waivers. On a positive note, if you look at Trust fees and exclude money market-related distribution, excluding money market-related distribution fees, Trust fees are actually up 1% sequentially and year-over-year. Clearing fees were up 3% over the prior quarter and were down 9% over the prior year, resulting from lower volumes and also from money market fee waivers. 
Asset and Wealth Management fees excluding performance fees were up 1% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. Both increases reflect improved equity values, stronger investment performance, the Insight acquisition and the impact of long-term inflows, partially offset by a reduction in fees due to money market outflows and fee waivers due to the very low interest rate environment. The sequential increase is also negatively impacted by a stronger U.S. dollar. Money market fee waivers reduced fee revenue during the quarter by about 5% or $117 million, impacting Security Servicing fees and Asset and Wealth Management fees. This is expected to continue until we see the Central Bank's increase short-term rates. 
FX and other trading revenue was up 7% sequentially, reflecting higher fixed-income trading revenue and lower mark-to-market adjustments on credit default swaps that we used to hedge loan portfolio. The increase was partially offset by lower FX revenue, which was down 14% compared to the first quarter of 2009, reflecting lower volatility, partially offset by volumes. 
Investment and other income was driven by above-trend gains on continued disposition of lease assets and the positive FX revaluation for the quarter. We would expect lease gains to be lower going forward. 
Turning to Page 7 of the Earnings Review. Net interest revenue on a related margin reflect a positive impact of the higher yield related to the restructured investments securities portfolio and higher hedging gains. This was partially offset by a persistently low short-term interest rates globally. The margin is also impacted by a risk reduction strategy, which is helping to drive lower credit and impairment charges in the long run. 
Net interest revenue increased 6% sequentially and was down 1% over the year-ago quarter. The net interest margin was 1.89% compared with 1.77% in the prior quarter. The increase primarily reflects the higher yield in the assets in the Grantor Trust, partially offset by lower rates. 
As a reminder, in the third and fourth quarters, we restructured the investment securities portfolio. And that enabled us to sell the securities that we didn't think will perform well and retain the securities we thought had good potential for a recovery. So those retained securities were mark-to-market and put in a grantor trust. 
The Grantor Trust accretion for the quarter was higher than we had anticipated due to higher projected cash flows. The future yield on these assets will be driven by the level of interest rates and also the credit performance of the underlying securities. An added benefit is that the trust will actually help hedge our interest rate sensitivity. If rates rise, the yield will decline. And if rates go down, the yield should improve. 
In addition, we expect the trust principal to amortize over five- or six-year period. So the NII benefit will decline modestly quarter-by-quarter as the principal reduces on this high-yielding asset. We now estimate that the restructuring will actually increase interest income for this year by about $320 million. 
NII was also benefited from hedging gains which are not likely to continue. We expect the impact from hedging gains and accretion to reduce the current quarterly run rate on NII by about $25 million to $30 million. And of course, the other key driver of our net interest margin will be when and if the fed decides to raise rates. We continue to estimate that a 100 basis point immediate increase in the funds rate will add $500 million to our pretax, assuming no change in client behavior. 
Turning to non-interest expense on Page 8. You can see we did a good job of controlling expenses. Excluding the increase in the litigation reserve relating to several existing matters, operating expenses were down 5% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower professional and consulting fees and seasonally lower business development expense, and decreases in nearly all other expense categories. 
On January 1, we adopted the FAS 167. This new statement increased our balance sheet by approximately 1%, or $2.7 billion, for the consolidation of certain asset management funds, C capital investments and securitizations. The changes make it a bit difficult to compare our prior results. There's $22 million on a net basis in affected revenue, $16 million would've been in the investment income and $6 million in Asset and Wealth Management revenue. The non-controlling interest is a negative number. It's not a cost, it's just basically the performance of our clients asset that we manage and we require to consolidate.
On Page 9 of the Earnings Review, we provide detail on the securities portfolio. The table shows amortized cost, fair value and ratings. Watch list securities continued to decline from the prior quarter. The restructured securities are included under the Grantor Trust and their market value has improved nicely as did every other asset class. Portfolio value was up about $750 million sequentially and nearly $8 billion year-over-year and has continued to improve in the current quarter. 
During the quarter, we enjoyed significant growth in capital and reduction in risk-weighted assets. As a result our key regulatory ratios strengthened meaningfully, Tier 1 increased 110 basis points to 13.2% , Tier 1 common also increased 110 basis points to 11.6% and our tangible common equity increased 90 basis points to 6.1%. 
In terms of our loan portfolio on Page 11, we're pleased to see that our risk reduction efforts have begun to pay dividends. The provision for credit losses declined from $65 million to $35 million in the first quarter, and that's driven by a decrease in higher risk-rated loans and non-performing loans. During the quarter, the total reserve for credit increased $10 million and net charge-offs totaled $25 million. 
The effective tax rate in the quarter on an operating basis was approximately 29%. If you exclude the impact of the litigation reserves, the restructuring charge and M&I expense, the effective tax rate was closer to 31%. And we would expect our effective tax rate to come in around the same area in the second quarter, so around 31%. 
Looking ahead and recognizing how the equity markets are moving, we're optimistic that the revenue momentum in Asset Management will continue in the coming quarters. In addition, DRs and Sec Lending should benefit from seasonality. Both NIR and fees continue to be impacted by the low interest rate environment, so any rise in rates will substantially improve performance. We expect net interest margin to be around 1.70% to 1.80%. And in terms of credit, we've been giving up yield but improving quality. Because of that strategy, we expect our lower credit provision to be sustainable. 
Two expense items to note. Our operating expense this second quarter will reflect the impact of U.K. bonus tax, which is approximately $25 million. And we awarded our annual company-wide merit increase of approximately 2% on April 1. So that will also come into our numbers. 
As Bob mentioned, we're using some of the excess capital that we're generating to make accretive transactions that contribute to the growth of our Asset Management and Securities Servicing businesses. And we would expect to start to see some of the benefits of the GIS and BHF acquisitions in the third quarter. 
In the meantime, the key to our performance will be continuing to win new business, controlling cost and delivering outstanding client service. All of which we've been successful in doing. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Bob."

As we kind of look at it, we looked at the revenues as a revenue per assets under management, and obviously since the fourth quarter, come down a little bit. But it's showing at least some signs of stabilization to potentially building. On that metric, how should we be thinking about it? Given the fact that as risk appetite increases, this sort of, marginal level of profitability or marginally unit of revenue may be increasing? Can you give me some context towards revenue growth versus asset management growth for the Asset Management section?"

EPS for the quarter was $0.49 or $601 million. On an operating basis, that was $0.59 or $715 million. Earnings were reduced by about 10% mainly due to increased litigation reserves for several existing matters. 
Overall, I characterize the quarter as an encouraging quarter. Fee revenue was positive and impacted by higher market values, and we demonstrated superb asset quality in both our loan and security portfolios. Offsetting this was money market fee waivers, lower trading volume and lower volatility, quarter-over-quarter. As you know, our business model is really levered to rates edging up and financial flows beginning to normalize at higher levels, and we have yet to see that at this point. 
Fee revenue has been unchanged sequentially and mostly due to seasonality in some of our businesses, which are somewhat unique, and up 6% versus a year ago. Asset and Wealth Management fees were up 13% over a year ago. We had net positive long-term flows of $16 billion in assets and client assets. Asset Servicing fee revenue grew by 17% year-over-year. Security lending spread and FX volatility levels remain muted. NII is down slightly compared to last year, but up 6% sequentially, principally reflecting the higher yield related to the restructured assets in our securities portfolio.  Operating expenses remained very well controlled. 
Together with our success in winning new business, we achieved another quarter of positive operating leverage. On the new business front, in addition to strong inflows in Asset Management, we had new Asset Servicing wins of over $200 billion in assets under custody, cutting across all client segments and geographies, whether it corporates, financial institutions, endowments or international. Pershing won a number of mandates, which we expect to be able to announce shortly. And Wealth Management had its 17th consecutive quarter of net long-term client asset inflows. 
We realized too that since the beginning of our financial crisis a couple of years ago, we've been successful in creating new products to help our clients fulfill more difficult and stringent reporting requirements. A couple of examples might include our new portfolio stress testing capabilities and our Derivative 360 product, which improves the transparency and helps clients reduce risks overall. Both of these products are strengthening our ties with clients and creating new revenue streams for the company overall. 
Credit quality trends are improving nicely. You may have noticed that the provision was down 46%, and non-performing assets were down 17% sequentially. And our unrealized pretax loss on the investment portfolio is not quite at break-even yet, but it's down 77% from year end, just in the last three months. 
Service levels remained very strong. In the last annual R&M Survey of custody clients and fund managers, BNY Mellon Asset Servicing was ranked number one overall in six key categories and ahead of our peer group in a further seven categories. In Global Investor Magazine's annual FX Survey, we are ranked number one in 25 categories, including four overall performance categories and 14 of the 20 service categories. This is the third consecutive year in which we've essentially dominated this survey. 
On the capital side, all of our key capital ratios strengthened during the quarter. You may have noted that our Tier 1 common and our Tier 1 capital are up over 100 basis points sequentially. As you know, we're using our capital to make accretive acquisitions and to support organic growth in both our core Asset Management and Security Servicing businesses. 
Our Asset Management results this quarter are already benefiting from the acquisition of Insight, which we closed last November. In this quarter, you may recall that we announced two Asset Servicing acquisitions: Global Investor Services, with operations primarily in the U.S., but also in our Ireland and Poland; and BHF Asset Servicing in Germany. Both of these deals are expected to close in the third quarter and will be immediately accretive to earnings. 
Also as previously reported, we still intend to raise about $700 million in common equity to fund these purchases and also to maintain strong capital ratios, in spite of the strength that we did see in the first quarter. 
So in summary, what I say the positives from this quarter is that we had nice year-over-year growth in revenue, AUM and assets under custody. Second, we had new business inflows, which are encouraging. Credit quality is excellent, expense control is evident and capital generation is strong. 
So maybe with that, I'll turn it over to Todd, so he can do the numbers with you in more detail."

As again at the numbers, my comments will follow the Quarterly Earnings Review that begins on Page 3. Our continuing EPS was $0.49 on a reported basis. It was reduced by a total of $0.10 due to an increase in our litigation reserve and M&I expenses. That gets us to an operating EPS of $0.59 for the quarter. 
Let's look at a few key items on a sequential basis. Net interest revenue was up 6%. Fee revenue was flat, but up 6% year-over-year. Non-interest expenses were down 5%. And that resulted in 600 basis points of positive operating leverage for the link quarter. The provision for credit losses declined $30 million and credit quality trends in the investment portfolio both showed good improvement. And as Bob had mentioned, all of our capital ratios strengthened. 
To put the quarter in perspective, we generated above trend's net interest and investment income of approximately $0.05. And I'll review those items in more detail shortly. 
Turning to Page 5 of the review, you can see that during the quarter, our Asset Management business generated $16 billion of positive long-term flows. Also during the quarter, equity appreciation was basically offset by the stronger U.S. dollar. 
Our AUM composition has a better balance than last year, which should lead to higher fee realization going forward. Assets under custody, which was flat sequentially, was helped by increased equity prices and new business, offset by the stronger U.S. dollar as well as our concentration in the fixed income markets. Securities on loan were modestly up at period end. 
Turning to Page 6 of the earnings review, which shows fee growth. Securities Servicing fees, excluding securities lending revenue, were down 3% quarter-over-quarter and down 2% year-over-year. And Asset Servicing fees were down 2% sequentially, due primarily to lower volumes and the stronger U.S. dollar, and up 17% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values and net new business. 
During the quarter, we won an incremental $205 billion in new business in Asset Servicing and the pipeline remains healthy. Security lending fees were down $1 million sequentially and $55 million compared with the first quarter of 2009. Both declines reflect lower volumes and lower spreads. 
Issuer Service fees were down 10% sequentially, and that was primarily reflecting the seasonally lower DR revenues in the first quarter and lower Corporate Trust fees driven by the continuing impact of money markets fee waivers. On a positive note, if you look at Trust fees and exclude money market-related distribution, excluding money market-related distribution fees, Trust fees are actually up 1% sequentially and year-over-year. Clearing fees were up 3% over the prior quarter and were down 9% over the prior year, resulting from lower volumes and also from money market fee waivers. 
Asset and Wealth Management fees excluding performance fees were up 1% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. Both increases reflect improved equity values, stronger investment performance, the Insight acquisition and the impact of long-term inflows, partially offset by a reduction in fees due to money market outflows and fee waivers due to the very low interest rate environment. The sequential increase is also negatively impacted by a stronger U.S. dollar. Money market fee waivers reduced fee revenue during the quarter by about 5% or $117 million, impacting Security Servicing fees and Asset and Wealth Management fees. This is expected to continue until we see the Central Bank's increase short-term rates. 
FX and other trading revenue was up 7% sequentially, reflecting higher fixed-income trading revenue and lower mark-to-market adjustments on credit default swaps that we used to hedge loan portfolio. The increase was partially offset by lower FX revenue, which was down 14% compared to the first quarter of 2009, reflecting lower volatility, partially offset by volumes. 
Investment and other income was driven by above-trend gains on continued disposition of lease assets and the positive FX revaluation for the quarter. We would expect lease gains to be lower going forward. 
Turning to Page 7 of the Earnings Review. Net interest revenue on a related margin reflect a positive impact of the higher yield related to the restructured investments securities portfolio and higher hedging gains. This was partially offset by a persistently low short-term interest rates globally. The margin is also impacted by a risk reduction strategy, which is helping to drive lower credit and impairment charges in the long run. 
Net interest revenue increased 6% sequentially and was down 1% over the year-ago quarter. The net interest margin was 1.89% compared with 1.77% in the prior quarter. The increase primarily reflects the higher yield in the assets in the Grantor Trust, partially offset by lower rates. 
As a reminder, in the third and fourth quarters, we restructured the investment securities portfolio. And that enabled us to sell the securities that we didn't think will perform well and retain the securities we thought had good potential for a recovery. So those retained securities were mark-to-market and put in a grantor trust. 
The Grantor Trust accretion for the quarter was higher than we had anticipated due to higher projected cash flows. The future yield on these assets will be driven by the level of interest rates and also the credit performance of the underlying securities. An added benefit is that the trust will actually help hedge our interest rate sensitivity. If rates rise, the yield will decline. And if rates go down, the yield should improve. 
In addition, we expect the trust principal to amortize over a five- or six-year period. So the NII benefit will decline modestly quarter-by-quarter as the principal reduces on this high-yielding asset. We now estimate that the restructuring will actually increase interest income for this year by about $320 million. 
NII was also benefited from hedging gains which are not likely to continue. We expect the impact from hedging gains and accretion to reduce the current quarterly run rate on NII by about $25 million to $30 million. And of course, the other key driver of our net interest margin will be when and if the Fed decides to raise rates. We continue to estimate that a 100 basis point immediate increase in the funds rate will add $500 million to our pretax, assuming no change in client behavior. 
Turning to non-interest expense on Page 8. You can see we did a good job of controlling expenses. Excluding the increase in the litigation reserve relating to several existing matters, operating expenses were down 5% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower professional and consulting fees and seasonally lower business development expense, and decreases in nearly all other expense categories. 
On January 1, we adopted the FAS 167. This new statement increased our balance sheet by approximately 1%, or $2.7 billion, for the consolidation of certain asset management funds, seed capital investments and securitizations. The changes make it a bit difficult to compare our prior results. There's $22 million on a net basis in affected revenue, $16 million would've been in the investment income and $6 million in Asset and Wealth Management revenue. The non-controlling interest is a negative number. It's not a cost, it's just basically the performance of our client's asset that we manage and we're required to consolidate.
On Page 9 of the Earnings Review, we provide detail on the securities portfolio. The table provided shows amortized cost, fair value and ratings. Watch list securities continued to decline from the prior quarter. The restructured securities are included under the Grantor Trust and their market value has improved nicely as did every other asset class. Portfolio value was up about $750 million sequentially and nearly $8 billion year-over-year and has continued to improve in the current quarter. 
During the quarter, we enjoyed significant growth in capital and reduction in risk-weighted assets. As a result, our key regulatory ratios strengthened meaningfully, Tier 1 increased 110 basis points to 13.2% , Tier 1 common also increased 110 basis points to 11.6% and our tangible common equity increased 90 basis points to 6.1%. 
In terms of our loan portfolio on Page 11, we're pleased to see that our risk reduction efforts have begun to pay dividends. The provision for credit losses declined from $65 million to $35 million in the first quarter, and that's driven by a decrease in higher risk-rated loans and non-performing loans. During the quarter, the total reserve for credit increased $10 million and net charge-offs totaled $25 million. 
The effective tax rate in the quarter on an operating basis was approximately 29%. If you exclude the impact of the litigation reserves, the restructuring charge and M&I expenses, the effective tax rate was closer to 31%. And we would expect our effective tax rate to come in around the same area in the second quarter, so around 31%. 
Looking ahead and recognizing how the equity markets are moving, we're optimistic that the revenue momentum in Asset Management will continue in the coming quarters. In addition, DRs and Sec Lending should benefit from seasonality. Both NIR and fees continue to be impacted by the low interest rate environment, so any rise in rates will substantially improve performance. We expect net interest margin to be around 1.70% to 1.80%. And in terms of credit, we've been giving up yield but improving quality. Because of that strategy, we expect our lower credit provision to be sustainable. 
Two expense items to note. Our operating expense for the second quarter will reflect the impact of U.K. bonus tax, which is approximately $25 million. And we awarded our annual company-wide merit increase of approximately 2% on April 1. So that will also come into our numbers. 
As Bob mentioned, we're using some of the excess capital that we're generating to make accretive transactions that contribute to the growth of our Asset Management and Securities Servicing businesses. And we would expect to start to see some of the benefits of the GIS and BHF acquisitions in the third quarter. 
In the meantime, the key to our performance will be continuing to win new business, controlling cost and delivering outstanding client service, all of which we've been successful in doing. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Bob."

In terms of AUM flows, we had about $16 billion overall across Asset and Wealth Management in positive net long-term flows, which was very strong, the strongest since, certainly, in the last five years per quarter, coming off the $13 billion we had last quarter. Short-term flows though is you're seeing everywhere were negative for us. It was a negative $25 billion.

So we tend to -- once this period is over, we tend to, if you will, bottom-up at a higher level than we did the last time and with slightly more share.

It seems globally. And the Europeans have a bit of a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis the American banks, at this point, in that we had more capital and we had more consolidation as well. So the key to it is that we have a level playing field globally. I don't think this is going to be implemented very quickly.

EPS for the quarter was $0.49 or $601 million. On an operating basis, that was $0.59 or $715 million. Earnings were reduced by about 10% mainly due to increased litigation reserves for several existing matters. 
Overall, I characterize the quarter as an encouraging quarter. Fee revenue was positive and impacted by higher market values, and we demonstrated superb asset quality in both our loan and security portfolios. Offsetting this was money market fee waivers, lower trading volume and lower volatility, quarter-over-quarter. As you know, our business model is really levered to rates edging up and financial flows beginning to normalize at higher levels, and we have yet to see that at this point. 
Fee revenue has been unchanged sequentially and mostly due to seasonality in some of our businesses, which are somewhat unique, and up 6% versus a year ago. Asset and Wealth Management fees were up 13% over a year ago. We had net positive long-term flows of $16 billion in assets and client assets. Asset Servicing fee revenue grew by 17% year-over-year. Security lending spread and FX volatility levels remain muted. NII is down slightly compared to last year, but up 6% sequentially, principally reflecting the higher yield related to the restructured assets in our securities portfolio.  Operating expenses remained very well controlled. 
Together with our success in winning new business, we achieved another quarter of positive operating leverage. On the new business front, in addition to strong inflows in Asset Management, we had new Asset Servicing wins of over $200 billion in assets under custody, cutting across all client segments and geographies, whether it corporates, financial institutions, endowments or international. Pershing won a number of mandates, which we expect to be able to announce shortly. And Wealth Management had its 17th consecutive quarter of net long-term client asset inflows. 
We realized too that since the beginning of our financial crisis a couple of years ago, we've been successful in creating new products to help our clients fulfill more difficult and stringent reporting requirements. A couple of examples might include our new portfolio stress testing capabilities and our Derivative 360 product, which improves the transparency and helps clients reduce risks overall. Both of these products are strengthening our ties with clients and creating new revenue streams for the company overall. 
Credit quality trends are improving nicely. You may have noticed that the provision was down 46%, and non-performing assets were down 17% sequentially. And our unrealized pretax loss on the investment portfolio is not quite at break-even yet, but it's down 77% from year end, just in the last three months. 
Service levels remained very strong. In the last annual R&M Survey of custody clients and fund managers, BNY Mellon Asset Servicing was ranked number one overall in six key categories and ahead of our peer group in a further seven categories. In Global Investor Magazine's annual FX Survey, we are ranked number one in 25 categories, including four overall performance categories and 14 of the 20 service categories. This is the third consecutive year in which we've essentially dominated this survey. 
On the capital side, all of our key capital ratios strengthened during the quarter. You may have noted that our Tier 1 common and our Tier 1 capital are up over 100 basis points sequentially. As you know, we're using our capital to make accretive acquisitions and to support organic growth in both our core Asset Management and Security Servicing businesses. 
Our Asset Management results this quarter are already benefiting from the acquisition of Insight, which we closed last November. In this quarter, you may recall that we announced two Asset Servicing acquisitions: Global Investor Services, with operations primarily in the U.S., but also in our Ireland and Poland; and BHF Asset Servicing in Germany. Both of these deals are expected to close in the third quarter and will be immediately accretive to earnings. 
Also as previously reported, we still intend to raise about $700 million in common equity to fund these purchases and also to maintain strong capital ratios, in spite of the strength that we did see in the first quarter. 
So in summary, what I say the positives from this quarter is that we had nice year-over-year growth in revenue, AUM and assets under custody. Second, we had new business inflows, which are encouraging. Credit quality is excellent, expense control is evident and capital generation is strong. 
So maybe with that, I'll turn it over to Todd, so he can do the numbers with you in more detail."

As again at the numbers, my comments will follow the Quarterly Earnings Review that begins on Page 3. Our continuing EPS was $0.49 on a reported basis. It was reduced by a total of $0.10 due to an increase in our litigation reserve and M&I expenses. That gets us to an operating EPS of $0.59 for the quarter. 
Let's look at a few key items on a sequential basis. Net interest revenue was up 6%. Fee revenue was flat, but up 6% year-over-year. Non-interest expenses were down 5%. And that resulted in 600 basis points of positive operating leverage for the link quarter. The provision for credit losses declined $30 million and credit quality trends in the investment portfolio both showed good improvement. And as Bob had mentioned, all of our capital ratios strengthened. 
To put the quarter in perspective, we generated above trend's net interest and investment income of approximately $0.05. And I'll review those items in more detail shortly. 
Turning to Page 5 of the review, you can see that during the quarter, our Asset Management business generated $16 billion of positive long-term flows. Also during the quarter, equity appreciation was basically offset by the stronger U.S. dollar. 
Our AUM composition has a better balance than last year, which should lead to higher fee realization going forward. Assets under custody, which was flat sequentially, was helped by increased equity prices and new business, offset by the stronger U.S. dollar as well as our concentration in the fixed income markets. Securities on loan were modestly up at period end. 
Turning to Page 6 of the earnings review, which shows fee growth. Securities Servicing fees, excluding securities lending revenue, were down 3% quarter-over-quarter and down 2% year-over-year. And Asset Servicing fees were down 2% sequentially, due primarily to lower volumes and the stronger U.S. dollar, and up 17% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values and net new business. 
During the quarter, we won an incremental $205 billion in new business in Asset Servicing and the pipeline remains healthy. Security lending fees were down $1 million sequentially and $55 million compared with the first quarter of 2009. Both declines reflect lower volumes and lower spreads. 
Issuer Service fees were down 10% sequentially, and that was primarily reflecting the seasonally lower DR revenues in the first quarter and lower Corporate Trust fees driven by the continuing impact of money markets fee waivers. On a positive note, if you look at Trust fees and exclude money market-related distribution, excluding money market-related distribution fees, Trust fees are actually up 1% sequentially and year-over-year. Clearing fees were up 3% over the prior quarter and were down 9% over the prior year, resulting from lower volumes and also from money market fee waivers. 
Asset and Wealth Management fees excluding performance fees were up 1% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. Both increases reflect improved equity values, stronger investment performance, the Insight acquisition and the impact of long-term inflows, partially offset by a reduction in fees due to money market outflows and fee waivers due to the very low interest rate environment. The sequential increase is also negatively impacted by a stronger U.S. dollar. Money market fee waivers reduced fee revenue during the quarter by about 5% or $117 million, impacting Security Servicing fees and Asset and Wealth Management fees. This is expected to continue until we see the Central Bank's increase short-term rates. 
FX and other trading revenue was up 7% sequentially, reflecting higher fixed-income trading revenue and lower mark-to-market adjustments on credit default swaps that we used to hedge loan portfolio. The increase was partially offset by lower FX revenue, which was down 14% compared to the first quarter of 2009, reflecting lower volatility, partially offset by volumes. 
Investment and other income was driven by above-trend gains on continued disposition of lease assets and the positive FX revaluation for the quarter. We would expect lease gains to be lower going forward. 
Turning to Page 7 of the Earnings Review. Net interest revenue on a related margin reflect a positive impact of the higher yield related to the restructured investments securities portfolio and higher hedging gains. This was partially offset by a persistently low short-term interest rates globally. The margin is also impacted by a risk reduction strategy, which is helping to drive lower credit and impairment charges in the long run. 
Net interest revenue increased 6% sequentially and was down 1% over the year-ago quarter. The net interest margin was 1.89% compared with 1.77% in the prior quarter. The increase primarily reflects the higher yield in the assets in the Grantor Trust, partially offset by lower rates. 
As a reminder, in the third and fourth quarters, we restructured the investment securities portfolio. And that enabled us to sell the securities that we didn't think will perform well and retain the securities we thought had good potential for a recovery. So those retained securities were mark-to-market and put in a grantor trust. 
The Grantor Trust accretion for the quarter was higher than we had anticipated due to higher projected cash flows. The future yield on these assets will be driven by the level of interest rates and also the credit performance of the underlying securities. An added benefit is that the trust will actually help hedge our interest rate sensitivity. If rates rise, the yield will decline. And if rates go down, the yield should improve. 
In addition, we expect the trust principal to amortize over a five- or six-year period. So the NII benefit will decline modestly quarter-by-quarter as the principal reduces on this high-yielding asset. We now estimate that the restructuring will actually increase interest income for this year by about $320 million. 
NII was also benefited from hedging gains which are not likely to continue. We expect the impact from hedging gains and accretion to reduce the current quarterly run rate on NII by about $25 million to $30 million. And of course, the other key driver of our net interest margin will be when and if the Fed decides to raise rates. We continue to estimate that a 100 basis point immediate increase in the funds rate will add $500 million to our pretax, assuming no change in client behavior. 
Turning to non-interest expense on Page 8. You can see we did a good job of controlling expenses. Excluding the increase in the litigation reserve relating to several existing matters, operating expenses were down 5% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower professional and consulting fees and seasonally lower business development expense, and decreases in nearly all other expense categories. 
On January 1, we adopted the FAS 167. This new statement increased our balance sheet by approximately 1%, or $2.7 billion, for the consolidation of certain asset management funds, seed capital investments and securitizations. The changes make it a bit difficult to compare our prior results. There's $22 million on a net basis in affected revenue, $16 million would've been in the investment income and $6 million in Asset and Wealth Management revenue. The non-controlling interest is a negative number. It's not a cost, it's just basically the performance of our client's asset that we manage and we're required to consolidate.
On Page 9 of the Earnings Review, we provide detail on the securities portfolio. The table provided shows amortized cost, fair value and ratings. Watch list securities continued to decline from the prior quarter. The restructured securities are included under the Grantor Trust and their market value has improved nicely as did every other asset class. Portfolio value was up about $750 million sequentially and nearly $8 billion year-over-year and has continued to improve in the current quarter. 
During the quarter, we enjoyed significant growth in capital and reduction in risk-weighted assets. As a result, our key regulatory ratios strengthened meaningfully, Tier 1 increased 110 basis points to 13.2% , Tier 1 common also increased 110 basis points to 11.6% and our tangible common equity increased 90 basis points to 6.1%. 
In terms of our loan portfolio on Page 11, we're pleased to see that our risk reduction efforts have begun to pay dividends. The provision for credit losses declined from $65 million to $35 million in the first quarter, and that's driven by a decrease in higher risk-rated loans and non-performing loans. During the quarter, the total reserve for credit increased $10 million and net charge-offs totaled $25 million. 
The effective tax rate in the quarter on an operating basis was approximately 29%. If you exclude the impact of the litigation reserves, the restructuring charge and M&I expenses, the effective tax rate was closer to 31%. And we would expect our effective tax rate to come in around the same area in the second quarter, so around 31%. 
Looking ahead and recognizing how the equity markets are moving, we're optimistic that the revenue momentum in Asset Management will continue in the coming quarters. In addition, DRs and Sec Lending should benefit from seasonality. Both NIR and fees continue to be impacted by the low interest rate environment, so any rise in rates will substantially improve performance. We expect net interest margin to be around 1.70% to 1.80%. And in terms of credit, we've been giving up yield but improving quality. Because of that strategy, we expect our lower credit provision to be sustainable. 
Two expense items to note. Our operating expense for the second quarter will reflect the impact of U.K. bonus tax, which is approximately $25 million. And we awarded our annual company-wide merit increase of approximately 2% on April 1. So that will also come into our numbers. 
As Bob mentioned, we're using some of the excess capital that we're generating to make accretive transactions that contribute to the growth of our Asset Management and Securities Servicing businesses. And we would expect to start to see some of the benefits of the GIS and BHF acquisitions in the third quarter. 
In the meantime, the key to our performance will be continuing to win new business, controlling cost and delivering outstanding client service, all of which we've been successful in doing. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Bob."

As we kind of look at it, we looked at the revenues as a revenue per assets under management, and obviously since the fourth quarter, come down a little bit.

EPS for the quarter was $0.49 or $601 million. On an operating basis, that was $0.59 or $715 million. Earnings were reduced by about 10% mainly due to increased litigation reserves for several existing matters. 
Overall, I characterize the quarter as an encouraging quarter. Fee revenue was positive and impacted by higher market values, and we demonstrated superb asset quality in both our loan and security portfolios. Offsetting this was money market fee waivers, lower trading volume and lower volatility, quarter-over-quarter. As you know, our business model is really levered to rates edging up and financial flows beginning to normalize at higher levels, and we have yet to see that at this point. 
Fee revenue has been unchanged sequentially and mostly due to seasonality in some of our businesses, which are somewhat unique, and up 6% versus a year ago. Asset and Wealth Management fees were up 13% over a year ago. We had net positive long-term flows of $16 billion in assets and client assets. Asset Servicing fee revenue grew by 17% year-over-year. Security lending spread and FX volatility levels remain muted. NII is down slightly compared to last year, but up 6% sequentially, principally reflecting the higher yield related to the restructured assets in our securities portfolio.  Operating expenses remained very well controlled. 
Together with our success in winning new business, we achieved another quarter of positive operating leverage. On the new business front, in addition to strong inflows in Asset Management, we had new Asset Servicing wins of over $200 billion in assets under custody, cutting across all client segments and geographies, whether it corporates, financial institutions, endowments or international. Pershing won a number of mandates, which we expect to be able to announce shortly. And Wealth Management had its 17th consecutive quarter of net long-term client asset inflows. 
We realized too that since the beginning of our financial crisis a couple of years ago, we've been successful in creating new products to help our clients fulfill more difficult and stringent reporting requirements. A couple of examples might include our new portfolio stress testing capabilities and our Derivative 360 product, which improves the transparency and helps clients reduce risks overall. Both of these products are strengthening our ties with clients and creating new revenue streams for the company overall. 
Credit quality trends are improving nicely. You may have noticed that the provision was down 46%, and non-performing assets were down 17% sequentially. And our unrealized pretax loss on the investment portfolio is not quite at break-even yet, but it's down 77% from year end, just in the last three months. 
Service levels remained very strong. In the last annual R&M Survey of custody clients and fund managers, BNY Mellon Asset Servicing was ranked number one overall in six key categories and ahead of our peer group in a further seven categories. In Global Investor Magazine's annual FX Survey, we are ranked number one in 25 categories, including four overall performance categories and 14 of the 20 service categories. This is the third consecutive year in which we've essentially dominated this survey. 
On the capital side, all of our key capital ratios strengthened during the quarter. You may have noted that our Tier 1 common and our Tier 1 capital are up over 100 basis points sequentially. As you know, we're using our capital to make accretive acquisitions and to support organic growth in both our core Asset Management and Security Servicing businesses. 
Our Asset Management results this quarter are already benefiting from the acquisition of Insight, which we closed last November. In this quarter, you may recall that we announced two Asset Servicing acquisitions: Global Investor Services, with operations primarily in the U.S., but also in our Ireland and Poland; and BHF Asset Servicing in Germany. Both of these deals are expected to close in the third quarter and will be immediately accretive to earnings. 
Also as previously reported, we still intend to raise about $700 million in common equity to fund these purchases and also to maintain strong capital ratios, in spite of the strength that we did see in the first quarter. 
So in summary, what I say the positives from this quarter is that we had nice year-over-year growth in revenue, AUM and assets under custody. Second, we had new business inflows, which are encouraging. Credit quality is excellent, expense control is evident and capital generation is strong. 
So maybe with that, I'll turn it over to Todd, so he can do the numbers with you in more detail."

As again at the numbers, my comments will follow the Quarterly Earnings Review that begins on Page 3. Our continuing EPS was $0.49 on a reported basis. It was reduced by a total of $0.10 due to an increase in our litigation reserve and M&I expenses. That gets us to an operating EPS of $0.59 for the quarter. 
Let's look at a few key items on a sequential basis. Net interest revenue was up 6%. Fee revenue was flat, but up 6% year-over-year. Non-interest expenses were down 5%. And that resulted in 600 basis points of positive operating leverage for the link quarter. The provision for credit losses declined $30 million and credit quality trends in the investment portfolio both showed good improvement. And as Bob had mentioned, all of our capital ratios strengthened. 
To put the quarter in perspective, we generated above trend's net interest and investment income of approximately $0.05. And I'll review those items in more detail shortly. 
Turning to Page 5 of the review, you can see that during the quarter, our Asset Management business generated $16 billion of positive long-term flows. Also during the quarter, equity appreciation was basically offset by the stronger U.S. dollar. 
Our AUM composition has a better balance than last year, which should lead to higher fee realization going forward. Assets under custody, which was flat sequentially, was helped by increased equity prices and new business, offset by the stronger U.S. dollar as well as our concentration in the fixed income markets. Securities on loan were modestly up at period end. 
Turning to Page 6 of the earnings review, which shows fee growth. Securities Servicing fees, excluding securities lending revenue, were down 3% quarter-over-quarter and down 2% year-over-year. And Asset Servicing fees were down 2% sequentially, due primarily to lower volumes and the stronger U.S. dollar, and up 17% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values and net new business. 
During the quarter, we won an incremental $205 billion in new business in Asset Servicing and the pipeline remains healthy. Security lending fees were down $1 million sequentially and $55 million compared with the first quarter of 2009. Both declines reflect lower volumes and lower spreads. 
Issuer Service fees were down 10% sequentially, and that was primarily reflecting the seasonally lower DR revenues in the first quarter and lower Corporate Trust fees driven by the continuing impact of money markets fee waivers. On a positive note, if you look at Trust fees and exclude money market-related distribution, excluding money market-related distribution fees, Trust fees are actually up 1% sequentially and year-over-year. Clearing fees were up 3% over the prior quarter and were down 9% over the prior year, resulting from lower volumes and also from money market fee waivers. 
Asset and Wealth Management fees excluding performance fees were up 1% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. Both increases reflect improved equity values, stronger investment performance, the Insight acquisition and the impact of long-term inflows, partially offset by a reduction in fees due to money market outflows and fee waivers due to the very low interest rate environment. The sequential increase is also negatively impacted by a stronger U.S. dollar. Money market fee waivers reduced fee revenue during the quarter by about 5% or $117 million, impacting Security Servicing fees and Asset and Wealth Management fees. This is expected to continue until we see the Central Bank's increase short-term rates. 
FX and other trading revenue was up 7% sequentially, reflecting higher fixed-income trading revenue and lower mark-to-market adjustments on credit default swaps that we used to hedge loan portfolio. The increase was partially offset by lower FX revenue, which was down 14% compared to the first quarter of 2009, reflecting lower volatility, partially offset by volumes. 
Investment and other income was driven by above-trend gains on continued disposition of lease assets and the positive FX revaluation for the quarter. We would expect lease gains to be lower going forward. 
Turning to Page 7 of the Earnings Review. Net interest revenue on a related margin reflect a positive impact of the higher yield related to the restructured investments securities portfolio and higher hedging gains. This was partially offset by a persistently low short-term interest rates globally. The margin is also impacted by a risk reduction strategy, which is helping to drive lower credit and impairment charges in the long run. 
Net interest revenue increased 6% sequentially and was down 1% over the year-ago quarter. The net interest margin was 1.89% compared with 1.77% in the prior quarter. The increase primarily reflects the higher yield in the assets in the Grantor Trust, partially offset by lower rates. 
As a reminder, in the third and fourth quarters, we restructured the investment securities portfolio. And that enabled us to sell the securities that we didn't think will perform well and retain the securities we thought had good potential for a recovery. So those retained securities were mark-to-market and put in a grantor trust. 
The Grantor Trust accretion for the quarter was higher than we had anticipated due to higher projected cash flows. The future yield on these assets will be driven by the level of interest rates and also the credit performance of the underlying securities. An added benefit is that the trust will actually help hedge our interest rate sensitivity. If rates rise, the yield will decline. And if rates go down, the yield should improve. 
In addition, we expect the trust principal to amortize over a five- or six-year period. So the NII benefit will decline modestly quarter-by-quarter as the principal reduces on this high-yielding asset. We now estimate that the restructuring will actually increase interest income for this year by about $320 million. 
NII was also benefited from hedging gains which are not likely to continue. We expect the impact from hedging gains and accretion to reduce the current quarterly run rate on NII by about $25 million to $30 million. And of course, the other key driver of our net interest margin will be when and if the Fed decides to raise rates. We continue to estimate that a 100 basis point immediate increase in the funds rate will add $500 million to our pretax, assuming no change in client behavior. 
Turning to non-interest expense on Page 8. You can see we did a good job of controlling expenses. Excluding the increase in the litigation reserve relating to several existing matters, operating expenses were down 5% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower professional and consulting fees and seasonally lower business development expense, and decreases in nearly all other expense categories. 
On January 1, we adopted the FAS 167. This new statement increased our balance sheet by approximately 1%, or $2.7 billion, for the consolidation of certain asset management funds, seed capital investments and securitizations. The changes make it a bit difficult to compare our prior results. There's $22 million on a net basis in affected revenue, $16 million would've been in the investment income and $6 million in Asset and Wealth Management revenue. The non-controlling interest is a negative number. It's not a cost, it's just basically the performance of our client's asset that we manage and we're required to consolidate.
On Page 9 of the Earnings Review, we provide detail on the securities portfolio. The table provided shows amortized cost, fair value and ratings. Watch list securities continued to decline from the prior quarter. The restructured securities are included under the Grantor Trust and their market value has improved nicely as did every other asset class. Portfolio value was up about $750 million sequentially and nearly $8 billion year-over-year and has continued to improve in the current quarter. 
During the quarter, we enjoyed significant growth in capital and reduction in risk-weighted assets. As a result, our key regulatory ratios strengthened meaningfully, Tier 1 increased 110 basis points to 13.2% , Tier 1 common also increased 110 basis points to 11.6% and our tangible common equity increased 90 basis points to 6.1%. 
In terms of our loan portfolio on Page 11, we're pleased to see that our risk reduction efforts have begun to pay dividends. The provision for credit losses declined from $65 million to $35 million in the first quarter, and that's driven by a decrease in higher risk-rated loans and non-performing loans. During the quarter, the total reserve for credit increased $10 million and net charge-offs totaled $25 million. 
The effective tax rate in the quarter on an operating basis was approximately 29%. If you exclude the impact of the litigation reserves, the restructuring charge and M&I expenses, the effective tax rate was closer to 31%. And we would expect our effective tax rate to come in around the same area in the second quarter, so around 31%. 
Looking ahead and recognizing how the equity markets are moving, we're optimistic that the revenue momentum in Asset Management will continue in the coming quarters. In addition, DRs and Sec Lending should benefit from seasonality. Both NIR and fees continue to be impacted by the low interest rate environment, so any rise in rates will substantially improve performance. We expect net interest margin to be around 1.70% to 1.80%. And in terms of credit, we've been giving up yield but improving quality. Because of that strategy, we expect our lower credit provision to be sustainable. 
Two expense items to note. Our operating expense for the second quarter will reflect the impact of U.K. bonus tax, which is approximately $25 million. And we awarded our annual company-wide merit increase of approximately 2% on April 1. So that will also come into our numbers. 
As Bob mentioned, we're using some of the excess capital that we're generating to make accretive transactions that contribute to the growth of our Asset Management and Securities Servicing businesses. And we would expect to start to see some of the benefits of the GIS and BHF acquisitions in the third quarter. 
In the meantime, the key to our performance will be continuing to win new business, controlling cost and delivering outstanding client service, all of which we've been successful in doing. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Bob."

But having said that, we believe in having a really strong balance sheet, and we want to make sure we can continue to invest organically and maybe at the margins, at least, in small acquisitions.

It's coming from the release of the compression on our net interest income and also having a little higher yield in the money market funds really means that we won't have to waive so many fees. It is not linear. The first 25 basis points is more valuable to us than the last 25 basis points of that 100. So I would say, we probably capture close to 50% to 60% of the, maybe, the first two moves. So we'll definitely catch more than 60% the first two moves, but almost all that in the first move. And then it kind of slows down. The assumption that we've made, and it's hard for us to do in any other way because we'd just be speculating, is that our deposit levels remaining where they are today and that the money market funds remain where they are today. Now typically, you might see some money exit money market funds that you see a rise in rates, but who knows, you might see people actually attracted to them. But in order to give you the statistic, we'll give you the sense of really what's driving off what we know. That's how we came up with that estimate."

It's all about quality of capital, it seems, globally. And the Europeans have a bit of a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis the American banks at this point, and that we had more capital and we had more consolidation as well. So the key to it is that we have a level playing field globally. I don't think this is going to be implemented very quickly.

Thanks for joining us. EPS in Q2 is $0.55 or $668 million. We booked good growth in securities servicing fees and in Asset Management, and Wealth Management posted a the third consecutive quarter of positive long-term asset flows. That's equivalent to $12 billion for the quarter and $42 billion over the last nine months. 
Continuing on the new business front, we had new asset servicing wins of $419 billion in assets under custody. In Broker-Dealer Services, we had really nice success in winning new collateral management business, particularly in Europe. Pershing had some big wins that we will be converting in the third and fourth quarters, but with a lot of expenses in Q2 in advance of that. Depository Receipts are continuing to win new business. And overall, we're maintaining or growing our market shares. 
Net interest income was up slightly compared to last year and down about 6% sequentially. This decline was primarily due to our risk management strategy in both loan and bank placement portfolios, and we're going to be looking closely at strategies to replace this revenue in the third and fourth quarters. 
Credit improvement continues. It reflects what is clearly now a very clean balance sheet. Sequentially, our provision was actually down 43% and non-performing assets were down 12%. We also went from having an unrealized pretax loss on the investment portfolio in Q1 to a gain of $292 million at June 30. We continue to generate capital, TCE, Tier 1 and Tier 1 Common all strengthened. Service levels remain excellent, in the latest Global Investor survey, global custody clients we were ranked number one over major peers in 16 categories. Global Custodian magazine released its Securities Lending survey in May. We were ranked number one overall in two categories, which is particularly pleasing to see since the last couple of years have been pretty tough times for both the holders and the lenders of assets. 
We're also continuing to invest in the future growth of our businesses. On July 1, we successfully closed the GIS [Global Investment Servicing Inc.] acquisition. And just a quick update on that, we're really pleased with how everything is going so far, which is a reflection of the terrific work being done by the integration teams across the company. As you may recall, our deal model relied very little on revenue synergies in the early years. Having said that, the first couple of weeks post-closing have been pretty encouraging. We're starting to see a very nice revenue synergies, we're looking forward to seeing more of that to come. Cultures are mixing well, people are working very well together as one company already. And it's also a nice expansion in Europe, particularly related to hedge fund administration. So bottom line is, we're pretty optimistic about our ability to achieve the expense and revenue synergies that made this feel so attractive in the first place. 
On other fronts, we expect to close the BHF Asset Servicing deal in Germany next month. We recently received final regulatory approval to open our asset management joint venture based in Shanghai. This will enable us to start offering new products in China, as well as to our international clients, and we expect to able to do that later this year. We've received approval to provide more asset management capabilities in Korea. We also announced the acquisition of a wealth management firm in Toronto, our first wealth management acquisition outside the United States. 
So there's a lot of activity underway to build the future revenue pipeline, as well as our global footprint. Let me say the key takeaways before we hand it over to Todd, would be solid earnings, very strong balance sheet, we're generating capital and we're investing for the future. 
So let's hand it over to Todd to go through the numbers in more detail."

As I get into the numbers, my comments will follow the Quarterly Earnings Review beginning on Page 3. Let me isolate a few key data points on a sequential basis. 
First of all, we earned $0.55 for the quarter on both a reported and operating basis. Fee revenue benefited from a 6% increase in securities servicing fees and a 39% increase in foreign exchange. Net interest revenue was down 6%, which was slightly more than expected due to the defensive investment strategy that Bob just mentioned. Non-interest expenses were up 3%. We'll get into the detail on that in a minute. Credit quality trends continue to improve. Provision for credit losses was $20 million, down from $35 million in Q1, and reserve levels actually increased. Our businesses continued to generate excess capital during the second quarter. We actually increased Tier 1 capital by over $430 million and tangible capital by almost $800 million. 
If you turn to Page 5 of the review, assets under management and assets under custody were both up year-over-year but down sequentially due to the strong dollar and the decline of the value of equity markets globally. In assets under management, we had our third consecutive quarter of strong, long-term asset flows. Over the last three quarters, we've had a total of $42 billion in long-term flows, including $12 billion this quarter, and is a principally fixed income and global equity strategies. Money market flows remains negative and that's consistent with industry trends. The good news here is that we're beginning to see an increase in money market yields reflecting a steeper yield curve at the short ends. 
If you turn to Page 6 of the earnings review, that shows our fee growth. Security servicing fees were up 6% quarter-over-quarter and down 2% year-over-year. And asset servicing fees were up 2% sequentially, due primarily to new business and higher transaction volumes and up 8% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values, net new business and higher transaction volumes. During the quarter, we won an incremental $419 billion in new business in Asset Servicing.
Securities lending fees were up $17 million sequentially and down $51 million compared with the second quarter of 2009. The sequential increase reflects seasonality, while the year-over-year decline reflects narrower spreads and slightly lower loan balances. Issuer service fees were up 6% sequentially, primarily reflecting seasonality in depository receipts and shareowner services, which was partially offset by lower corporate trust fees, which is impacted by the continued very low debt issuance globally. 
Clearing fees were up 7% due to higher trading volumes, as well as a stronger money market-related fees, and they're down 2% over the prior year, primarily reflecting the lower money market-related distribution fees from that period. Asset and wealth management fees, adjusting for performance fees and income from consolidated asset management funds, were down 1% sequentially, not too bad given that the S&P was down 12% and the MSCI was down 15%. Fees were up 12% year-over-year, reflecting improved market values, the Insight acquisition and the impact of new business, which was partially offset by higher fee waivers and a reduction of fees due to money market outflows.
FX revenue of $244 million was up 39% sequentially on higher volatility. The FX and other trading line was down 16%, however, due to negative other trading revenue of $24 million, which is largely the result of the credit value adjustment, driven by widening spreads in the quarter, as well as the lower level of fixed income trading. The decline in FX and other trading is somewhat offset by translation and leasing residual gains and investment in other income, which is up $92 million on a year-over-year basis. The translation gain largely resulted from the decline in euro over the period.
Turning to Page 7 of the earnings review, NIR and the related margin reflect the impact of persistently low short-term interest rate globally. As you may recall, we indicated in Q1 that net interest revenue would decline by about $30 million versus Q1 in the second quarter, and that was due to hedging gains that we enjoyed in the first quarter, as well as some other items. As it turned out, NIR was actually down $43 million sequentially. The larger decline was primarily driven by the defensive stance we took in short-term investments, in light of the situation in Europe and the continued reduction in our targeted loan portfolio, which is actually moving a little faster than expected. Versus the year ago quarter, net interest revenue was actually up 3%. The net interest margin was 1.74% compared with 1.89% in the prior quarter, it's pretty much in line with previous guidance. And the decrease primarily reflects the factors that I just discussed.
Turning to non-interest expense on Page 8, we can see that the sequential increase of 3%, primarily reflects four items: First of all, we had the impact of our annual merit increase, which is 2%, effective April 1. We also expensed the U.K. bonus tax in the quarter. We also had seasonally high business development expenses. This was partially due to client conferences we held in the second quarter that have been canceled last year, and there were also costs related to business we expect to convert in the second half. And finally, about half of the increase was related to the quarterly change in the market value of Lehman securities that we've supported.
During the quarter, we continue to generate significant capital, $430 million in Tier 1 and nearly $800 million intangible. As a result, our key regulatory ratios have all increased by 20 basis points. Tier 1 to 13.50%, Tier 1 Common to 11.80% and TCE to 6.30%. Our balance sheet was a bit high at quarter end, largely reflecting a spike in the number of large client deposits. And concurrent with the GIS and BHF acquisitions, what we had projected is a deal model that after closing, our TCE would be around 4.9% and Tier 1 Common would be at 10%. We also successfully, as we had indicated, we would do, we successfully raised $700 million of common equity via forward sale agreement. That will settle in the third quarter. And based on the current levels of our capital ratios, we're confident that the ratios will actually come in higher than we had indicated when we announced the acquisitions.
Moving to our loan portfolio on Page 11. While our risk reduction efforts are having a modestly negative impact in NII, as I discussed earlier, they're actually benefiting our credit costs. The provision for credit losses declined from $35 million to $20 million in the second quarter, and that reflects a decrease in higher risk rated loans, as well as non-performing loans. During the quarter, the total reserve for credit losses actually increased $7 million as net charge-offs totaled $13 million versus the provision of $20 million. The effective tax rate in the second quarter was approximately 30.2%. During the third quarter, we would expect our effective tax rate to come in around the 30% to 31% range as well.
So looking ahead, our third quarter results will begin to reflect the full quarter impact of GIS and the two-month impact of the BHF acquisition, and we expect these to be neutral to slightly accretive. Bear in mind that the third quarter earnings have traditionally been impacted by seasonality associated with lower levels of capital market related revenues, particularly securities lending and foreign exchange. We expect the net interest margin to continue to be in the range of 1.70% to $1.80%. Our lower credit provision should be sustainable, and we will continue to manage expense growth. We will also continue to focus on the drivers of revenue growth, which includes winning new business, converting as quickly as possible and delivering exceptional client service. These are the keys to success and are things we've proven we can do well. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Bob."

But I suspect that -- I don't suspect, I know, that we're in an increasingly globalized economy, and that's not going away. It's going to be more and more and more global and more integrated, which will imply that over time, more and more of our business is going to be outside of the U.S. So one of the themes you heard here this morning is that at the margin, we are becoming more international by business. We are particularly focused on Asia-Pacific. No acquisition opportunities there. But on the other hand, great organic growth opportunities. We're continuing to invest executives and strategies on there. Maybe there will be some JV opportunities in Asia-Pacific where we can partner with important players there to help them be more successful over time and to provide our global infrastructure. Europe is, I suspect, is going to be an opportunity going forward as well, both organically and maybe even through smaller acquisitions in our core businesses. I keep thinking of just the very simplistic reality that over the last 10 or 20 years in the United States, just about everyone got out of the custody business because if you're a sub-scale in terms of the size in your book of business and in recognition of what clients were expecting in terms of investment in new software and capabilities, eventually, that's going to happen in Europe as well and no one can predict timing on that. But the hard-core reality is there's a lot of sub-scale players in Europe still, and we'll see if that creates opportunities for us in years to come. And the other advantage we have that's fairly material is that on average, our Asset Management products are very well priced, and their performance is excellent compared to many of our global competitors outside of the U.S. So I think the inevitable outcome is that even in an environment where you have more uncertainty about the global outlook, savings rates are going to continue to be extraordinarily strong and cross-boarder capabilities will be undoubtedly of huge importance."

And then the question would be, which is really important, is could you actually grow the business, because you never want to buy something that even though it's financially attractive on day one, that is low growth. So if we could bring our global capabilities to something, would it make sense over time? And I guess the easy answer to that is -- I just don't know the answer to that yet, but that's something that, obviously, you have to think about. I do worry, frankly, about higher regulatory costs in Europe, bank taxes. We saw the U.K. do this. Recently, there's talk of France and Germany doing it; perhaps, Belgium. We're not hearing it from Ireland. But if national entities want to really increase taxes, the makes the economics much more difficult and less attractive to us, and I guess we could talk separately about any tax in the U.S."

It's more of the, I guess, closely guarded realities of people working very, very hard towards, which I'm still continuing to hear and continue to read that there's going to be some kind of global accord on capital and liquidity by November for the Korean G20 announcement. So I think most governments want to get this over with and so that progress has been made. I think it's a given that the minimum capital ratios are going to rise. The quality of capital has to go up. Liquidity has to go up. That's an easy bet. Then the question would be for the median player, will their capital have to increase as well? My guess is probably true. It's not clear to me, though, that for the top quartile players whether or not they will have to add to capital. Because one of the realities I've learned over the past six months in speaking with our colleagues around the world, you do have to remember that in the U.S. here, we've been pretty aggressive in writing down assets and raising capital, much more so than in other countries around the world. So we have to think globally here. There are going to be other nations where they're just not going to be able to reach our level of capital for a long time. So I would think American banks have an advantage over many of our global peers. And I think we're going to have a long implementation period as a result as well, because certain of these economies are going to be very low growth. And it will be hard to grow capital rapidly. So it's going to be very interesting to see where we end up, and I am somewhat optimistic. But of course, this is the next very, very, very important step as we head into the next phase of regulatory reform, which is these global accords."

So I was in Brazil last month. Brazil added 1.7 million jobs in the last 12 months. GDP growth is 6% per annum. Brazil is a country that's on a roll; nearly 200 people, huge natural resources. We're investing aggressively in Brazil. We're going to continue to invest in Asia-Pacific. You think about a developed economy like Australia. They haven't had a recession in 20 years because they're enjoying the halo effect of good fundamental management of their economy, plus everything that's going on north of them, in China and India and Korea and other places. So that's going to be our primary focus. That is a smaller percentage of our company today. We really want that to grow. But that is the one area that really stands out as being a longer term priority for us."

How should we think about the trend over the coming quarters on a sort of intermediate term basis by virtue of the fact that -- should we expect that trend to continue? And if you could give me a sense for how much of servicing fees in the current quarter or in the past couple of quarters have not been tied to assets but more tied towards the functionality or service?"

There are a lot of issues there. But if you look in security servicing fees, we're really looking at a number of businesses including our Issuer Services business, our Clearing business as well as our Asset Servicing business. And there's a fair amount of volatility, as you know, in our Issuer Services specifically around Depositary Receipts. So ultimately, it is a reflection of the total amount of issuance and shares outstanding. But there are corporate actions and other things that tend to be a bit seasonal that can move that. So a little bit of the bump that you saw in the second quarter is reflective of that. It's somewhat offset by the very slow limited amount of activity that we're seeing in corporate trust, which again, is reflective of the amount of trusteeships that we have. And there you're just not seeing any new debt issuance globally. In terms of Asset Servicing, I'd turn it over to Jim to comment on."

So I think you're going to expect that 40% more likely to decline than increase as it relates to market sensitivity."

Thanks for joining us. EPS in Q2 is $0.55 or $668 million. We booked good growth in securities servicing fees and in Asset Management, and Wealth Management posted a the third consecutive quarter of positive long-term asset flows. That's equivalent to $12 billion for the quarter and $42 billion over the last nine months. 
Continuing on the new business front, we had new asset servicing wins of $419 billion in assets under custody. In Broker-Dealer Services, we had really nice success in winning new collateral management business, particularly in Europe. Pershing had some big wins that we will be converting in the third and fourth quarters, but with a lot of expenses in Q2 in advance of that. Depository Receipts are continuing to win new business. And overall, we're maintaining or growing our market shares. 
Net interest income was up slightly compared to last year and down about 6% sequentially. This decline was primarily due to our risk management strategy in both loan and bank placement portfolios, and we're going to be looking closely at strategies to replace this revenue in the third and fourth quarters. 
Credit improvement continues. It reflects what is clearly now a very clean balance sheet. Sequentially, our provision was actually down 43% and non-performing assets were down 12%. We also went from having an unrealized pretax loss on the investment portfolio in Q1 to a gain of $292 million at June 30. We continue to generate capital, TCE, Tier 1 and Tier 1 Common all strengthened. Service levels remain excellent, in the latest Global Investor survey, global custody clients we were ranked number one over major peers in 16 categories. Global Custodian magazine released its Securities Lending survey in May. We were ranked number one overall in two categories, which is particularly pleasing to see since the last couple of years have been pretty tough times for both the holders and the lenders of assets. 
We're also continuing to invest in the future growth of our businesses. On July 1, we successfully closed the GIS [Global Investment Servicing Inc.] acquisition. And just a quick update on that, we're really pleased with how everything is going so far, which is a reflection of the terrific work being done by the integration teams across the company. As you may recall, our deal model relied very little on revenue synergies in the early years. Having said that, the first couple of weeks post-closing have been pretty encouraging. We're starting to see a very nice revenue synergies, we're looking forward to seeing more of that to come. Cultures are mixing well, people are working very well together as one company already. And it's also a nice expansion in Europe, particularly related to hedge fund administration. So bottom line is, we're pretty optimistic about our ability to achieve the expense and revenue synergies that made this feel so attractive in the first place. 
On other fronts, we expect to close the BHF Asset Servicing deal in Germany next month. We recently received final regulatory approval to open our asset management joint venture based in Shanghai. This will enable us to start offering new products in China, as well as to our international clients, and we expect to able to do that later this year. We've received approval to provide more asset management capabilities in Korea. We also announced the acquisition of a wealth management firm in Toronto, our first wealth management acquisition outside the United States. 
So there's a lot of activity underway to build the future revenue pipeline, as well as our global footprint. Let me say the key takeaways before we hand it over to Todd, would be solid earnings, very strong balance sheet, we're generating capital and we're investing for the future. 
So let's hand it over to Todd to go through the numbers in more detail."

As I get into the numbers, my comments will follow the Quarterly Earnings Review beginning on Page 3. Let me isolate a few key data points on a sequential basis.

As I get into the numbers, my comments will follow the Quarterly Earnings Review beginning on Page 3. Let me isolate a few key data points on a sequential basis. 
First of all, we earned $0.55 for the quarter on both a reported and operating basis. Fee revenue benefited from a 6% increase in securities servicing fees and a 39% increase in foreign exchange. Net interest revenue was down 6%, which was slightly more than expected due to the defensive investment strategy that Bob just mentioned. Non-interest expenses were up 3%. We'll get into the detail on that in a minute. Credit quality trends continue to improve. Provision for credit losses was $20 million, down from $35 million in Q1, and reserve levels actually increased. Our businesses continued to generate excess capital during the second quarter. We actually increased Tier 1 capital by over $430 million and tangible capital by almost $800 million. 
If you turn to Page 5 of the review, assets under management and assets under custody were both up year-over-year but down sequentially due to the strong dollar and the decline of the value of equity markets globally. In assets under management, we had our third consecutive quarter of strong, long-term asset flows. Over the last three quarters, we've had a total of $42 billion in long-term flows, including $12 billion this quarter, and is a principally fixed income and global equity strategies. Money market flows remains negative and that's consistent with industry trends. The good news here is that we're beginning to see an increase in money market yields reflecting a steeper yield curve at the short ends. 
If you turn to Page 6 of the earnings review, that shows our fee growth. Security servicing fees were up 6% quarter-over-quarter and down 2% year-over-year. And asset servicing fees were up 2% sequentially, due primarily to new business and higher transaction volumes and up 8% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values, net new business and higher transaction volumes. During the quarter, we won an incremental $419 billion in new business in Asset Servicing.
Securities lending fees were up $17 million sequentially and down $51 million compared with the second quarter of 2009. The sequential increase reflects seasonality, while the year-over-year decline reflects narrower spreads and slightly lower loan balances. Issuer service fees were up 6% sequentially, primarily reflecting seasonality in depository receipts and shareowner services, which was partially offset by lower corporate trust fees, which is impacted by the continued very low debt issuance globally. 
Clearing fees were up 7% due to higher trading volumes, as well as a stronger money market-related fees, and they're down 2% over the prior year, primarily reflecting the lower money market-related distribution fees from that period. Asset and wealth management fees, adjusting for performance fees and income from consolidated asset management funds, were down 1% sequentially, not too bad given that the S&P was down 12% and the MSCI was down 15%. Fees were up 12% year-over-year, reflecting improved market values, the Insight acquisition and the impact of new business, which was partially offset by higher fee waivers and a reduction of fees due to money market outflows.
FX revenue of $244 million was up 39% sequentially on higher volatility. The FX and other trading line was down 16%, however, due to negative other trading revenue of $24 million, which is largely the result of the credit value adjustment, driven by widening spreads in the quarter, as well as the lower level of fixed income trading. The decline in FX and other trading is somewhat offset by translation and leasing residual gains and investment in other income, which is up $92 million on a year-over-year basis. The translation gain largely resulted from the decline in euro over the period.
Turning to Page 7 of the earnings review, NIR and the related margin reflect the impact of persistently low short-term interest rate globally. As you may recall, we indicated in Q1 that net interest revenue would decline by about $30 million versus Q1 in the second quarter, and that was due to hedging gains that we enjoyed in the first quarter, as well as some other items. As it turned out, NIR was actually down $43 million sequentially. The larger decline was primarily driven by the defensive stance we took in short-term investments, in light of the situation in Europe and the continued reduction in our targeted loan portfolio, which is actually moving a little faster than expected. Versus the year ago quarter, net interest revenue was actually up 3%. The net interest margin was 1.74% compared with 1.89% in the prior quarter, it's pretty much in line with previous guidance. And the decrease primarily reflects the factors that I just discussed.
Turning to non-interest expense on Page 8, we can see that the sequential increase of 3%, primarily reflects four items: First of all, we had the impact of our annual merit increase, which is 2%, effective April 1. We also expensed the U.K. bonus tax in the quarter. We also had seasonally high business development expenses. This was partially due to client conferences we held in the second quarter that have been canceled last year, and there were also costs related to business we expect to convert in the second half. And finally, about half of the increase was related to the quarterly change in the market value of Lehman securities that we've supported.
During the quarter, we continued to generate significant capital, $430 million in Tier 1 and nearly $800 million intangible. As a result, our key regulatory ratios have all increased by 20 basis points. Tier 1 to 13.50%, Tier 1 Common to 11.80% and TCE to 6.30%. Our balance sheet was a bit high at quarter end, largely reflecting a spike in a number of large client deposits. And concurrent with the GIS and BHF acquisitions, what we had projected in the deal model is that after closing, our TCE would be around 4.9% and Tier 1 Common would be at 10%. We also successfully, as we had indicated, we would do, we successfully raised $700 million of common equity via forward sale agreement. That will settle in the third quarter. And based on the current levels of our capital ratios, we're confident that the ratios will actually come in higher than we had indicated when we announced the acquisitions.
Moving to our loan portfolio on Page 11. While our risk reduction efforts are having a modestly negative impact in NII as I discussed earlier, they're actually benefiting our credit costs. The provision for credit losses declined from $35 million to $20 million in the second quarter, and that reflects a decrease in higher risk rated loans as well as non-performing loans. During the quarter, the total reserve for credit losses actually increased $7 million as net charge-offs totaled $13 million versus the provision of $20 million. The effective tax rate in the second quarter was approximately 30.2%. During the third quarter, we would expect our effective tax rate to come in around the 30% to 31% range as well.
So looking ahead, our third quarter results will begin to reflect the full quarter impact of GIS and the two-month impact of the BHF acquisition, and we expect these to be neutral to slightly accretive. Bear in mind that the third quarter earnings have traditionally been impacted by seasonality associated with lower levels of capital market-related revenues, particularly securities lending and foreign exchange. We expect the net interest margin to continue to be in the range of 1.70% to 1.80%. Our lower credit provision should be sustainable, and we will continue to manage expense growth. We will also continue to focus on the drivers of revenue growth, which includes winning new business, converting as quickly as possible and delivering exceptional client service. These are the keys to success and are things we've proven we can do well. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Bob."

That in the first half of the year, we have seen a slow but increasing pipeline of long-term flows coming in. The mix of business has been very beneficial to us. A lot of fixed income and alternatives, especially given the equity markets, but we're seeing equity as well. And it's being supported by pretty good performance across-the-board, especially on our three-year numbers. So overall, I'm pretty optimistic about the pipeline. Funding has also been accelerating for us as well from the wins. So that's been encouraging."

As you look at particularly the third quarter, those have the tendency to soften. What we have seen, which is encouraging on both fronts is because of the new business activity that we've converted over the last year, specifically, we've converted about $1.3 trillion over the last four quarters, that results in more global and cross-border activity. So that account for some of the foreign exchange growth. And then also encouraging on the securities lending side, we continue to see more clients either returning to the program or new clients being added to the program.

I keep thinking of just the very simplistic reality that over the last 10 or 20 years in the United States, just about everyone got out of the custody business because if you're a sub-scale in terms of the size in your book of business and in recognition of what clients were expecting in terms of investment in new software and capabilities, eventually, that's going to happen in Europe as well and no one can predict timing on that. But the hard-core reality is there's a lot of sub-scale players in Europe still, and we'll see if that creates opportunities for us in years to come. And the other advantage we have that's fairly material is that on average, our Asset Management products are very well priced, and their performance is excellent compared to many of our global competitors outside of the U.S. So I think the inevitable outcome is that even in an environment where you have more uncertainty about the global outlook, savings rates are going to continue to be extraordinarily strong and cross-boarder capabilities will be undoubtedly of huge importance."

And then the question would be, which is really important, is could you actually grow the business, because you never want to buy something that even though it's financially attractive on day one, that is low growth. So if we could bring our global capabilities to something, would it make sense over time? And I guess the easy answer to that is -- I just don't know the answer to that yet, but that's something that, obviously, you have to think about. I do worry, frankly, about higher regulatory costs in Europe, bank taxes. We saw the U.K. do this. Recently, there's talk of France and Germany doing it; perhaps, Belgium. We're not hearing it from Ireland. But if national entities want to really increase taxes, the makes the economics much more difficult and less attractive to us, and I guess we could talk separately about any tax in the U.S."

It's more of the, I guess, closely guarded realities of people working very, very hard towards, which I'm still continuing to hear and continue to read that there's going to be some kind of global accord on capital and liquidity by November for the Korean G20 announcement. So I think most governments want to get this over with and so that progress has been made. I think it's a given that the minimum capital ratios are going to rise. The quality of capital has to go up. Liquidity has to go up. That's an easy bet. Then the question would be for the median player, will their capital have to increase as well? My guess is probably true. It's not clear to me, though, that for the top quartile players whether or not they will have to add to capital. Because one of the realities I've learned over the past six months in speaking with our colleagues around the world, you do have to remember that in the U.S. here, we've been pretty aggressive in writing down assets and raising capital, much more so than in other countries around the world. So we have to think globally here. There are going to be other nations where they're just not going to be able to reach our level of capital for a long time. So I would think American banks have an advantage over many of our global peers. And I think we're going to have a long implementation period as a result as well, because certain of these economies are going to be very low growth. And it will be hard to grow capital rapidly. So it's going to be very interesting to see where we end up, and I am somewhat optimistic. But of course, this is the next very, very, very important step as we head into the next phase of regulatory reform, which is these global accords."

There are a lot of issues there. But if you look in security servicing fees, we're really looking at a number of businesses including our Issuer Services business, our Clearing business as well as our Asset Servicing business. And there's a fair amount of volatility, as you know, in our Issuer Services specifically around Depositary Receipts. So ultimately, it is a reflection of the total amount of issuance and shares outstanding. But there are corporate actions and other things that tend to be a bit seasonal that can move that. So a little bit of the bump that you saw in the second quarter is reflective of that. It's somewhat offset by the very slow limited amount of activity that we're seeing in corporate trust, which again, is reflective of the amount of trusteeships that we have. And there you're just not seeing any new debt issuance globally. In terms of Asset Servicing, I'd turn it over to Jim to comment on."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Q3 EPS was $0.51 or $625 million and that includes $0.04 of primarily M&I expense. Revenues were up 3% year-over-year, and what is encouraging about that is our two largest sources of fees,",641,"Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Q3 EPS was $0.51 or $625 million and that includes $0.04 of primarily M&I expense. Revenues were up 3% year-over-year, and what is encouraging about that is our two largest sources of fees, mainly Security Servicing and Asset Management, which together contribute over 80% of fee revenue are up nicely. 
Specifically, Securities Servicing fees are up 20% year-over-year. We're benefiting from the GIS and BHF Asset Servicing acquisitions and of course, some new business growth. Underlying this, assets under custody were $24.4 trillion, up 10% year-over-year, a new record for us.
Asset and Wealth Management fees were up 8% year-over-year. AUM was $1.14 trillion, up 18% year-over-year, also a new record. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of positive long-term asset inflows for asset and wealth management. That's $11 billion for the quarter and a total of $53 billion over the past 12 months. 
In terms of offsets, there was weakness in FX and other trading. Q3 is seasonally the weakest quarter for FX. Volatility was lower in derivatives and fixed income trading's still weak. Trading volumes were low and that impacts Pershing, and net interest income was down a few million dollars sequentially, which is essentially due to the impact of lower interest rates.
On the new business fronts, on top of strong inflows in asset management, we had new Asset Servicing wins of $480 billion in assets under custody. That's up 15% from the second quarter. Pershing also had some significant new business wins that will start to be converted during the fourth quarter and into next year. 
We're already realizing revenue synergies related to the acquisitions. About a third of the $480 billion in new assets under custody was directly attributable to the acquisitions. Our newly combined capabilities position us to bid for and win pieces of business that we never would have won previously. 
As a couple of examples in broker-dealer services, we've already won three significant collateral management deals in Germany since the BHF acquisition. Clients told us very clearly, that our expanded infrastructure in Germany was an important factor in the decision towards new business. 
Here in the U.S., our new integrated administration and transfer agency capabilities have already generated some nice wins in the insurance space. Credit quality continues to improve. The provision went from plus $20 million last quarter to minus $22 million this quarter. Criticized assets were down 26% and behind that. Expenses, backing out acquisitions, were only up 2% year-over-year and well controlled. Capital ratios were slightly above where we expected them to be after we closed on the acquisitions. Our Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.2% and our Tier 1 common ratio was 10.7%.
Our business model generates a lot of capital, and that would be approximately $800 million per quarter. As you know, we've been deploying some of that capital to make acquisitions. Both GIS and BHF were accretive to earnings and EPS in the third quarter.
There's also been a lot of comments that are recently about the impact of Basel III, but frankly, we don't still have all the detail related to implementation, so there's still some guesswork involved. However, given the strength of our balance sheet and our ability to generate significant levels of capital, we feel really good about our relative positioning versus Pierce.
So to sum up the story of the quarter is this: good growth in Asset Management, securities servicing is benefiting from our acquisitions, both top line and bottom line; it was a seasonally weak quarter for FX trading in some of the volume-related businesses; and we have a very strong balance sheet and are generating terrific excess capital. 
With that, let me turn it over to Todd who'll go through the numbers, and we'll open it up for regular questions. Todd?"

To get started, I'll take a deeper dive into the numbers. My comments will follow Quarterly Earnings Review beginning on Page 3.On an operating basis, earnings for the quarter were flat to the second quarter and up 2% over",1281,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning. To get started, I'll take a deeper dive into the numbers. My comments will follow Quarterly Earnings Review beginning on Page 3.
On an operating basis, earnings for the quarter were flat to the second quarter and up 2% over the year ago quarter. Intangible amortization was $0.06, and that's actually been trending down, but it was up due to the acquisitions. If you exclude the intangible amortization, operating earnings were up 2% over the second quarter. 
Some highlights on the sequential basis. Fee revenue was up 5% and total revenue was up 4%, reflecting the benefit of the acquisitions on Securities Services fees and the 3% increase in Asset and Wealth Management fees. Net interest revenue was basically flat. The seasonal decline in FX and weakness in other trading was offset by the negative credit provision and a lower effective tax rate. The tax rate gave us a benefit of about $0.02. And finally, noninterest expenses were up 13%, primarily reflecting the impact of the acquisitions. If you exclude the acquisitions, expenses were up about 1%.
Turning to Page 5 of the review. Assets under management was up 18% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially to a record level of $1.14 trillion, reflecting net long term inflows of $11 billion and net short-term inflows of $18 billion as well as increased market values. Long-term inflows benefited from strength and institutional fixed income and global equity products and the fifth consecutive quarter of positive flows in retail funds. I should point out that approximately 75% of long-term net inflows came in September, so the P&L didn't reflect much of the benefit. Assets under custody was up 10% year-over-year and up 12% sequentially to a record level of $24.4 trillion, driven primarily by the acquisitions. 
Turning to Page 6 of the Earnings Review, which shows fee growth. Securities Servicing fees were up 17% quarter-over-quarter and up 20% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the acquisitions and new business. If you exclude securities lending in the acquisitions, Securities Servicing fees were up 1% sequentially. Asset Servicing fees were up 34% sequentially and 39% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of the acquisitions, higher market values, new business and asset inflows to existing clients. These results include the full quarter impact of GIS and two months of BHF Asset Servicing.
During the quarter, we won an incremental $480 billion in new Asset Servicing business. As Bob mentioned, around a third of that business, we won because of the acquisition. We are very pleased with the early crossover results. Securities lending fees were down $8 million sequentially and $5 million compared with the third quarter of 2009. The sequential decrease reflects seasonality, while the year-over-year decline reflects narrow spreads and lower loan balances. However, during the quarter, loan balances did increase. Issuer Services fees were up 3% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher depositary receipt revenue, which was partially offset by Shareowner Services fee revenue that was down due to seasonality.
Before I leave Issuer Services, I want to comment on the role of trustees for asset-backed securitization. What we do as trustee is fairly straightforward. For most deals, we also act as a documentation -- as trustee, what we do is we receive cash and then we pay that cash on to the bondholders. For most deals, we also act as a document custodian where we receive loan files and reports of the servicers and originators if the files are incomplete. We have good agreements that limit our role, so we don't perceive liability related to the recent foreclosure issues. 
Now let's turn it back to the revenues. Clearing fees were up 3% due primarily to the GIS acquisition. Excluding GIS, clearing fees decreased 6% sequentially due to lower transaction volumes as share volume on U.S. exchanges declined over 20% during the quarter. Asset wealth management fees adjusting for performance fees and the income from consolidated asset management funds were up 3% sequentially, reflecting the impact of new business and higher period end market values.
Fees were up 8% year-over-year, reflecting improved market values, the Insight acquisition and the impact of new business. FX and other trading was down 34% sequentially. FX revenue totaled $160 million, down 35% compared to the second quarter. The decline was driven by seasonality and lower volatility.
Other trading revenue was a negative $14 million. The loss was related to hedges on balance sheet items such as loans and currency totaling $14 million and a rate driven decline of the CVA [credit valuation adjustments], which was offset by other gains. We expect other trading return to profitability in the fourth quarter.
We were able to achieve operating earnings of $0.55 even though investment in other income was down $48 million sequentially, driven primarily by lower foreign currency translation revenue. It was down $108 million over last year, reflecting lower lease residual gains and a gain on the sale of VISA shares in the third quarter of 2009.
Turning to Page 7 of the earnings review. NIR was down slightly sequentially reflecting the impact of lower spreads and was flat year-over-year. Net interest margin was 1.67% compared with 1.74% in the prior quarter, reflecting deposit note of liability growth in a lower rate environment. As the balance sheet grows in this low rate market, it will be difficult to hold the margin. But the good news is that the growth will increase income. 
Turning to Page 8, if you strip out intangible amortization, restructuring and M&I expenses, noninterest expense increased 9% sequentially, primarily driven by the acquisitions. Excluding them, expenses were up 1% sequentially, largely due to higher litigation and software operating expense.
On Page 11, you can see that our key capital ratios came in a bit higher than expected after funding the acquisitions. So sequential decrease primarily reflects the acquisitions, which was partially offset by the $677 million issuance of common equity via a forward-sale agreement that settled in mid-September. It also reflects earnings retentions.
The acquisitions, net of the equity raised, reduced Tier 1 and Tier 1 common by approximately 185 basis points and tangible common by approximately 100 basis points. Our Tier 1 common is still strong, 10.7% post the acquisitions.
Looking out to our loan portfolio, you can see that our risk reduction efforts are continuing to benefit our credit costs. The provision for credit losses declined from a charge of $20 million last quarter to a credit of $22 million in the third quarter, reflecting a 26% decline in criticized assets. The effective tax rate in the third quarter was 27.3% due to a discrete benefit of approximately $0.02, largely driven by a change in state and local tax laws. 
In the fourth quarter, we would expect our effective tax rates to come in between 28% and 30%. Other factors to consider when you're looking out to the fourth quarter: In asset and wealth management, we should benefit from those long-term inflows that came in late in the third quarter and then the typical fourth quarter performance fees.
The fourth quarter should also benefit from client convergence and clearing, as well as improve other trading. The net interest margin should be in the range of 1.60% to 1.75% depending on the size of the balance sheet and the credit provision should be relatively low, given the quality of our assets and the limited growth in the portfolio. 
Looking forward, our focus will be on managing expense growth through re-engineering efforts, optimizing our footprint, realizing the synergies associated with the recent acquisitions and continuing to transition new business through the pipeline and on to the revenue line. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Bob."

First of all, there is a new definition as you know, so the numerator is different. And it's basically the same as tangible common with some deductions for various items. We don't expect the deductions to have any impact on us. So you can kind of look at our tangible common that's basically what it's going to be. In the denominator, there are new definitions around risk-weighted assets, and they're primarily driven by the trading book, and that's actually coming in Basel 2.5, but also tougher definitions around the counterparties and so forth. Again, there, we see that as a de minimis impact. The only meaningful impact to us right now that we see is related to securitizations. So if you're going below investment grade securitization, they garner a significant amount of capital in the form of risk-weighted assets. And as you know, we have actually marked ours to market, and they're amortizing off. So we think that, that will basically burn off and not have a significant impact. So we're very well positioned, I think, as well as anybody for what ultimately is going to come forward. We don't know exactly what the rule set is yet, but we think we're in a very good position, especially the fact that we're generating $800 million a quarter on top of that. So I'm pretty confident we will be well ahead before an implementation of the ultimate target.

Those are really wins the way we think about it, we wouldn't have won had we not done this deal. The second category of wins is when we extend current products into new geographies, and we mentioned the three big collateral wins in Germany.

The net interest income in the balance sheet tends to be liability driven. So as our clients grow, there's frictional cash that will stick to our balance sheet. We can direct some of that into money market funds and other things, which we've done. So there's not a huge need for us to actually increase balance sheet to support our business growth. We've always kind of looked at it maybe half or even less of the revenue growth results. Let's say the revenue growth rates was 5%, we would expect no more than say 2% of balance sheet growth associated with that. And by the way, the assets that we're growing into versus where we were historically, are much lower risk-weighted assets as well. So you're not going to move the risk weighted asset by much through growth."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Q3 EPS was $0.51, or $625 million, and that includes $0.04 of primarily M&I expense. Revenues were up 3% year-over-year, and what is encouraging about that is our two largest sources of fees",642,"Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Q3 EPS was $0.51, or $625 million, and that includes $0.04 of primarily M&I expense. Revenues were up 3% year-over-year, and what is encouraging about that is our two largest sources of fees, mainly Security Servicing and Asset Management, which together contribute over 80% of fee revenue, are up nicely. 
Specifically, Securities Servicing fees are up 20% year-over-year. We're benefiting from the GIS and BHF Asset Servicing acquisitions and of course, some new business growth. Underlying this, assets under custody were $24.4 trillion, up 10% year-over-year, a new record for us.
Asset and Wealth Management fees were up 8% year-over-year. AUM was $1.14 trillion, up 18% year-over-year, also a new record. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of positive long-term asset inflows for asset and wealth management. That's $11 billion for the quarter and a total of $53 billion over the past 12 months. 
In terms of offsets, there was weakness in FX and other trading. Q3 is seasonally the weakest quarter for FX. Volatility was lower in derivatives, and fixed income trading's still weak. Trading volumes were low, and that impacts Pershing, and net interest income was down a few million dollars sequentially, which is essentially due to the impact of lower interest rates.
On the new business fronts, on top of strong inflows in asset management, we had new Asset Servicing wins of $480 billion in assets under custody. That's up 15% from the second quarter. Pershing also had some significant new business wins that will start to be converted during the fourth quarter and into next year. 
We're already realizing revenue synergies related to the acquisitions. About a third of the $480 billion in new assets under custody was directly attributable to the acquisitions. Our newly combined capabilities position us to bid for and win pieces of business that we never would have won previously. 
As a couple of examples in broker-dealer services, we've already won three significant collateral management deals in Germany since the BHF acquisition. Clients told us very clearly that our expanded infrastructure in Germany was an important factor in the decision towards new business. 
Here in the U.S., our new integrated administration and transfer agency capabilities have already generated some nice wins in the insurance space. Credit quality continues to improve. The provision went from plus $20 million last quarter to minus $22 million this quarter. Criticized assets were down 26% and behind that. Expenses, backing out acquisitions, were only up 2% year-over-year and well controlled. Capital ratios were slightly above where we expected them to be after we closed on the acquisitions. So our Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.2% and our Tier 1 common ratio was 10.7%.
Our business model generates a lot of capital, and that would be approximately $800 million per quarter. As you know, we've been deploying some of that capital to make acquisitions. Both GIS and BHF were accretive to earnings and EPS in the third quarter.
There's also been a lot of comments that are recently about the impact of Basel III, but frankly, we don't still have all the detail related to implementation, so there's still some guesswork involved. However, given the strength of our balance sheet and our ability to generate significant levels of capital, we feel really good about our relative positioning versus peers.
So to sum up, the story of the quarter is this: Good growth in Asset Management; securities servicing is benefiting from our acquisitions, both top line and bottom line; it was a seasonally weak quarter for FX trading in some of the volume-related businesses; and we have a very strong balance sheet and are generating terrific excess capital. 
With that, let me turn it over to Todd, who'll go through the numbers, and we'll open it up for regular questions. Todd?"

To get started, I'll take a deeper dive into the numbers. My comments will follow Quarterly Earnings Review beginning on Page 3.On an operating basis, earnings for the quarter were flat to the second quarter and up 2% over",1274,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning. To get started, I'll take a deeper dive into the numbers. My comments will follow Quarterly Earnings Review beginning on Page 3.
On an operating basis, earnings for the quarter were flat to the second quarter and up 2% over the year ago quarter. Intangible amortization was $0.06, and that's actually been trending down, but it was up due to the acquisitions. If you exclude intangible amortization, operating earnings were up 2% over the second quarter. 
Some highlights on the sequential basis. Fee revenue was up 5% and total revenue was up 4%, reflecting the benefit of the acquisitions on Securities Servicing fees and a 3% increase in Asset and Wealth Management fees. Net interest revenue was basically flat. The seasonal decline in FX and weakness in other trading was offset by the negative credit provision and a lower effective tax rate. The tax rate gave us a benefit of about $0.02. And finally, noninterest expenses were up 13%, primarily reflecting the impact of the acquisitions. If you exclude the acquisitions, expenses were up about 1%.
Turning to Page 5 of the review. Assets under management was up 18% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially to a record level of $1.14 trillion, reflecting net long-term inflows of $11 billion and net short-term inflows of $18 billion as well as increased market values. Long-term inflows benefited from strength and institutional fixed income and global equity products and the fifth consecutive quarter of positive flows in retail funds. I should point out that approximately 75% of long-term net inflows came in September, so the P&L didn't reflect much of the benefit. Assets under custody was up 10% year-over-year and up 12% sequentially to a record level of $24.4 trillion, driven primarily by the acquisitions. 
Turning to Page 6 of the Earnings Review, which shows fee growth. Securities Servicing fees were up 17% quarter-over-quarter and up 20% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the acquisitions and new business. If you exclude securities lending in the acquisitions, Securities Servicing fees were up 1% sequentially. Asset Servicing fees were up 34% sequentially and 39% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of the acquisitions, higher market values, new business and asset inflows to existing clients. These results include the full quarter impact of GIS and two months of BHF Asset Servicing.
During the quarter, we won an incremental $480 billion in new Asset Servicing business. As Bob mentioned, around a third of that business we won because of the acquisitions. We are very pleased with the early cross-sell results. Securities lending fees were down $8 million sequentially and $5 million compared with the third quarter of 2009. The sequential decrease reflects seasonality, while the year-over-year decline reflects narrow spreads and lower loan balances. However, during the quarter, loan balances did increase. Issuer Services fees were up 3% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher depositary receipt revenue, which was partially offset by Shareowner Services fee revenue that was down due to seasonality.
Before I leave Issuer Services, I want to comment on the role of trustees for asset-backed securitization. What we do as trustee is fairly straightforward. For most deals, we also act as a documentation -- as trustee, what we do is we receive cash, and then we pay that cash on to the bondholders. For most deals, we also act as a document custodian, where we receive loan files and report to the servicers and originators if the files are incomplete. We have good agreements that limit our role, so we don't perceive liability related to the recent foreclosure issues. 
Now let's turn it back to the revenues. Clearing fees were up 3%, due primarily to the GIS acquisition. Excluding GIS, clearing fees decreased 6% sequentially due to lower transaction volumes as share volume on U.S. exchanges declined over 20% during the quarter. Asset wealth management fees adjusting for performance fees and the income from consolidated asset management funds were up 3% sequentially, reflecting the impact of new business and higher period end market values.
Fees were up 8% year-over-year, reflecting improved market values, the Insight acquisition and the impact of new business. FX and other trading was down 34% sequentially. FX revenue totaled $160 million, down 35% compared to the second quarter. The decline was driven by seasonality and lower volatility.
Other trading revenue was a negative $14 million. The loss was related to hedges on balance sheet items, such as loans and currency, totaling $14 million and a rate-driven decline of the CVA [credit valuation adjustments], which was offset by other gains. We expect other trading return to profitability in the fourth quarter.
We were able to achieve operating earnings of $0.55, even though investment in other income was down $48 million sequentially, driven primarily by lower foreign currency translation revenue. It was down $108 million over last year, reflecting lower lease residual gains and a gain on the sale of VISA shares in the third quarter of 2009.
Turning to Page 7 of the earnings review. NIR was down slightly sequentially, reflecting the impact of lower spreads, and was flat year-over-year. Net interest margin was 1.67% compared with 1.74% in the prior quarter, reflecting deposit note of liability growth in a lower-rate environment. As the balance sheet grows in this low-rate market, it will be difficult to hold the margin. But the good news is that the growth will increase income. 
Turning to Page 8, if you strip out intangible amortization, restructuring and M&I expenses, noninterest expense increased 9% sequentially, primarily driven by the acquisitions. Excluding them, expenses were up 1% sequentially, largely due to higher litigation and software expense.
On Page 11, you can see that our key capital ratios came in a bit higher than expected after funding the acquisitions.  The sequential decrease primarily reflects the acquisitions, which is partially offset by the $677-million issuance of common equity via a forward-sale agreement that settled in mid-September. It also reflects earnings retentions.
The acquisitions net of the equity raised reduced Tier 1 and Tier 1 common by approximately 185 basis points and tangible common by approximately 100 basis points. Our Tier 1 common is still strong, 10.7% post the acquisitions.
Looking out to our loan portfolio, you can see that our risk reduction efforts are continuing to benefit our credit costs. The provision for credit losses declined from a charge of $20 million last quarter to a credit of $22 million in the third quarter, reflecting a 26% decline in criticized assets. The effective tax rate in the third quarter was 27.3% due to a discrete benefit of approximately $0.02, largely driven by a change in state and local tax laws. 
In the fourth quarter, we would expect our effective tax rates to come in between 28% and 30%. Other factors to consider when you're looking out to the fourth quarter: In asset and wealth management, we should benefit from those long-term inflows that came in late in the third quarter and then the typical fourth quarter performance fees.
The fourth quarter should also benefit from client convergence and clearing, as well as improve other trading. The net interest margin should be in the range of 1.60% to 1.75%, depending on the size of the balance sheet, and the credit provision should be relatively low, given the quality of our assets and the limited growth in the portfolio. 
Looking forward, our focus will be on managing expense growth through re-engineering efforts, optimizing our footprint, realizing the synergies associated with the recent acquisitions and continuing to transition new business through the pipeline and on to the revenue line. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Bob."

First of all, there is a new definition, as you know, so the numerator is different. And it's basically the same as tangible common with some deductions for various items. We don't expect the deductions to have any impact on us. So you can kind of look at our tangible common.  That's basically what it's going to be. In the denominator, there are new definitions around risk-weighted assets, and they're primarily driven by the trading book, and that's actually coming in Basel 2.5, but also tougher definitions around the counterparties and so forth. Again, there, we see that as a de minimis impact. The only meaningful impact to us right now that we see is related to securitizations. So if you own below-investment-grade securitization, they garner a significant amount of capital in the form of risk-weighted assets. And as you know, we have actually marked ours to market, and they're amortizing off. So we think that, that will basically burn off and not have a significant impact. So we're very well positioned, I think, as well as anybody, for what ultimately is going to come forward. We don't know exactly what the rule set is yet, but we think we're in a very good position, especially the fact that we're generating $800 million a quarter on top of that. So I'm pretty confident we will be well ahead before an implementation of the ultimate target.

I thought I might just characterize that for you, because they're really helping a lot. The first category wins is cross-selling GIS products into legacy BNY Mellon and vice versa. That was terrific. Those are really wins, the way we think about it, we wouldn't have won had we not done this deal. The second category of wins is when we extend current products into new geographies, and we mentioned the three big collateral wins in Germany. And the third category, we had five significant GIS current clients extend and expand their relationships with us.

So we still have a lot of volatility and uncertainty in these markets. So I want to give a little bit more time to take place before we consider doing something like that. We love our business model. We love our balance sheet. We love our cash flow and excess capital generation. And we're still a little early in the regulatory process.

And so I'm not going to show up in front of our investors until we have greater clarity on exactly what our goals should be.
