While these statements address plans or events, which we expect will or may occur in the future, a number of factors, as set forth in our SEC filings and press releases, could cause actual results to differ from our expectations. We refer you to and specifically incorporate the cautionary and risk statements contained in today's press release and in our SEC filings. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today, January 6, 2010.

This morning, we reported earnings per diluted share of $0.49, a 17% increase over the first quarter of fiscal 2009. While the top line was slightly below our original expectations, strong gross margin performance offset the SG&A impact of our investments, resulting in 80 basis points of operating margin improvement during the quarter. As we reported several weeks ago, net sales for the quarter increased 3.9% and comp sales increased 2.4%. As we discussed on our last conference call, sales for the quarter started off strong, with September comps increasing about 5%. While calendar shifts resulted in some noise between months in the quarter, November sales were softer than we expected. This softness was driven largely by lower sales of apparel and other weather-sensitive categories.While the average transaction value flattened this quarter, I would note that customer traffic continued to increase. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased approximately 110 basis points in the quarter. This improvement was driven primarily by reductions in freight expense and inventory shrinkage. In addition, our ongoing efforts to increase inventory productivity and mitigate risk resulted in lower seasonal markdowns during the quarter. At the end of the first quarter, average inventory per store was approximately 7% lower than last year.SG&A expense as a percentage of sales increased approximately 30 basis points during the quarter. The deleverage of SG&A expense in the quarter was primarily a result of the investments we are making to drive revenues, including the continued rollout of our store technology Refresh, our space realignment efforts and expanded store operating hours. Partially offsetting these increases were benefits from targeted cost-improvement initiatives in a number of areas, including insurance and energy management.Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, we have consistently maintained strong liquidity. Cash and cash equivalents as of November 28, 2009, were approximately $366 million as compared with approximately $153 million at the end of the first quarter last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $39 million. We continue to expect that capital expenditures for the year will be between $160 million and $180 million.Finally, I would note that we continued our stock buyback program this quarter, purchasing about $25 million of our common stock. As a reminder, our board authorized an additional $400 million in November. As a result, we currently have approximately $437 million remaining under outstanding buyback authorizations.Now let's turn to our outlook for the rest of the year. For the second quarter, we expect comp store sales to increase 2% to 4%, and we expect earnings per share will be between $0.65 and $0.70, compared with $0.60 in the second quarter of fiscal 2009.As Howard will discuss further in a moment, we are accelerating investments to drive stronger top-line growth and expect to build sales momentum through the second half the year. Reflecting the cadence of these initiatives, we expect comps will increase 3% to 5% in the second half. I would note that these investments may exacerbate the adverse mix impact and constrain our ability to leverage expenses at the lower end of our guidance. Reflecting these expectations, we continue to project that earnings per diluted share for the full year will be between $2.15 and $2.35. Now I'll turn the call over to Howard for some remarks. Howard?"
270820,82359615,45174,"Family Dollar Stores Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Jan-06-2010",2010-01-06,"Earnings Calls","Family Dollar Stores Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. I hope you had an enjoyable holiday season. And speaking of the holidays, as we reported this morning, our December comp sales increased about 4%, with strong performance in the seasonal and toy areas. I especially",1078,"Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. I hope you had an enjoyable holiday season. And speaking of the holidays, as we reported this morning, our December comp sales increased about 4%, with strong performance in the seasonal and toy areas. I especially want to thank our store teams who are instrumental in delivering these record results. Particular recognition goes to those teams heavily impacted by winter storms. Without their dedication and commitment, we would not be reporting record sales this morning. Over the last several years, we have made significant investments to increase our market share, strengthen our merchandising and operational capabilities and build strong employee teams, and these investments are delivering tangible results. During the first quarter, we increased customer traffic, we expanded operating margin, we improved inventory productivity, and importantly, we increased employee retention. I'm especially pleased that despite softer-than-expected top-line growth, we delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth.While general economic conditions appear to be stabilizing, the pressures on low- and middle-income customers continue to be challenging. For customers with limited or no financial safety net, saving money continues to be a key driver of shopping trips, and our strategy of providing value in a convenient shopping experience has resulted in growth in both customers and shopping trips. For the sixth consecutive quarter, customer traffic increased. Although our core low-income customers continued to account for about two-thirds of our total sales, customers making more than $40,000 a year continued to grow as a percentage of our new sales. Over the last several years, we have invested significantly to understand our customers better. As a result, we have gained an appreciation of the many subtle but meaningful differences among them, while also understanding their similarities better. As we strive to satisfy more of our customers' needs, our investments in category-management capabilities have led to more relevant assortments especially in consumable categories. We have seen particular strong customer response, and we have been able to tailor our assortments to reflect customer preferences.While we have made progress in increasing our appeal with a variety of customers, I believe we have an opportunity to accelerate our top-line growth. To that end, we're investing to strengthen our assortment, enhance our customer communication and improve the shopping experience in our stores.As a result of today's economy, our customers have significantly constrained discretionary spending and focus more on basic needs. We have improved our assortments across consumable areas, and as a result, have realized both increased sales and trips, but we are also focused on becoming more relevant to customers in more discretionary areas. Our solid December sales results, especially in toys and holiday, reflect our progress in this area. Looking forth, we also see further opportunity to expand our private label program. Customers are turning increasingly to private label brands to help better meet their need for value. To capitalize on this opportunity and to offset the mixed pressure from stronger sales of lower margin consumables, we are investing to expand our penetration of private label. Over the last year, we have created a dedicated team to work with our buyers to reposition and re-brand many of our store brands.We have defined our strategy, prioritized our focus, and built processes to ensure that our quality expectations are met. This spring, you will see more of the results of these efforts in our stores. In addition to greater acceptance of private today customers are increasingly sensitive to promotions, sales and coupons. Responding to this shift in landscape, we are changing the way we communicate with our customers. While we continue to utilize circulars to communicate the values we offer, we are experimenting with a variety of online tools that enable us to increase our brand awareness. We are enhancing our in-store communications through better shelf, aisle and in cap signage and reinforce our compelling price points. This new signage not only communicate the values we offer, it also improves the shopping experience by helping customers find what they need faster.In addition to better navigational signage, we are making other improvements to the in-store shopping experience. The completion of our point-of-sale refresh, the expansion of operating hours, space realignment efforts and ongoing team retention efforts will result in stores that are more convenient, less cluttered and easier to shop. The completion of our point-of-sale refresh this year will increase the convenience of our check-out process as it supports an expanded selection of payment choices, including food stamps, credit cards and Family Dollar gift cards. We are on track to have all stores on the new platform by the end of our second quarter.Another way we are working to increase the convenience of the shopping experience is through expanded operating hours. During the first quarter, we expanded operating hours in approximately 15% of our stores. Based on the positive response from customers, we intend to accelerate this initiative and expand operating hours in substantially all stores by the end of our second quarter.To support an expanded assortment of key traffic-driving categories and to improve merchandise adjacencies, last year, we initiated efforts to realign space in our stores. Today, approximately 55% of our stores have completed these layout changes, and I'm pleased to report that these stores are outperforming stores that have not yet made these changes. This year, we will continue these efforts, focusing our attention on about 1,000 additional stores. Finally, we continue to increase our employee retention. I'm especially pleased with the improvements we have made to stabilize our store teams, with the benefit of experienced employees as the greatest impact on the customer shopping experience.  Our store manager and assistant manager retention continues to increase, and we are seeing the benefit of this experience in stronger, more consistent store standards, lower inventory shrinkage and more satisfied customers. While economic conditions may be stabilizing, it is unclear when things will improve for our customers, and projecting short-term financial performance within this context remains challenging.Clearly, the values we offer and the investments we have made to improve the shopping experience are appealing to a diverse range of customers. Our initiatives are delivering results, but I believe we have an opportunity to further accelerate top-line growth. I am confident that our efforts to broaden the appeal of our assortment, strengthen our customer communications and improve the in-store shopping experience will result in market share growth and strong financial returns. And now operator, we would be happy to open the call for questions."

So the first part to mention was I believe it will continue to change and evolve and we will continue to learn how to adapt and appropriately utilize marketing to drive market share for our customer out there today. But I do think there's been some structural change out there, not unlike what happened after the Great Depression, where for a generation or two, there was a change in the way people thought about value. And I think that positions us very nicely and what we're trying to do in terms of our marketing focus is utilize some different tools, to help let our customers know what we're doing. Through our POS implementation, we'll have more flexibility in terms of what we decide to do in different types of marketing events, but marketing will continue to evolve. We are still an EDLP retailer, and as I have said over the years, utilizing circulars to notify our customers of great deals, what's going on seasonally, is the way we're going to continue to operate. And it's frankly not too much different than what you see out of Wal-Mart today, where it's more of a hybrid of EDLP that's getting supplemented with the various sales promotions, but no question today, the customer is very focused on saving money, and we like to be in that space, and are just trying to learn more ways to utilize communication methods to let our customers know about some of the things that we're doing."

Private label that Howard discussed is another nice driver that we position to utilize as a gross margin driver. So we continue to gross initiatives to drive margin. Of the flip side, we do also expect the mix dynamic that we've seen as consumables remain strong to present a bit of pressure, and the one change that we do see is in the freight area, moving forward. We've seen a nice tailwind from freight over the last several quarters. That comparison -- freight is very dependent on the input cost of diesel, and the comparison of diesel costs have been very favorable. And that changed a bit beginning in the November, December time period. And so that strong improvement will wing from a freight perspective, as we move forward.

We have made significant progress over the last several years, starting with stabilizing our workforce and creating a more progressive culture at the store level that's helped not only customer service but also managed shrink more effectively. We have introduced a lot of new processes and a lot of new equipment and technology into the store that is enabling us to react much quicker to problems and we're managing inventory much more effectively, so that's giving us a platform to continue to drive shrink. So I think all three of those areas are key factors in shrink and all three of those areas continue to show improvement.

At this point in time, we did perform tests early on. We confirmed that the sales performance of those stores were accretive.

We began this process several quarters ago and we were fairly conservative in approaching it for several reasons. Not the least of which is we've made some major progress with our store teams and we wanted to make sure that we could manage this in a way that would be positive, but not only to our customers but our associates in the stores. So our test indicated that we could do that. We had initially discussed expanding store hours over a much longer period of time. As we indicated this morning, we expect to have substantially all of our stores with expanded hours by the end of the second quarter. So the first point is, I think we have, through our processes, determined the right approach and made it a win-win at the store level. The second part of your question is also very valid. We expect that the incremental hours will be leveraged differently across the chain. Obviously, their productivity will not be competitive with some of our best hours today. But on the other hand our tests have indicated two things. One, we believe that the expansion will be accretive to our bottom line very quickly and two, we have seen an accretion of the productivity of those hours through time. In other words, your customer base becomes more familiar with the change and finds more opportunities to come to you during these incremental hours.

But if I had to isolate on one, I think what we saw was, first of all, traffic has been pretty consistent and even through the first quarter, we saw that. We saw a slight fall-off in transaction value, it was flattish. And I think that can be attributed primarily to the softness in discretionary categories. And our mix of discretionary is pretty high compared to some others in the channel and I think with a warmer November that did hurt and the softer October also contributed to that.

Another important metric is the way we were able to manage inventories during that time period, as inventory levels were down in the mid-teens in our Apparel areas. And to be able to drive those kind of numbers did show a nice improvement in productivity. And so I'm very pleased with the direction we've gone through there, and I think that, that speaks nicely coming out of this holiday season too with the cold December and some good sales in some of those areas, position us nicely from a clearance perspective. There has been a bottoming out, and we have had a huge effort in trying to improve our Apparel business starting with quality, starting with price points, starting with a number of areas that we think we can do a much better job in. And I haven't talked a lot about that because I'd like to see the goods and like to see some of the results for the early spring, summer-selling season. But we continue to focus on driving sales in those areas. As I said earlier, our mix is more leaning towards discretionary than others. We've purposely kept it that way but if done, a very nice job of managing the risks as we've gone through a pretty difficult economic cycle here. So I think there's a number of things that we're working on and I'd rather talk about the results of some of the positive things and talk about what might happen there, but I think it's important to note that we have huge efforts in the Home area and other discretionary categories, including Apparel and trying to get those things jump started despite some of the challenges there and we're looking forward to seeing some of those results."

This morning, we reported earnings per diluted share of $0.49, a 17% increase over the first quarter of fiscal 2009. While the top line was slightly below our original expectations, strong gross margin performance offset the SG&A impact of our investments, resulting in 80 basis points of operating margin improvement during the quarter. As we reported several weeks ago, net sales for the quarter increased 3.9% and comp sales increased 2.4%. As we discussed on our last conference call, sales for the quarter started off strong, with September comps increasing about 5%. While calendar shifts resulted in some noise between months in the quarter, November sales were softer than we expected. This softness was driven largely by lower sales of apparel and other weather-sensitive categories.While the average transaction value flattened this quarter, I would note that customer traffic continued to increase. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased approximately 110 basis points in the quarter. This improvement was driven primarily by reductions in freight expense and inventory shrinkage. In addition, our ongoing efforts to increase inventory productivity and mitigate risk resulted in lower seasonal markdowns during the quarter. At the end of the first quarter, average inventory per store was approximately 7% lower than last year.SG&A expense as a percentage of sales increased approximately 30 basis points during the quarter. The deleverage of SG&A expense in the quarter was primarily a result of the investments we are making to drive revenues, including the continued rollout of our store technology Refresh, our space realignment efforts and expanded store operating hours. Partially offsetting these increases were benefits from targeted cost-improvement initiatives in a number of areas, including insurance and energy management.Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, we have consistently maintained strong liquidity. Cash and cash equivalents as of November 28, 2009, were approximately $366 million as compared with approximately $153 million at the end of the first quarter last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $39 million. We continue to expect that capital expenditures for the year will be between $160 million and $180 million.Finally, I would note that we continued our stock buyback program this quarter, purchasing about $25 million of our common stock. As a reminder, our board authorized an additional $400 million in November. As a result, we currently have approximately $437 million remaining under outstanding buyback authorizations.Now let's turn to our outlook for the rest of the year. For the second quarter, we expect comp store sales to increase 2% to 4%, and we expect earnings per share will be between $0.65 and $0.70, compared with $0.60 in the second quarter of fiscal 2009.As Howard will discuss further in a moment, we are accelerating investments to drive stronger top-line growth and expect to build sales momentum through the second half the year. Reflecting the cadence of these initiatives, we expect comps will increase 3% to 5% in the second half. I would note that these investments may exacerbate the adverse mix impact and constrain our ability to leverage expenses at the lower end of our guidance. Reflecting these expectations, we continue to project that earnings per diluted share for the full year will be between $2.15 and $2.35. Now I'll turn the call over to Howard for some remarks. Howard?"

I hope you had an enjoyable holiday season. And speaking of the holidays, as we reported this morning, our December comp sales increased about 4%, with strong performance in the seasonal and toy areas. I especially",1078,"Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. I hope you had an enjoyable holiday season. And speaking of the holidays, as we reported this morning, our December comp sales increased about 4%, with strong performance in the seasonal and toy areas. I especially want to thank our store teams who are instrumental in delivering these record results. Particular recognition goes to those teams heavily impacted by winter storms. Without their dedication and commitment, we would not be reporting record sales this morning. Over the last several years, we have made significant investments to increase our market share, strengthen our merchandising and operational capabilities and build strong employee teams, and these investments are delivering tangible results. During the first quarter, we increased customer traffic, we expanded operating margin, we improved inventory productivity, and importantly, we increased employee retention. I'm especially pleased that despite softer-than-expected top-line growth, we delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth.While general economic conditions appear to be stabilizing, the pressures on low- and middle-income customers continue to be challenging. For customers with limited or no financial safety net, saving money continues to be a key driver of shopping trips, and our strategy of providing value in a convenient shopping experience has resulted in growth in both customers and shopping trips. For the sixth consecutive quarter, customer traffic increased. Although our core low-income customers continued to account for about two-thirds of our total sales, customers making more than $40,000 a year continued to grow as a percentage of our new sales. Over the last several years, we have invested significantly to understand our customers better. As a result, we have gained an appreciation of the many subtle but meaningful differences among them, while also understanding their similarities better. As we strive to satisfy more of our customers' needs, our investments in category-management capabilities have led to more relevant assortments especially in consumable categories. We have seen particular strong customer response, and we have been able to tailor our assortments to reflect customer preferences.While we have made progress in increasing our appeal with a variety of customers, I believe we have an opportunity to accelerate our top-line growth. To that end, we're investing to strengthen our assortment, enhance our customer communication and improve the shopping experience in our stores.As a result of today's economy, our customers have significantly constrained discretionary spending and focus more on basic needs. We have improved our assortments across consumable areas, and as a result, have realized both increased sales and trips, but we are also focused on becoming more relevant to customers in more discretionary areas. Our solid December sales results, especially in toys and holiday, reflect our progress in this area. Looking forth, we also see further opportunity to expand our private label program. Customers are turning increasingly to private label brands to help better meet their need for value. To capitalize on this opportunity and to offset the mixed pressure from stronger sales of lower margin consumables, we are investing to expand our penetration of private label. Over the last year, we have created a dedicated team to work with our buyers to reposition and re-brand many of our store brands.We have defined our strategy, prioritized our focus, and built processes to ensure that our quality expectations are met. This spring, you will see more of the results of these efforts in our stores. In addition to greater acceptance of private today customers are increasingly sensitive to promotions, sales and coupons. Responding to this shift in landscape, we are changing the way we communicate with our customers. While we continue to utilize circulars to communicate the values we offer, we are experimenting with a variety of online tools that enable us to increase our brand awareness. We are enhancing our in-store communications through better shelf, aisle and in cap signage and reinforce our compelling price points. This new signage not only communicate the values we offer, it also improves the shopping experience by helping customers find what they need faster.In addition to better navigational signage, we are making other improvements to the in-store shopping experience. The completion of our point-of-sale refresh, the expansion of operating hours, space realignment efforts and ongoing team retention efforts will result in stores that are more convenient, less cluttered and easier to shop. The completion of our point-of-sale refresh this year will increase the convenience of our check-out process as it supports an expanded selection of payment choices, including food stamps, credit cards and Family Dollar gift cards. We are on track to have all stores on the new platform by the end of our second quarter.Another way we are working to increase the convenience of the shopping experience is through expanded operating hours. During the first quarter, we expanded operating hours in approximately 15% of our stores. Based on the positive response from customers, we intend to accelerate this initiative and expand operating hours in substantially all stores by the end of our second quarter.To support an expanded assortment of key traffic-driving categories and to improve merchandise adjacencies, last year, we initiated efforts to realign space in our stores. Today, approximately 55% of our stores have completed these layout changes, and I'm pleased to report that these stores are outperforming stores that have not yet made these changes. This year, we will continue these efforts, focusing our attention on about 1,000 additional stores. Finally, we continue to increase our employee retention. I'm especially pleased with the improvements we have made to stabilize our store teams, with the benefit of experienced employees as the greatest impact on the customer shopping experience.  Our store manager and assistant manager retention continues to increase, and we are seeing the benefit of this experience in stronger, more consistent store standards, lower inventory shrinkage and more satisfied customers. While economic conditions may be stabilizing, it is unclear when things will improve for our customers, and projecting short-term financial performance within this context remains challenging.Clearly, the values we offer and the investments we have made to improve the shopping experience are appealing to a diverse range of customers. Our initiatives are delivering results, but I believe we have an opportunity to further accelerate top-line growth. I am confident that our efforts to broaden the appeal of our assortment, strengthen our customer communications and improve the in-store shopping experience will result in market share growth and strong financial returns. And now operator, we would be happy to open the call for questions."

So the first part to mention was I believe it will continue to change and evolve and we will continue to learn how to adapt and appropriately utilize marketing to drive market share for our customer out there today. But I do think there's been some structural change out there, not unlike what happened after the Great Depression, where for a generation or two, there was a change in the way people thought about value. And I think that positions us very nicely. And what we're trying to do in terms of our marketing focus is utilize some different tools to help let our customers know what we're doing. Through our POS implementation, we'll have more flexibility in terms of what we decide to do in different types of marketing events, as marketing will continue to evolve. We are still an EDLP retailer. And as I have said over the years, utilizing circulars to notify our customers of great deals, what's going on seasonally, is the way we're going to continue to operate. And it's frankly not too much different than what you see out of Wal-Mart today, where it's more of a hybrid of EDLP that's getting supplemented with various sales promotions. But no question today that customer is very focused on saving money, and we like to be in that space, and are just trying to learn more ways to utilize communication methods to let our customers know about some of the things that we're doing."

Private label that Howard discussed is another nice driver that we position to utilize as a gross margin driver. So we continue to gross initiatives to drive margin. Of the flip side, we do also expect the mix dynamic that we've seen as consumables remain strong to present a bit of pressure, and the one change that we do see is in the freight area, moving forward. We've seen a nice tailwind from freight over the last several quarters. That comparison -- freight is very dependent on the input cost of diesel, and the comparison of diesel costs have been very favorable. And that changed a bit beginning in the November, December time period. And so that strong improvement will wing from a freight perspective, as we move forward.

We began this process several quarters ago and we were fairly conservative in approaching it for several reasons. Not the least of which is we've made some major progress with our store teams and we wanted to make sure that we could manage this in a way that would be positive, but not only to our customers but our associates in the stores. So our test indicated that we could do that. We had initially discussed expanding store hours over a much longer period of time. As we indicated this morning, we expect to have substantially all of our stores with expanded hours by the end of the second quarter. So the first point is, I think we have, through our processes, determined the right approach and made it a win-win at the store level. The second part of your question is also very valid. We expect that the incremental hours will be leveraged differently across the chain. Obviously, their productivity will not be competitive with some of our best hours today. But on the other hand our tests have indicated two things. One, we believe that the expansion will be accretive to our bottom line very quickly and two, we have seen an accretion of the productivity of those hours through time. In other words, your customer base becomes more familiar with the change and finds more opportunities to come to you during these incremental hours. So we think it will be a gradual process but very quickly accretive."

But I think there's a number of issues that we were facing. What we decided though was we were going to focus on those initiatives that I had talked about to try to get back into that 3% to 5% comp store guidance. But if I had to isolate on one, I think what we saw was, first of all, traffic has been pretty consistent and even through the first quarter, we saw that. We saw a slight fall-off in transaction value, it was flattish. And I think that can be attributed primarily to the softness in discretionary categories. And our mix of discretionary is pretty high compared to some others in the channel and I think with a warmer November that did hurt and the softer October also contributed to that. But once we gotten December, we did see discretionary pick up quite a bit, and I think that did help give us the momentum in the month."

Another important metric is the way we were able to manage inventories during that time period, as inventory levels were down in the mid-teens in our Apparel areas. And to be able to drive those kind of numbers did show a nice improvement in productivity. And so I'm very pleased with the direction we've gone through there, and I think that, that speaks nicely coming out of this holiday season too with the cold December and some good sales in some of those areas, position us nicely from a clearance perspective. There has been a bottoming out, and we have had a huge effort in trying to improve our Apparel business starting with quality, starting with price points, starting with a number of areas that we think we can do a much better job in. And I haven't talked a lot about that because I'd like to see the goods and like to see some of the results for the early spring, summer-selling season. But we continue to focus on driving sales in those areas. As I said earlier, our mix is more leaning towards discretionary than others. We've purposely kept it that way but if done, a very nice job of managing the risks as we've gone through a pretty difficult economic cycle here. So I think there's a number of things that we're working on and I'd rather talk about the results of some of the positive things and talk about what might happen there, but I think it's important to note that we have huge efforts in the Home area and other discretionary categories, including Apparel and trying to get those things jump started despite some of the challenges there and we're looking forward to seeing some of those results."

This morning, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.81, a 35% increase over the second quarter of fiscal 2009. While revenue growth was in line with our original expectations, a more favorable sales mix and improved purchase markups,",1080,"Thanks, Kiley. This morning, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.81, a 35% increase over the second quarter of fiscal 2009. While revenue growth was in line with our original expectations, a more favorable sales mix and improved purchase markups, combined with benefits from targeted cost improvements initiatives, resulted in 195 basis points of operating margin expansion during the quarter.As we reported several weeks ago, net sales for the quarter increased 4.9% and comp sales increased 3.6%. Customer traffic continued to be the primary driver of comp sales, but average ticket also increased.While our Consumable business continued to drive traffic, increasing 5% this year on top of a 15% increase last year, we also saw improved performance in more discretionary categories. Both the Home Products category and the Seasonal and Electronics category increased nicely this year, reflecting a strong focus on compelling price points, better in-store presentations and improved marketing support.After several quarters of declining sales, sales in the Apparel and Accessories category were flat this quarter. Through our space realignment initiative and inventory management efforts, we have reduced inventory levels in this category by more than 15%. Given these significant reductions, we are pleased that sales of Apparel have stabilized. As a percentage of sales, Consumables increased 10 basis points to 60.8% of sales as compared to 60.7% of sales last year. I would note that the second quarter typically has the highest mix of discretionary sales.Less pressure from an adverse sales mix, combined with higher purchase markups resulted in a greater-than-expected expansion of gross margin. As we continue to leverage our pricing capabilities and begin to expand our assortment of private label products, we are seeing an impactful benefit on our cost of goods. Reductions in markdowns, freight expense and inventory shrinkage also contributed to the 175 basis points of gross margin expansion during the quarter.As a reminder, during the second quarter last year, we incurred approximately $8 million in inventory write-offs for products containing low levels of lead and phthalates due to the passage and interpretation of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement act. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased approximately 20 basis points during the quarter reflecting our ongoing efforts to manage inventories, increased employee retention and improved processes. We continue to benefit from favorable trends in our workers' compensation and general liability costs. The net impact during the quarter was about 30 basis points of leverage, which helps to offset the impact of additional store labor related to expanded store operating hours. In addition, our ongoing energy management efforts resulted in lower utility expenses, which offset higher maintenance and repair costs related to the extreme winter weather we've experienced this season.Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We continue to manage inventory levels well, especially in discretionary categories. At the end of the second quarter, average inventory per store was approximately 10% lower than last year. We continue to produce strong cash flows, generating about $317 million in operating cash flow during the first half of fiscal 2010. As we have previously discussed, our first priority for the deployment of capital is to reinvest in the business to drive higher financial returns. Reflecting this focus, we have invested approximately $83 million in capital expenditures this year compared with $62 million last year.For the full year, we now expect that capital expenditures will be between $190 million and $210 million, reflecting additional investments in store fixtures and distribution center enhancements to support our efforts to expand and tailor our merchandise assortments. Year-to-date, we have also funded approximately $37 million in dividend payments. As a reminder, in January, our Board of Directors approved a 15% increase in the quarterly dividend.Finally, I would note that we accelerated our stock buyback program this quarter, purchasing about 3 million shares in the open market during the quarter for a total cost of $91 million. In addition, during the second quarter, we entered into a structured agreement to purchase an additional $50 million of stock. Under this agreement, our agent will purchase shares in the open market and deliver them to us at specified intervals during the contract term. The actual number of shares purchased will be based on the volume weighted average price during the purchase period, less an agreed-upon discount. At the end of the second quarter, we had $296 million remaining under current repurchase authorizations.Now let's turn to our outlook for the third quarter and full year. Since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we have seen a gradual escalation in our comp performance, and we expect this acceleration to continue through the second half. As Howard will discuss further, we continue to invest to drive revenue growth. Specifically, we are expanding our assortment of traffic driving consumables and increasing our marketing efforts.These changes combined with the completion of significant initiatives including our point-of-sale refresh and expanded operating hours should result in the continued acceleration of comp growth through the second half of fiscal 2010. While we expect that the expansion of Consumables will result in greater top line growth, it will most likely also result in greater mix pressure. I would also note that the cost of diesel, which has been favorable for the last several quarters, is now higher year-over-year. As a result of these trends, we expect that the pace of gross margin expansion will slow in the second half. In addition, our investments to drive top line growth to include expanded operating hours and ongoing space realignment efforts will most likely result in additional expense growth and may constrain our ability to leverage SG&A at the lower end of our sales guidance. Overall, we expect continued operating margin expansion through the second half.Regarding the third quarter, we're off to a great start. As we disclosed in our press release this morning, comp sales for the March period increased approximately 11%. For the third quarter, we expect that comp sales will increase 6% to 8%. I would remind you that the holiday shift, which benefits March, will adversely impact April sales results.Based on our current sales, margin and expense expectations, we estimate that earnings per diluted share for the quarter will be between $0.71 and $0.76 compared with $0.62 in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. For the full year, we expect that earnings per share will be between $2.48 and $2.58 compared with $2.07 in fiscal 2009. Now I'll turn the call over to Howard for some remarks. Howard?"

This morning we reported stronger-than-planned results for the second quarter. These results reflect our successful efforts to provide our customers with more value, more convenience and a better shopping experience.In 2006, we began to slow new store growth and shift our investment focus to improve the shop-ability of our stores and strengthen our financial model. Since then, we have invested significantly to improve processes, build merchandise capabilities and stabilize our work force. And these investments are clearly delivering results. Most notably, we have increased our relevancy to the customer. Today, more customers are shopping us more frequently and spending more when they shop. We've expanded our assortment of Consumables, increased our focus on quality and incorporated more customer and market data into our pricing strategies to provide our customers with even greater value.With the completion of our POS refresh, the expansion of our store operating hours and our space realignment efforts, we have increased the convenience of the shopping experience. And we have reduced employee turnover to the lowest levels that I can remember, resulting in more consistent execution for the customer, increased productivity and reduced operating cost.And most important for our investors, we have expanded our operating margin, increased our inventory productivity and improved our financial returns. And I'm pleased that we have delivered our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. While we continue to leverage the foundational investments we have made, we are increasing our focus on driving stronger top line growth. Our strategy of providing value in a convenient shopping experience has resonated well with both low- and middle-income consumers, resulting in an increase in both traffic and average ticket.While we have made progress in broadening our customer base, I believe we have an opportunity to further expand our market share. To that end, we are increasing our investments to broaden the appeal of our assortment, increase our customer communications and further improve the in-store shopping experience.To drive greater market share, we intend to grow our Consumable business while also refocusing on increasing the productivity of our more discretionary categories. To satisfy our customers' needs better, we have made significant investments to improve our selection of consumables. For example, several years ago, we began to increase our assortment of food to capture a greater share of the small fill-in food trips. We added coolers, expanded our assortment of non-perishable food and began implementing new technology to facilitate the acceptance of food stamps. As the economy contracted and customers increased their focus on basic need, we continued to expand our assortment of food and other consumables. As a result of these investments, we have increased customer traffic and our share of wallet.Building on this foundation, we intend to continue to increase our assortment of traffic-driving consumables, expanding both our assortment of national brands and quality private label products. Our goal is to both broaden our customer reach while also increasing the productivity of these important categories.While basic needs are still the primary driver of recurring shopping trips, we recognize that families want to celebrate holidays and other events in ways that are both fun and affordable. For example, during this past holiday season, we saw that a strong focus on value combined with appealing in-store presentations and marketing can drive sales of discretionary categories. I'm particularly pleased that our Seasonal Electronics category increased 7% anniversary-ing last year's 8% growth. In February, we applied this strategy to our Home category. Our merchandising teams assembled a great assortment of quality merchandise for the Home at compelling price points. Our store teams created more engaging presentations and our marketing team produced stronger customer communications. As a result, sales in the Home category increased 6% during the quarter, the strongest performance that we have seen since 2007.As we indicated in our press release this morning, these trends have continued through March. We had strong sell-throughs of Easter-related merchandise and the early warming trend has benefited the sales of apparel. And we continue to manage our inventory levels well, resulting in continued improvements in inventory productivity. While these results are encouraging, I believe that they reflect what we have often seen during this economic recession. Consumers want to celebrate with their families but they want and need to celebrate in ways that don't compromise their budgets. Reflecting this focus on value, consumers continued to be sensitive to marketing, promotions and coupons. In response, we are investing in how we communicate with our customers. To reinforce our value proposition and increase awareness of, and loyalty to the Family Dollar brand, we are working to better integrate all of our customer touch points, including our print advertising, our in-store communications and our digital media tools.  We have increased the frequency of direct communications, and we have improved our in-store communications to reinforce our values and brand offering. While an appealing assortment and compelling prices influence customer satisfaction, we know that the customers' experience in the store will often determine as she becomes a loyal shopper. Consequently, we are making improvements to enhance the shop-ability of our stores including improved layouts, new fixtures that will facilitate stronger merchandise presentations while reducing clutter. In addition, we have upgraded our store level technology to increase our competitiveness and productivity.Four years ago, we began a refresh of our store technology platform, and I'm very pleased to announce that we have now completed the rollout in all stores. This platform, which includes new point-of-sale technology, enables us to accept a variety of payment choices, including food stamps, credit cards and Family Dollar gift cards, again, increasing our competitiveness and convenience. While this technology improves the way we interface with our customers, it also fundamentally changed how we communicate, train and drive execution in our stores. Now that the system is in place in all stores, we can more fully leverage these new capabilities to improve the consistency of our operating standards, strengthen our in-store presentations and better support our efforts to enhance team productivity and effectiveness.In closing, we continue to operate in an uncertain environment. While economic conditions appear to be stabilizing, it is unclear when we will see sustainable improvement. Several years ago, we slowed growth to focus on improving returns, and these investments are clearly delivering results. We have increased our profitability, improved inventory productivity and increased the effectiveness of our work force. As this investment cycle winds down, we are shifting our focus to re-accelerate growth. I am confident that our efforts to broaden the appeal of our assortment, strengthen our marketing programs and improve the in-store shopping experience will result in market share growth and stronger financial returns.And now operator, we would be happy to open the call for questions."

So at this stage, I would say that we’ve really gained good traction but that traction is likely to continue.

And we're very pleased with how we've been able to manage those core expenses. And we've talked in the past about that three percentage leverage point. And we still challenge ourselves and work very hard on the core expenses. Some examples of successes we've had include our efforts around eProcurement. We continue to look for opportunities for savings there. A second area we've seen recent successes around are energy management systems and are pleased with our success in managing demand of energy. So we think of that side of the expense picture and continue to work to manage those core expenses and target that three percentage comp breakeven point. The other side is more cyclical. So it depends on the pace of your investments. So when we think of the other piece of expenses, we think of our initiatives. And right now, what we're ramping up is some clear investments to drive the top line. And we're seeing early signs of success for those. Examples of expenses related to those initiatives would be the extended hours. We felt very good about early results there. And we moved fast and rolled that to the entire chain by the end of February. Additional efforts around space realignment, again, carries some expenses but delivers some top line growth. And then some additional expense around customer communications or marketing and the many forms that could take. So the guidance does suggest that a slightly higher breakeven point in the back half but it certainly is dependent on the pacing of our initiatives. And what we're real excited about is what those investments are driving from a top line growth. So I think we'll see that for the back half of this year."

And I think that also tended to help solidify the base. What we are doing is we have ongoing satisfaction surveys with our team members so that we know that it's not simply the economy. They are finding Family Dollar a more compelling place to work. And as a result, they’re becoming a more effective team. So I think overall, I can't give you a number, but we do feel very good about the fact that we've got a great culture here and a great team here.

This morning, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.81, a 35% increase over the second quarter of fiscal 2009. While revenue growth was in line with our original expectations, a more favorable sales mix and improved purchase markups,",1082,"Thanks, Kiley. This morning, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.81, a 35% increase over the second quarter of fiscal 2009. While revenue growth was in line with our original expectations, a more favorable sales mix and improved purchase markups, combined with benefits from targeted cost improvements initiatives, resulted in 195 basis points of operating margin expansion during the quarter.As we reported several weeks ago, net sales for the quarter increased 4.9% and comp sales increased 3.6%. Customer traffic continued to be the primary driver of comp sales, but average ticket also increased.While our Consumable business continued to drive traffic, increasing 5% this year on top of a 15% increase last year, we also saw improved performance in more discretionary categories. Both the Home Products category and the Seasonal and Electronics category increased nicely this year, reflecting a strong focus on compelling price points, better in-store presentations and improved marketing support.After several quarters of declining sales, sales in the Apparel and Accessories category were flat this quarter. Through our space realignment initiative and inventory management efforts, we have reduced inventory levels in this category by more than 15%. Given these significant reductions, we are pleased that sales of Apparel have stabilized. As a percentage of sales, Consumables increased 10 basis points to 60.8% of sales as compared to 60.7% of sales last year. I would note that the second quarter typically has the highest mix of discretionary sales.Less pressure from an adverse sales mix, combined with higher purchase markups resulted in a greater than expected expansion of gross margin. As we continue to leverage our pricing capabilities and begin to expand our assortment of private label products, we are seeing an impactful benefit on our cost of goods. Reductions in markdowns, freight expense and inventory shrinkage also contributed to the 175 basis points of gross margin expansion during the quarter.As a reminder, during the second quarter last year, we incurred approximately $8 million in inventory write-offs for products containing low levels of lead and phthalates due to the passage and interpretation of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased approximately 20 basis points during the quarter reflecting our ongoing efforts to manage inventories, increase employee retention and improve processes. We continue to benefit from favorable trends in our workers' compensation and general liability costs. The net impact during the quarter was about 30 basis points of leverage, which helps to offset the impact of additional store labor related to expanded store operating hours. In addition, our ongoing energy management efforts resulted in lower utility expenses, which offset higher maintenance and repair costs related to the extreme winter weather we've experienced this season.Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We continue to manage inventory levels well, especially in discretionary categories. At the end of the second quarter, average inventory per store was approximately 10% lower than last year. We continue to produce strong cash flows, generating about $317 million in operating cash flow during the first half of fiscal 2010. As we have previously discussed, our first priority for the deployment of capital is to reinvest in the business to drive higher financial returns. Reflecting this focus, we have invested approximately $83 million in capital expenditures this year compared with $62 million last year.For the full year, we now expect that capital expenditures will be between $190 million and $210 million, reflecting additional investments in store fixtures and distribution center enhancements to support our efforts to expand and tailor our merchandise assortments. Year-to-date, we have also funded approximately $37 million in dividend payments. As a reminder, in January, our Board of Directors approved a 15% increase in the quarterly dividend.Finally, I would note that we accelerated our stock buyback program this quarter, purchasing about 3 million shares in the open market during the quarter for a total cost of $91 million. In addition, during the second quarter, we entered into a structured agreement to purchase an additional $50 million of stock. Under this agreement, our agent will purchase shares in the open market and deliver them to us at specified intervals during the contract term. The actual number of shares purchased will be based on the volume weighted average price during the purchase period, less an agreed-upon discount. At the end of the second quarter, we had $296 million remaining under current repurchase authorizations.Now let's turn to our outlook for the third quarter and full year. Since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we have seen a gradual escalation in our comp performance, and we expect this acceleration to continue through the second half. As Howard will discuss further, we continue to invest to drive revenue growth. Specifically, we are expanding our assortment of traffic driving consumables and increasing our marketing efforts.These changes combined with the completion of significant initiatives including our point-of-sale refresh and expanded operating hours should result in the continued acceleration of comp growth through the second half of fiscal 2010. While we expect that the expansion of Consumables will result in greater top line growth, it will most likely also result in greater mix pressure. I would also note that the cost of diesel, which has been favorable for the last several quarters, is now higher year-over-year. As a result of these trends, we expect that the pace of gross margin expansion will slow in the second half. In addition, our investments to drive top line growth to include expanded operating hours and ongoing space realignment efforts will most likely result in additional expense growth and may constrain our ability to leverage SG&A at the lower end of our sales guidance. Overall, we expect continued operating margin expansion through the second half.Regarding the third quarter, we're off to a great start. As we disclosed in our press release this morning, comp sales for the March period increased approximately 11%. For the third quarter, we expect that comp sales will increase 6% to 8%. I would remind you that the holiday shift, which benefits March, will adversely impact April sales results.Based on our current sales, margin and expense expectations, we estimate that earnings per diluted share for the quarter will be between $0.71 and $0.76 compared with $0.62 in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. For the full year, we expect that earnings per share will be between $2.48 and $2.58 compared with $2.07 in fiscal 2009. Now I'll turn the call over to Howard for some remarks. Howard?"

This morning we reported stronger-than-planned results for the second quarter. These results reflect our successful efforts to provide our customers with more value, more convenience and a better shopping experience.In 2006, we began to slow new store growth and shift our investment focus to improve the shop-ability of our stores and strengthen our financial model. Since then, we have invested significantly to improve processes, build merchandise capabilities and stabilize our work force. And these investments are clearly delivering results. Most notably, we have increased our relevancy to the customer. Today, more customers are shopping us more frequently and spending more when they shop. We've expanded our assortment of Consumables, increased our focus on quality and incorporated more customer and market data into our pricing strategies to provide our customers with even greater value.With the completion of our POS refresh, the expansion of our store operating hours and our space realignment efforts, we have increased the convenience of the shopping experience. And we have reduced employee turnover to the lowest levels that I can remember, resulting in more consistent execution for the customer, increased productivity and reduced operating cost.And most important for our investors, we have expanded our operating margin, increased our inventory productivity and improved our financial returns. And I'm pleased that we have delivered our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. While we continue to leverage the foundational investments we have made, we are increasing our focus on driving stronger top line growth. Our strategy of providing value in a convenient shopping experience has resonated well with both low- and middle-income consumers, resulting in an increase in both traffic and average ticket.While we have made progress in broadening our customer base, I believe we have an opportunity to further expand our market share. To that end, we are increasing our investments to broaden the appeal of our assortment, increase our customer communications and further improve the in-store shopping experience.To drive greater market share, we intend to grow our Consumable business while also refocusing on increasing the productivity of our more discretionary categories. To satisfy our customers' needs better, we have made significant investments to improve our selection of consumables. For example, several years ago, we began to increase our assortment of food to capture a greater share of the small fill-in food trips. We added coolers, expanded our assortment of non-perishable food and began implementing new technology to facilitate the acceptance of food stamps. As the economy contracted and customers increased their focus on basic need, we continued to expand our assortment of food and other consumables. As a result of these investments, we have increased customer traffic and our share of wallet.Building on this foundation, we intend to continue to increase our assortment of traffic-driving consumables, expanding both our assortment of national brands and quality private label products. Our goal is to both broaden our customer reach while also increasing the productivity of these important categories.While basic needs are still the primary driver of recurring shopping trips, we recognize that families want to celebrate holidays and other events in ways that are both fun and affordable. For example, during this past holiday season, we saw that a strong focus on value combined with appealing in-store presentations and marketing can drive sales of discretionary categories. I'm particularly pleased that our Seasonal Electronics category increased 7%, anniversary-ing last year's 8% growth. In February, we applied this strategy to our Home category. Our merchandising teams assembled a great assortment of quality merchandise for the Home at compelling price points. Our store teams created more engaging presentations and our marketing team produced stronger customer communications. As a result, sales in the Home category increased 6% during the quarter, the strongest performance that we have seen since 2007.As we indicated in our press release this morning, these trends have continued through March. We had strong sell-throughs of Easter-related merchandise and the early warming trend has benefited the sales of apparel. And we continue to manage our inventory levels well, resulting in continued improvements in inventory productivity. While these results are encouraging, I believe that they reflect what we have often seen during this economic recession. Consumers want to celebrate with their families but they want and need to celebrate in ways that don't compromise their budgets. Reflecting this focus on value, consumers continue to be sensitive to marketing, promotions and coupons. In response, we are investing in how we communicate with our customers. To reinforce our value proposition and increase awareness of, and loyalty to the Family Dollar brand, we are working to better integrate all of our customer touch points, including our print advertising, our in-store communications and our digital media tools.  We have increased the frequency of direct communications, and we have improved our in-store communications to reinforce our values and brand offering. While an appealing assortment and compelling prices influence customer satisfaction, we know that the customers' experience in the store will often determine if she becomes a loyal shopper. Consequently, we are making improvements to enhance the shop-ability of our stores including improved layouts, new fixtures that will facilitate stronger merchandise presentations while reducing clutter. In addition, we have upgraded our store level technology to increase our competitiveness and productivity.Four years ago, we began a refresh of our store technology platform, and I'm very pleased to announce that we have now completed the rollout in all stores. This platform, which includes new point-of-sale technology, enables us to accept a variety of payment choices, including food stamps, credit cards and Family Dollar gift cards, again, increasing our competitiveness and convenience. While this technology improves the way we interface with our customers, it also fundamentally changed how we communicate, train and drive execution in our stores. Now that the system is in place in all stores, we can more fully leverage these new capabilities to improve the consistency of our operating standards, strengthen our in-store presentations and better support our efforts to enhance team productivity and effectiveness.In closing, we continue to operate in an uncertain environment. While economic conditions appear to be stabilizing, it is unclear when we will see sustainable improvement. Several years ago, we slowed growth to focus on improving returns, and these investments are clearly delivering results. We have increased our profitability, improved inventory productivity and increased the effectiveness of our work force. As this investment cycle winds down, we are shifting our focus to re-accelerate growth. I am confident that our efforts to broaden the appeal of our assortment, strengthen our marketing programs and improve the in-store shopping experience will result in market share growth and stronger financial returns.And now operator, we would be happy to open the call for questions."

While we've seen some improvement in the discretionary area, I think it may be a little premature to become overly optimistic as to the state of the consumer as it relates to this discretionary sales area. We have worked hard in those areas, and we're very well positioned to respond to our customer needs. But we're simply not projecting a further acceleration of discretionary right now.

So at this stage, I would say that we’ve really gained good traction but that traction is likely to continue. Now it does change from season to season so I would be looking at most of the productivity gain over the next quarter or two to be more related to being able to get higher sales comp out of the same level of inventory as opposed to further inventory reductions.

And right now, what we're ramping up is some clear investments to drive the top line. And we're seeing the successes -- early signs of success for those. Examples of expenses related to those initiatives would be the extended hours. We felt very good about early results there. And we moved fast and rolled that to the entire chain by the end of February. Additional efforts around space realignment, again, carries some expenses but delivers some top line growth. And then some additional expense around customer communications or marketing and the many forms that could take. So we do -- the guidance does suggest that -- a slightly higher breakeven point in the back half but it certainly is dependent on the pacing of our initiatives. And what we're real excited about is what those investments are driving from a top line growth. So I think we'll see that for the back half of this year."

270820,99045367,55591,"Family Dollar Stores Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-07-2010",2010-04-07,"Earnings Calls","Family Dollar Stores Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kiley. This morning, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.81, a 35% increase over the second quarter of fiscal 2009. While revenue growth was in line with our original expectations, a more favorable sales mix and improved purchase markups,",1082,"Thanks, Kiley. This morning, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.81, a 35% increase over the second quarter of fiscal 2009. While revenue growth was in line with our original expectations, a more favorable sales mix and improved purchase markups, combined with benefits from targeted cost improvements initiatives, resulted in 195 basis points of operating margin expansion during the quarter.As we reported several weeks ago, net sales for the quarter increased 4.9% and comp sales increased 3.6%. Customer traffic continued to be the primary driver of comp sales, but average ticket also increased.While our Consumable business continued to drive traffic, increasing 5% this year on top of a 15% increase last year, we also saw improved performance in more discretionary categories. Both the Home Products category and the Seasonal and Electronics category increased nicely this year, reflecting a strong focus on compelling price points, better in-store presentations and improved marketing support.After several quarters of declining sales, sales in the Apparel and Accessories category were flat this quarter. Through our space realignment initiative and inventory management efforts, we have reduced inventory levels in this category by more than 15%. Given these significant reductions, we are pleased that sales of Apparel have stabilized. As a percentage of sales, Consumables increased 10 basis points to 60.8% of sales as compared to 60.7% of sales last year. I would note that the second quarter typically has the highest mix of discretionary sales.Less pressure from an adverse sales mix, combined with higher purchase markups resulted in a greater than expected expansion of gross margin. As we continue to leverage our pricing capabilities and begin to expand our assortment of private label products, we are seeing an impactful benefit on our cost of goods. Reductions in markdowns, freight expense and inventory shrinkage also contributed to the 175 basis points of gross margin expansion during the quarter.As a reminder, during the second quarter last year, we incurred approximately $8 million in inventory write-offs for products containing low levels of lead and phthalates due to the passage and interpretation of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased approximately 20 basis points during the quarter reflecting our ongoing efforts to manage inventories, increase employee retention and improve processes. We continue to benefit from favorable trends in our workers' compensation and general liability costs. The net impact during the quarter was about 30 basis points of leverage, which helps to offset the impact of additional store labor related to expanded store operating hours. In addition, our ongoing energy management efforts resulted in lower utility expenses, which offset higher maintenance and repair costs related to the extreme winter weather we've experienced this season.Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We continue to manage inventory levels well, especially in discretionary categories. At the end of the second quarter, average inventory per store was approximately 10% lower than last year. We continue to produce strong cash flows, generating about $317 million in operating cash flow during the first half of fiscal 2010. As we have previously discussed, our first priority for the deployment of capital is to reinvest in the business to drive higher financial returns. Reflecting this focus, we have invested approximately $83 million in capital expenditures this year compared with $62 million last year.For the full year, we now expect that capital expenditures will be between $190 million and $210 million, reflecting additional investments in store fixtures and distribution center enhancements to support our efforts to expand and tailor our merchandise assortments. Year-to-date, we have also funded approximately $37 million in dividend payments. As a reminder, in January, our Board of Directors approved a 15% increase in the quarterly dividend.Finally, I would note that we accelerated our stock buyback program this quarter, purchasing about 3 million shares in the open market during the quarter for a total cost of $91 million. In addition, during the second quarter, we entered into a structured agreement to purchase an additional $50 million of stock. Under this agreement, our agent will purchase shares in the open market and deliver them to us at specified intervals during the contract term. The actual number of shares purchased will be based on the volume weighted average price during the purchase period, less an agreed-upon discount. At the end of the second quarter, we had $296 million remaining under current repurchase authorizations.Now let's turn to our outlook for the third quarter and full year. Since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we have seen a gradual escalation in our comp performance, and we expect this acceleration to continue through the second half. As Howard will discuss further, we continue to invest to drive revenue growth. Specifically, we are expanding our assortment of traffic driving consumables and increasing our marketing efforts.These changes combined with the completion of significant initiatives including our point-of-sale refresh and expanded operating hours should result in the continued acceleration of comp growth through the second half of fiscal 2010. While we expect that the expansion of Consumables will result in greater top line growth, it will most likely also result in greater mix pressure. I would also note that the cost of diesel, which has been favorable for the last several quarters, is now higher year-over-year. As a result of these trends, we expect that the pace of gross margin expansion will slow in the second half. In addition, our investments to drive top line growth to include expanded operating hours and ongoing space realignment efforts will most likely result in additional expense growth and may constrain our ability to leverage SG&A at the lower end of our sales guidance. Overall, we expect continued operating margin expansion through the second half.Regarding the third quarter, we're off to a great start. As we disclosed in our press release this morning, comp sales for the March period increased approximately 11%. For the third quarter, we expect that comp sales will increase 6% to 8%. I would remind you that the holiday shift, which benefits March, will adversely impact April sales results.Based on our current sales, margin and expense expectations, we estimate that earnings per diluted share for the quarter will be between $0.71 and $0.76 compared with $0.62 in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. For the full year, we expect that earnings per share will be between $2.48 and $2.58 compared with $2.07 in fiscal 2009. Now I'll turn the call over to Howard for some remarks. Howard?"

This morning we reported stronger-than-planned results for the second quarter.

This morning we reported stronger-than-planned results for the second quarter. These results reflect our successful efforts to provide our customers with more value, more convenience and a better shopping experience.In 2006, we began to slow new store growth and shift our investment focus to improve the shop-ability of our stores and strengthen our financial model. Since then, we have invested significantly to improve processes, build merchandise capabilities and stabilize our work force. And these investments are clearly delivering results. Most notably, we have increased our relevancy to the customer. Today, more customers are shopping us more frequently and spending more when they shop. We've expanded our assortment of Consumables, increased our focus on quality and incorporated more customer and market data into our pricing strategies to provide our customers with even greater value.With the completion of our POS refresh, the expansion of our store operating hours and our space realignment efforts, we have increased the convenience of the shopping experience. And we have reduced employee turnover to the lowest levels that I can remember, resulting in more consistent execution for the customer, increased productivity and reduced operating cost.And most important for our investors, we have expanded our operating margin, increased our inventory productivity and improved our financial returns. And I'm pleased that we have delivered our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. While we continue to leverage the foundational investments we have made, we are increasing our focus on driving stronger top line growth. Our strategy of providing value in a convenient shopping experience has resonated well with both low- and middle-income consumers, resulting in an increase in both traffic and average ticket.While we have made progress in broadening our customer base, I believe we have an opportunity to further expand our market share. To that end, we are increasing our investments to broaden the appeal of our assortment, increase our customer communications and further improve the in-store shopping experience.To drive greater market share, we intend to grow our Consumable business while also refocusing on increasing the productivity of our more discretionary categories. To satisfy our customers' needs better, we have made significant investments to improve our selection of consumables. For example, several years ago, we began to increase our assortment of food to capture a greater share of the small fill-in food trips. We added coolers, expanded our assortment of non-perishable food and began implementing new technology to facilitate the acceptance of food stamps. As the economy contracted and customers increased their focus on basic need, we continued to expand our assortment of food and other consumables. As a result of these investments, we have increased customer traffic and our share of wallet.Building on this foundation, we intend to continue to increase our assortment of traffic-driving consumables, expanding both our assortment of national brands and quality private label products. Our goal is to both broaden our customer reach while also increasing the productivity of these important categories.While basic needs are still the primary driver of recurring shopping trips, we recognize that families want to celebrate holidays and other events in ways that are both fun and affordable. For example, during this past holiday season, we saw that a strong focus on value combined with appealing in-store presentations and marketing can drive sales of discretionary categories. I'm particularly pleased that our Seasonal Electronics category increased 7%, anniversary-ing last year's 8% growth. In February, we applied this strategy to our Home category. Our merchandising teams assembled a great assortment of quality merchandise for the Home at compelling price points. Our store teams created more engaging presentations and our marketing team produced stronger customer communications. As a result, sales in the Home category increased 6% during the quarter, the strongest performance that we have seen since 2007.As we indicated in our press release this morning, these trends have continued through March. We had strong sell-throughs of Easter-related merchandise and the early warming trend has benefited the sales of apparel. And we continue to manage our inventory levels well, resulting in continued improvements in inventory productivity. While these results are encouraging, I believe that they reflect what we have often seen during this economic recession. Consumers want to celebrate with their families but they want and need to celebrate in ways that don't compromise their budgets. Reflecting this focus on value, consumers continue to be sensitive to marketing, promotions and coupons. In response, we are investing in how we communicate with our customers. To reinforce our value proposition and increase awareness of, and loyalty to the Family Dollar brand, we are working to better integrate all of our customer touch points, including our print advertising, our in-store communications and our digital media tools.  We have increased the frequency of direct communications, and we have improved our in-store communications to reinforce our values and brand offering. While an appealing assortment and compelling prices influence customer satisfaction, we know that the customers' experience in the store will often determine if she becomes a loyal shopper. Consequently, we are making improvements to enhance the shop-ability of our stores including improved layouts, new fixtures that will facilitate stronger merchandise presentations while reducing clutter. In addition, we have upgraded our store level technology to increase our competitiveness and productivity.Four years ago, we began a refresh of our store technology platform, and I'm very pleased to announce that we have now completed the rollout in all stores. This platform, which includes new point-of-sale technology, enables us to accept a variety of payment choices, including food stamps, credit cards and Family Dollar gift cards, again, increasing our competitiveness and convenience. While this technology improves the way we interface with our customers, it also fundamentally changed how we communicate, train and drive execution in our stores. Now that the system is in place in all stores, we can more fully leverage these new capabilities to improve the consistency of our operating standards, strengthen our in-store presentations and better support our efforts to enhance team productivity and effectiveness.In closing, we continue to operate in an uncertain environment. While economic conditions appear to be stabilizing, it is unclear when we will see sustainable improvement. Several years ago, we slowed growth to focus on improving returns, and these investments are clearly delivering results. We have increased our profitability, improved inventory productivity and increased the effectiveness of our work force. As this investment cycle winds down, we are shifting our focus to re-accelerate growth. I am confident that our efforts to broaden the appeal of our assortment, strengthen our marketing programs and improve the in-store shopping experience will result in market share growth and stronger financial returns.And now operator, we would be happy to open the call for questions."

And we're seeing excellent acceleration of our consumable sales. So in providing guidance, I think we've reflected the sales that we had the greatest visibility to. While we've seen some improvement in the discretionary area, I think it may be a little premature to become overly optimistic as to the state of the consumer as it relates to this discretionary sales area. We have worked hard in those areas, and we're very well positioned to respond to our customer needs. But we're simply not projecting a further acceleration of discretionary right now. That results in an adverse mix shift in the third quarter as consumable sales acceleration exceeds what's currently expected in the discretionary area."

Now it does change from season to season so I would be looking at most of the productivity gain over the next quarter or two to be more related to being able to get higher sales comp out of the same level of inventory as opposed to further inventory reductions. But there's still quite a bit of productivity enhancing that I believe that you'll see over the next two to three years."

One of the things that we’re really seeing and even also in the early innings on is as part of Project Accelerate, our assortment planning tool. We're still very early in the utilization of that tool as our buyers are being trained and starting to roll that out. But what that is going to enable us to do is really tailor assortments to specific stores. So it doesn't necessarily mean more inventory has to be purchased. It means just getting that merchandise to the stores that we think we have the best chance to selling that. So something that's a very complex rollout for us but is going well. And we hope to see more benefits from that initiative as well."

The second area that we also believe we have substantial opportunity on is in a remodel, relocation opportunities. We are so excited about what some of our new stores are doing in terms of the layout and what that really shows the way we want our Family Dollar brand to be presented to our consumers, that we will be rolling out a program that we're not ready to talk about at this point but of going back and remodeling a number of stores. And then finally, relocations and new stores, another important part of revenue growth. Now as we’ve talked about many times, we’ve slowed things down. We're seeing much better returns in our new stores. The market conditions are prime for us to really start to see an acceleration in that. And in fact, we are seeing increased submittals here.

And we're very pleased with how we've been able to manage those core expenses. And we've talked in the past about that three percentage leverage point. And we still challenge ourselves and work very hard on the core expenses. Some examples of successes we've had include our efforts around eProcurement. We continue to look for opportunities for savings there. A second area we've seen recent successes around are energy management systems and are pleased with our success in managing demand of energy. So we think of that side of the expense picture and continue to work to manage those core expenses and target that three percentage comp breakeven point. The other side is more cyclical. So it depends on the pace of your investments. So when we think of the other piece of expenses, we think of our initiatives. And right now, what we're ramping up is some clear investments to drive the top line. And we're seeing the successes -- early signs of success for those. Examples of expenses related to those initiatives would be the extended hours. We felt very good about early results there. And we moved fast and rolled that to the entire chain by the end of February. Additional efforts around space realignment, again, carries some expenses but delivers some top line growth. And then some additional expense around customer communications or marketing and the many forms that could take. So we do -- the guidance does suggest that -- a slightly higher breakeven point in the back half but it certainly is dependent on the pacing of our initiatives. And what we're real excited about is what those investments are driving from a top line growth. So I think we'll see that for the back half of this year."

This morning, we reported diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $0.77, a 24% increase over the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Strong revenue growth, combined with continued productivity improvements resulted in 100 basis points",1184,"Thanks, Kiley. This morning, we reported diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $0.77, a 24% increase over the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Strong revenue growth, combined with continued productivity improvements resulted in 100 basis points of operating margin expansion during the quarter.
As Howard will discuss further in a moment, we are making investments to drive revenue growth. Specifically, we are expanding our assortment of traffic-driving consumables and increasing our marketing efforts. These changes, combined with the completion of significant initiatives, including our point-of-sale refresh and expanded operating hours, resulted in an increase in net sales of 8.4% and an increase in comp sales of 7% for the quarter.
Customer traffic continued to be the primary driver of comp sales. As expected, sales of Consumables accelerated nicely during the quarter. I would note that sales of discretionary categories were more volatile throughout the quarter, but increased overall.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points in the quarter. This improvement was a result of lower markdowns and lower inventory shrink. As a reminder, we have benefited from lower diesel costs for the last several quarters. Today, diesel is measurably higher than last year, but I'm pleased to report that our supply chain teams were able to mitigate the impact of significantly higher diesel costs through continued productivity and efficiency improvements.
While we continue to see benefits from our global sourcing and private label investments, we have reinvested many of these cost savings to enhance the quality and appeal of our assortment.
SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased 60 basis points during the quarter, reflecting the effect of the 7% comp increase in the quarter and our continued focus on driving productivity improvements, most expenses including occupancy costs, were leveraged in the quarter. I would note that we continue to benefit from favorable trends in our workers' compensation and general liability costs. The net impact during the third quarter was about 30 basis points of leverage.
We also continue to see returns from our energy management efforts which resulted in lower utility expenses during the quarter. Partially offsetting these improvements was the impact of our investments in revenue-driving initiatives, including expanded operating hours, our space realignment efforts and increased advertising.
Our effective tax rate was a bit higher this quarter at 37.6% compared with 35.8% in the third quarter last year. The higher tax rate as a percentage of pretax income was primarily a result of changes in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions, changes in state income taxes and fewer federal jobs tax credits.
Now let's take a look at the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, merchandise inventories were 5% lower than inventories at the end of the third quarter last year. On a per store basis, average inventory decreased approximately 6% as compared with last year. We continue to manage inventories well. In addition, we have seen better sell-throughs in discretionary categories.
Reflecting our continued expansion in key traffic-driving categories, inventory levels of Consumables were slightly higher at the end of the third quarter this year as compared with last year.
We continue to maintain a strong liquidity position. Through the first three quarters of fiscal 2010, we generated $374 million in operating cash flows, more than adequate to fund $136 million in capital expenditures and $58 million in dividend payments.  At the end of the third quarter, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $344 million, as compared with approximately $296 million last year.
As we have discussed previously, our first priority for the deployment of capital is to reinvest in the business to drive higher financial returns. As such, we continue to expect that capital expenditures for the year will be between $190 million and $210 million, reflecting the addition of 200 new stores, investments in additional store fixtures and distribution center enhancements to support our efforts to tailor merchandise assortments.
Finally, I would note that we purchased about 1.4 million shares in the open market during the quarter for a total cost of about $56 million. In addition, we also received about 1.1 million shares in the quarter related to the structured agreement we initiated during the second quarter. So far this year, we have purchased approximately 6.6 million shares for a total of $222 million.
In addition, during the third quarter, we entered into a new structured agreement to purchase another $50 million of stock. At the end of the third quarter, we had $190 million remaining under current repurchase authorizations.
As we look to the fourth quarter, I would remind you that the environment remains challenging for consumers, and projecting short-term financial performance within this context remains difficult.
Starting with sales, we expect that an expanded assortment of Consumables, increased advertising and expanded operating hours will continue to drive sales. However, I would note that discretionary trends continue to be somewhat volatile, and we continue to see customers buying closer to need.
As a result of these trends, we expect that comp store sales will increase between 5% and 7% in the fourth quarter. For those of you who focused on a two-year stacked comp trend, I would remind you to consider the impact of the 2008 federal stimulus. I think a three-year look largely resolves the comparability issues.
The June period just ended and we estimate that comps for the period increased approximately 5.5%. We continue to see strong sales in Consumable categories. However, discretionary categories continue to be more volatile, reflecting holiday shifts and continued economic pressures.
We expect that operating margin will continue to expand in the quarter, driven primarily by SG&A leverage. We expect modest gross margin expansion in the quarter. We intend to continue to enhance the quality and appeal of our offering and expect that freight expense will continue to be challenged by higher year-over-year fuel costs. We estimate that these pressures will be modestly offset by improvements in inventory shrinkage.
Reflecting the effect of our comp expectations for the quarter and our continued focus on driving productivity improvements, we expect to leverage SG&A expense in the quarter. Although we will continue to incur additional store labor expense related to expanded operating hours, I would remind you that we will also anniversary investments we made last year in the quarter to realign space in about 3,000 stores.
Finally, I would note that we expect that our tax rate in the fourth quarter will be between 36% and 37% as compared to 32.6% in the fourth quarter last year. As a reminder, we saw an increase in federal jobs tax credits in the fourth quarter last year.
As a result of these expectations, we have fine-tuned our expectations by about $0.01 and now project that earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter will be between $0.46 and $0.51, as compared with $0.43 in fiscal 2009. And that earnings per diluted share for the full year will be between $2.53 and $2.58, as compared with $2.07 in fiscal 2009.
Now I'll turn the call over to Howard for some remarks. Howard?"
270820,106899256,66856,"Family Dollar Stores Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-07-2010",2010-07-07,"Earnings Calls","Family Dollar Stores Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. I hope all had a safe and holiday weekend. Over the last several years, we have invested aggressively to build new capabilities throughout our organization, with particular focus on merchandising supply chain and store",1376,"Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. I hope all had a safe and holiday weekend. Over the last several years, we have invested aggressively to build new capabilities throughout our organization, with particular focus on merchandising supply chain and store operations processes. As a result of these investments, today, we are building more compelling assortments, managing inventories more effectively and executing at the store level more consistently. We have seen the tangible results of these structural investments to include nine consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings per share growth, an expansion of operating margin by more than 200 basis points since 2008 and a significant improvement in inventory productivity during this period. Certainly, our team is proud of these accomplishments, but we also recognize that we have opportunities to leverage these new capabilities further.
More recently, we have focused greater attention on driving top line performance, and I am pleased with the early results. As expected, revenues in the third quarter accelerated nicely from the first half. Net sales of Consumables increased 9%, up from a 5% increase in the second quarter, on top of a 13% increase in the third quarter last year. Some of our initiatives to include the expansion of our operating hours, our space realignment efforts and our increased customer communications have delivered immediate benefits. But we recognize that to deliver sustainable results, we must continuously improve the customer shopping experience. That is why we are working to broaden the appeal of our assortment, strengthen our customer relationships and further improve the in-store shopping experience.
This year, we have undertaken significant efforts to expand the appeal of our Consumable and Discretionary categories. As a result, we have realized both increased sales and trips.
To accommodate the growth of key traffic-driving Consumable categories and to make stores easier to shop, we have realigned space in about 2/3 of our stores, expanding space in high-growth areas while reducing space in underperforming categories. Leveraging these changes, we continue to expand our selection in key Consumable categories.
Increasing the appeal of our assortment isn't just about having the right items. It is also about providing the right value for the customer. We continue to maintain a strong price perception with our customers and we are committed to protecting our price image. But maintaining a strong price image isn't about having the lowest price on every item. It is about providing good values and being competitive on the right items. That is, the items that have the greatest impact on overall price perception.
Over the last three years, we have invested significantly to enhance our pricing capabilities. Today, we have greater visibility to market changes and better tools to analyze the specific business impact. As a result, we can be more agile and deliberate in our pricing decisions. While I expect that the sourcing and competitive environment will continue to change, I am confident that our improved capabilities position us well to maintain our strong price image.
But value isn't just about price. It is also about quality. And while we have maintained a strong price image, we have an opportunity to strengthen our quality perception. We're addressing this opportunity in two specific ways. We're adding more national brands, and we are raising the quality of our private label.
For example, food continues to be a significant driver of shopping trips, especially mid-week grocery trips. Reflecting this opportunity, this spring, we added more than 100 new items in the food category, focusing primarily on grocery items. And to strengthen our quality perception, especially with new customers, most of these new items are nationally recognized brands. We've also added some great new private label food products under a new Family Dollar brand, Family Gourmet. Leveraging new quality control processes, we've enhanced the quality and the packaging while maintaining competitive price points. I encourage you to try these new items. The feedback we're getting from our customers and our team members has been very encouraging, and I'm confident that you'll be impressed.
Clearly, basic needs are still the primary driver of recurring shopping trips, but we also understand that families want to celebrate and treat themselves in ways that are both fun and affordable. Private label, supported by our global sourcing capabilities, enables us to provide quality products at compelling price points. For example, this spring, we enhanced and relaunched several brands including Tropic Sun, Outdoor by Design and our Kidgets apparel line for infants and toddlers. We've improved the product design, increased the quality of these items while maintaining competitive price points. To emphasize the values we offer, both in nationally recognized brands and in our private label offering, we have increased the frequency of our advertising. Five years ago, we communicated directly with our customers only a few times a year, generally around key holiday periods. Today, we communicate with our customers at least once a month, through either print or digital communications. These investments continue to be strongly supported by our vendor partners. 
We are also building new capabilities in both print and digital media. For example, we supported the launch of our Kidgets brand with more compelling in-store signage, increased direct marketing and a multimedia PR campaign targeting both social and traditional media. As part of our efforts to create greater brand awareness, we even launched an online contest: Cute as a Kidget, that generated great exposure to the brand.
Value is clearly important to our customers, but good customer service and a clean, well-organized store can differentiate us and drive increased customer loyalty. Reflecting this opportunity, we're re-emphasizing the importance of customer service in our stores and raising our expectations for store standards.
Leveraging our store technology platform, we are introducing new online training modules to help our store teams improve. And we're investing in new tools and processes that will help us manage our store teams better and improve our execution for customers.
To make our stores easier to shop, we've worked to eliminate excess inventories in stores and reduce clutters, and we're making layout changes that make it easier for our customers to quickly find what they need. We're also introducing new fixtures to accommodate expansions in key Consumable areas and to present seasonal merchandise better. And to provide the customer with more shopping convenience, we've expanded our operating hours and our payment types.
I began my remarks this morning with the discussion on the investments we have made to build new capabilities throughout our organization. We are already seeing a payback from these investments in operating margin expansion, stronger inventory productivity and higher returns on invested capital. While I'm proud of the progress we have made, I am even more excited about the future opportunity. As many customers continue to face financial pressures, I believe that we have a unique opportunity to increase our market share as more customers find our strategy of value and convenience appealing.
To position further market share growth, we are making significant investments to deliver a better customer experience and to strengthen the Family Dollar brand. We are expanding our selection of key traffic-driving Consumables and adding more national brands. We are leveraging stronger quality control processes and investing to raise the quality of our private label. We are protecting our strong price image and increasing our promotional efforts. While these investments have slowed the expansion of gross margin, they provide a platform for further top line growth and position us well to expand their market share and deliver even stronger financial results.
Clearly, the operating environments continues to be challenging. The competitive landscape is heating up as retailers look for new ways to drive traffic and ticket. The global environment continues to evolve as governments respond to continued economic uncertainty and customer sentiment continues to shift.
In recent quarters, we have seen increased interest in discretionary categories. And while we are encouraged by these trends, it is unclear when we will see consistent growth.
Notwithstanding these economic uncertainties, I believe that our persistent focus on value and convenience, along with capability-building investments we have made, enhance our ability to adapt to an ever-changing environment and enable us to continue to deliver strong financial returns. 
And now operator, we'd be happy to open the call up for questions."

We saw some benefit from a markdown perspective that aided the gross margin expansion as we continue to manage inventories [ph]. The freight line is the one that has changed in tone. As we've talked about before, we're now seeing diesel costs measurably higher than they were year-over-year. So that moved from a tailwind to more flattish or a headwind. And I think what we were discussing was, we continue to see benefits from our efforts around both our global sourcing efforts and private label and general procurement efforts. And what we've done is reinvest that into the value proposition in the form of additional quality, protecting the price image and a bit additional promotions. So those are the key drivers, the ups and downs for the third quarter. The fourth quarter, we do expect to grow, for gross margin to improve at a slower pace.

As Howard mentioned, we had a 9% growth of Consumables this quarter, which was on top of a 13% growth in the third quarter last year. So we are encountering some fairly significant growth in the Consumable areas and we want to be able to sustain that. That was a primary objective of the space realignment and that has been largely realized. There are other stores, Chuck, that we are also dealing with the space issue in somewhat different ways. For example, we have looked at a number of urban markets and have significantly improved both space and inventory productivity by better aligning space and inventories to the demand patterns of the store. So I think the big bump, if you will, in expenses is behind us and it will be more of a continual process as we focus on both driving inventory and space productivity, along with creating a better shopping environment for the customer."

But I have to give credit to the merchandising and supply chain teams for continuing to work on improving our assortments and really continuing to fine tune the role, but the Apparel category is playing the Dollar Store space. I think that we have some work to do yet, but I think we had some good sell-throughs and productivity increases. We're very strong. As we work through the fourth quarter, it's primarily a clearance quarter. Based on the early sell-throughs, we don't have as much clearance to sell. I think while that may impact sales, I think it speaks nicely to profitability. And as I talked about investing some of those savings into the promotional side, it's really what we've done thus far. We're excited that we're ending the spring and summer selling season very clean.

We had a very good Christmas season and volatility around the season. We had a very strong Easter, with volatility then around Easter. The third quarter doesn't have quite the impact, Memorial Day, 4th of July are a bit smaller for us, but there's volatility around those too. Looking into the fourth quarter, we still see a net positive view in the discretionary area. But there seems to us to be a bit more uncertainty you deal with the discretionary items where we are seeing this volatility, than in the Consumable areas where we're seeing very strong high single-digit consistent growth. So I suspect that what we're seeing is something that, to us, represents a bit more uncertainty as opposed to a distinct trend. In fact, as volatility implies, it's the absence of a trend that we're looking at. And with that, we've taken a very conservative view of the fourth quarter. Also as Howard mentioned, the fourth quarter is predominantly a clearance quarter. So the good news is we have higher sell-throughs. The other side of that equation is we have lower inventories, upon which to drive clearance sales. So net-net, we are still seeing some positive results from a lot of the initiatives we've had to improve our Seasonal areas, our Home area and our Apparel area. But the buying patterns are, I believe, reflective of a lot of the uncertainties of the economy. You mentioned or referenced the fact that our customers do have a significant percent on various types of social umbrella programs. And yes, we're concerned as some of those umbrellas may be less effective or may not be extended, for example, the unemployment area. But what we've seen throughout this period is that, as times have toughened, we've actually gained in terms of pocketbook of our core customer. So we think that, that will be -- net-net, we'll be able to manage through it. Value and convenience is a key now and will be a key going down the road."

You're seeing double-digit growth in that arena. We're investing a lot of the improvement we're seeing back to the value proposition right now. But longer term, private label still offers an excellent opportunity for our gross margin expansion force."

I don't know if you've had a chance to drop in to some of our Brooklyn and Bronx stores. We've gone through renovations of many of those stores.

So the urban stores offer us a lot of opportunities to leverage the inherent traffic that is potentially there. And we are seeing that, as we drive efficiencies through our supply chain, as we tailor assortments to those customers, that the economics can strengthen at a fairly quick rate. We've talked in the past about stabilizing our workforce and our ability to improve training through the technology in our stores. Those things are actually having more dramatic positive impact within the more difficult urban environments than in the lower volume stores. So overall, we have accelerated the returns in the urban markets significantly. It's always a challenging market, so we see opportunities to continue to improve. But we're very enthusiastic about the return levels that we are seeing in most of our urban markets. On the other hand, the core markets are also benefiting from a lot of the investments. I think, particularly, as we have better met the needs of our customers within the food area, we have gained the ability to accept food stamps and make our stores a more convenient place to shop through expanded hours, that all of those things have resulted in some nice sales performance in that core group of stores. And they've benefited from many of our cost savings initiatives too. So I think each provides a different opportunity. Each are on an upward trend right now."

270820,106899256,66859,"Family Dollar Stores Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-07-2010",2010-07-07,"Earnings Calls","Family Dollar Stores Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kiley. This morning we reported diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $0.77, a 24% increase over the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Strong revenue growth combined with continued productivity improvements resulted in 100 basis points o",1179,"Thanks, Kiley. This morning we reported diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $0.77, a 24% increase over the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Strong revenue growth combined with continued productivity improvements resulted in 100 basis points of operating margin expansion during the quarter.
As Howard will discuss further in a moment, we are making investments to drive revenue growth, specifically, we are expanding our assortment of traffic-driving consumables and increasing our marketing efforts. These changes, combined with the completion of significant initiatives, including our point-of-sale refresh and expanded operating hours resulted in an increase in net sales of 8.4% and an increase in comp sales of 7% for the quarter.
Customer traffic continued to be the primary driver of comp sales. As expected, sales of consumables accelerated nicely during the quarter. I would note that sales of discretionary categories were more volatile throughout the quarter, but increased overall.
Gross profit, as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points in the quarter. This improvement was a result of lower markdowns and lower inventory shrink. As a reminder, we have benefited from diesel costs for the last several quarters. Today, diesel is measurably higher than last year, but I am pleased to report that our supply chain teams were able to mitigate the impact of significantly higher diesel cost through continued productivity and efficiency improvements. While we continue to see benefits from our global sourcing and private-label investments, we have reinvested many of these cost savings to enhance the quality and appeal of our assortment.
SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased 60 basis points during the quarter. Reflecting the effect of the 7% comp increase in the quarter and our continued focus on driving productivity improvements, most expenses, including occupancy costs were leveraged in the quarter. I would note that we continue to benefit from favorable trends in our workers’ compensation and general liability costs. The net impact during the third quarter was about 30 basis points of leverage.
We also continue to see returns from our energy management efforts, which resulted in lower utility expenses during the quarter. Partially offsetting these improvements was the impact of our investments in revenue-driving initiatives, including expanded operating hours, our space realignment efforts, and increased advertising.
Our effective tax rate was a bit higher this quarter at 37.6% compared with 35.8% in the third quarter last year. The higher tax rate as a percentage of pre-tax income was primarily a result of changes in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions, changes in state income taxes, and fewer federal jobs tax credits.
Now, let’s take a look at the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, merchandise inventories were 5% lower than inventories at the end of the third quarter last year. on a per-store basis, average inventory decreased approximately 6% as compared with last year. We continue to manage inventories well. In addition, we have seen sell-throughs in discretionary categories. Reflecting our continued expansion in key traffic-driving categories, inventory levels of consumables were slightly higher at the end of the third quarter this year as compared with last year.
We continue to maintain a strong liquidity position. Through the first three quarters of fiscal 2010 we generated $374 million in operating cash flows, more than adequate to fund $136 million in capital expenditure and $58 million in dividend payments. At the end of the third quarter, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $344 million as compared with approximately $296 million last year.
As we discussed previously, our first priority for the deployment of capital is to reinvest in the business to drive higher financial returns. As such, we continue to expect that capital expenditures for the year will be between $190 million and $210 million, reflecting the addition of 200 new stores, investments in additional store fixtures, and distribution center enhancements to support our efforts to tailor merchandise assortments.
Finally, I would note that we purchased about 1.4 million shares in the open market during the quarter for a total cost of about $56 million. In addition, we also received about 1.1 million shares in the quarter related to the structured agreement we initiated during the second quarter. So far this year we have purchased approximately 6.6 million for a total of $222 million. In addition, during the third quarter, we entered into a new structured agreement to purchase another $50 million of stock. At the end of the third quarter, we had $190 million remaining under current repurchase authorization.
As we look to the fourth quarter, I would remind you that the environment remains challenging for consumers. And projecting short term financial performance within this context remains difficult.
Starting with sales, we expect that an expanded assortment of consumables, increased advertising, and expanded operating hours will continue to drive sales. However, I would note that discretionary trends continue to be somewhat volatile and we continue to see customers buying closer to need. As a result of these trends, we expect that comp-store sales will increase between 5% and 7% in the fourth quarter.
For those of you who focus on a two-year stack comp trend, I would remind you to consider the impact of the 2008 federal stimulus. I think a three-year look largely resolves the comparability issues.
The June period just ended and we estimate that comps for the period increased approximately 5.5%. We continue to see strong sales in consumable categories. However, discretionary categories continue to be more volatile, reflecting holiday shifts and continued economic pressures.
We expect that operating margin will continue to expand in the quarter driven particularly by SG&A leverage. We expect modest gross margin expansion in the quarter. we intend to continue to enhance the quality and appeal of our offering and expect that trade expense will continue to be challenged by higher year-over-year fuel costs. We estimate that these pressures will be modestly offset by improvements in inventory shrinkage.
Reflecting the effect of our comp expectations for the quarter and our continued focus on driving improvements, we expect to leverage SG&A expense in the quarter. Although we will continue to incur additional store labor expense related to expanded operating hours, I would remind you that we will also anniversary investments we made last year in the quarter to realign space in about 3000 stores.
Finally, I would note that we expect that our tax rate in the fourth quarter will be between 36% and 37% as compared to 32.6% in the fourth quarter last year. As a reminder, we saw an increase in federal jobs tax credit in the fourth quarter last year.
As a result of these expectations, we have fine-tuned our expectations by about $0.01 and now project that earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter will be between $0.46 and $0.51 as compared with $0.43 in fiscal 2009 and that earnings per diluted share for the full year will be between $2.53 and $2.58 as compared with $2.07 in fiscal 2009.
Now, I will turn the call over to Howard for some remarks. Howard?

Good morning, everyone. I hope all had a safe and holiday weekend. Over the last several years we have invested aggressively to build new capabilities throughout our organization with particular focus on merchandising, supply chain, and store operations processes. As a result of these investments today we are building more compelling assortments, managing inventories more effectively, and executing at the store level more consistently.
We have seen the tangible results of the structural investments to include nine consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings per share growth, an expansion of operating margin by more than 200 basis points since 2008, and a significant improvement in inventory productivity during this period. Certainly, our team is proud of these accomplishments, but we also recognize that we have opportunities to leverage these new capabilities further.
More recently, we have focused greater attention on driving top line performance and I am pleased with the early results. As expected, revenues in the third quarter accelerated nicely from the first half. Net sales of consumable increased 9%, a 5% increase in the second quarter on top of a 13% increase in the third quarter last year. Some of our initiatives to include the expansion of our operating hours, our space realignment efforts and our increased customer communications have delivered immediate benefits. But we recognize that to deliver sustainable results we must continuously improve the customer shopping experience. That is why we are working to broaden the appeal of our assortment, strengthen our customer relationships, and further improve the in-store shopping experience.
This year, we have undertaken significant efforts to expand the appeal of our consumable and discretionary categories. As a result, we realized both increased sales and trips. To accommodate the growth of key traffic-driving consumable categories and to make stores easier to shop, we have realigned space in about two-thirds of our stores, expanding space in high-growth areas while reducing space in under-performing categories. Leveraging these changes, we continue to expand our selection in key consumable categories.
Increasing the appeal of our assortment isn’t just about having the right items. It is also about providing the right value for the customer. We continue to maintain a strong price perception with our customers and we are committed to protecting our price image. But maintaining a strong price image isn’t about having the lowest price on every item. It is about providing good value and being competitive on the right items, that is the items that have the greatest impact on overall price perception.
Over the last three years, we have invested significantly to enhance our pricing capabilities. Today, we have greater visibility to market changes and better tools to analyze the specific business impact. As a result, we can be more agile and deliberate in our pricing decisions. While I expect that the sourcing and competitive environment will continue to change, I am confident that our improved capabilities position us well to maintain our strong price image.
But value isn’t just about price. It is also about quality and while we have maintained a strong price image, we have an opportunity to strengthen our quality perception. We are addressing this opportunity in two specific ways. We are adding more national brands and we are raising the quality of our private-label. For example, food continues to be a significant driver of shopping trips, especially mid-week grocery trips. Reflecting this opportunity, this spring we added more than 100 new items in the food category, focusing particularly on grocery items. And to strengthen our quality perception especially with new customers most of these new items are nationally recognized brands.
We’ve also added some great new private-label food products under a new Family Dollar brand, Family Gourmet. Leveraging new quality control processes, we’ve enhanced the quality and the packaging while maintaining competitive price points. I encourage you to try these new items. The feedback we are getting from our customers and our team members has been very encouraging and I am confident that you’ll be impressed.
Clearly, basic needs are still the primary driver of recurring shopping trips, but we also understand that families want to celebrate and treat themselves in ways that are both fun and affordable. Private label supported by our global sourcing capability enables us to provide quality products at compelling price points. For example, this spring, we enhanced and relaunched several brands, including Tropic Sun, Outdoor by Design, and our Kidgets apparel line for infants and toddlers. We’ve improved the product design, increased the quality of these items while maintaining competitive price points.
To emphasize the values we offer both in nationally recognized brands and in our private-label offering, we have increased the frequency of our advertisements. Five years ago, we communicated directly with our customers only a few times a year, generally around key holiday periods. Today, we communicate with our customers at least once a month through either print or digital communications. These investments continue to be strongly supported by our vendor partners. We are also building new capabilities in both print and digital media. For example, we supported the launch of our Kidgets brand with more compelling in-store signage, increased direct marketing, and a multimedia PR campaign, targeting both social and traditional media. As part of our efforts to create greater brand awareness we even launched an online contest ‘Cute as a Kidget,’ that generated great exposure to the brand.
Value is clearly important to our customers, but good customer service in a clean, well-organized store can differentiate us and drive increased customer loyalty. Reflecting this opportunity, we are reemphasizing the importance of customer service in our stores and raising our expectations for store standards.
Leveraging our store technology platform, we are introducing new online training modules to help our store teams improve. And we are investing in new tools and processes that will help us manage our store teams better and improve our execution for customers. To make our stores easier to shop, we’ve worked to eliminate excess inventories in stores and reduce clutters and we are making layout changes that make it easier for our customers to quickly find what they need.
We are also introducing new fixtures to accommodate expansions in key consumable areas and to present seasonal merchandise better. And to provide the customer more shopping convenience, we’ve expanded our operating hours and our payment types.
I began my remarks this morning with a discussion on the investments we have made to build new capabilities throughout our organization. We are already seeing the payback from these investments in operating margin expansion, stronger inventory productivity, and higher returns on invested capital. While I am proud of the progress we have made, I am even more excited about the future opportunity. As many customers continue to face financial pressures, I believe that we have a unique opportunity to increase our market share as more customers find our strategy of value and convenience appealing.
To position further market share growth, we are making significant investments to deliver a better customer experience and to strengthen the Family Dollar brand. We are expanding our selection of key traffic-driving consumables and adding more national brands. We are leveraging stronger quality control processes and investing to raise the quality of our private-label. We are protecting our strong price image and increasing our promotional efforts. While these investments have slowed the expansion of gross margin, they provide a platform for further top line growth and position us well to expand our market share and deliver even stronger financial results.
Clearly, the operating environment continues to be challenging. The competitive landscape is heating up as retailers look for new ways to drive traffic and ticket. The global environment continues to evolve as governments respond to continued economic uncertainty and customer sentiment continues to shift.
In recent quarters, we have seen increased interest in discretionary categories. And while we are encouraged by these trends, it is unclear when we will see consistent growth. Notwithstanding these economic uncertainties, I believe that our persistent focus on value and convenience along with capability building investments we have made enhance our ability to adapt to an ever-changing environment and enable us to continue to deliver strong financial returns.
And now, operator, we’d be happy to open the call up for questions.

If we look at the third quarter and the gross margin and think about the buckets, the two quick ones are shrink continues to - continues the trend we’ve seen for several quarters in a couple of years now and providing nice benefit. We saw some benefit from a markdown perspective that aided the gross margin expansion as we continue to manage inventory well. The freight line is the one that has changed in turn as we’ve talked about before where we are now seeing diesel costs measurably higher than they were year-over-year, so that moved from a tailwind to more flattish or a headwind.
And then I think what we were discussing, we continue to see benefits from our efforts around both our global sourcing efforts and private label and general procurement efforts. And what we’ve done is reinvest that into the value proposition in the form of additional quality, protecting the price image and a bit additional promotions. So, those are the key drivers, the ups and downs for the third quarter.
The fourth quarter, we do expect to grow - for gross margin to improve at a slower pace you know it will continue to slowdown from the first and second quarter as we look to the fourth quarter.

And the stores that we changed are those that we could make a change and quickly achieve the objective of providing more space in support of the rapid growth that we were seeing in the core consumables. As Howard mentioned, we had a 9% growth on consumables this quarter, which was on top of a 13% growth in the third quarter last year. So, we are encountering some fairly significant growth in the consumable areas and we want to be able to sustain that. That was the primary objective of the space realignment and that has been largely realized.
There are other stores, Chuck, that we are also dealing with the space issue in somewhat different ways. For example, we have looked at a number of urban markets and have significantly improved both space and inventory productivity by better aligning space and inventories to the demand patterns of the store. So I think the big bump, if you will, in expenses is behind us and it will be more of a continual process as we focus on both driving inventory and space productivity along with creating a better shopping environment for the customer.

We’ve been working very hard to continue to drive our apparel business. I think we did get some benefits as I indicated in the second quarter call from a shift of Easter period as well with some early warmer weather. In fact, earliest I remember in a long time that we got the warm weather. And that helped us but I have to give credit to the merchandising and supply chain teams for continuing to work on improving our assortments and really continuing to fine-tune the role that the apparel categories play in the Dollar Stores space. I think that we have some work to do yet, but I think we had some sell-throughs and productivity increases. We are very strong. As we work through the fourth quarter, it’s primarily a clearance quarter. Based on the early sell-throughs, we don’t have as much clearance to sell. I think while that may impact sales, I think it speaks nicely to profitability.
And as I talked about investing some of those savings into the promotional side is really what we’ve done thus far. We are excited that we are ending the spring and summer selling season very clean. I think what I have seen over the years is when we end a season clean that always speaks well to getting the season off to a good start.

We had a very good Christmas season and volatility around the season. We had a very strong Easter with volatility then around Easter. The third quarter doesn’t have quite the impact, Memorial Day, Fourth of July are a bit smaller for us, but there is volatility around those too. Looking into the fourth quarter, we still see a net positive view in the discretionary area. But there seems to be a bit more uncertainty when you deal with the discretionary items where we are seeing this volatility than in the consumable areas where we are seeing very strong high-single digit consistent growth. So, I suspect that - what we are seeing is something that just to us represents a bit more uncertainty as opposed to a distinct trend. In fact, as volatility implies, it’s the absence of the trend that we are looking at. And with that, we’ve taken a very conservative view of the fourth quarter.
Also, as Howard mentioned, the fourth quarter is predominantly a clearance quarter. So, the good news we have higher sell-throughs. The other side of that equation is we have lower inventories upon which to drive clearance sales. So, net-net, we are still seeing some positive results from a lot of the initiatives we’ve had to improve our seasonal areas, our home area, and our apparel area, but the buying patterns are, I believe, reflective a lot of the uncertainties of the economy.

But what we have seen throughout this period is that as times have toughened, we’ve actually gained in terms of pocket book of our core customer. So, we think that that will be - net-net we will be able to manage through it. Value and convenience is key now and will be key going down the road.

I think that creates a lot of uncertainty not just for retailers, but for a lot of different businesses, and navigating through those kinds of things is something that I think we’ve demonstrated pretty well over the last couple of years, facing some of the toughest economic conditions in many, many years, coupled with growing competitiveness really makes you think hard about all the decisions that you make. So, yes, we are uncertain. That does impact our guidance, and it’s something that I think investors should feel good about in that we have demonstrated a good ability to navigate through choppy waters. So, and - I don’t know if that was two question or one questions, we’ll have to get a ruling from Kiley on that.

So, the results have been that we are seeing double-digit growth within our private-label arena. The other result I would report is that we are gaining momentum. The teams are now at the stage where they are actually fine-tuning a lot of items and introducing items into our stores. I would caution that initially one of the conclusions that we reached through customer surveys as well as our independent quality control checks is that we had an opportunity to improve the value proposition through improving the quality of merchandise and that then gives us a platform in which we can actually grow the private-label brands more aggressively going forward. So, I think we are off to a good start. You are seeing double-digit growth in that arena. We are investing a lot of the improvement we are seeing back to the value proposition right now, but longer term private-label still offers an excellent opportunity for our gross margin expansion for us.

We’ve gone through renovations in many of those stores. And as a result, we are seeing some fairly outstanding productivity changes and sales growth number. So the urban stores offer us a lot of opportunities to leverage the inherent traffic that is potentially there. And we are seeing that as we drive efficiencies through our supply chain, as we tailor assortments to those customers that the economics can strengthen at a fairly quick rate. 
We’ve talked in the past about stabilizing our workforce and our ability to improve training through the technology in our stores. Those things are actually having more dramatic positive impact within the more difficult-to-operate urban environments than in the lower volume stores. So, overall, we have accelerated the returns in the urban market significantly. It’s always a challenging market, so we see opportunities to continue to improve, but we are very enthusiastic about the return levels that we are seeing in most of our urban markets.
On the other hand, the core markets are also benefiting from a lot of the investments, I think particularly as we have better met the needs of our customers within the food area. We have gained the ability to accept food stamps and make our stores a more convenient place to shop through expanded hours that all of those things have resulted in some nice sales performance in that core group of stores and they’ve benefited from many of our cost savings initiatives too. So, I think each provides a different opportunity. Each are on an upward trend right now.

Strong revenue growth, combined with continued productivity improvements, resulted in 100 basis point",1183,"Thanks, Kiley. This morning, we reported diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $0.77, a 24% increase over the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Strong revenue growth, combined with continued productivity improvements, resulted in 100 basis points of operating margin expansion during the quarter.
As Howard will discuss further in a moment, we are making investments to drive revenue growth. Specifically, we are expanding our assortment of traffic-driving Consumables and increasing our marketing efforts. These changes, combined with the completion of significant initiatives, including our point-of-sale refresh and expanded operating hours, resulted in an increase in net sales of 8.4% and an increase in comp sales of 7% for the quarter.
Customer traffic continued to be the primary driver of comp sales. As expected, sales of Consumables accelerated nicely during the quarter. I would note that sales of Discretionary categories were more volatile throughout the quarter but increased overall.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points in the quarter. This improvement was a result of lower markdowns and lower inventory shrink. 
As a reminder, we have benefited from lower diesel costs for the last several quarters. Today, diesel is measurably higher than last year, but I'm pleased to report that our supply chain teams were able to mitigate the impact of significantly higher diesel costs through continued productivity and efficiency improvements. While we continue to see benefits from our global sourcing and private label investments, we have reinvested many of these cost savings to enhance the quality and appeal of our assortment.
SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased 60 basis points during the quarter, reflecting the effect of the 7% comp increase in the quarter and our continued focus on driving productivity improvements. Most expenses, including occupancy costs, were leveraged in the quarter. I would note that we continue to benefit from favorable trends in our workers' compensation and general liability costs. The net impact during the third quarter was about 30 basis points of leverage.
We also continue to see returns from our energy management efforts which resulted in lower utility expenses during the quarter. Partially offsetting these improvements was the impact of our investments in revenue-driving initiatives, including expanded operating hours, our space realignment efforts and increased advertising.
Our effective tax rate was a bit higher this quarter at 37.6% compared with 35.8% in the third quarter last year. The higher tax rate as a percentage of pretax income was primarily a result of changes in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions, changes in state income taxes and fewer federal jobs tax credits.
Now let's take a look at the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, merchandise inventories were 5% lower than inventories at the end of the third quarter last year. On a per-store basis, average inventory decreased approximately 6% as compared with last year. We continue to manage inventories well. In addition, we have seen better sell-throughs in Discretionary categories.
Reflecting our continued expansion in key traffic-driving categories, inventory levels of Consumables were slightly higher at the end of the third quarter this year as compared with last year.
We continue to maintain a strong liquidity position. Through the first three quarters of fiscal 2010, we generated $374 million in operating cash flows, more than adequate to fund $136 million in capital expenditures and $58 million in dividend payments.  At the end of the third quarter, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $344 million as compared with approximately $296 million last year.
As we have discussed previously, our first priority for the deployment of capital is to reinvest in the business to drive higher financial returns. As such, we continue to expect that capital expenditures for the year will be between $190 million and $210 million, reflecting the addition of 200 new stores, investments in additional store fixtures and distribution center enhancements to support our efforts to tailor merchandise assortments.
Finally, I would note that we purchased about 1.4 million shares in the open market during the quarter for a total cost of about $56 million. In addition, we also received about 1.1 million shares in the quarter related to the structured agreement we initiated during the second quarter. So far this year, we have purchased approximately 6.6 million shares for a total of $222 million.
In addition, during the third quarter, we entered into a new structured agreement to purchase another $50 million of stock. At the end of the third quarter, we had $190 million remaining under current repurchase authorizations.
As we look to the fourth quarter, I would remind you that the environment remains challenging for consumers, and projecting short-term financial performance within this context remains difficult.
Starting with sales, we expect that an expanded assortment of Consumables, increased advertising and expanded operating hours will continue to drive sales. However, I would note that discretionary trends continue to be somewhat volatile, and we continue to see customers buying closer to need.
As a result of these trends, we expect that comp store sales will increase between 5% and 7% in the fourth quarter. For those of you who focused on a two-year stacked comp trend, I would remind you to consider the impact of the 2008 federal stimulus. I think a three-year look largely resolves the comparability issues.
The June period just ended and we estimate that comps for the period increased approximately 5.5%. We continue to see strong sales in Consumable categories. However, Discretionary categories continued to be more volatile, reflecting holiday shifts and continued economic pressures.
We expect that operating margin will continue to expand in the quarter, driven primarily by SG&A leverage. We expect modest gross margin expansion in the quarter. We intend to continue to enhance the quality and appeal of our offering and expect that freight expense will continue to be challenged by higher year-over-year fuel costs. We estimate that these pressures will be modestly offset by improvements in inventory shrinkage.
Reflecting the effect of our comp expectations for the quarter and our continued focus on driving productivity improvements, we expect to leverage SG&A expense in the quarter. Although we will continue to incur additional store labor expense related to expanded operating hours, I would remind you that we will also anniversary investments we made last year in the quarter to realign space in about 3,000 stores.
Finally, I would note that we expect that our tax rate in the fourth quarter will be between 36% and 37% as compared to 32.6% in the fourth quarter last year. As a reminder, we saw an increase in federal jobs tax credits in the fourth quarter last year.
As a result of these expectations, we have fine-tuned our expectations by about $0.01 and now project that earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter will be between $0.46 and $0.51 as compared with $0.43 in fiscal 2009; and that earnings per diluted share for the full year will be between $2.53 and $2.58, as compared with $2.07 in fiscal 2009.
Now I'll turn the call over to Howard for some remarks. Howard?"

Good morning, everyone. I hope all had a safe holiday weekend. Over the last several years, we have invested aggressively to build new capabilities throughout our organization, with particular focus on merchandising supply chain and store operations processes. As a result of these investments, today, we are building more compelling assortments, managing inventories more effectively and executing at the store level more consistently. We have seen the tangible results of these structural investments to include nine consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings per share growth, an expansion of operating margin by more than 200 basis points since 2008 and a significant improvement in inventory productivity during this period. Certainly, our team is proud of these accomplishments, but we also recognize that we have opportunities to leverage these new capabilities further.
More recently, we have focused greater attention on driving top line performance and I am pleased with the early results. As expected, revenues in the third quarter accelerated nicely from the first half. 
Net sales of Consumables increased 9%, up from a 5% increase in the second quarter, on top of a 13% increase in the third quarter last year. Some of our initiatives to include the expansion of our operating hours, our space realignment efforts and our increased customer communications have delivered immediate benefits. But we recognize that to deliver sustainable results, we must continuously improve the customer shopping experience. That is why we are working to broaden the appeal of our assortment, strengthen our customer relationships and further improve the in-store shopping experience.
This year, we have undertaken significant efforts to expand the appeal of our Consumable and Discretionary categories. As a result, we have realized both increased sales and trips.
To accommodate the growth of key traffic-driving Consumable categories and to make stores easier to shop, we have realigned space in about 2/3 of our stores, expanding space in high-growth areas while reducing space in underperforming categories. Leveraging these changes, we continue to expand our selection in key Consumable categories.
Increasing the appeal of our assortment isn't just about having the right items. It is also about providing the right value for the customer. We continue to maintain a strong price perception with our customers, and we are committed to protecting our price image. But maintaining a strong price image isn't about having the lowest price on every item. It is about providing good values and being competitive on the right items. That is, the items that have the greatest impact on overall price perception.
Over the last three years, we have invested significantly to enhance our pricing capabilities. Today, we have greater visibility to market changes and better tools to analyze the specific business impact. As a result, we can be more agile and deliberate in our pricing decisions. While I expect that the sourcing and competitive environment will continue to change, I am confident that our improved capabilities position us well to maintain our strong price image.
But value isn't just about price. It is also about quality. And while we have maintained a strong price image, we have an opportunity to strengthen our quality perception. We're addressing this opportunity in two specific ways. We're adding more national brands and we are raising the quality of our private label.
For example, food continues to be a significant driver of shopping trips, especially midweek grocery trips. Reflecting this opportunity, this spring, we added more than 100 new items in the food category, focusing primarily on grocery items. And to strengthen our quality perception, especially with new customers, most of these new items are nationally recognized brands. We've also added some great new private label food products under a new Family Dollar brand, Family Gourmet. 
Leveraging new quality control processes, we've enhanced the quality and the packaging while maintaining competitive price points. I encourage you to try these new items. The feedback we're getting from our customers and our team members has been very encouraging, and I'm confident that you'll be impressed.
Clearly, basic needs are still the primary driver of recurring shopping trips, but we also understand that families want to celebrate and treat themselves in ways that are both fun and affordable. Private label, supported by our global sourcing capabilities, enables us to provide quality products at compelling price points. 
For example, this spring, we enhanced and relaunched several brands including Tropic Sun, Outdoor by Design and our Kidgets apparel line for infants and toddlers. We've improved the product design, increased the quality of these items while maintaining competitive price points. 
To emphasize the values we offer, both in nationally recognized brands and in our private label offering, we have increased the frequency of our advertising. Five years ago, we communicated directly with our customers only a few times a year, generally around key holiday periods. Today, we communicate with our customers at least once a month, through either print or digital communications. These investments continue to be strongly supported by our vendor partners. 
We are also building new capabilities in both print and digital media. For example, we supported the launch of our Kidgets brand with more compelling in-store signage, increased direct marketing and a multimedia PR campaign targeting both social and traditional media. As part of our efforts to create greater brand awareness, we even launched an online contest, Cute as a Kidget, that generated great exposure to the brand.
Value is clearly important to our customers, but good customer service and a clean, well-organized store can differentiate us and drive increased customer loyalty. Reflecting this opportunity, we're re-emphasizing the importance of customer service in our stores and raising our expectations for store standards.
Leveraging our store technology platform, we are introducing new online training modules to help our store teams improve. And we're investing in new tools and processes that will help us manage our store teams better and improve our execution for customers.
To make our stores easier to shop, we've worked to eliminate excess inventories in stores and reduce clutters, and we're making layout changes that make it easier for our customers to quickly find what they need. We're also introducing new fixtures to accommodate expansions in key Consumable areas and to present seasonal merchandise better. And to provide the customer with more shopping convenience, we've expanded our operating hours and our payment types.
I began my remarks this morning with the discussion on the investments we have made to build new capabilities throughout our organization. We are already seeing a payback from these investments in operating margin expansion, stronger inventory productivity and higher returns on invested capital. While I'm proud of the progress we have made, I am even more excited about the future opportunity. As many customers continue to face financial pressures, I believe that we have a unique opportunity to increase our market share as more customers find our strategy of value and convenience appealing.
To position further market share growth, we are making significant investments to deliver a better customer experience and to strengthen the Family Dollar brand. We are expanding our selection of key traffic-driving Consumables and adding more national brands. We are leveraging stronger quality control processes and investing to raise the quality of our private label. We are protecting our strong price image and increasing our promotional efforts. While these investments have slowed the expansion of gross margin, they provide a platform for further top line growth and position us well to expand our market share and deliver even stronger financial results.
Clearly, the operating environments continues to be challenging. The competitive landscape is heating up as retailers look for new ways to drive traffic and ticket. The global environment continues to evolve, as governments respond to continued economic uncertainty and customer sentiment continues to shift.
In recent quarters, we have seen increased interest in discretionary categories. And while we are encouraged by these trends, it is unclear when we will see consistent growth.
Notwithstanding these economic uncertainties, I believe that our persistent focus on value and convenience, along with capability-building investments we have made, enhance our ability to adapt to an ever-changing environment and enable us to continue to deliver strong financial returns. 
And now operator, we'd be happy to open the call up for questions."

We saw some benefit from a markdown perspective that aided the gross margin expansion as we continue to manage inventory as well [ph]. The freight line is the one that has changed in tone, as we've talked about before. We're now seeing diesel costs measurably higher than they were year-over-year. So that moved from a tailwind to more flattish or a headwind. And then I think what we were discussing was, we continue to see benefits from our efforts around both our global sourcing efforts and private label and general procurement efforts. And what we've done is reinvest that into the value proposition in the form of additional quality, protecting the price image and a bit additional promotions. So those are the key drivers, the ups and downs for the third quarter. The fourth quarter, we do expect to grow, for gross margin to improve at a slower pace. We'll continue to slow down from the first and second quarter as we look to the fourth quarter."

So we are encountering some fairly significant growth in the Consumable areas, and we want to be able to sustain that. That was a primary objective of the space realignment and that has been largely realized. There are other stores, Chuck, that we are also dealing with the space issue in somewhat different ways. For example, we have looked at a number of urban markets and have significantly improved both space and inventory productivity by better aligning space and inventories to the demand patterns of the store.

I think that we have some work to do yet, but I think we had some good sell-throughs and productivity increases. We're very strong. As we work through the fourth quarter, it's primarily a clearance quarter. Based on the early sell-throughs, we don't have as much clearance to sell. I think while that may impact sales, I think it speaks nicely to profitability. And as I talked about investing some of those savings into the promotional side, it's really what we've done thus far. We're excited that we're ending the spring and summer selling season very clean.

We had a very good Christmas season and volatility around the season. We had a very strong Easter, with volatility then around Easter. The third quarter doesn't have quite the impact. Memorial Day, 4th of July are a bit smaller for us, but there is around those too. Looking into the fourth quarter, we still see a net positive view in the discretionary area. But there seems to us to be a bit more uncertainty. You deal with the discretionary items where we are seeing this volatility, than in the Consumable areas where we're seeing very strong high single-digit consistent growth. So I suspect that what we're seeing is something that just, to us, represents a bit more uncertainty as opposed to a distinct trend. In fact, as volatility implies, it's the absence of a trend that we are looking at. And with that, we've taken a very conservative view of the fourth quarter. Also as Howard mentioned, the fourth quarter is predominantly a clearance quarter. So the good news is we have higher sell-throughs. The other side of that equation is we have lower inventories, upon which to drive clearance sales. So net-net, we are still seeing some positive results from a lot of the initiatives we've had to improve our Seasonal areas, our Home area and our Apparel area. But the buying patterns are, I believe, reflective of a lot of the uncertainties of the economy. You mentioned or referenced the fact that our customers do have a significant percent on various types of social umbrella programs. And yes, we are concerned as some of those umbrellas may be less effective or may not be extended. For example, the unemployment area. But what we've seen throughout this period is that, as times have toughened, we've actually gained in terms of pocketbook of our core customer. So we think that, that will be -- net-net, we'll be able to manage through it. Value and convenience is a key now and will be a key going down the road."

The teams are now at the stage where they're actually fine-tuning a lot of items and introducing items into our stores. I would caution that initially, one of the conclusions that we reached through customer surveys as well as our independent quality control checks, is that we had an opportunity to improve the value proposition through improving the quality of merchandise. And that then gives us a platform in which we can actually grow the private label brands more aggressively going forward. So I think we're off to a good start.

I don't know if you've had a chance to drop in to some of our Brooklyn and Bronx stores. We've gone through renovations of many of those stores.

We've talked in the past about stabilizing our workforce and our ability to improve training through the technology in our stores. Those things are actually having more dramatic positive impact within the more difficult urban environments than in the lower volume stores. So overall, we have accelerated the returns in the urban markets significantly. It's always a challenging market, so we see opportunities to continue to improve. But we're very enthusiastic about the return levels that we are seeing in most of our urban markets. On the other hand, the core markets are also benefiting from a lot of the investments.

This morning, we reported diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $0.77, a 24% increase over the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Strong revenue growth, combined with continued productivity improvements, resulted in 100 basis point",1183,"Thanks, Kiley. This morning, we reported diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $0.77, a 24% increase over the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Strong revenue growth, combined with continued productivity improvements, resulted in 100 basis points of operating margin expansion during the quarter.
As Howard will discuss further in a moment, we are making investments to drive revenue growth. Specifically, we are expanding our assortment of traffic-driving Consumables and increasing our marketing efforts. These changes, combined with the completion of significant initiatives, including our point-of-sale refresh and expanded operating hours, resulted in an increase in net sales of 8.4% and an increase in comp sales of 7% for the quarter.
Customer traffic continued to be the primary driver of comp sales. As expected, sales of Consumables accelerated nicely during the quarter. I would note that sales of Discretionary categories were more volatile throughout the quarter but increased overall.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points in the quarter. This improvement was a result of lower markdowns and lower inventory shrink. 
As a reminder, we have benefited from lower diesel costs for the last several quarters. Today, diesel is measurably higher than last year, but I'm pleased to report that our supply chain teams were able to mitigate the impact of significantly higher diesel costs through continued productivity and efficiency improvements. While we continue to see benefits from our global sourcing and private label investments, we have reinvested many of these cost savings to enhance the quality and appeal of our assortment.
SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased 60 basis points during the quarter, reflecting the effect of the 7% comp increase in the quarter and our continued focus on driving productivity improvements. Most expenses, including occupancy costs, were leveraged in the quarter. I would note that we continue to benefit from favorable trends in our workers' compensation and general liability costs. The net impact during the third quarter was about 30 basis points of leverage.
We also continue to see returns from our energy management efforts which resulted in lower utility expenses during the quarter. Partially offsetting these improvements was the impact of our investments in revenue-driving initiatives, including expanded operating hours, our space realignment efforts and increased advertising.
Our effective tax rate was a bit higher this quarter at 37.6% compared with 35.8% in the third quarter last year. The higher tax rate as a percentage of pretax income was primarily a result of changes in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions, changes in state income taxes and fewer federal jobs tax credits.
Now let's take a look at the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, merchandise inventories were 5% lower than inventories at the end of the third quarter last year. On a per-store basis, average inventory decreased approximately 6% as compared with last year. We continue to manage inventories well. In addition, we have seen better sell-throughs in Discretionary categories.
Reflecting our continued expansion in key traffic-driving categories, inventory levels of Consumables were slightly higher at the end of the third quarter this year as compared with last year.
We continue to maintain a strong liquidity position. Through the first three quarters of fiscal 2010, we generated $374 million in operating cash flows, more than adequate to fund $136 million in capital expenditures and $58 million in dividend payments.  At the end of the third quarter, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $344 million as compared with approximately $296 million last year.
As we have discussed previously, our first priority for the deployment of capital is to reinvest in the business to drive higher financial returns. As such, we continue to expect that capital expenditures for the year will be between $190 million and $210 million, reflecting the addition of 200 new stores, investments in additional store fixtures and distribution center enhancements to support our efforts to tailor merchandise assortments.
Finally, I would note that we purchased about 1.4 million shares in the open market during the quarter for a total cost of about $56 million. In addition, we also received about 1.1 million shares in the quarter related to the structured agreement we initiated during the second quarter. So far this year, we have purchased approximately 6.6 million shares for a total of $222 million.
In addition, during the third quarter, we entered into a new structured agreement to purchase another $50 million of stock. At the end of the third quarter, we had $190 million remaining under current repurchase authorizations.
As we look to the fourth quarter, I would remind you that the environment remains challenging for consumers, and projecting short-term financial performance within this context remains difficult.
Starting with sales, we expect that an expanded assortment of Consumables, increased advertising and expanded operating hours will continue to drive sales. However, I would note that discretionary trends continue to be somewhat volatile, and we continue to see customers buying closer to need.
As a result of these trends, we expect that comp store sales will increase between 5% and 7% in the fourth quarter. For those of you who focused on a two-year stacked comp trend, I would remind you to consider the impact of the 2008 federal stimulus. I think a three-year look largely resolves the comparability issues.
The June period just ended and we estimate that comps for the period increased approximately 5.5%. We continue to see strong sales in Consumable categories. However, Discretionary categories continued to be more volatile, reflecting holiday shifts and continued economic pressures.
We expect that operating margin will continue to expand in the quarter, driven primarily by SG&A leverage. We expect modest gross margin expansion in the quarter. We intend to continue to enhance the quality and appeal of our offering and expect that freight expense will continue to be challenged by higher year-over-year fuel costs. We estimate that these pressures will be modestly offset by improvements in inventory shrinkage.
Reflecting the effect of our comp expectations for the quarter and our continued focus on driving productivity improvements, we expect to leverage SG&A expense in the quarter. Although we will continue to incur additional store labor expense related to expanded operating hours, I would remind you that we will also anniversary investments we made last year in the quarter to realign space in about 3,000 stores.
Finally, I would note that we expect that our tax rate in the fourth quarter will be between 36% and 37% as compared to 32.6% in the fourth quarter last year. As a reminder, we saw an increase in federal jobs tax credits in the fourth quarter last year.
As a result of these expectations, we have fine-tuned our expectations by about $0.01 and now project that earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter will be between $0.46 and $0.51 as compared with $0.43 in fiscal 2009; and that earnings per diluted share for the full year will be between $2.53 and $2.58, as compared with $2.07 in fiscal 2009.

Good morning, everyone. I hope all had a safe holiday weekend. Over the last several years, we have invested aggressively to build new capabilities throughout our organization, with particular focus on merchandising supply chain and store operations processes. As a result of these investments, today, we are building more compelling assortments, managing inventories more effectively and executing at the store level more consistently. We have seen the tangible results of these structural investments to include nine consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings per share growth, an expansion of operating margin by more than 200 basis points since 2008 and a significant improvement in inventory productivity during this period. Certainly, our team is proud of these accomplishments, but we also recognize that we have opportunities to leverage these new capabilities further.
More recently, we have focused greater attention on driving top line performance and I am pleased with the early results. As expected, revenues in the third quarter accelerated nicely from the first half. 
Net sales of Consumables increased 9%, up from a 5% increase in the second quarter, on top of a 13% increase in the third quarter last year. Some of our initiatives to include the expansion of our operating hours, our space realignment efforts and our increased customer communications have delivered immediate benefits. But we recognize that to deliver sustainable results, we must continuously improve the customer shopping experience. That is why we are working to broaden the appeal of our assortment, strengthen our customer relationships and further improve the in-store shopping experience.
This year, we have undertaken significant efforts to expand the appeal of our Consumable and Discretionary categories. As a result, we have realized both increased sales and trips.
To accommodate the growth of key traffic-driving Consumable categories and to make stores easier to shop, we have realigned space in about 2/3 of our stores, expanding space in high-growth areas while reducing space in underperforming categories. Leveraging these changes, we continue to expand our selection in key Consumable categories.
Increasing the appeal of our assortment isn't just about having the right items. It is also about providing the right value for the customer. We continue to maintain a strong price perception with our customers, and we are committed to protecting our price image. But maintaining a strong price image isn't about having the lowest price on every item. It is about providing good values and being competitive on the right items. That is, the items that have the greatest impact on overall price perception.
Over the last three years, we have invested significantly to enhance our pricing capabilities. Today, we have greater visibility to market changes and better tools to analyze the specific business impact. As a result, we can be more agile and deliberate in our pricing decisions. While I expect that the sourcing and competitive environment will continue to change, I am confident that our improved capabilities position us well to maintain our strong price image.
But value isn't just about price. It is also about quality. And while we have maintained a strong price image, we have an opportunity to strengthen our quality perception. We're addressing this opportunity in two specific ways. We're adding more national brands and we are raising the quality of our private label.
For example, food continues to be a significant driver of shopping trips, especially midweek grocery trips. Reflecting this opportunity, this spring, we added more than 100 new items in the food category, focusing primarily on grocery items. And to strengthen our quality perception, especially with new customers, most of these new items are nationally recognized brands. We've also added some great new private label food products under a new Family Dollar brand, Family Gourmet. 
Leveraging new quality control processes, we've enhanced the quality and the packaging while maintaining competitive price points. I encourage you to try these new items. The feedback we're getting from our customers and our team members has been very encouraging, and I'm confident that you'll be impressed.
Clearly, basic needs are still the primary driver of recurring shopping trips, but we also understand that families want to celebrate and treat themselves in ways that are both fun and affordable. Private label, supported by our global sourcing capabilities, enables us to provide quality products at compelling price points. 
For example, this spring, we enhanced and relaunched several brands including Tropic Sun, Outdoor by Design and our Kidgets apparel line for infants and toddlers. We've improved the product design, increased the quality of these items while maintaining competitive price points. 
To emphasize the values we offer, both in nationally recognized brands and in our private label offering, we have increased the frequency of our advertising. Five years ago, we communicated directly with our customers only a few times a year, generally around key holiday periods. Today, we communicate with our customers at least once a month, through either print or digital communications. These investments continue to be strongly supported by our vendor partners. 
We are also building new capabilities in both print and digital media. For example, we supported the launch of our Kidgets brand with more compelling in-store signage, increased direct marketing and a multimedia PR campaign targeting both social and traditional media. As part of our efforts to create greater brand awareness, we even launched an online contest, Cute as a Kidget, that generated great exposure to the brand.
Value is clearly important to our customers, but good customer service and a clean, well-organized store can differentiate us and drive increased customer loyalty. Reflecting this opportunity, we're re-emphasizing the importance of customer service in our stores and raising our expectations for store standards.
Leveraging our store technology platform, we are introducing new online training modules to help our store teams improve. And we're investing in new tools and processes that will help us manage our store teams better and improve our execution for customers.
To make our stores easier to shop, we've worked to eliminate excess inventories in stores and reduce clutters, and we're making layout changes that make it easier for our customers to quickly find what they need. We're also introducing new fixtures to accommodate expansions in key Consumable areas and to present seasonal merchandise better. And to provide the customer with more shopping convenience, we've expanded our operating hours and our payment types.
I began my remarks this morning with the discussion on the investments we have made to build new capabilities throughout our organization. We are already seeing a payback from these investments in operating margin expansion, stronger inventory productivity and higher returns on invested capital. While I'm proud of the progress we have made, I am even more excited about the future opportunity. As many customers continue to face financial pressures, I believe that we have a unique opportunity to increase our market share as more customers find our strategy of value and convenience appealing.
To position further market share growth, we are making significant investments to deliver a better customer experience and to strengthen the Family Dollar brand. We are expanding our selection of key traffic-driving Consumables and adding more national brands. We are leveraging stronger quality control processes and investing to raise the quality of our private label. We are protecting our strong price image and increasing our promotional efforts. While these investments have slowed the expansion of gross margin, they provide a platform for further top line growth and position us well to expand our market share and deliver even stronger financial results.
Clearly, the operating environments continues to be challenging. The competitive landscape is heating up as retailers look for new ways to drive traffic and ticket. The global environment continues to evolve, as governments respond to continued economic uncertainty and customer sentiment continues to shift.
In recent quarters, we have seen increased interest in discretionary categories. And while we are encouraged by these trends, it is unclear when we will see consistent growth.
Notwithstanding these economic uncertainties, I believe that our persistent focus on value and convenience, along with capability-building investments we have made, enhance our ability to adapt to an ever-changing environment and enable us to continue to deliver strong financial returns. 
And now operator, we'd be happy to open the call up for questions."

We saw some benefit from a markdown perspective that aided the gross margin expansion as we continue to manage inventory as well [ph]. The freight line is the one that has changed in tone, as we've talked about before. We're now seeing diesel costs measurably higher than they were year-over-year. So that moved from a tailwind to more flattish or a headwind. And then I think what we were discussing was, we continue to see benefits from our efforts around both our global sourcing efforts and private label and general procurement efforts. And what we've done is reinvest that into the value proposition in the form of additional quality, protecting the price image and a bit additional promotions. So those are the key drivers, the ups and downs for the third quarter. The fourth quarter, we do expect to grow, for gross margin to improve at a slower pace. We'll continue to slow down from the first and second quarter as we look to the fourth quarter."

So we are encountering some fairly significant growth in the Consumable areas, and we want to be able to sustain that. That was a primary objective of the space realignment and that has been largely realized. There are other stores, Chuck, that we are also dealing with the space issue in somewhat different ways. For example, we have looked at a number of urban markets and have significantly improved both space and inventory productivity by better aligning space and inventories to the demand patterns of the store. So I think the big bump, if you will, in expenses is behind us and it will be more of a continual process as we focus on both driving inventory and space productivity, along with creating a better shopping environment for the customer."

I would also mention the insurance has -- we did see some nice -- when you're looking at the third quarter versus the fourth quarter, we saw -- as we called out 30 basis points of leverage in the third quarter, don't expect that benefit to be at the same level as we move through the fourth quarter.

And a couple of those, again to reiterate, a couple of the bigger dollar ones, there's the full load on the POS rollout.

So could you just talk about that a little bit? And are we in the edge here, maybe finally seeing some improvement in that side of the house?"

I think we did get some benefit, as I indicated in the second quarter call, from a shift of Easter period, as well with some early warmer weather. In fact, our earliest I remember in a long time that we got the warm weather. And that helped us. But I have to give credit to the merchandising and supply chain teams for continuing to work on improving our assortments and really continuing to fine-tune the role that the Apparel category is playing in the Dollar Store space. I think that we have some work to do yet, but I think we had some good sell-throughs and productivity increases. We're very strong. As we work through the fourth quarter, it's primarily a clearance quarter. Based on the early sell-throughs, we don't have as much clearance to sell. I think while that may impact sales, I think it speaks nicely to profitability. And as I talked about investing some of those savings into the promotional side, it's really what we've done thus far. We're excited that we're ending the spring and summer selling season very clean. I think what I had seen over the years is when we end the season clean, it always speaks well to getting the next season off to a good start. So hopefully, that will help us, along with some of the strategic changes that we're making in the Apparel side of our business."

We had a very good Christmas season and volatility around the season. We had a very strong Easter, with volatility then around Easter. The third quarter doesn't have quite the impact. Memorial Day, 4th of July are a bit smaller for us, but there is around those too. Looking into the fourth quarter, we still see a net positive view in the discretionary area. But there seems to us to be a bit more uncertainty. You deal with the discretionary items where we are seeing this volatility, than in the Consumable areas where we're seeing very strong high single-digit consistent growth. So I suspect that what we're seeing is something that just, to us, represents a bit more uncertainty as opposed to a distinct trend. In fact, as volatility implies, it's the absence of a trend that we are looking at. And with that, we've taken a very conservative view of the fourth quarter. Also as Howard mentioned, the fourth quarter is predominantly a clearance quarter. So the good news is we have higher sell-throughs. The other side of that equation is we have lower inventories, upon which to drive clearance sales. So net-net, we are still seeing some positive results from a lot of the initiatives we've had to improve our Seasonal areas, our Home area and our Apparel area. But the buying patterns are, I believe, reflective of a lot of the uncertainties of the economy. You mentioned or referenced the fact that our customers do have a significant percent on various types of social umbrella programs. And yes, we are concerned as some of those umbrellas may be less effective or may not be extended. For example, the unemployment area. But what we've seen throughout this period is that, as times have toughened, we've actually gained in terms of pocketbook of our core customer. So we think that, that will be -- net-net, we'll be able to manage through it. Value and convenience is a key now and will be a key going down the road."

I think that creates a lot of uncertainty, not just for retailers, but for a lot of different businesses. And navigating through those kinds of things is something that, I think, we've demonstrated pretty well over the last couple of years. Facing some of the toughest economic conditions in many, many years, coupled with growing competitiveness, really makes you think hard about all of the decisions that you make.

The teams are now at the stage where they're actually fine-tuning a lot of items and introducing items into our stores. I would caution that initially, one of the conclusions that we reached through customer surveys as well as our independent quality control checks, is that we had an opportunity to improve the value proposition through improving the quality of merchandise. And that then gives us a platform in which we can actually grow the private label brands more aggressively going forward. So I think we're off to a good start.

Strong revenue growth, combined with continued productivity improvements, resulted in 100 basis point",1183,"Thanks, Kiley. This morning, we reported diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $0.77, a 24% increase over the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Strong revenue growth, combined with continued productivity improvements, resulted in 100 basis points of operating margin expansion during the quarter.
As Howard will discuss further in a moment, we are making investments to drive revenue growth. Specifically, we are expanding our assortment of traffic-driving Consumables and increasing our marketing efforts. These changes, combined with the completion of significant initiatives, including our point-of-sale refresh and expanded operating hours, resulted in an increase in net sales of 8.4% and an increase in comp sales of 7% for the quarter.
Customer traffic continued to be the primary driver of comp sales. As expected, sales of Consumables accelerated nicely during the quarter. I would note that sales of Discretionary categories were more volatile throughout the quarter but increased overall.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points in the quarter. This improvement was a result of lower markdowns and lower inventory shrink. 
As a reminder, we have benefited from lower diesel costs for the last several quarters. Today, diesel is measurably higher than last year, but I'm pleased to report that our supply chain teams were able to mitigate the impact of significantly higher diesel costs through continued productivity and efficiency improvements. While we continue to see benefits from our global sourcing and private label investments, we have reinvested many of these cost savings to enhance the quality and appeal of our assortment.
SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased 60 basis points during the quarter, reflecting the effect of the 7% comp increase in the quarter and our continued focus on driving productivity improvements. Most expenses, including occupancy costs, were leveraged in the quarter. I would note that we continue to benefit from favorable trends in our workers' compensation and general liability costs. The net impact during the third quarter was about 30 basis points of leverage.
We also continue to see returns from our energy management efforts which resulted in lower utility expenses during the quarter. Partially offsetting these improvements was the impact of our investments in revenue-driving initiatives, including expanded operating hours, our space realignment efforts and increased advertising.
Our effective tax rate was a bit higher this quarter at 37.6% compared with 35.8% in the third quarter last year. The higher tax rate as a percentage of pretax income was primarily a result of changes in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions, changes in state income taxes and fewer federal jobs tax credits.
Now let's take a look at the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, merchandise inventories were 5% lower than inventories at the end of the third quarter last year. On a per-store basis, average inventory decreased approximately 6% as compared with last year. We continue to manage inventories well. In addition, we have seen better sell-throughs in Discretionary categories.
Reflecting our continued expansion in key traffic-driving categories, inventory levels of Consumables were slightly higher at the end of the third quarter this year as compared with last year.
We continue to maintain a strong liquidity position. Through the first three quarters of fiscal 2010, we generated $374 million in operating cash flows, more than adequate to fund $136 million in capital expenditures and $58 million in dividend payments.  At the end of the third quarter, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $344 million as compared with approximately $296 million last year.
As we have discussed previously, our first priority for the deployment of capital is to reinvest in the business to drive higher financial returns. As such, we continue to expect that capital expenditures for the year will be between $190 million and $210 million, reflecting the addition of 200 new stores, investments in additional store fixtures and distribution center enhancements to support our efforts to tailor merchandise assortments.
Finally, I would note that we purchased about 1.4 million shares in the open market during the quarter for a total cost of about $56 million. In addition, we also received about 1.1 million shares in the quarter related to the structured agreement we initiated during the second quarter. So far this year, we have purchased approximately 6.6 million shares for a total of $222 million.
In addition, during the third quarter, we entered into a new structured agreement to purchase another $50 million of stock. At the end of the third quarter, we had $190 million remaining under current repurchase authorizations.
As we look to the fourth quarter, I would remind you that the environment remains challenging for consumers, and projecting short-term financial performance within this context remains difficult.
Starting with sales, we expect that an expanded assortment of Consumables, increased advertising and expanded operating hours will continue to drive sales. However, I would note that discretionary trends continue to be somewhat volatile, and we continue to see customers buying closer to need.
As a result of these trends, we expect that comp store sales will increase between 5% and 7% in the fourth quarter. For those of you who focused on a two-year stacked comp trend, I would remind you to consider the impact of the 2008 federal stimulus. I think a three-year look largely resolves the comparability issues.
The June period just ended and we estimate that comps for the period increased approximately 5.5%. We continue to see strong sales in Consumable categories. However, Discretionary categories continued to be more volatile, reflecting holiday shifts and continued economic pressures.
We expect that operating margin will continue to expand in the quarter, driven primarily by SG&A leverage. We expect modest gross margin expansion in the quarter. We intend to continue to enhance the quality and appeal of our offering and expect that freight expense will continue to be challenged by higher year-over-year fuel costs. We estimate that these pressures will be modestly offset by improvements in inventory shrinkage.
Reflecting the effect of our comp expectations for the quarter and our continued focus on driving productivity improvements, we expect to leverage SG&A expense in the quarter. Although we will continue to incur additional store labor expense related to expanded operating hours, I would remind you that we will also anniversary investments we made last year in the quarter to realign space in about 3,000 stores.
Finally, I would note that we expect that our tax rate in the fourth quarter will be between 36% and 37% as compared to 32.6% in the fourth quarter last year. As a reminder, we saw an increase in federal jobs tax credits in the fourth quarter last year.
As a result of these expectations, we have fine-tuned our expectations by about $0.01 and now project that earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter will be between $0.46 and $0.51 as compared with $0.43 in fiscal 2009; and that earnings per diluted share for the full year will be between $2.53 and $2.58, as compared with $2.07 in fiscal 2009.
Now I'll turn the call over to Howard for some remarks. Howard?"

Over the last several years, we have invested aggressively to build new capabilities throughout our organization, with particular focus on merchandising supply chain and store ope",1375,"Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. I hope all had a safe holiday weekend. Over the last several years, we have invested aggressively to build new capabilities throughout our organization, with particular focus on merchandising supply chain and store operations processes. As a result of these investments, today, we are building more compelling assortments, managing inventories more effectively and executing at the store level more consistently. We have seen the tangible results of these structural investments to include nine consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings per share growth, an expansion of operating margin by more than 200 basis points since 2008 and a significant improvement in inventory productivity during this period. Certainly, our team is proud of these accomplishments, but we also recognize that we have opportunities to leverage these new capabilities further.
More recently, we have focused greater attention on driving top line performance and I am pleased with the early results. As expected, revenues in the third quarter accelerated nicely from the first half. 
Net sales of Consumables increased 9%, up from a 5% increase in the second quarter, on top of a 13% increase in the third quarter last year. Some of our initiatives to include the expansion of our operating hours, our space realignment efforts and our increased customer communications have delivered immediate benefits. But we recognize that to deliver sustainable results, we must continuously improve the customer shopping experience. That is why we are working to broaden the appeal of our assortment, strengthen our customer relationships and further improve the in-store shopping experience.
This year, we have undertaken significant efforts to expand the appeal of our Consumable and Discretionary categories. As a result, we have realized both increased sales and trips.
To accommodate the growth of key traffic-driving Consumable categories and to make stores easier to shop, we have realigned space in about 2/3 of our stores, expanding space in high-growth areas while reducing space in underperforming categories. Leveraging these changes, we continue to expand our selection in key Consumable categories.
Increasing the appeal of our assortment isn't just about having the right items. It is also about providing the right value for the customer. We continue to maintain a strong price perception with our customers, and we are committed to protecting our price image. But maintaining a strong price image isn't about having the lowest price on every item. It is about providing good values and being competitive on the right items. That is, the items that have the greatest impact on overall price perception.
Over the last three years, we have invested significantly to enhance our pricing capabilities. Today, we have greater visibility to market changes and better tools to analyze the specific business impact. As a result, we can be more agile and deliberate in our pricing decisions. While I expect that the sourcing and competitive environment will continue to change, I am confident that our improved capabilities position us well to maintain our strong price image.
But value isn't just about price. It is also about quality. And while we have maintained a strong price image, we have an opportunity to strengthen our quality perception. We're addressing this opportunity in two specific ways. We're adding more national brands and we are raising the quality of our private label.
For example, food continues to be a significant driver of shopping trips, especially midweek grocery trips. Reflecting this opportunity, this spring, we added more than 100 new items in the food category, focusing primarily on grocery items. And to strengthen our quality perception, especially with new customers, most of these new items are nationally recognized brands. We've also added some great new private label food products under a new Family Dollar brand, Family Gourmet. 
Leveraging new quality control processes, we've enhanced the quality and the packaging while maintaining competitive price points. I encourage you to try these new items. The feedback we're getting from our customers and our team members has been very encouraging, and I'm confident that you'll be impressed.
Clearly, basic needs are still the primary driver of recurring shopping trips, but we also understand that families want to celebrate and treat themselves in ways that are both fun and affordable. Private label, supported by our global sourcing capabilities, enables us to provide quality products at compelling price points. 
For example, this spring, we enhanced and relaunched several brands including Tropic Sun, Outdoor by Design and our Kidgets apparel line for infants and toddlers. We've improved the product design, increased the quality of these items while maintaining competitive price points. 
To emphasize the values we offer, both in nationally recognized brands and in our private label offering, we have increased the frequency of our advertising. Five years ago, we communicated directly with our customers only a few times a year, generally around key holiday periods. Today, we communicate with our customers at least once a month, through either print or digital communications. These investments continue to be strongly supported by our vendor partners. 
We are also building new capabilities in both print and digital media. For example, we supported the launch of our Kidgets brand with more compelling in-store signage, increased direct marketing and a multimedia PR campaign targeting both social and traditional media. As part of our efforts to create greater brand awareness, we even launched an online contest, Cute as a Kidget, that generated great exposure to the brand.
Value is clearly important to our customers, but good customer service and a clean, well-organized store can differentiate us and drive increased customer loyalty. Reflecting this opportunity, we're re-emphasizing the importance of customer service in our stores and raising our expectations for store standards.
Leveraging our store technology platform, we are introducing new online training modules to help our store teams improve. And we're investing in new tools and processes that will help us manage our store teams better and improve our execution for customers.
To make our stores easier to shop, we've worked to eliminate excess inventories in stores and reduce clutters, and we're making layout changes that make it easier for our customers to quickly find what they need. We're also introducing new fixtures to accommodate expansions in key Consumable areas and to present seasonal merchandise better. And to provide the customer with more shopping convenience, we've expanded our operating hours and our payment types.
I began my remarks this morning with the discussion on the investments we have made to build new capabilities throughout our organization. We are already seeing a payback from these investments in operating margin expansion, stronger inventory productivity and higher returns on invested capital. While I'm proud of the progress we have made, I am even more excited about the future opportunity. As many customers continue to face financial pressures, I believe that we have a unique opportunity to increase our market share as more customers find our strategy of value and convenience appealing.
To position further market share growth, we are making significant investments to deliver a better customer experience and to strengthen the Family Dollar brand. We are expanding our selection of key traffic-driving Consumables and adding more national brands. We are leveraging stronger quality control processes and investing to raise the quality of our private label. We are protecting our strong price image and increasing our promotional efforts. While these investments have slowed the expansion of gross margin, they provide a platform for further top line growth and position us well to expand our market share and deliver even stronger financial results.
Clearly, the operating environments continues to be challenging. The competitive landscape is heating up as retailers look for new ways to drive traffic and ticket. The global environment continues to evolve, as governments respond to continued economic uncertainty and customer sentiment continues to shift.
In recent quarters, we have seen increased interest in discretionary categories. And while we are encouraged by these trends, it is unclear when we will see consistent growth.
Notwithstanding these economic uncertainties, I believe that our persistent focus on value and convenience, along with capability-building investments we have made, enhance our ability to adapt to an ever-changing environment and enable us to continue to deliver strong financial returns. 
And now operator, we'd be happy to open the call up for questions."

We saw some benefit from a markdown perspective that aided the gross margin expansion as we continue to manage inventory as well [ph]. The freight line is the one that has changed in tone, as we've talked about before. We're now seeing diesel costs measurably higher than they were year-over-year. So that moved from a tailwind to more flattish or a headwind. And then I think what we were discussing was, we continue to see benefits from our efforts around both our global sourcing efforts and private label and general procurement efforts. And what we've done is reinvest that into the value proposition in the form of additional quality, protecting the price image and a bit additional promotions. So those are the key drivers, the ups and downs for the third quarter. The fourth quarter, we do expect to grow, for gross margin to improve at a slower pace. We'll continue to slow down from the first and second quarter as we look to the fourth quarter."

So we are encountering some fairly significant growth in the Consumable areas, and we want to be able to sustain that. That was a primary objective of the space realignment and that has been largely realized. There are other stores, Chuck, that we are also dealing with the space issue in somewhat different ways. For example, we have looked at a number of urban markets and have significantly improved both space and inventory productivity by better aligning space and inventories to the demand patterns of the store. So I think the big bump, if you will, in expenses is behind us and it will be more of a continual process as we focus on both driving inventory and space productivity, along with creating a better shopping environment for the customer."

The key pressure from our core expense that we often refer to begins with expanded hours and then moves to some additional marketing. So those begin to move that leverage point up. You make a good point about last year's. We did, as we mentioned, invest heavily in realignments last fourth quarter that we're now anniversary-ing. So that does help to bring it down a bit. I would also mention the insurance has -- we did see some nice -- when you're looking at the third quarter versus the fourth quarter, we saw -- as we called out 30 basis points of leverage in the third quarter, don't expect that benefit to be at the same level as we move through the fourth quarter. So I think that the expense story is we continue to aggressively manage our core expenses, and the change from quarter-to-quarter is the cadence of our investments. And a couple of those, again to reiterate, a couple of the bigger dollar ones, there's the full load on the POS rollout. So we now have the whole chain done for both the third and the fourth quarter and the expanded hours."

In fact, our earliest I remember in a long time that we got the warm weather. And that helped us. But I have to give credit to the merchandising and supply chain teams for continuing to work on improving our assortments and really continuing to fine-tune the role that the Apparel category is playing in the Dollar Store space. I think that we have some work to do yet, but I think we had some good sell-throughs and productivity increases. We're very strong. As we work through the fourth quarter, it's primarily a clearance quarter. Based on the early sell-throughs, we don't have as much clearance to sell. I think while that may impact sales, I think it speaks nicely to profitability. And as I talked about investing some of those savings into the promotional side, it's really what we've done thus far. We're excited that we're ending the spring and summer selling season very clean. I think what I had seen over the years is when we end the season clean, it always speaks well to getting the next season off to a good start. So hopefully, that will help us, along with some of the strategic changes that we're making in the Apparel side of our business."

We had a very good Christmas season and volatility around the season. We had a very strong Easter, with volatility then around Easter. The third quarter doesn't have quite the impact. Memorial Day, 4th of July are a bit smaller for us, but there is around those too. Looking into the fourth quarter, we still see a net positive view in the discretionary area. But there seems to us to be a bit more uncertainty. You deal with the discretionary items where we are seeing this volatility, than in the Consumable areas where we're seeing very strong high single-digit consistent growth. So I suspect that what we're seeing is something that just, to us, represents a bit more uncertainty as opposed to a distinct trend. In fact, as volatility implies, it's the absence of a trend that we are looking at. And with that, we've taken a very conservative view of the fourth quarter. Also as Howard mentioned, the fourth quarter is predominantly a clearance quarter. So the good news is we have higher sell-throughs. The other side of that equation is we have lower inventories, upon which to drive clearance sales. So net-net, we are still seeing some positive results from a lot of the initiatives we've had to improve our Seasonal areas, our Home area and our Apparel area. But the buying patterns are, I believe, reflective of a lot of the uncertainties of the economy. You mentioned or referenced the fact that our customers do have a significant percent on various types of social umbrella programs. And yes, we are concerned as some of those umbrellas may be less effective or may not be extended. For example, the unemployment area. But what we've seen throughout this period is that, as times have toughened, we've actually gained in terms of pocketbook of our core customer. So we think that, that will be -- net-net, we'll be able to manage through it. Value and convenience is a key now and will be a key going down the road."

With me on the call this morning are Howard Levine, Chairman and CEO; Jim Kelly, President and COO; and Ken Smith, Chief Financial Officer. We'll begin our discussion this morning with a review of fiscal 2010, and then we'll take a few minutes to discuss our plans and outlook for fiscal 2011. 
Because of the amount of information we intend to discuss, our prepared comments will be longer than usual. We will, of course, host a question-and-answer session after our prepared comments, and please remember that the queue for the question-and-answer session will not be available until after we have finished our prepared remark.
Before we get started with our formal discussion of 2010, I'd like to cover a couple of housekeeping issues. First, as announced in our earnings release, we will no longer report quarterly sales separate from quarterly earnings. We expect to report sales and earnings for the first quarter on January 5, 2011.
Second, I would note that the balance sheet presentation reflects the reclassification of certain insurance liability. In short, we had previously recorded our insurance liabilities net of expected recovery. The revised presentation includes the recording of both the gross insurance liability as well as an insurance asset related to claims. In addition, we have broken out the insurance liabilities and related assets into both current and long-term portions. 
Finally, I'd like to announce that we're hosting an Investor Update meeting in New York on October 6. If you've not received an invitation and would like to attend, please contact me after today's call.

This morning, we reported another year of strong earnings growth, with earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2010 increasing 26.6% to $2.62 per share compared with $2.07 in fiscal '09. We also significantly improved the shopping experience at Family Dollar to include the following accomplishments. We expanded our assortment of consumables, increased our focus on quality and incorporated more customer and market data into our merchandising strategies to provide our customers with even greater value. We grew our private label program. We enhanced our advertising and pricing capabilities to successfully maintain our strong price image with customers despite a more promotional competitive environment. We reduced clutter and improved adjacencies through better inventory management and the installation of new more efficient fixturing. 
Through the completion of our store technology refresh, the expansion of our store operating hours and our space realignment efforts, we increased the convenience of the Family Dollar shopping experience. We also made great progress in our efforts to be a more compelling place to work. We strengthened our pay-for-performance culture and expanded our training and development programs. As a result, we drove continued improvement in our employee retention and internal promotion metric, delivering more consistent execution for customers, increasing productivity and reducing costs.
Finally, our efforts to be a more compelling place to shop and work delivered strong results for our shareholders. Our investments to drive revenue growth delivered a comparable store sales increase of 4.8%, driven by an acceleration of growth in the second half. Our efforts to maintain gross margin better and contain costs resulted in 110 basis points of operating margin expansion and another year of double-digit earnings per share growth, even as we invested aggressively to position Family Dollar for future growth. And we increased our overall return on shareholder's equity to approximately 25%, the strongest level in more than 10 years. 
I'm very proud of our achievements and performance and want to recognize the hard work and effort of all of our Family Dollar team members. Now I'll turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail, and then I will come back to review our plans and objectives for fiscal 2011. Ken?"
270820,112828717,79353,"Family Dollar Stores Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Sep 29, 2010",2010-09-29,"Earnings Calls","Family Dollar Stores Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Howard. I'm going to start with a review of our full year results, and then I'll discuss the fourth quarter. As Howard mentioned, earnings for fiscal 2010 increased 26.6% to $2.62 per diluted share compared with $2.07 per diluted share in fiscal",886,"Thanks, Howard. I'm going to start with a review of our full year results, and then I'll discuss the fourth quarter. 
As Howard mentioned, earnings for fiscal 2010 increased 26.6% to $2.62 per diluted share compared with $2.07 per diluted share in fiscal 2009. Strong top line growth combined with gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage resulted in operating margin expansion of more than 110 basis points. As we reported several weeks ago, net sales increased 6.3% and comp sales increased 4.8% for the year. Customer traffic continued to be the primary driver of comp sales, while the average transaction value was approximately flat at just under $10. 
While our Consumable business continued to drive traffic, we also saw improved performance in more discretionary categories. We are particularly pleased that sales of apparel began to show modest growth, especially as we lowered inventory levels by more than 10% per store through our space realignment and inventory management efforts.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased approximately 90 basis points in fiscal 2010. This improvement was a result of a number of investments we have made to lower our cost of goods. First, our continued focus on increasing employee retention, combined with enhanced processes and exception reporting, all contributed to continued improvement in inventory shrinkage. 
In addition, the expansion of our private brand assortment, improvements in our direct sourcing efforts and the continued leverage of our pricing capabilities all contributed to improve purchase markups. And our ongoing efforts to increase inventory productivity and mitigate risk resulted in lower markdowns for the year.
Finally, lower diesel costs in the first of the year more than offset increased transportation expense in the second half of fiscal 2010. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased approximately 30 basis points for the year. Most expenses, including occupancy costs, were leveraged during the year as a result of a 4.8% increase in comp store sales and our continued focus on driving productivity improvements.
We continue to benefit this year from favorable trends in our workers' compensation and general liability costs. The net impact for the full year was about 20 basis points. We also continued to see returns from our energy management efforts, which contributed another 20 basis points of improvement in fiscal 2010. Partially offsetting these improvements was an acceleration of investments in revenue-driving initiatives, including the expansion of operating hours.
Turning now to the fourth quarter. Net sales for the quarter increased 8% and comp sales increased 6.1%. Similar to the trend we saw throughout fiscal 2010, traffic was the primary driver of sales. 
During the quarter, Consumables increased approximately 10% to 67.3% of sales compared with 66.2% of sales in the fourth quarter last year. Despite this mix shift, gross margin increased approximately 20 basis points. Lower inventory shrinkage and higher purchase markups more than offset higher freight expense, higher promotional and clearance markdowns and stronger sales of lower margin consumable merchandise.
I would note that we continued to reinvest many of the cost savings from our global sourcing and private brand investments to enhance quality and protect our price image, and we have seen encouraging trends in both these metrics. These investments support our strategy to enhance our appeal to growing numbers of trade-down customers.
SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 60 basis points during the quarter, reflecting the effect of the 6% comp increase in the quarter and our continued focus on driving productivity improvements. Most expenses, including occupancy costs, were leveraged in the quarter. SG&A expenses increased by 0.8% in the quarter, driven by expenses related to sales-driving initiatives, including expanded operating hours, increased advertising and expenses related to new store openings.
In addition, we incurred expenses related to the launch of our store renovation efforts and the further expansion of store operating hours. The impact of these investments was partially offset by the impact of a favorable insurance settlement of approximately $9 million and lower professional fees. 
Net income for the quarter increased 23% to $74 million compared with $60.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Earnings per diluted share increased 30.2% to $0.56 this year compared with $0.43 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
Let me conclude our discussion of fiscal 2010 with a review of some additional financial highlights. Reflecting the expansion of key traffic-driving consumables as well as our efforts to improve in stocks, average inventory per store at the end of fiscal 2010 was about 1.5% higher than last year. We continued to manage inventory levels in more discretionary categories well. We continue to generate strong cash flows, generating about $590 million in operating cash flow this year. 
As we have previously discussed, our first priority for the deployment of capital is to reinvest in the business to drive higher financial returns. Reflecting this focus, we invested approximately $212 million back into our business this year, including $92 million for improvements and upgrades to existing stores, $55 million in technology-related projects, $29 million for new stores and $27 million for distribution center improvements. We also funded $79 million in dividend payments and purchased $332 million of our common stock during the year. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Howard, who will discuss our plans and objectives for fiscal 2011. Howard?"

While we have delivered 10 consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings growth, we are not satisfied with our relative sales performance.

While we have delivered 10 consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings growth, we are not satisfied with our relative sales performance. To close the competitive gap, we are moving faster to leverage the important progress we've made. 
Several years ago, we began to slow new store growth to focus more on improving returns in existing stores and the chain overall. Since then, we completed an end-to-end re-engineering of our merchandising and supply chain processes through our Project Accelerate initiative. We enhanced the performance of our store teams and refreshed our store technology platform and all stores through our Store of the Future project. And through our Concept Renewal efforts, we created a store layout for new stores that was more convenient and easier to shop.
As a result of these investments, we upgraded our operational capabilities, increased profitability, gained productivity and expanded our financial returns. More importantly, these investments provided us with a strong foundation to accelerate revenue growth going forward.
In fiscal 2010, as many of these infrastructure investments were fully implemented, we began to drive faster top line growth. We extended operating hours and strengthened our marketing efforts. Leveraging our space realignment efforts, we expanded our assortment in key Consumable categories and increased our selection of national brands. And we introduced new more productive fixtures to reduce clutter and improve our merchandise presentations. The result was an acceleration in comp sales from the 2% to 3% range in the first half of fiscal 2010 to the 6% to 7% range in the second half of the year.
Importantly, many of these investments are expected to continue driving results in fiscal '11. Building on these improvements, this year, we intend to continue to strengthen our value and convenience proposition. In addition, we plan to reaccelerate new store growth while also launching an aggressive store renovation program. 
Our new store performance has improved significantly in the last several years as a result of stronger site selection tools, as well as enhancements driven by Project Accelerate, Store of the Future and Concept Renewal. As we indicated last year in our fiscal 2009 conference call, these operational improvements, combined with softening real estate markets and a growing customer base, have resulted in additional opportunities for new store growth. As our cadence of new store openings in the fourth quarter would suggest, we have begun to ramp up the pace of unit growth.
In fiscal '11, we plan to open approximately 300 new stores, a 50% increase over 2010 openings. We also expect to build the pipeline to return to square-footage growth of 5% to 7% over the next two to three years. 
Reaccelerating new store opening is an important component of our plans to drive greater revenues. But we recognize that to deliver sustainable long-term growth, we must balance growth from new stores with growth from comp stores. 
I'm excited to announce today that we are launching an aggressive renovation program this year. Leveraging what we learned from Concept Renewal, enhanced merchandising and supply chain capability, a refresh store technology platform and a better trained and more productive workforce, we are initiating a comprehensive renovation program intended to re-energize the Family Dollar brand.
While concepts and merchandise differ across retailing channels, customer satisfaction is essentially determined by three basic factors: one, could I find what I needed; two, was the store clean and inviting; and three, was my interaction with employees pleasant. Through this renovation effort, we intend to impact all three of these drivers of customer satisfaction. 
I want to give you a high-level appreciation of this effort by noting the following merchandising changes. Utilizing a race-track flow, we have created a store-within-a-store presentation, with more customer-friendly adjacencies and improved navigational signage. With the goal of enhancing customer sight lines while also increasing merchandising capacity, we are utilizing new fixtures that are designed to simplify restocking and recovery while also providing greater flexibility for future merchandising mix shifts. We have further expanded our assortment in key Consumable categories, like food and health aides, while also strengthening our seasonal presentations. Finally, we have adjusted our checkout to encourage more customer interaction while also supporting our shrink control efforts.
Merchandise assortment and quality are important drivers of satisfaction, but the condition of the store itself also plays a role. This renovation will not only address the interior of the store, but will also include an exterior redesign effort to help strengthen our brand identity. 
Finally, customer satisfaction is dependent upon the interaction with our team. Consequently, we have increased our focus on customer service and raised our expectations regarding store standards. Leveraging our store technology platform, we are expanding our employee training and investing in new workflow management tools. We are implementing new employee branding to ensure that customers can find help when they need it, and we are initiating a new store manager incentive program that more clearly link compensation with sales growth.
Simply put, we are launching a comprehensive renovation program that will result in more customer-focused assortments and layouts, rejuvenated physical stores and more customer-centric teams. We'll discuss these improvements in more detail next week at our meeting in New York.
Our plan is to renovate 600 to 800 stores in fiscal 2011 at a projected cost of $100,000 to $130,000 per store. From a timing standpoint, we plan to have the first 200 completed before the holiday season begins. We initiated the process in a number of stores in August. And while it's still very early, the feedback we're getting from our customers and our team members is very encouraging. 
While we are making significant investments to drive revenue growth, we will also continue to pursue opportunities to further enhance our profitability and financial returns. Key areas of focus will include the continued expansion of our private brand penetration and the continued development of our global sourcing capability, as well as our ongoing efforts to improve operational productivity. 
At our Analyst Day last November, we articulated our goal of increasing sales of private brands, and we have made significant progress toward this goal in fiscal 2010. Over the last year, we have launched or refreshed 10 Family Dollar brands, impacting around 1,000 items. As a result of these efforts, private brand sales increased 19% to about 22% of sales in fiscal 2010, up from 19% in fiscal 2009.
And while I'm pleased with the progress we have made, we still have a significant opportunity to increase our penetration of private-branded consumables. In fiscal '11, we expect to continue to enhance and develop new private brand programs, with increased focus on Consumable categories. And we plan to leverage our enhanced marketing capabilities to drive greater brand awareness and strengthen our overall quality perception.
Our efforts to expand global sourcing capabilities will also support our private brand goals. Since launching our global sourcing effort, we have improved the quality of our private brands due to the establishment of standardized product specifications in more rigorous testing protocols. We believe that we have additional opportunity to manage our cost better through the diversification of our supplier network. And in support of these efforts, we expect to establish a local presence in China in the next several months.
Finally, we've remain focused on aggressively managing our core cost structure and driving additional productivity improvements. As we have discussed in previous presentations, we look to limit the growth of our core cost structure to 2% to 3% annually. Of course, with increased pressures from energy, healthcare and other external factors, that means we have to drive improvements in productivity, especially of our workforce every year.
Over the last several years, we have stabilized our workforce, significantly increased our store level training and raised our performance expectations. As a result, we have improved both our execution for the customer as well as our sales per labor hour. To help us drive further improvements, we are introducing new technology and processes to improve workflow management and leverage our labor hours more effectively.
In closing, I want to reiterate how excited we are about the opportunities that lie before us. With a strong foundation of improved capabilities in place, our team has worked hard over the last year to develop the plans we announced today. We presented our plans to our board back in April and with their support, began working in earnest to lay the groundwork to reaccelerate revenue growth. 
Although the economic environment continues to be challenging, I believe that our commitment to providing customers with greater value and convenience, combined with our intensified efforts to improve the shopping experience in our stores, will enable us to continue to expand our market share, drive double-digit earnings growth and improve our financial returns.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken, who will provide more specific details about our financial expectations for fiscal '11. Ken?"

As Howard discussed, we intend to continue to invest aggressively to increase customer traffic and drive sales growth. We will also continue to pursue opportunities to further enhance our financial results. We expect that the new store opening and renovation plans, combined with investments we are making to drive productivity in all stores, will result in net revenue growth of between 8% and 10% and comp store sales growth of between 5% and 7%.
We expect that gross margin in fiscal 2011 will be similar to fiscal 2010 levels, reflecting several offsetting factors. We believe that the investments we are making to improve quality and protect our price perception, combined with continued pressure from transportation expense, will mostly offset expected benefits from lower markdowns, the expansion of our private brand program, improvements in price optimization and lower inventory shrinkage.
While we continue to focus on cost-containment efforts, we are investing to drive stronger top line growth. Expanded operating hours, the acceleration of new store growth and our renovation program will all result in SG&A expense growth. However, we expect to leverage these investments and expand the operating margin in fiscal 2011. 
Regarding CapEx, as we indicated in the earnings release, we expect that CapEx in fiscal 2011 will be between $300 million and $350 million, reflecting our new store opening and renovation plans. I would also note that we expect to begin construction on our 10th distribution center later this year. Based on these expectations, we estimate that earnings per share will be between $2.95 and $3.15 in fiscal 2011. 
Before I move to our expectations for the first quarter, I would also note that our board has authorized the repurchase of $750 million of our common stock. As indicated in our press release, we intend to fund the repurchases through a combination of cash on hand, cash from operations and potential debt financings. We expect that the buybacks will be accretive to earnings per share and will enhance shareholder return on equity by lowering our effective cost of capital.
We have not yet finalized our plans but are currently considering a balanced cadence of repurchases over the next 12 months. We will provide further details as our plans are finalized. As noted in our press release, our earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2011 does not incorporate the effect of stock buybacks or potential debt financings. 
Regarding the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we expect comp store sales to increase between 5% and 7%. While the September period is not over, we are pleased with our sales performance so far.
We expect that Consumables will continue to drive sales in the first quarter, resulting in continued mix pressure. And similar to our experience in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we expect that transportation costs will continue to increase as a percentage of sales. However, we expect that lower shrink and lower markdowns will offset these pressures. As a result, we expect modest gross margin expansion in the first quarter.
In addition, our investments to drive top line growth to include expanded operating hours, accelerated new store openings and our store renovation program will most likely result in additional expense growth and constrain our ability to leverage SG&A at the lower end of our sales guidance. 
Given these expectations, we estimate that earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 will be between $0.55 and $0.60 compared with $0.49 in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.

There's been some volatility in our sales, as we've been working very hard to improve our capabilities. As we discussed today, we basically restructured our merchandising supply chain through our Project Accelerate process. That has positioned us to feel very good about growing comps more aggressively. Further, we've improved our store level execution. The Store of the Future has been a big part of that, so we're very pleased with what we've done there. Additionally, as we've talked about, we've really worked hard through realignment efforts to improve our adjacencies. We've expanded Consumables to adding not only national brands, but growing our private label. We've increased our store operating hours. More recently, we've expanded our hours even further. We're looking to see continuation of that. We've basically reworked and re-merchandised the whole center aisle of our store. We've expanded our marketing. Our in-store signage has shown great promise and is improving a lot to help our customers navigate through our stores. We've launched this aggressive renovation program, and we're talking about spending $100,000 to $130,000 per store. For any of you that have followed us historically, that is quite a number. And what that does is it addresses the three components that we think are really important to position us for future growth. We're addressing the physical plan of the store to include the facade, new exterior signage, we're really cleaning up the store on the inside as well with the new layout that we're very excited about that addresses a number of the shortfalls we felt we had with our assortment and we continue to grow our private brands. So we think we've done a lot to try to position ourselves for that kind of growth. No question, it's aggressive. But when we met with our board and we've been meeting with our management team, it's something that we feel we need to do from a competitive standpoint. The environment, while challenging, has given us a lot of confidence that we've navigated and survived and operated very nicely through what was the toughest economy in many, many years. So we feel very good about the opportunities. But at the end of the day, it's all about execution. So we're going to be the focused very hard on executing these programs and looking forward to reaching our goals."

We start with gross margin. I think the themes, as we think about them, are fairly consistent as we look to the quarters of fiscal 2011, I think the first thought there is we are very pleased the results we're seeing out of our efforts around our private brands and program as well as global sourcing. And we're reinvesting the savings we're getting there into quality and really strengthening, maintaining our strong price perception. So we look for that investment, the gains to continue to be invested as we look to next year. We do expect Consumables to lead the way. That being said, that tends to put some mix pressure on the margin line and as we look out towards '11, expect that to continue. We look for both markdowns and shrinkage to continue their trends, which is to give us some benefit there. So we continue to look for those trends to continue as we move to '11. And freight is the one area that as we saw in the fourth quarter, we expect that has to shift and it indeed has from a tailwind in the first part of 2010 to a headwind, starting in our fourth quarter, and we see that as a headwind on gross margin as we look to 2011. So those are roughly the puts and take. The net effect is in the first quarter. As we said, we expect modest gross margin improvement as we get out into the rest of the year. Obviously, the further we go out, there's a bit more uncertainty and we're remodeling flattish, I would call it flattish gross margin, rate for fiscal '11. From an expense perspective, I think the key thing around expenses is the investment to drive the top line. And we see that in the form of extended hours, ramped up new store growth and the strong renovation program that we're launching. So all of those, while they do add a bit of expense, we're looking for nice strong returns out of those and we look for those to drive the top line. On the other side, our core expenses, we do have aggressive plans to manage these core expenses in that 2% to 3% range and continue to look for opportunities such as outsourcing, examples being in our maintenance area, and continue this cross-functional cost controls within our core expenses. So we'll continue to do that. Obviously, your point, well taken, with the investment agenda all in that comp leverage point, those move a bit north of our 2% to 3% focus on the quarter."

Thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, you should know that our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding various operating initiatives, sales and profitability metrics and capital expenditures as well as our expectations for future financial performance.
While these statements address plans or events that we expect will or may occur in the future, a number of factors as set forth in our SEC filings and press releases could cause actual results to differ from our expectations. We refer you to and specifically incorporate the cautionary and risk statements contained in today's press release and in our SEC filings. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today, September 29, 2010. We have no obligation to update or revise our forward-looking statements, except as required by law, and you should not expect us to do so.
With me on the call this morning are Howard Levine, Chairman and CEO; Jim Kelly, President and COO; and Ken Smith, Chief Financial Officer. We'll begin our discussion this morning with a review of fiscal 2010, and then we'll take a few minutes to discuss our plans and outlook for fiscal 2011. 
Because of the amount of information we intend to discuss, our prepared comments this morning will be longer than usual. We will, of course, host a question-and-answer session after our prepared comments, and please remember that the queue for the question-and-answer session will not be available until after we have finished our prepared remarks.
Before we get started with our formal discussion of 2010, I'd like to cover a couple of housekeeping issues. First, as announced in our earnings release, we will no longer report quarterly sales separate from quarterly earnings. We expect to report sales and earnings for the first quarter on January 5, 2011.
Second, I would note that the balance sheet presentation reflects the reclassification of certain insurance liability. In short, we had previously recorded our insurance liabilities net of expected recovery. The revised presentation includes the recording of both the gross insurance liability as well as an insurance asset related to claims. In addition, we have broken out the insurance liabilities and related assets into both current and long-term portions. 
Finally, I'd like to announce that we're hosting an Investor Update meeting in New York on October 6. If you have not received an invitation and would like to attend, please contact me after today's call.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Howard Levine for some opening comments. Howard?"

This morning, we reported another year of strong earnings growth, with earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2010 increasing 26.6% to $2.62 per share compared with $2.07 per share in fiscal '09. We also significantly improved the shopping experience at Family Dollar to include the following accomplishments. We expanded our assortment of consumables, increased our focus on quality and incorporated more customer and market data into our merchandising strategies to provide our customers with even greater value. We grew our private label program. We enhanced our advertising and pricing capabilities to successfully maintain our strong price image with customers despite a more promotional competitive environment. We reduced clutter and improved adjacencies through better inventory management and the installation of new, more efficient fixturing. 
Through the completion of our store technology refresh, the expansion of our store operating hours and our space realignment efforts, we increased the convenience of the Family Dollar shopping experience. We also made great progress in our efforts to be a more compelling place to work. We strengthened our pay-for-performance culture and expanded our training and development programs. As a result, we drove continued improvement in our employee retention and internal promotion metric, delivering more consistent execution for customers, increasing productivity and reducing costs.
Finally, our efforts to be a more compelling place to shop and work delivered strong results for our shareholders. Our investments to drive revenue growth delivered a comparable store sales increase of 4.8%, driven by an acceleration of growth in the second half. Our efforts to maintain gross margin better and contain costs resulted in 110 basis points of operating margin expansion and another year of double-digit earnings per share growth, even as we invested aggressively to position Family Dollar for future growth. And we increased our overall return on shareholder's equity to approximately 25%, the strongest level in more than 10 years. 
I'm very proud of our achievements and performance and want to recognize the hard work and effort of all of our Family Dollar team members. Now I'll turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail, and then I will come back to review our plans and objectives for fiscal 2011. Ken?"

I'm going to start with a review of our full year results, and then I'll discuss the fourth quarter. As Howard mentioned, earnings for fiscal 2010 increased 26.6% to $2.62 per diluted share compared with $2.07 per diluted share in fiscal",886,"Thanks, Howard. I'm going to start with a review of our full year results, and then I'll discuss the fourth quarter. 
As Howard mentioned, earnings for fiscal 2010 increased 26.6% to $2.62 per diluted share compared with $2.07 per diluted share in fiscal 2009. Strong top line growth combined with gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage resulted in operating margin expansion of more than 110 basis points. As we reported several weeks ago, net sales increased 6.3% and comp sales increased 4.8% for the year. Customer traffic continued to be the primary driver of comp sales, while the average transaction value was approximately flat at just under $10. 
While our Consumable business continued to drive traffic, we also saw improved performance in more discretionary categories. We are particularly pleased that sales of apparel began to show modest growth, especially as we lowered inventory levels by more than 10% per store through our space realignment and inventory management efforts.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased approximately 90 basis points in fiscal 2010. This improvement was a result of a number of investments we have made to lower our cost of goods. First, our continued focus on increasing employee retention, combined with enhanced processes and exception reporting, all contributed to continued improvement in inventory shrinkage. 
In addition, the expansion of our private brand assortment, improvements in our direct sourcing efforts and the continued leverage of our pricing capabilities all contributed to improve purchase markups. And our ongoing efforts to increase inventory productivity and mitigate risk resulted in lower markdowns for the year.
Finally, lower diesel costs in the first of the year more than offset increased transportation expense in the second half of fiscal 2010. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased approximately 30 basis points for the year. Most expenses, including occupancy costs, were leveraged during the year as a result of a 4.8% increase in comp store sales and our continued focus on driving productivity improvements.
We continue to benefit this year from favorable trends in our workers' compensation and general liability costs. The net impact for the full year was about 20 basis points. We also continued to see returns from our energy management efforts, which contributed another 20 basis points of improvement in fiscal 2010. Partially offsetting these improvements was an acceleration of investments in revenue-driving initiatives, including the expansion of operating hours.
Turning now to the fourth quarter. Net sales for the quarter increased 8% and comp sales increased 6.1%. Similar to the trend we saw throughout fiscal 2010, traffic was the primary driver of sales. 
During the quarter, Consumables increased approximately 10% to 67.3% of sales compared with 66.2% of sales in the fourth quarter last year. Despite this mix shift, gross margin increased approximately 20 basis points. Lower inventory shrinkage and higher purchase markups more than offset higher freight expense, higher promotional and clearance markdowns and stronger sales of lower margin consumable merchandise.
I would note that we continued to reinvest many of the cost savings from our global sourcing and private brand investments to enhance quality and protect our price image, and we have seen encouraging trends in both these metrics. These investments support our strategy to enhance our appeal to growing numbers of trade-down customers.
SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 60 basis points during the quarter, reflecting the effect of the 6% comp increase in the quarter and our continued focus on driving productivity improvements. Most expenses, including occupancy costs, were leveraged in the quarter. SG&A expenses increased by 0.8% in the quarter, driven by expenses related to sales-driving initiatives, including expanded operating hours, increased advertising and expenses related to new store openings.
In addition, we incurred expenses related to the launch of our store renovation efforts and the further expansion of store operating hours. The impact of these investments was partially offset by the impact of a favorable insurance settlement of approximately $9 million and lower professional fees. 
Net income for the quarter increased 23% to $74 million compared with $60.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Earnings per diluted share increased 30.2% to $0.56 this year compared with $0.43 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
Let me conclude our discussion of fiscal 2010 with a review of some additional financial highlights. Reflecting the expansion of key traffic-driving consumables as well as our efforts to improve in stocks, average inventory per store at the end of fiscal 2010 was about 1.5% higher than last year. We continued to manage inventory levels in more discretionary categories well. We continue to generate strong cash flows, generating about $590 million in operating cash flow this year. 
As we have previously discussed, our first priority for the deployment of capital is to reinvest in the business to drive higher financial returns. Reflecting this focus, we invested approximately $212 million back into our business this year, including $92 million for improvements and upgrades to existing stores, $55 million in technology-related projects, $29 million for new stores and $27 million for distribution center improvements. We also funded $79 million in dividend payments and purchased $332 million of our common stock during the year. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Howard, who will discuss our plans and objectives for fiscal 2011. Howard?"

While we have delivered 10 consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings growth, we are not satisfied with our relative sales performance. To close the competitive gap, we are moving faster to leverage the important progress we've made. 
Several years ago, we began to slow new store growth to focus more on improving returns in existing stores and the chain overall. Since then, we completed an end-to-end re-engineering of our merchandising and supply chain processes through our Project Accelerate initiative. We enhanced the performance of our store teams and refreshed our store technology platform in all stores through our Store of the Future project. And through our Concept Renewal efforts, we created a store layout for new stores that was more convenient and easier to shop.
As a result of these investments, we upgraded our operational capabilities, increased profitability, gained productivity and expanded our financial returns. More importantly, these investments provided us with a strong foundation to accelerate revenue growth going forward.
In fiscal 2010, as many of these infrastructure investments were fully implemented, we began to drive faster top line growth. We extended operating hours and strengthened our marketing efforts. Leveraging our space realignment efforts, we expanded our assortment in key Consumable categories and increased our selection of national brands. And we introduced new, more productive fixtures to reduce clutter and improve our merchandise presentations. The result was an acceleration in comp sales from the 2% to 3% range in the first half of fiscal 2010 to the 6% to 7% range in the second half of the year.
Importantly, many of these investments are expected to continue driving results in fiscal '11. Building on these improvements, this year, we intend to continue to strengthen our value and convenience proposition. In addition, we plan to reaccelerate new store growth while also launching an aggressive store renovation program. 
Our new store performance has improved significantly in the last several years as a result of stronger site selection tools, as well as enhancements driven by Project Accelerate, Store of the Future and Concept Renewal. As we indicated last year in our fiscal 2009 conference call, these operational improvements, combined with softening real estate markets and a growing customer base, have resulted in additional opportunities for new store growth. As our cadence of new store openings in the fourth quarter would suggest, we have begun to ramp up the pace of unit growth.
In fiscal '11, we plan to open approximately 300 new stores, a 50% increase over 2010 openings. We also expect to build the pipeline to return to square-footage growth of 5% to 7% over the next two to three years. 
Reaccelerating new store opening is an important component of our plans to drive greater revenues. But we recognize that to deliver sustainable long-term growth, we must balance growth from new stores with growth from comp stores. 
I'm excited to announce today that we are launching an aggressive renovation program this year. Leveraging what we learned from Concept Renewal, enhanced merchandising and supply chain capability, a refresh store technology platform and a better trained and more productive workforce, we are initiating a comprehensive renovation program intended to re-energize the Family Dollar brand.
While concepts and merchandise differ across retailing channels, customer satisfaction is essentially determined by three basic factors: one, could I find what I needed; two, was the store clean and inviting; and three, was my interaction with employees pleasant. Through this renovation effort, we intend to impact all three of these drivers of customer satisfaction. 
I want to give you a high-level appreciation of this effort by noting the following merchandising changes. Utilizing a race-track flow, we have created a store-within-a-store presentation, with more customer-friendly adjacencies and improved navigational signage. With the goal of enhancing customer sight lines while also increasing merchandising capacity, we are utilizing new fixtures that are designed to simplify restocking and recovery while also providing greater flexibility for future merchandising mix shifts. We have further expanded our assortment in key Consumable categories, like food and health aids, while also strengthening our seasonal presentations. Finally, we have adjusted our checkout to encourage more customer interaction while also supporting our shrink control efforts.
Merchandise assortment and quality are important drivers of satisfaction, but the condition of the store itself also plays a role. This renovation will not only address the interior of the store, but will also include an exterior redesign effort to help strengthen our brand identity. 
Finally, customer satisfaction is dependent upon the interaction with our team. Consequently, we have increased our focus on customer service and raised our expectations regarding store standards. Leveraging our store technology platform, we are expanding our employee training and investing in new workflow management tools. We are implementing new employee branding to ensure that customers can find help when they need it, and we are initiating a new store manager incentive program that more clearly link compensation with sales growth.
Simply put, we are launching a comprehensive renovation program that will result in more customer-focused assortments and layouts, rejuvenated physical stores and more customer-centric teams. We'll discuss these improvements in more detail next week at our meeting in New York.
Our plan is to renovate 600 to 800 stores in fiscal 2011 at a projected cost of $100,000 to $130,000 per store. From a timing standpoint, we plan to have the first 200 completed before the holiday season begins. We initiated the process in a number of stores in August. And while it's still very early, the feedback we're getting from our customers and our team members is very encouraging. 
While we are making significant investments to drive revenue growth, we will also continue to pursue opportunities to further enhance our profitability and financial returns. Key areas of focus will include the continued expansion of our private brand penetration and the continued development of our global sourcing capability, as well as our ongoing efforts to improve operational productivity. 
At our Analyst Day last November, we articulated our goal of increasing sales of private brands, and we have made significant progress toward this goal in fiscal 2010. Over the last year, we have launched or refreshed 10 Family Dollar brands, impacting around 1,000 items. As a result of these efforts, private brand sales increased 19% to about 22% of sales in fiscal 2010, up from 19% in fiscal 2009.
And while I'm pleased with the progress we have made, we still have a significant opportunity to increase our penetration of private-branded consumables. In fiscal '11, we expect to continue to enhance and develop new private brand programs, with increased focus on Consumable categories. And we plan to leverage our enhanced marketing capabilities to drive greater brand awareness and strengthen our overall quality perception.
Our efforts to expand global sourcing capabilities will also support our private brand goals. Since launching our global sourcing effort, we have improved the quality of our private brands due to the establishment of standardized product specifications and more rigorous testing protocols. We believe that we have additional opportunity to manage our cost better through the diversification of our supplier network. And in support of these efforts, we expect to establish a local presence in China in the next several months.
Finally, we've remain focused on aggressively managing our core cost structure and driving additional productivity improvements. As we have discussed in previous presentations, we look to limit the growth of our core cost structure to 2% to 3% annually. Of course, with increased pressures from energy, healthcare and other external factors, that means we have to drive improvements in productivity, especially of our workforce every year.
Over the last several years, we have stabilized our workforce, significantly increased our store-level training and raised our performance expectations. As a result, we have improved both our execution for the customer as well as our sales per labor hour. To help us drive further improvements, we are introducing new technology and processes to improve workflow management and leverage our labor hours more effectively.
In closing, I want to reiterate how excited we are about the opportunities that lie before us. With a strong foundation of improved capabilities in place, our team has worked hard over the last year to develop the plans we announced today. We presented our plans to our board back in April and with their support, began working in earnest to lay the groundwork to reaccelerate revenue growth. 
Although the economic environment continues to be challenging, I believe that our commitment to providing customers with greater value and convenience, combined with our intensified efforts to improve the shopping experience in our stores, will enable us to continue to expand our market share, drive double-digit earnings growth and improve our financial returns.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken, who will provide more specific details about our financial expectations for fiscal '11. Ken?"

As Howard discussed, we intend to continue to invest aggressively to increase customer traffic and drive sales growth. We will also continue to pursue opportunities to further enhance our financial results. We expect that the new store opening and renovation plans, combined with investments we are making to drive productivity in all stores, will result in net revenue growth of between 8% and 10% and comp store sales growth of between 5% and 7%.
We expect that gross margin in fiscal 2011 will be similar to fiscal 2010 levels, reflecting several offsetting factors. We believe that the investments we are making to improve quality and protect our price perception, combined with continued pressure from transportation expense, will mostly offset expected benefits from lower markdowns, the expansion of our private brand program, improvements in price optimization and lower inventory shrinkage.
While we continue to focus on cost-containment efforts, we are investing to drive stronger top line growth. Expanded operating hours, the acceleration of new store growth and our renovation program will all result in SG&A expense growth. However, we expect to leverage these investments and expand the operating margin in fiscal 2011. 
Regarding CapEx, as we indicated in the earnings release, we expect that CapEx in fiscal 2011 will be between $300 million and $350 million, reflecting our new store opening and renovation plans. I would also note that we expect to begin construction on our 10th distribution center later this year. Based on these expectations, we estimate that earnings per share will be between $2.95 and $3.15 in fiscal 2011. 
Before I move to our expectations for the first quarter, I would also note that our board has authorized the repurchase of $750 million of our common stock. As indicated in our press release, we intend to fund the repurchases through a combination of cash on hand, cash from operations and potential debt financings. We expect that the buybacks will be accretive to earnings per share and will enhance shareholder return on equity by lowering our effective cost of capital.
We have not yet finalized our plans but are currently considering a balanced cadence of repurchases over the next 12 months. We will provide further details as our plans are finalized. As noted in our press release, our earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2011 does not incorporate the effect of stock buybacks or potential debt financings. 
Regarding the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we expect comp store sales to increase between 5% and 7%. While the September period is not over, we are pleased with our sales performance so far.
We expect that Consumables will continue to drive sales in the first quarter, resulting in continued mix pressure. And similar to our experience in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we expect that transportation costs will continue to increase as a percentage of sales. However, we expect that lower shrink and lower markdowns will offset these pressures. As a result, we expect modest gross margin expansion in the first quarter.
In addition, our investments to drive top line growth to include expanded operating hours, accelerated new store openings and our store renovation program will most likely result in additional expense growth and constrain our ability to leverage SG&A at the lower end of our sales guidance. 
Given these expectations, we estimate that earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 will be between $0.55 and $0.60 compared with $0.49 in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.

But as we look to continue to grow new stores and look at the fourth quarter cadence, as I mentioned in my comments, we're encouraged by what we see there in terms of the openings as well as the new submittals that are coming in. Most of those are all in the existing operating area, to your point, to increase density, to provide better leverage from a management point of view and a marketing point of view and a transportation point of view. The state out West, on the West Coast, is certainly out there. And we are looking to open up stores out in the West, not this fiscal year, more than likely sometime at the beginning of the following fiscal year."

There's been some volatility in our sales, as we've been working very hard to improve our capabilities. As we discussed today, we basically restructured our merchandising supply chain through our Project Accelerate process. That has positioned us to feel very good about growing comps more aggressively. Further, we've improved our store-level execution. The Store of the Future has been a big part of that, so we're very pleased with what we've done there. Additionally, as we've talked about, we've really worked hard through realignment efforts to improve our adjacencies. We've expanded Consumables to adding not only national brands, but growing our private label. We've increased our store operating hours. More recently, we've expanded our hours even further. We're looking to see continuation of that. We've basically reworked and re-merchandised the whole center aisle of our store. We've expanded our marketing. Our in-store signage has shown great promise and is improving a lot to help our customers navigate through our stores. We've launched this aggressive renovation program, and we're talking about spending $100,000 to $130,000 per store. For any of you that have followed us historically, that is quite a number. And what that does is, is addresses the three components that we think are really important to position us for future growth. We're addressing the physical plan of the store to include the facade, new exterior signage. We're really cleaning up the store on the inside as well with the new layout that we're very excited about that addresses a number of the shortfalls we felt we had with our assortment, and we continue to grow our private brands. So we think we've done a lot to try to position ourselves for that kind of growth. No question, it's aggressive. But when we met with our board and we've been meeting with our management team, it's something that we feel we need to do from a competitive standpoint. The environment, while challenging, has given us a lot of confidence that we've navigated and survived and operated very nicely through what was the toughest economy in many, many years. So we feel very good about the opportunities. But at the end of the day, it's all about execution. So we're going to be focused very hard on executing these programs and looking forward to reaching our goals."

And I think the themes, as we think about them, are fairly consistent as we look to the quarters of fiscal 2011. I think the first thought there is we are very pleased with the results we're seeing out of our efforts around our private brands and program as well as global sourcing. And we're reinvesting the savings we're getting there into quality and really strengthening, maintaining our strong price perception. So we look for that investment, the gains to continue to be invested as we look to next year. We do expect Consumables to lead the way. That being said, that tends to put some mix pressure on the margin line and as we look out towards '11, expect that to continue. We look for both markdowns and shrinkage to continue their trends, which is to give us some benefit there. So we continue to look for those trends to continue as we move to '11. And freight is the one area that as we saw in the fourth quarter, we expect that has to shift, and it indeed has from a tailwind in the first part of 2010 to a headwind, starting in our fourth quarter, and we see that as a headwind on gross margin as we look to 2011. So those are roughly the puts and take. The net effect is in the first quarter. As we said, we expect modest gross margin improvement as we get out into the rest of the year. Obviously, the further we go out, there's a bit more uncertainty and we're modeling flattish, I would call it flattish gross margin, rate for fiscal '11. From an expense perspective, I think the key thing around expenses is the investment to drive the top line. And we see that in the form of extended hours, ramped up new store growth and the strong renovation program that we're launching. So all of those, while they do add a bit of expense, we're looking for nice strong returns out of those and we look for those to drive the top line. On the other side, our core expenses, we do have aggressive plans to manage these core expenses in that 2% to 3% range and continue to look for opportunities such as outsourcing, examples being in our maintenance area, and continue just cross-functional cost controls within our core expenses. So we'll continue to do that. Obviously, your point, well taken, with the investment agenda, all in that comp leverage point, does move a bit north of our 2% to 3% focus on the quarter."

And I guess, can you deep dive into that a little bit more because you're asking a lot of the stores organization, you're saying shrink is actually going to improve, which typically, it doesn't improve. So could you talk about that? And then on the remodel side, how much if you get those remodeled stores up to the chain average, what impact just by having those remodels up to the chain average would have on the overall consolidated margin?"

We had some great comps, so I also want to point out that there is opportunity when we do attack something like we're doing here to grow our business. I always qualify something as major as this, that there's execution risk. I think we've done a good job of trying to mitigate as much of that as possible with all the investments we've made over the last couple of years to include all the -- the Store of the Future, to include Project Accelerate, all the in-store operational execution problems and issues that we've worked on to improve. Having stability of our workforce has been a very big help of getting some of the training fully implemented throughout the company. So we’re always sensitive to the potential of execution snafus. But I think that today, we're very well positioned to work through those, make adjustments as we see fit. One of the things that we mentioned is we're going to have 200 stores completed pretty soon. We're almost done with almost 100 to date. What we're going to do is monitor those through the holiday season. Then I can promise you, we'll have some tweaks and some adjustments that we’ll make as we go forward, but are very excited about how we're positioned and the way we've enhanced our management team to ensure better execution throughout this process. So we're excited but certainly appreciate the comments and the caution in terms of execution.  But as I've said, we feel very good about where we are today and are ready to reaccelerate growth."
