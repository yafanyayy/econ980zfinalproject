The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-Q and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. And if you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website.Ball finished 2009 on a strong note. Fourth quarter comparable earnings per share of $0.84 versus $0.56 last year increased by 50%. Also on a comparable basis, our diluted earnings per share were $4.05 in 2009 versus $3.61 in 2008, a 12% improvement. Our businesses are performing well. Nearly every segment saw month-on-month volume improvement during 2009. We're executing on our strategy to grow our Global Beverage Can business and our strong free cash flow long-term relationships with the customers and sound balance sheet position us to build on our momentum in 2010 and beyond.2010 marks Ball's 130th year in business and we're going to work hard to make sure it's our best year ever. With me on today's call are John Hayes, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and also joining us is Ray Seabrook. In November we announced that John, Scott and Ray were being promoted. Though Ray has been our CFO for a decade he's always had an affinity for our operations and now in his role as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Global Packaging. He has operating responsibility for 90% of Ball's businesses.Both today and in the future Scott will interpret our numbers, we thought the investor community should not be cut off cold turkey from Ray, so we invited Ray to be on the call today and before Scott and John discuss the quarter, Ray, would you like to greet the group?"

In the fourth quarter, Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share were up $0.84 well ahead of last year's $0.56. Overall, the fourth quarter numbers were very strong due to the excellent performance in Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas and Asia, a better than expected contribution from the newly acquired container plant, a stronger euro and excellent fixed cost controls in European beverage, and an overall, lower effective tax rate.Turning to the operating segments. Metal Beverage Americas and Asia had improved earnings for the quarter and the year, a better than expected contribution from the metal container plant, cost savings resulting from prior plant rationalization and lower fixed cost all provided good earnings momentum in the quarter. Metal Beverage Europe's earnings were up considerably for the quarter due to the impact of a higher euro and lower fixed cost. Full year lower earnings were primarily related to the full year exchange impact and product mix.Metal food and household product earnings in the quarter were down due to the lower volumes and the favorable resolution of a $6.8 million claim recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the year, earnings were up considerably due to inventory holding gain improved margins and benefits prior plant rationalization efforts, which more than offset the double-digit volume declines in the segment.Plastics was profitable in the fourth quarter versus break-even results last year. Full year EBIT improved slightly despite an 11% reduction in volume. Aerospace and Technologies posted near double-digit EBIT margins in the quarter despite lower sales. The absence of large fixed price hardware contracts was the primary reason for the decline in year-over-year revenue and earnings. A higher euro in the quarter compared to last year increased diluted share earnings by $0.04 and for the year, the impact of a lower euro was negative impact of $0.03 per diluted share compared to 2008.Turning to full year free cash flow. Ball generated $373 million, which was on target with our expectations. That included an incremental $14 million pension contribution and an investment in working capital totaling $82 million which was slightly larger than our earlier estimate of $70 million as we took advantage of early payment discounts. The working capital build is expected to largely to reverse in 2010.As Ray indicated would be the case, the cash collateral of the company was required to post with counter parties in 2008 was returned by the end of 2009. Net balance sheet debt at the end of the year was approximately $2.4 billion, only $100 million higher than the net balance sheet debt at the end of 2008. Despite making a nearly $600 million acquisition during 2009.Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains solid with the 2009 rolling four quarters EBIT to interest coverage at 5.6x and net debt to EBITDA at 2.5x. Committed credit and available liquidity at year end was in excess of $800 million.As we look to full year 2010 earnings and cash flow, we anticipate capital spending in the range of $235 million. CapEx will remain at these disciplined levels until we see growth opportunities returning.  Free cash flow should be in excess of $0.5 billion, excluding the impact of a change in how we account for our AR securitization program, which I'll cover in a minute. Pension expenses projected to be about $6 million higher in 2010 while after-tax pension funding is expected to be approximately $25 million lower.The full year effective tax rate will likely increase to around 33% due to projected higher U.S. earnings as a result of the full year impact of our Metal Beverage acquisition as the U.S. is our highest tax jurisdiction. With the full year impact of the additional debt for our acquisition, we expect 2010 interest expense in the range of $140 million. We also expect to improve our already strong balance sheet in 2010 by having plenty of flexibility to great value for our shareholders.Also want to get ahead of the curve and address an item before we get to our first quarter earnings announcement. Due to the issuance of revised guidance on the accounting for AR securitization programs effective in the first quarter of 2010, the aspects [ph] of how free cash flow will look in 2010 needs to be addressed. The accounting change will result in our securitization being placed on the balance sheet. We have had a securitization since the 1990s and have consistently reported the outstanding amount during conference calls and in financial statement footnotes. While 2009 year on AR securitization balance was $250 million, the maximum level of the plan. The change will be reflected in the first quarter 10-Q and subsequent periods for any outstanding securitization balance. And in the first year, the effect will be to increase accounts receivable and debt on the balance sheet.While the net balance sheet and cash flow affected zero, the change will create a one-time reduction in operating cash flow for the amount of receivables securitized and an offsetting increase in cash inflows from financing activities. We will break out the impacts so that you will be able to see the net change and comparability between periods. It is fewer than accounting change but I wanted to point it out now so you'll be aware of the change and with that, I'll turn it over to John."

We have complementary skill sets, a talented bench of people across the organization and wonderful",937,"Thank you, Scott. As Ray mentioned, all of us have been working together for a number of years and like every good team, we're able to feed off each other. We have complementary skill sets, a talented bench of people across the organization and wonderful base from which to continue building needless to say all of us are geared to go here at Ball Corp. We did have a strong year in 2009 and we are teed up for better 2010 and beyond. Better supply and demand balance, good focus on cost management, a disciplined approach to our commercial activities and continued focus on market leadership, and sustainability and innovation helped drive our 2009 performance.Now turning to the various businesses. Profitability for the quarter in our Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas and Asia segment was slightly above our expectations and notably improved over 2008. This was driven largely by improving volume dynamics late in the fourth quarter. Cost containment in this business remains excellent and continued cost savings from plant rationalizations contributed to improved results. Excluding the newly acquired facilities, our fourth quarter volume in North America was down approximately 3% versus a decline of 1% for the industry. However, our volumes improved month by month in the quarter and our December results were some of the strongest that we've seen in a while. Driving this was stronger promotional activity of our customers in the CSD side, as they balanced the value to volume equation, and continued packet share increases in the beer side of  the business.Volumes in our newly acquired facilities also experienced similar demand trends.At year-end Ball also successfully concluded negotiations on all of our significant Metal Beverage contracts. Our customer conversations were constructive and we are satisfied with the results of these negotiations. With the acquisition of the former metal container plants in North America, we have the opportunity to take a fresh look at our customer mix and we use this opportunity to balance our customer concentration. Given the size of our business, this often can take a couple of years to accomplish and as a result we may step back slightly in 2010 in terms of overall volume while recovering it in 2011 and beyond.In Asia, Paul announced in November its intention to acquired the remaining 65% interest in JFP's Sanshui facility. Once completed, this facility will provide Ball an opportunity to better serve our customer base in Southern China and provides us a low-cost way of increasing our capacity without growing overall industry capacity.In summary, we expect 2010 profitability in the Americas, Asia segment to be improved driven by contribution of three additional quarters of the two acquisitions, continued cost savings resulting from the previous announced capacity closures, continued focus on our cost optimization initiatives and continued growth from new innovative product launches like Alumi-Tek and a 7.5 ounce 90-calorie soft drink can. This will be slightly offset by planned lower volumes in North America.In our European operations, volumes improved slightly for the full year with volumes roughly flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter. A stronger euro and cost saving initiatives implemented in the plants offset continued negative product mix. With 33-centiliter CSD growth, offsetting lower 50-centiliter beer sales. However, we have seen Eastern Europe, excluding Russia stabilized and Western Europe continues to hold up reasonably well particularly in France and the Netherlands.As we look towards 2010, the overall pricing dynamics in Europe are a bit more challenging than in prior years due to the supply demand balance. However, our European management team continues to monitor the demand trends by region and stands ready to adjust to any deviations to our expectations. Our continued FX tailwinds and mitigating cost inputs will help to offset weaker price mix, as in the Americas and Asia segment, we expect earnings improvement in 2010 in this segment as well. Our Food and Household product group performed very well in 2009, excellent execution on our rationalization program, tight discipline around our pricing and cost recovery initiatives and overall attention to detail and focused execution contributed to strong performance. Fourth quarter year-over-year performance was off mainly due to a favorable resolution of a $6.8 million claim collected in the fourth quarter of 2008 and difficult volume comps from the prior year. Recall fourth quarter 2008 volumes were up 4% due to a pre-buy of food and aerosol packaging that impacted the entire industry. Aerosol volumes continue to improve at year-end but still finished the year down more than 10%.As Scott mentioned, first quarter 2010 comparisons in this segment will be negative as a result to the first quarter 2009 inventory holding gains. Plastic Packaging Americas had a challenging fourth quarter driven primarily by lower volumes in the CSD and Water segments. Overall volumes were down in the low teens and we took additional downtime in the fourth quarter to manage inventory targets. However, our Food Plastic customer base experienced improved trends especially in the smaller category of Nutriceuticals. Our Aerospace business had a strong fourth quarter with sales and EBIT both exceeding our internal expectations. Our antenna, components and service businesses are maintaining good growth trajectory and management is awaiting word on a number of bids to enhance the backlog and position the business for growth going forward.We are pleased with the operational performance of our company but we are not content. 2010 will be a year where we continue to make further progress on the initiatives underway, we're focusing on best practice sharing and plant efficiencies across our worldwide system and the continued execution of our overall strategy. And with that, I'll turn it back to Dave."

And you could clearly see it in all the IRI numbers. As you got to the fourth quarter of last year, you started to see those trends reverse and you saw a lot of promotional activity and they're really focusing on trying to get the volumes going through price promotions. And again, if you look at the IRI data over the last four weeks or eight weeks of the quarter, you'll clearly able to see that. As we go into 2010, I think the customer base is still trying to figure out this value versus volume equation. And while we don't have very strong expectations that they are going to push real hard, it's too early in the year to tell. We do have the Winter Olympics coming up. We have the World Cup over in Europe. So I think some of the promotional activity around that will be telling.  Turning to the food side, I think the tone overall, is relatively constructive. There wasn't destocking in the first half of the year last year that's why I believe volumes were a bit soft. They started to improve in the fourth quarter and as we go into 2010 we're starting to see some volume trends are much more constructive than they certainly were 12 months ago."

I mentioned here in North America on the beer side, it's been gaining share in the packaged mix.

We're starting to see a little bit of a recovery and in fact I believe in the full fourth quarter, Generally speaking, as I said Eastern Europe, you exclude Russia and there was actually a little bit of growth in some of those major markets there. I think overall, the can is holding up pretty well in this overall, environment. We have expectations that these trend will continue because of the convenience of the can and because of the wonderful sustainability aspects of it. With respect to your question about efficiencies and supply and demand in Europe, we are running pretty tight.

Joining me today on the call is John Hayes, Ball's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, Scott will provide key financial metrics for the quarter and for 2010, and John will follow with details about our operating performance. 
While we reported strong first quarter results against some difficult comparisons last year when we had a net inventory holding gain in the range of $35 million. And also, as we described in our press release, we're seeing signs of growth in our packaging markets, which is very welcome. And during the quarter, our Aerospace segment saw an improving contract to work environment. We did announce earlier this month a new contract called GFO-2 [Geosat Follow-on 2 ] with significant potential and we're glad to see that begin to come in. So we hope to hear more about other proposals in that part of our business soon. And with that, Scott?"

In the first quarter, Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share were at $0.85, well ahead of last year's $0.77. Drivers during the quarter were positive contributions from the four acquired beverage can plants in the fourth quarter of last year: Volume improvements in our packaging businesses, very good operating performance and cost controls, tax benefits realized on a foreign investment in Asia and a strong start in equity earnings in affiliates in Brazil and further strengthening expected during the remaining quarters of this year. These were offset somewhat by higher interest costs due to the acquisition financing from last year. 
Aerospace segment first quarter earnings were down slightly on lower revenue. As mentioned on the last conference call, the trends in this business appear to be improving. While contract wins, including the one noted in the earnings release, will likely not have a significant impact on 2010, they do firm up staffing in the business and set us up nicely going into 2011.
Turning to some key financial metrics, interest expense in the quarter was up as expected due to the acquisition financing from last year's purchase of the four Metal Beverage plants. While we still expect full year interest expense to be in the range of $140 million, excluding the impacts of the one-time interest costs associated with calling of the 2012 notes. 
The first quarter effective tax rate of 20% was favorably impacted by certain foreign tax benefits earned on investments. As you are aware, the recognition of tax benefits tends to be a lumpy activity. We continue to expect the full year rate to be in the range of 32%. But our tax department historically has done a great job of finding opportunities. 
The company's receivables securitization program is now being recorded as a balance sheet obligation, due to the effects of the accounting pronouncement I described in the January call. The impact for the quarter was an increase in accounts receivable of $250 million and an increase in debt. While the net balance sheet and total cash flow effect is zero, there was a one-time reduction in operating cash flow for the amount of receivables securitized and an offsetting increase in cash inflows from financing activities. This change has been broken out as separate line items in the press release financials, as you can see the net change and comparability between periods. 
During the quarter, we raised $500 million in new 6.75% notes due in 2020. On April 21, we used the proceeds of the new notes to retire $509 million and 6 7/8% notes due in 2012. Because of the timing of the new note issuance and the calling of the existing notes, our balance sheet reflects both debt issues and considerable cash on hand at the end of the quarter. The 2012 notes that were retired are shown as short-term debt at quarter end. 
Also following January's earnings conference call, we announced the repurchase of $125 million of our stock through an accelerated share repurchase program. The program resulted in the delivery of 90% or 2.2 million shares on the execution day with the remainder to be delivered at the conclusion of the contract, which will occur during the next few months. Given our significant free cash flow expectations for 2010 which continue to be in excess of $500 million, we will increase the size of the share repurchase program during 2010. As always, we look to return value to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. During the period that our accelerated share repurchase contract remains open, it is cumbersome to change the current dividend amount, but we continue to evaluate both of these mechanisms to ensure that we have the right mix. 
With that, I'll turn it over to John."

Ball delivered a strong first quarter.  Global consumers appeared to be getting back on track.  And that, along with balancing our supply and demand in our metal packaging businesses and very good and improving operating performance, makes us optimistic as we head into the busy summer selling season. 
Profitability for the quarter of our metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia segment met our expectations and was notably improved over first quarter 2009. This was driven largely by the impact of the newly acquired U.S. plants and the lack of inventory holding losses recorded last year. Cost savings from prior plant rationalizations also contributed to improved results. Our CSD customers are fine-tuning the value versus volume equation, which is beginning to show up in the improving sequential CSD can volume trends in the first quarter. 
In China, both the overall market as well as Ball saw double-digit volume growth rates in the quarter. Herbal teas and beer demand were the main catalyst behind the volume improvement. In Brazil, the startup of our new facility continues to go very well and it is sold out. We announced the addition of a second line in this facility and it should come on stream in early 2011. The market is performing very well. It's up mid-teens, and we continue to look for opportunities while remaining disciplined.
We continue to expect 2010 profitability in the Americas and Asia segment to be improved. Driven by the contribution of three additional quarters of the acquisition that closed in October, cost savings resulted from the previously announced capacity closures. Our relentless focus on our cost optimization and best practice sharing activities continued growth from new innovative product launches like our 90-calorie mini soft drink can, improved penetration of the can into the Kraft brewing segment and improving volume trends in both the U.S. and China.
In our European operations, volumes were up mid single-digit percent in the first quarter led by promising growth in both Western and Eastern Europe that was slightly offset by weaker export sales. Continued cost savings at the plant level also contributed to improved results. As in the Americas and Asia segment, we expect earnings improvement, albeit on a euro basis in 2010 in this segment. The business is beginning to prepare for World Cup promotional activities, so we'll wait to see how much of a positive impact this will have with our customers. 
And Food and Household products segment continues to execute well. Volumes were up slightly above 3% in the quarter and many of our customers are off to a nice start. First year, year-over-year performance was down due to the lack of inventory holding gains recorded last year that Dave mentioned. However, even with that difficult comparison, the business had a very solid quarter due largely to excellent operating performance. While food and aerosol can volumes have rebounded, they are not yet back to historical levels. Continued volume growth and our disciplined approach to commercial activities offers upside for the remainder of this year and into 2011.
Plastic packaging, Americas challenges continue. Lower volumes in the cold-fill CSD and water segments and manufacturing disruptions at a PVT plant due to a customer qualification occurrence led to an operating loss in the quarter. The manufacturing disruption is behind us and plants are catching up with the recent increased demand at the C store level. Also the food specialty plastic side of the business is seeing improved trends from our customer base. Ball Aerospace experienced somewhat softer sales in EBIT in the quarter, but also saw progress in contract integrations and, more importantly, new awards. This trend, if it continues, may provide a foundation for better results. Our antenna components and services businesses are maintaining good growth trajectory, and the hardware side of this business also has some glimmers of future contracts awards. So stay tuned here. 
Company-wide, our operations are executing well in what appears to be the beginning of an improved global environment. Continued discipline around capital spending and working capital reductions will ensure the delivery of significant free cash flow, which is a major focus in 2010.
During the past two years, we've taken numerous actions to improve performance in a difficult global environment while also positioning Ball for growth when the economy improves. Though we are not done with that process, in fact we're never done, we do like where we stand today with our manufacturing footprint and the leverage we can poll to grow as markets grow. Dave?"

We're also seeing a lot of good improvement, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, on the innovation side of our business. The Craft beer segment, we're seeing a lot of tailwind there.

And beer, it's really glass versus cans. And on the soft drink, you also have PET in the mix as well. So if I recall off the top of my head, the can as a share of beer mix is in the upper 30s, call it 37%, 38%, and on the CSD side, it's probably low teens. And so as that economy continues to mature, as the GDP per cap continues to increase, and as the government continues to invest in infrastructure in anticipation of the '14 World Cup and the '16 Olympics, I think the underpinnings for the continued growth looks nice. Let's not forget that here in North America, in the beer segment, cans as a share of package mix is now probably over 50%."

Joining me today on the call is John Hayes, Ball's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, Scott will provide key financial metrics for the quarter and for 2010, and John will follow with details about our operating performance. 
While we reported strong first quarter results against some difficult comparisons last year when we had a net inventory holding gain in the range of $35 million. And also, as we described in our press release, we're seeing signs of growth in our packaging markets, which is very welcome. And during the quarter, our Aerospace segment saw an improving contract to work environment. We did announce earlier this month a new contract called GFO-2 [Geosat Follow-on 2 ] with significant potential and we're glad to see that begin to come in. So we hope to hear more about other proposals in that part of our business soon. And with that, Scott?

These were offset somewhat by higher interest costs due to the acquisition financing from last year. 
Aerospace segment first quarter earnings were down slightly on lower revenue. As mentioned on the last conference call, the trends in this business appear to be improving. While contract wins, including the one noted in the earnings release, will likely not have a significant impact on 2010, they do firm up staffing in the business and set us up nicely going into 2011.
Turning to some key financial metrics, interest expense in the quarter was up as expected due to the acquisition financing from last year's purchase of the four Metal Beverage plants. While we still expect full year interest expense to be in the range of $140 million, excluding the impacts of the one-time interest costs associated with calling of the 2012 notes. 
The first quarter effective tax rate of 20% was favorably impacted by certain foreign tax benefits earned on investments. As you are aware, the recognition of tax benefits tends to be a lumpy activity. We continue to expect the full year rate to be in the range of 32%. But our tax department historically has done a great job of finding opportunities. 
The company's receivables securitization program is now being recorded as a balance sheet obligation, due to the effects of the accounting pronouncement I described in the January call. The impact for the quarter was an increase in accounts receivable of $250 million and an increase in debt. While the net balance sheet and total cash flow effect is zero, there was a one-time reduction in operating cash flow for the amount of receivables securitized and an offsetting increase in cash inflows from financing activities. This change has been broken out as separate line items in the press release financials, as you can see the net change and comparability between periods. 
During the quarter, we raised $500 million in new 6.75% notes due in 2020. On April 21, we used the proceeds of the new notes to retire $509 million and 6 7/8% notes due in 2012. Because of the timing of the new note issuance and the calling of the existing notes, our balance sheet reflects both debt issues and considerable cash on hand at the end of the quarter. The 2012 notes that were retired are shown as short-term debt at quarter end. 
Also following January's earnings conference call, we announced the repurchase of $125 million of our stock through an accelerated share repurchase program. The program resulted in the delivery of 90% or 2.2 million shares on the execution day with the remainder to be delivered at the conclusion of the contract, which will occur during the next few months. Given our significant free cash flow expectations for 2010 which continue to be in excess of $500 million, we will increase the size of the share repurchase program during 2010. As always, we look to return value to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. During the period that our accelerated share repurchase contract remains open, it is cumbersome to change the current dividend amount, but we continue to evaluate both of these mechanisms to ensure that we have the right mix. 
With that, I'll turn it over to John.

170352,100000648,58565,"Ball Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-29-2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Ball Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Scott. Ball delivered a strong first quarter.  Global consumers appeared to be getting back on track.  And that, along with balancing our supply and demand in our metal packaging businesses and very good and improving operating performance, makes",752,"Thanks, Scott. Ball delivered a strong first quarter.  Global consumers appeared to be getting back on track.  And that, along with balancing our supply and demand in our metal packaging businesses and very good and improving operating performance, makes us optimistic as we head into the busy summer selling season. 
Profitability for the quarter of our metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia segment met our expectations and was notably improved over first quarter 2009. This was driven largely by the impact of the newly acquired U.S. plants and the lack of inventory holding losses recorded last year. Cost savings from prior plant rationalizations also contributed to improved results. Our CSD customers are fine-tuning the value versus volume equation, which is beginning to show up in the improving sequential CSD can volume trends in the first quarter. 
In China, both the overall market as well as Ball saw double-digit volume growth rates in the quarter. Herbal teas and beer demand were the main catalyst behind the volume improvement. In Brazil, the startup of our new facility continues to go very well and it is sold out. We announced the addition of a second line in this facility and it should come on stream in early 2011. The market is performing very well. It's up mid-teens, and we continue to look for opportunities while remaining disciplined.
We continue to expect 2010 profitability in the Americas and Asia segment to be improved. Driven by the contribution of three additional quarters of the acquisition that closed in October, cost savings resulted from the previously announced capacity closures. Our relentless focus on our cost optimization and best practice sharing activities continued growth from new innovative product launches like our 90-calorie mini soft drink can, improved penetration of the can into the Kraft brewing segment and improving volume trends in both the U.S. and China.
In our European operations, volumes were up mid single-digit percent in the first quarter led by promising growth in both Western and Eastern Europe that was slightly offset by weaker export sales. Continued cost savings at the plant level also contributed to improved results. As in the Americas and Asia segment, we expect earnings improvement, albeit on a euro basis in 2010 in this segment. The business is beginning to prepare for World Cup promotional activities, so we'll wait to see how much of a positive impact this will have with our customers. 
And Food and Household products segment continues to execute well. Volumes were up slightly above 3% in the quarter and many of our customers are off to a nice start. First year, year-over-year performance was down due to the lack of inventory holding gains recorded last year that Dave mentioned. However, even with that difficult comparison, the business had a very solid quarter due largely to excellent operating performance. While food and aerosol can volumes have rebounded, they are not yet back to historical levels. Continued volume growth and our disciplined approach to commercial activities offers upside for the remainder of this year and into 2011.
Plastic packaging, Americas challenges continue. Lower volumes in the cold-fill CSD and water segments and manufacturing disruptions at a PVT plant due to a customer qualification occurrence led to an operating loss in the quarter. The manufacturing disruption is behind us and plants are catching up with the recent increased demand at the C store level. Also the food specialty plastic side of the business is seeing improved trends from our customer base. Ball Aerospace experienced somewhat softer sales in EBIT in the quarter, but also saw progress in contract integrations and, more importantly, new awards. This trend, if it continues, may provide a foundation for better results. Our antenna components and services businesses are maintaining good growth trajectory, and the hardware side of this business also has some glimmers of future contracts awards. So stay tuned here. 
Company-wide, our operations are executing well in what appears to be the beginning of an improved global environment. Continued discipline around capital spending and working capital reductions will ensure the delivery of significant free cash flow, which is a major focus in 2010.
During the past two years, we've taken numerous actions to improve performance in a difficult global environment while also positioning Ball for growth when the economy improves. Though we are not done with that process, in fact we're never done, we do like where we stand today with our manufacturing footprint and the leverage we can poll to grow as markets grow. Dave?

So as we and others invest and/or put in more capacity, it's to fulfill an identified demand. But I think all of us have to be concerned and careful about this whole idea of being overbilled. Our new plant north of REO, both of these lines, the one that's operating and the one that is going to come up, as John said, early next year are sold out. So the other part is, as you know, although from time to time, we ship cans long distances, freight's an issues. So where you're located in a large country in a large market is not important either.

And on the food side, we expect those trends to continue throughout the year. Our conversations with our customers indicate that barring weather and crops and other things like that, that they expect it to be a robust year, largely because the destocking we saw, particularly in the first half of last year is over and we're seeing consumers starting to restock in the pantry.

And we've seen no decisions being made. Well, one's been made, we can anticipate, I think during the balance of this year, a few more. And if we win our share of those, we'll see our backlog build and so on. The business, actually, at this point through four months is frankly tracking a little ahead of where I thought it might be. And that's a credit to the people there, and that we have been winning smaller things. But we're optimistic that we're beginning to see inflection there, and more to come.

In a moment, Scott will provide key financial metrics for the quarter and for 2010, and John will follow with details about our operating performance. 
While we reported strong first quarter results against some difficult comparisons last year when we had a net inventory holding gain in the range of $35 million. And also, as we described in our press release, we're seeing signs of growth in our packaging markets, which is very welcome. And during the quarter, our Aerospace segment saw an improving contract to work environment. We did announce earlier this month a new contract called GFO-2 [Geosat Follow-on 2 ] with significant potential and we're glad to see that begin to come in. So we hope to hear more about other proposals in that part of our business soon. And with that, Scott?"

In the first quarter, Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share were at $0.85, well ahead of last year's $0.77. Drivers during the quarter were positive contributions from the four acquired beverage can plants in the fourth quarter of last year: volume improvements in our packaging businesses, very good operating performance and cost controls, tax benefits realized on a foreign investment in Asia and a strong start in equity earnings in affiliates in Brazil and further strengthening expected during the remaining quarters of this year. These were offset somewhat by higher interest costs due to the acquisition financing from last year. 
Aerospace segment first quarter earnings were down slightly on lower revenue. As mentioned on the last conference call, the trends in this business appear to be improving. While contract wins, including the one noted in the earnings release, will likely not have a significant impact on 2010, they do firm up staffing in the business and set us up nicely going into 2011.
Turning to some key financial metrics, interest expense in the quarter was up as expected due to the acquisition financing from last year's purchase of the four metal beverage plants. But we still expect full year interest expense to be in the range of $140 million, excluding the impacts of the one-time interest costs associated with calling of the 2012 notes. 
The first quarter effective tax rate of 20% was favorably impacted by certain foreign tax benefits earned on investments. As you are aware, the recognition of tax benefits tends to be a lumpy activity. We continue to expect the full year rate to be in the range of 32%. But our tax department, historically, has done a great job of finding opportunities. 
The company's receivable securitization program is now being recorded as a balance sheet obligation, due to the effects of the accounting pronouncement I described in the January call. The impact for the quarter was an increase in accounts receivable of $250 million and an increase in debt. While the net balance sheet and total cash flow effect is zero, there was a onetime reduction in operating cash flow for the amount of receivables securitized and an offsetting increase in cash inflows from financing activities. This change has been broken out as separate line items in the press release financials, as you can see the net change and comparability between periods. 
During the quarter, we raised $500 million in new 6 3/4% notes due in 2020. On April 21, we used the proceeds of the new notes to retire $509 million and 6 7/8% notes due in 2012. Because of the timing of the new note issuance and the calling of the existing notes, our balance sheet reflects both debt issues and considerable cash on hand at the end of the quarter. The 2012 notes that were retired are shown as short-term debt at quarter end. 
Also following January's earnings conference call, we announced the repurchase of $125 million of our stock through an accelerated share repurchase program. The program resulted in the delivery of 90% or 2.2 million shares on the execution day with the remainder to be delivered at the conclusion of the contract, which will occur during the next few months. Given our significant free cash flow expectations for 2010, which continue to be in excess of $500 million, we will increase the size of the share repurchase program during 2010. As always, we look to return value to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. During the period that our accelerated share repurchase contract remains open, it is cumbersome to change the current dividend amount, but we continue to evaluate both of these mechanisms to ensure that we have the right mix. 
With that, I'll turn it over to John."

Ball delivered a strong first quarter. Global consumers appear to be getting back on track, and that, along with balancing our supply and demand in our metal packaging businesses and very good and improving operating performance, makes us optimistic as we head into the busy summer selling season. 
Profitability for the quarter of our Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas and Asia segment met our expectations and was notably improved over first quarter 2009. This was driven largely by the impact of the newly acquired U.S. plants and the lack of inventory holding losses recorded last year. Cost savings from prior plant rationalizations also contributed to improved results. Our CSD customers are fine-tuning the value versus volume equation, which is beginning to show up in the improving sequential CSD can volume trends in the first quarter. 
In China, both the overall market as well as Ball saw double-digit volume growth rates in the quarter. Herbal teas and beer demand were the main catalyst behind the volume improvement. In Brazil, the start-up of our new facility continues to go very well and it is sold out. We announced the addition of a second line in this facility and it should come on stream in early 2011. The market is performing very well. It's up mid-teens, and we continue to look for opportunities while remaining disciplined.
We continue to expect 2010 profitability in the Americas and Asia segment to be improved, driven by the contribution of three additional quarters of the acquisition that closed in October, cost savings resulted from the previously announced capacity closures, our relentless focus on our cost optimization and best practice sharing activities, continued growth from new innovative product launches like our 90-calorie mini soft drink can, improved penetration of the can into the craft brewing segment and improving volume trends in both the U.S. and China.
In our European operations, volumes were up mid single-digit percent in the first quarter led by promising growth in both Western and Eastern Europe that was slightly offset by weaker export sales. Continued cost savings at the plant level also contributed to improved results. As in the Americas and Asia segment, we expect earnings improvement, albeit on a euro basis, in 2010 in this segment. The business is beginning to prepare for World Cup promotional activities, so we'll wait to see how much of a positive impact this will have with our customers. 
And Food and Household Products segment continues to execute well. Volumes were up slightly above 3% in the quarter and many of our customers are off to a nice start. First year, year-over-year performance was down due to the lack of inventory holding gains recorded last year that Dave mentioned. However, even with that difficult comparison, the business had a very solid quarter due largely to excellent operating performance. While food and aerosol can volumes have rebounded, they are not yet back to historical levels. Continued volume growth and our disciplined approach to commercial activities offers upside for the remainder of this year and into 2011.
Plastic Packaging, Americas challenges continue. Lower volumes in the cold-fill CSD and water segments and manufacturing disruptions at a PET plant due to a customer qualification occurrence led to an operating loss in the quarter. The manufacturing disruption is behind us and plants are catching up with the recent increased demand at the C-store level. Also the food specialty plastic side of the business is seeing improved trends from our customer base. Ball Aerospace experienced somewhat softer sales in EBIT in the quarter, but also saw progress in contract integrations and more importantly, new awards. This trend, if it continues, may provide a foundation for better results. Our antenna components and services businesses are maintaining good growth trajectory, and the hardware side of this business also has some glimmers of future contracts awards. So stay tuned here. 
Company-wide, our operations are executing well in what appears to be the beginning of an improved global environment. Continued discipline around capital spending and working capital reductions will ensure the delivery of significant free cash flow, which is a major focus in 2010.
During the past two years, we've taken numerous actions to improve performance in a difficult global environment while also positioning Ball for growth when the economy improves. Though we are not done with that process, in fact we're never done, we do like where we stand today with our manufacturing footprint and the leverage we can pull to grow as markets grow. Dave?"

As I mentioned earlier, all of our lines are running now, and shipments are picking up. And we just heard a day or two ago that  we're having trouble keeping up in a place or two. So no doubt that has a good impact. I would just say that overall, we have to fix this business. We did get price increases and so forth. Volumes have been softer. But it's getting a lot of attention inside of our company right now as to what to do. On the other hand, because as you mentioned earlier, it really isn't very large in terms of the overall Ball Corporation. And so I think one needs to keep that in mind. We want to make it perform better, certainly, and we may have to take actions to cause that to happen. So, John, do you have anything that you can add?"

The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ in the company's latest 10-Q and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. And if you don't have our earnings release, it's available on our website, which is at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website.
Joining me on the call today is John Hayes, Ball's President, Chief  Operating Officer; and Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, Scott's going to comment on our financial performance for the quarter and for 2010, and then John will follow details about our operating performance.
Ball reported strong second quarter results. Increasing volumes across our Packaging businesses, strong operating performance and positive contributions from the strategic actions we've been taking during the last couple of years led to our improved results. During the quarter we closed our acquisition of the JFP joint venture plan in China, and we announced our agreement to sell our Plastics business to Amcor for $280 million in cash.  We also increased our authorization to repurchase up to 12 million shares.
Also in the quarter, Ball published its second corporate sustainability report, highlighting progress on our goals in five key areas of focus which are: Packaging, energy, water and waste, safety and talent management. You can read the report and expanded details on ball.com.
Earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of Neuman Aluminum, the largest North American manufacturer of metal discs that are made into extruded aluminum bottles and containers used for personal care and beverage products. Well, we're very pleased with our strengthening performance this year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott."
170352,108735584,70557,"Ball Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Ball Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dave. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.38, well ahead of last year's $1.14, a more than 20% improvement.

Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.38, well ahead of last year's $1.14, a more than 20% improvement. Volume improvements in our Global Metal Packaging businesses, efficient plant operating performance and disciplined cost controls contributed to the improved results. These positive factors were offset somewhat by a higher interest cost, a higher effective tax rate. A weaker euro negatively impacted diluted earnings per share by $0.02 in the quarter and $0.06 year-to-date. At present rate, the FX headwinds are expected to increase in the second half of the year.
The Plastics business is now reflected under discontinued operations at our financial statements. The sale resulted in a charge of approximately $76 million in the second quarter. The bulk of this charge is related to goodwill impairment. For a complete summary of second quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release.
Turning to some key financial metrics. Interest expense in the quarter was up as expected due to the acquisition financing from last year's purchase of the four metal beverage plants. And an extra month of interest expense from carrying both the new bond issued in March and the 2012 notes we redeemed into April. We still anticipate full year interest expense to be approximately $140 million.
Given the improvement seen to date in our North American packaging operations, we expect the full year tax rate to be around 33%. At current exchange rates, year end net debt is expected to be approximately $2.4 billion, essentially where we ended 2009, or on a comparable basis, we're down over $200 million due to the AR securitization being reflected on the balance sheet. Even without the cash flow, we would have historically generated in the second half of the year from our Plastics business, we expect free cash flow to be approximately $0.5 billion in 2010, excluding the impact of the AR securitization coming out of the balance sheet.
As stated in this morning's press release, and as a result of our strong free cash flow, we expect to repurchase an excess of $400 million of our stock during 2010. As of today's conference call, we have acquired $250 million of stock this year. Our balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure are where we want to be, so expect us to return a majority of our free cash flow through share repurchases absent other significant strategic opportunities.
With that, I'll turn it over to John to talk more about the operations."

The optimism we felt heading into the busy summer season has materialized in the strong second quarter results.

The optimism we felt heading into the busy summer season has materialized in the strong second quarter results. In our Metal Beverage Packaging Americas and Asia segment, profitability for the quarter exceeded our expectations with EBITDA of $114.5 million versus $74.8 million in the second quarter last year. This was driven largely by the impact of the acquired plants, excellent plant performance and strong volume trend in CSD  [carbonated soft drink], certain specialty sizes and the emerging Craft Beer category.
Key U.S. retailers led significant promotional activity around the Memorial Day holiday, and that activity provided a volume lift relative to our expectations throughout the quarter. These promotions were in place for the Fourth of July holiday as well, but it appears that they have subsided somewhat. Best practice sharing and plant floor information system upgrades continue to drive efficiency gains in our plants. Our strong position in the specialty can arena and focus on innovation are providing opportunities for our customers to launch new products in the U.S., and our ability to respond to the growing needs of the Craft Brewing segment, all have contributed to improving volume trends. 
In China, both the overall market, as well as Ball saw strong double-digit volume growth rates in the quarter. Herbal teas and beer demands continue to be the main catalyst behind the volume improvement. The newly acquired JFP plants will play a pivotal role in being able to supply the growing demand for beverage cans in Southern China. We have a variety of opportunities to improve this new facility without spending significant capital, and the payback will exceed Ball's hurdle rate by the year end 2011.
Double-digit volume growth continues in Brazil. We've had a very close relationships with established partners there for a long time, and the three plants in our joint venture are performing well. We continue to evaluate further growth opportunities in this region. But as always, we'll do it in conjunction with secured customer contracts.
In our European operations, trends are also positive. Results in the quarter were EBIT of $72.5 million versus $64.8 million in the second quarter last year, on volumes that were up mid-single digits percent. This was offset by lower export volume and a slight FX translation headwind, which Scott mentioned earlier. A rebound in specialty can demand also provided improved price cost mix for the quarter.
We mentioned in the news release encouraging signs in Germany for the return of the beverage can. Several significant discounters in Germany began relisting beverage cans in their outlets during the second quarter, which helped to increase the total industry can sales in that country by more than 30% year-to-date and more than 50% in the second quarter. Obviously, that is on a base smaller than what we would like, but it is another step forward and we continue to work with retailers and others to bring back this important market.
As in the Americas, Asia segment we expect earnings improvement albeit on a euro basis in 2010 in that segment. Our Food and Household Packaging Products segment continued to perform very well. Volumes in the food side of the business were up low- to mid-single digits in the quarter, with aerosol volumes experiencing mid- to high-single digits growth both for the industry as well as for Ball.
Second quarter year-over-year EBIT of $33.4 million versus $35.1 million was down slightly but against a difficult year-over-year comparison due to inventory holding gains recorded in the second quarter of 2009. The segment had another solid quarter due largely to excellent operating performance, product mix and the improved volume trends mentioned earlier.
While food volumes have also rebounded nicely, the fresh packed crops are behind schedule by a couple of weeks especially the tomato crop. That being said, the Food and Household segment is running ahead of expectations and all indications are that this segment will have another solid year in 2010. We'll just look for some cooperation from the weather as we head into the pack season.
Dave mentioned Neuman Aluminum. We acquired that business this week, and it is a great strategic addition to our Food and Household Packaging segment. Neuman supplies more than 90% of the aluminum discs, called slugs, used to make extruded aluminum bottles in North America. It brings us technology, an entry further up the supply chain into an adjacent market. Neuman isn't a big acquisition in terms of size but it fits well within our portfolio, and we intend to leverage its capabilities to help us grow this segment.
Aerospace segment second quarter earnings of $18.6 million were up from last year's $14.8 million on essentially flat revenue. Strong program performance on existing fixed priced programs made up most of the difference. As we have indicated throughout the year, recent contract wins will likely not have a big earnings impact in the second half of 2010, but they do firm up the backlog and set us up nicely going into 2011. Those glimmers of future contracts awards noted in the first quarter conference call are slowly starting to move forward through the process. So stay tuned as we progress through the year.
In summary, our plants are running very well, packaging volume trends continue to improve and numerous opportunities exist for us to prosecute prudently. We're in a strong position operationally as we head into the second half of the year and we will expect to see good momentum continue into 2011. Dave?"

We continue to seek opportunities for growth both organically and through acquisitions, rest assured that we're going to remain focused on maintaining our track record of disciplined, balanced capital deployment.
Last year, from continuing operations adjusted for the sale of the Plastics business, we made $3.92 for the full year. In the first half of this year, the comparable earnings were $2.25, a very strong performance. And we're going to do our best to meet or exceed the first half performance in the second half of 2010.

I think we mentioned on the first quarter call that -- I'll talk North American first, North American beverage. We ran our business as a system, and we've had volumes moving around within our newly acquired facilities and our existing facilities. So it's difficult to separate out. Having said that, we acquired relatively full-out plants from Metal Container nine months ago or so. If you take those out of the equation, our remaining plants were about down 3% or so for the quarter. But as we also said in the first quarter, as we go into 2010 and '11, in 2010 we stepped back in terms of some of our volumes over the last 18 months or so related primarily to the plant closures, remember Kent, Washington and Kansas City among others, and we're trying to be a bit more disciplined. Having said that, going into 2011, we expect to be up relative to the market as we rebalance our customer portfolio. Over in Europe, some of the trends that we saw, certainly in Western Europe continued. It was up high single digits, I think in the 8% or so range. Eastern Europe was a bit soft, I think the economy is not improving in Eastern Europe relative to Western Europe and there's a bit of a lag there. But overall, we were up mid-single digits. Our exports remain a bit soft but some of our bigger markets including the Netherlands and the U.K. were up quite nicely and there's been good weather in Europe in addition to the World Cup. So we feel relatively constructive as we go into the second half of the year, that the trends we saw in the second quarter will continue."

And so as we go into 2011, I think the CSD and the beer people are looking at the value versus volume equation. We can tell you that the can had taken a little bit of share relative to other packaging substrates in some of those markets but I don't think any meaningful deviations have occurred. On the specialty side, we continue to see strong interest in a whole variety of different sizes. As you know, this year with the big CSD customer, we launched a 7.5-ounce container. We're seeing strong growth in some of the smaller sizes, as well as some of the larger sizes. Remember 2009, the larger sizes, largely on the energy drink side were impacted because of the housing downturn and the people were purchasing much less at the C-store [convenience store] level. We're seeing that starting to come back and so we continue to believe that our good position in the specialty side will continue to give us benefits as we go forward."

We acquired it on financial terms that are quite attractive and we're going to exceed our cost to capital in the first year. And also, it does play well into our initiatives around sustainability and recycling. So as we said, it wasn't a big acquisition and we paid approximately $60 million.

So consolidation was an appropriate thing to have happened in the market. We did not believe that, where we were positioned, it makes sense for us to be the consolidator, and it's as simple as that. We had a great plants. We did make money and we flow a lot of cash out of that business over the years that we had it. But as we got to making the decision, I think, what happened for us is going to be very good as we look into the future, and what has happened for the person that bought this, the company that bought it, you've got help to them. Not that, that's our goal necessarily just to help our competitors or other companies, but it's a situation where we've got lots of good people in that business who worked really, really hard and the market just wasn't ever set up, so that we could earn. I think what you have to try to figure out is where you can have advantage in whatever you do. And in the kind of businesses that we're in, are slug it out, tough businesses. Cost is very important. You got to do everything as near perfectly as you can to satisfy customer need. But there's no doubt in my mind that we've got lots of opportunity now, particularly on the Metal side of the business all around the world. The things that we're looking at and the possibilities including organic growth, including acquisitions, and we're flowing lots of cash. The company's is in a wonderful shape. I can see it improving over the next few years, just from the hand that we're dealt right now.

And if there's real growth opportunities, we might look at doing something else if we need to. In Europe, I think, I mentioned it before, other than 33 and 50s, it has been growing more than 2x the overall growth. And it varies by country, and it varies by CSD versus beer, the CSD isn't growing a little bit faster than the beer has over, on specialty sizes, over in Europe.

The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ in the company's latest 10-Q and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. And if you don't have our earnings release, it's available on our website, which is at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website.
Joining me on the call today is John Hayes, Ball's President, Chief  Operating Officer; and Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, Scott's going to comment on our financial performance for the quarter and for 2010, and then John will follow details about our operating performance.
Ball reported strong second quarter results. Increasing volumes across our Packaging businesses, strong operating performance and positive contributions from the strategic actions we've been taking during the last couple of years led to our improved results. During the quarter we closed our acquisition of the JFP joint venture plan in China, and we announced our agreement to sell our Plastics business to Amcor for $280 million in cash.  We also increased our authorization to repurchase up to 12 million shares.
Also in the quarter, Ball published its second corporate sustainability report, highlighting progress on our goals in five key areas of focus which are: Packaging, energy, water and waste, safety and talent management. You can read the report and expanded details on ball.com.
Earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of Neuman Aluminum, the largest North American manufacturer of metal discs that are made into extruded aluminum bottles and containers used for personal care and beverage products. Well, we're very pleased with our strengthening performance this year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott."

Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.38, well ahead of last year's $1.14, a more than 20% improvement.

Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.38, well ahead of last year's $1.14, a more than 20% improvement. Volume improvements in our Global Metal Packaging businesses, efficient plant operating performance and disciplined cost controls contributed to the improved results. These positive factors were offset somewhat by a higher interest cost, a higher effective tax rate. A weaker euro negatively impacted diluted earnings per share by $0.02 in the quarter and $0.06 year-to-date. At present rate, the FX headwinds are expected to increase in the second half of the year.
The Plastics business is now reflected under discontinued operations at our financial statements. The sale resulted in a charge of approximately $76 million in the second quarter. The bulk of this charge is related to goodwill impairment. For a complete summary of second quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release.
Turning to some key financial metrics. Interest expense in the quarter was up as expected due to the acquisition financing from last year's purchase of the four metal beverage plants. And an extra month of interest expense from carrying both the new bond issued in March and the 2012 notes we redeemed into April. We still anticipate full year interest expense to be approximately $140 million.
Given the improvement seen to date in our North American packaging operations, we expect the full year tax rate to be around 33%. At current exchange rates, year end net debt is expected to be approximately $2.4 billion, essentially where we ended 2009, or on a comparable basis, we're down over $200 million due to the AR securitization being reflected on the balance sheet. Even without the cash flow, we would have historically generated in the second half of the year from our Plastics business, we expect free cash flow to be approximately $0.5 billion in 2010, excluding the impact of the AR securitization coming out of the balance sheet.
As stated in this morning's press release, and as a result of our strong free cash flow, we expect to repurchase an excess of $400 million of our stock during 2010. As of today's conference call, we have acquired $250 million of stock this year. Our balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure are where we want to be, so expect us to return a majority of our free cash flow through share repurchases absent other significant strategic opportunities.
With that, I'll turn it over to John to talk more about the operations."

The optimism we felt heading into the busy summer season has materialized in the strong second quarter results. In our Metal Beverage Packaging Americas and Asia segment, profitability for the quarter exceeded our expectations with EBITDA of $114.5 million versus $74.8 million in the second quarter last year. This was driven largely by the impact of the acquired plants, excellent plant performance and strong volume trend in CSD  [carbonated soft drink], certain specialty sizes and the emerging Craft Beer category.
Key U.S. retailers led significant promotional activity around the Memorial Day holiday, and that activity provided a volume lift relative to our expectations throughout the quarter. These promotions were in place for the Fourth of July holiday as well, but it appears that they have subsided somewhat. Best practice sharing and plant floor information system upgrades continue to drive efficiency gains in our plants. Our strong position in the specialty can arena and focus on innovation are providing opportunities for our customers to launch new products in the U.S., and our ability to respond to the growing needs of the Craft Brewing segment, all have contributed to improving volume trends. 
In China, both the overall market, as well as Ball saw strong double-digit volume growth rates in the quarter. Herbal teas and beer demands continue to be the main catalyst behind the volume improvement. The newly acquired JFP plants will play a pivotal role in being able to supply the growing demand for beverage cans in Southern China. We have a variety of opportunities to improve this new facility without spending significant capital, and the payback will exceed Ball's hurdle rate by the year end 2011.
Double-digit volume growth continues in Brazil. We've had a very close relationships with established partners there for a long time, and the three plants in our joint venture are performing well. We continue to evaluate further growth opportunities in this region. But as always, we'll do it in conjunction with secured customer contracts.
In our European operations, trends are also positive. Results in the quarter were EBIT of $72.5 million versus $64.8 million in the second quarter last year, on volumes that were up mid-single digits percent. This was offset by lower export volume and a slight FX translation headwind, which Scott mentioned earlier. A rebound in specialty can demand also provided improved price cost mix for the quarter.
We mentioned in the news release encouraging signs in Germany for the return of the beverage can. Several significant discounters in Germany began relisting beverage cans in their outlets during the second quarter, which helped to increase the total industry can sales in that country by more than 30% year-to-date and more than 50% in the second quarter. Obviously, that is on a base smaller than what we would like, but it is another step forward and we continue to work with retailers and others to bring back this important market.
As in the Americas, Asia segment we expect earnings improvement albeit on a euro basis in 2010 in that segment. Our Food and Household Packaging Products segment continued to perform very well. Volumes in the food side of the business were up low- to mid-single digits in the quarter, with aerosol volumes experiencing mid- to high-single digits growth both for the industry as well as for Ball.
Second quarter year-over-year EBIT of $33.4 million versus $35.1 million was down slightly but against a difficult year-over-year comparison due to inventory holding gains recorded in the second quarter of 2009. The segment had another solid quarter due largely to excellent operating performance, product mix and the improved volume trends mentioned earlier.
While food volumes have also rebounded nicely, the fresh packed crops are behind schedule by a couple of weeks especially the tomato crop. That being said, the Food and Household segment is running ahead of expectations and all indications are that this segment will have another solid year in 2010. We'll just look for some cooperation from the weather as we head into the pack season.
Dave mentioned Neuman Aluminum. We acquired that business this week, and it is a great strategic addition to our Food and Household Packaging segment. Neuman supplies more than 90% of the aluminum discs, called slugs, used to make extruded aluminum bottles in North America. It brings us technology, an entry further up the supply chain into an adjacent market. Neuman isn't a big acquisition in terms of size but it fits well within our portfolio, and we intend to leverage its capabilities to help us grow this segment.
Aerospace segment second quarter earnings of $18.6 million were up from last year's $14.8 million on essentially flat revenue. Strong program performance on existing fixed priced programs made up most of the difference. As we have indicated throughout the year, recent contract wins will likely not have a big earnings impact in the second half of 2010, but they do firm up the backlog and set us up nicely going into 2011. Those glimmers of future contracts awards noted in the first quarter conference call are slowly starting to move forward through the process. So stay tuned as we progress through the year.
In summary, our plants are running very well, packaging volume trends continue to improve and numerous opportunities exist for us to prosecute prudently. We're in a strong position operationally as we head into the second half of the year and we will expect to see good momentum continue into 2011. Dave?"

We continue to seek opportunities for growth both organically and through acquisitions, rest assured that we're going to remain focused on maintaining our track record of disciplined, balanced capital deployment.
Last year, from continuing operations adjusted for the sale of the Plastics business, we made $3.92 for the full year. In the first half of this year, the comparable earnings were $2.25, a very strong performance. And we're going to do our best to meet or exceed the first half performance in the second half of 2010. 
And with that, Franz, I believe we're ready for questions."

I think we mentioned on the first quarter call that -- I'll talk North American first, North American beverage. We ran our business as a system, and we've had volumes moving around within our newly acquired facilities and our existing facilities. So it's difficult to separate out. Having said that, we acquired relatively full-out plants from Metal Container nine months ago or so. If you take those out of the equation, our remaining plants were about down 3% or so for the quarter. But as we also said in the first quarter, as we go into 2010 and '11, in 2010 we stepped back in terms of some of our volumes over the last 18 months or so related primarily to the plant closures, remember Kent, Washington and Kansas City among others, and we're trying to be a bit more disciplined. Having said that, going into 2011, we expect to be up relative to the market as we rebalance our customer portfolio. Over in Europe, some of the trends that we saw, certainly in Western Europe continued. It was up high single digits, I think in the 8% or so range. Eastern Europe was a bit soft, I think the economy is not improving in Eastern Europe relative to Western Europe and there's a bit of a lag there. But overall, we were up mid-single digits. Our exports remain a bit soft but some of our bigger markets including the Netherlands and the U.K. were up quite nicely and there's been good weather in Europe in addition to the World Cup. So we feel relatively constructive as we go into the second half of the year, that the trends we saw in the second quarter will continue."

And so as we go into 2011, I think the CSD and the beer people are looking at the value versus volume equation. We can tell you that the can had taken a little bit of share relative to other packaging substrates in some of those markets but I don't think any meaningful deviations have occurred. On the specialty side, we continue to see strong interest in a whole variety of different sizes. As you know, this year with the big CSD customer, we launched a 7.5-ounce container. We're seeing strong growth in some of the smaller sizes, as well as some of the larger sizes. Remember 2009, the larger sizes, largely on the energy drink side were impacted because of the housing downturn and the people were purchasing much less at the C-store [convenience store] level. We're seeing that starting to come back and so we continue to believe that our good position in the specialty side will continue to give us benefits as we go forward."

I don't have the exact numbers on, but the growth of the can in the Craft segment is quite strong. There's over 2,000 Craft brewers in America, but you're seeing a lot of the big ones to start to go in. Here in Colorado, there's New Belgium, there's Oskar Blues, that have really been pushing it strongly. We continue to see those trends improve, and in fact, several major publications over the last six months, there has been a various articles about the resurgence of cans as a premium package in the Craft Brewing segment. So I think all that chatter we hear from our various customers and new potential customers is bullish relative to Craft Beer going into cans."

We had a great plants. We did make money and we flow a lot of cash out of that business over the years that we had it.

Not that, that's our goal necessarily just to help our competitors or other companies, but it's a situation where we've got lots of good people in that business who worked really, really hard and the market just wasn't ever set up, so that we could earn. I think what you have to try to figure out is where you can have advantage in whatever you do. And in the kind of businesses that we're in, are slug it out, tough businesses. Cost is very important. You got to do everything as near perfectly as you can to satisfy customer need. But there's no doubt in my mind that we've got lots of opportunity now, particularly on the Metal side of the business all around the world. The things that we're looking at and the possibilities including organic growth, including acquisitions, and we're flowing lots of cash. The company's is in a wonderful shape.

Joining me on the call today is John Hayes, Ball's President, Chief  Operating Officer; and Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, Scott's going to comment on our financial performance for the quarter and for 2010, and then John will follow with details about our operating performance.
Ball reported strong second quarter results. Increasing volumes across our Packaging businesses, strong operating performance and positive contributions from the strategic actions we've been taking during the last couple of years led to our improved results. During the quarter we closed our acquisition of the JFP joint venture plan in China, and we announced our agreement to sell our Plastics business to Amcor for $280 million in cash.  We also increased our authorization to repurchase up to 12 million shares.
Also in the quarter, Ball published its second corporate sustainability report, highlighting progress on our goals in five key areas of focus which are: Packaging, energy, water and waste, safety and talent management. You can read the report and expand the details on ball.com.
Earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of Neuman Aluminum, the largest North American manufacturer of metal discs that are made into extruded aluminum bottles and containers used for personal care and beverage products. Well, we're very pleased with our strengthening performance this year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott."
170352,108735584,70676,"Ball Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Ball Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dave. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.38, well ahead of last year's $1.14, a more than 20% improvement.

Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.38, well ahead of last year's $1.14, a more than 20% improvement. Volume improvements in our Global Metal Packaging businesses, efficient plant operating performance and disciplined cost controls contributed to the improved results. These positive factors were offset somewhat by a higher interest cost, a higher effective tax rate. A weaker euro negatively impacted diluted earnings per share by $0.02 in the quarter and $0.06 year-to-date. At present rates, the FX headwinds are expected to increase in the second half of the year.
The Plastics business is now reflected under discontinued operations at our financial statements. The sale resulted in a charge of approximately $76 million in the second quarter. The bulk of this charge is related to goodwill impairment. For a complete summary of second quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release.
Turning to some key financial metrics. Interest expense in the quarter was up as expected due to the acquisition financing from last year's purchase of the four metal beverage plants. And an extra month of interest expense from carrying both the new bond issued in March and the 2012 notes we redeemed in April. We still anticipate full year interest expense to be approximately $140 million.
Given the improvement seen to date in our North American packaging operations, we expect the full year tax rate to be around 33%. At current exchange rates, year end net debt is expected to be approximately $2.4 billion, essentially where we ended 2009, though on a comparable basis, we're down over $200 million due to the AR securitization being reflected on the balance sheet. Even without the cash flow, we would have historically generated in the second half of the year from our Plastics business, we expect free cash flow to be approximately $0.5 billion in 2010, excluding the impact of the AR securitization coming out of the balance sheet.
As stated in this morning's press release, and as a result of our strong free cash flow, we expect to repurchase an excess of $400 million of our stock during 2010. As of today's conference call, we have acquired $250 million of stock this year. Our balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure are where we want to be, so expect us to return a majority of our free cash flow through share repurchases absent other significant strategic opportunities.
With that, I'll turn it over to John to talk more about the operations."
170352,108735584,70676,"Ball Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Ball Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Scott. The optimism we felt heading into the busy summer season has materialized in the strong second quarter results.

The optimism we felt heading into the busy summer season has materialized in the strong second quarter results. In our Metal Beverage Packaging Americas and Asia segment, profitability for the quarter exceeded our expectations with EBITDA of $114.5 million versus $74.8 million in the second quarter last year. This was driven largely by the impact of the acquired plants, excellent plant performance and strong volume trend in CSD  [carbonated soft drink], certain specialty sizes and the emerging Craft Beer category.
Key U.S. retailers led significant promotional activity around the Memorial Day holiday, and that activity provided a volume lift relative to our expectations throughout the quarter. These promotions were in place for the Fourth of July holiday as well, though it appears that they have subsided somewhat. Best practice sharing and plant floor information system upgrades continue to drive efficiency gains in our plants. Our strong position in the specialty can arena and focus on innovation are providing opportunities for our customers to launch new products in the U.S., and our ability to respond to the growing needs of the Craft Brewing segment, all have contributed to improving volume trends. 
In China, both the overall market, as well as Ball saw strong double-digit volume growth rates in the quarter. Herbal teas and beer demands continue to be the main catalyst behind the volume improvement. The newly acquired JFP plants will play a pivotal role in being able to supply the growing demand for beverage cans in Southern China. We have a variety of opportunities to improve this new facility without spending significant capital, and the payback will exceed Ball's hurdle rate by the year end 2011.
Double-digit volume growth continues in Brazil. We've had a very close relationships with established partners there for a long time, and the three plants in our joint venture are performing well. We continue to evaluate further growth opportunities in this region. But as always, we'll do it in conjunction with secured customer contracts.
In our European operations, trends are also positive. Results in the quarter were EBIT of $72.5 million versus $64.8 million in the second quarter last year, on volumes that were up mid-single digits percent. This was offset by lower export volume and a slight FX translation headwind, which Scott mentioned earlier. A rebound in specialty can demand also provided improved price cost mix for the quarter.
We mentioned in the news release encouraging signs in Germany for the return of the beverage can. Several significant discounters in Germany began relisting beverage cans in their outlets during the second quarter, which helped to increase the total industry can sales in that country by more than 30% year-to-date and more than 50% in the second quarter. Obviously, that is on a base smaller than what we would like, but it is another step forward and we continue to work with retailers and others to bring back this important market.
As in the Americas/Asia segment we expect earnings improvement albeit on a euro basis in 2010 in that segment. Our Food and Household Packaging Products segment continue to perform very well. Volumes in the food side of the business were up low- to mid-single digits in the quarter, with aerosol volumes experiencing mid- to high-single digits growth both for the industry as well as for Ball.
Second quarter year-over-year EBIT of $33.4 million versus $35.1 million was down slightly but against a difficult year-over-year comparison due to inventory holding gains recorded in the second quarter of 2009. The segment had another solid quarter due largely to excellent operating performance, product mix and the improved volume trends mentioned earlier.
While food volumes have also rebounded nicely, the fresh packed crops are behind schedule by a couple of weeks especially the tomato crop. That being said, the Food and Household segment is running ahead of expectations and all indications are that this segment will have another solid year in 2010. We'll just look for some cooperation from the weather as we head into the pack season.
Dave mentioned Neuman Aluminum. We acquired that business this week, and it is a great strategic addition to our Food and Household Packaging segment. Neuman supplies more than 90% of the aluminum discs, called slugs, used to make extruded aluminum bottles in North America. It brings us technology, an entry further up the supply chain into an adjacent market. Neuman isn't a big acquisition in terms of size but it fits well within our portfolio, and we intend to leverage its capabilities to help us grow this segment.
Aerospace segment second quarter earnings of $18.6 million were up from last year's $14.8 million on essentially flat revenue. Strong program performance on existing fixed priced programs made up most of the difference. As we have indicated throughout the year, recent contract wins will likely not have a big earnings impact in the second half of 2010, but they do firm up the backlog and set us up nicely going into 2011. Those glimmers of future contracts awards noted in the first quarter conference call are slowly starting to move forward through the process. So stay tuned as we progress through the year.
In summary, our plants are running very well, packaging volume trends continue to improve and numerous opportunities exist for us to prosecute prudently. We're in a strong position operationally as we head into the second half of the year and we'll expect to see good momentum continue into 2011. Dave?"

We're pleased with our performance so far this year and while we expect the positive momentum to continue, we recognize that the world economy still faces challenges. But so far, so good for Ball. We continue to seek opportunities for growth both organically and through acquisition, rest assured that we're going to remain focused on maintaining our track record of disciplined, balanced capital deployment.
Last year, from continuing operations adjusted for the sale of the Plastics business, we made $3.92 for the full year. In the first half of this year, the comparable earnings were $2.25, a very strong performance. And we're going to do our best to meet or exceed the first half performance in the second half of 2010. 
And with that, Franz, I believe we're ready for questions."

I think we mentioned on the first quarter call that -- I'll talk North American first, North American beverage. We ran our business as a system, and we've had volumes moving around within our newly acquired facilities and our existing facilities. So it's difficult to separate out. Having said that, we acquired relatively full-out plants from Metal Container nine months ago or so. If you take those out of the equation, our remaining plants were about down 3% or so for the quarter. But as we also said in the first quarter, as we go into 2010 and '11, in 2010 we stepped back in terms of some of our volumes over the last 18 months or so related primarily to the plant closures, remember Kent, Washington and Kansas City among others, and we're trying to be a bit more disciplined. Having said that, going into 2011, we expect to be up relative to the market as we rebalance our customer portfolio. Over in Europe, some of the trends that we saw, certainly in Western Europe continued. It was up high single digits, I think in the 8% or so range. Eastern Europe was a bit soft, I think the economy is not improving in Eastern Europe relative to Western Europe and there's a bit of a lag there. But overall, we were up mid-single digits. Our exports remain a bit soft but some of our bigger markets including the Netherlands and the U.K. were up quite nicely and there's been good weather in Europe in addition to the World Cup. So we feel relatively constructive as we go into the second half of the year, that the trends we saw in the second quarter will continue."

And so as we go into 2011, I think the CSD and the beer people are looking at the value versus volume equation. We can tell you that the can had taken a little bit of share relative to other packaging substrates in some of those markets but I don't think any meaningful deviations have occurred. On the specialty side, we continue to see strong interest in a whole variety of different sizes. As you know, this year with the big CSD customer, we launched a 7.5-ounce container. We're seeing strong growth in some of the smaller sizes, as well as some of the larger sizes. Remember 2009, the larger sizes, largely on the energy drink side were impacted because of the housing downturn and the people were purchasing much less at the C-store [convenience store] level. We're seeing that starting to come back and so we continue to believe that our good position in the specialty side will continue to give us benefits as we go forward."

And if there's real growth opportunities, we might look at doing something else if we need to. In Europe, I think, I mentioned it before, other than 33 and 50s, it has been growing more than 2x the overall growth.

The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ in the company's latest 10-Q and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. And if you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website.
Joining me this morning on the call is John Hayes, our Chief Operating Officer and President; and Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. And in a moment, Scott's going to talk about our financial results for the quarter and for 2010, and then John will follow with details about the operating performance.
While Ball reported strong third quarter results due largely to excellent operating performance and the impact of strategic actions taken during the last year or so. In addition, to improve results, key achievements in the third quarter included the sale of the Plastics business, the acquisition of Neuman Aluminum and announcement about the consolidation of our salmon can production, the acquisition of an incremental 10.1% of our Brazilian beverage can joint venture and an announcement that we were expanding on production of our commercially successful Alumi-Tek bottle to meet customer demand.
Also and importantly, Ball aerospace won significant new business increasing our backlog to $852 million at the end of the quarter, up from $539 million at the end of the second quarter of 2010. And after that active quarter, we had significant opportunities in front of us to improve performance and carry momentum into 2011 and beyond. 
Well I'll turn it over to Scott to talk about the quarter, and then as I said, John will provide color on our operations before I address our outlook. Scott?"

Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were at $1.40, well ahead of last year's $1.21.

Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were at $1.40, well ahead of last year's $1.21. 
The following factors contributed to improved results: positive impact from the four acquired beverage can plants, volume improvement that our global Metal Packaging businesses, exceptional operating performance in our various businesses. These positive factors were offset somewhat by a $5 million increase quarter-to-quarter in G&A, primarily due to compensation costs. Purchase accounting and other costs associated with Brazil totaled approximately $5 million, and we had higher interest expense also related to Brazil. 
During the quarter, the company realized an $80 million gain on the consolidation of our Brazilian joint venture, which is recorded in equity earnings. A 10% weaker Euro negatively impacted diluted earnings per share by $0.07 in the quarter and $0.13 year-to-date. For a complete summary of third quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release.
Turning to some key financial metrics. Interest expense in the quarter was up as expected due to the acquisition financing from last year's purchase of the four metal beverage plants and two months of interest expense from debt consolidated from Brazil. We now anticipate full year interest expense to be in the range of $145 million on a comparable basis and the full year effective tax rate on continuing operations should be in the range of 31%.
At current exchange rates, year end net debt is expected to be approximately $2.5 billion, or roughly $100 million reduction from 2009 taken into account the $250 million outstanding under the company's AR securitization program in 2009. 
Given the growth opportunities before the company and the consolidation of Brazil, we see full year CapEx approaching $300 million. However, free cash flow is expected to be at least $500 million, excluding the impact of the AR securitization coming on the balance sheet. We continue to be focused on returning value to shareholders. Our plan is to repurchase more than a net $400 million of our stock for 2010, and that's on track. 
With that, I'll turn it over to John to talk more about the operations."
170352,113905536,82900,"Ball Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Ball Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Scott. In the third quarter, our businesses performed very well across-the-board with EBIT in every segment up year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Comparable results for the quarter in our Metal Beverage Packaging Americas and Asia segm",777,"Thanks, Scott. In the third quarter, our businesses performed very well across-the-board with EBIT in every segment up year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. 
Comparable results for the quarter in our Metal Beverage Packaging Americas and Asia segment were up nearly 10% with EBIT of $112.8 million versus $102.9 million in the third quarter last year. This increase was driven largely by the impact of the acquired plants, strong volume growth in emerging markets and growth of certain specialty can sizes, offset by previously disclosed unfavorable volume comparisons in our legacy 12-ounce business and the impact of purchase accounting and other costs associated with consolidating Brazil into the segment that Scott referenced earlier. 
In North America, Ball's legacy volumes were down mid-single digits versus a flat overall market. Something we mentioned would happen during 2010 before a step-up in volume in 2011. As we described in the second quarter conference call, the strong promotional activity we saw in the early part of the summer subsided after the Fourth of July holiday, while in the Beer segment, cans continue to take share from other packaging types as consumers focused on value. Ready-to-drink treat teas and energy drinks continue to grow relative to a soft 2009.
Given the growth in Specialty Beverage cans, capital will be deployed to meet customers' needs. Our recent announcement to install a second Alumi-Tek bottle can line in North America is an example of the type of projects that will benefit us in 2011 and beyond. We continue to monitor C store trends where certain single-served product categories are growing upwards of 10%. In Brazil, we continue to see strong growth in demand driven by overall growth beer growth and beverage can share gains. We remain optimistic about our growth and future profitability in Brazil. 
In China, herbal teas and beer demand, as well as packaged share gains by two-piece beverage cans over three-piece cans and glass continue to be the main catalyst behind strong volume improvement. We're expanding output in our recently acquired Foshan plant in order to meet demand for beverage cans in Southern China and have many exciting opportunities in the future.
In our European operations, third quarter EBIT was $63.1 million versus $68.8 million in the third quarter last year. Volumes in Europe were up mid-single digits and excellent cost controls and plant efficiencies were offset by lower-than-anticipated export volume and the FX translation headwind that Scott mentioned earlier. 
On a Euro basis, Europe's earnings were up in the quarter versus last year. The momentum in the German beverage can market recovery continues. Total industry can sales in Germany were up more than 56% in the quarter versus third quarter 2009 and 41% year-to-date versus last year. We remain bullish on recent trends in Germany. And as you know, Ball is well positioned to benefit from the continuing return of the Can in that market. 
Our Food and Household Products segment had an excellent quarter, given the early end to the seasonal fruit and vegetable harvest in the Midwest. Volumes in this segment were down mid-single digits during the period. Third quarter EBIT of $49.4 million was up significantly versus the $27.8 million recorded in the third quarter of 2009, excellent operating performance. Our plants are doing a tremendous job and better mix contributed to better results.
During the quarter, we integrated the Neuman Aluminum acquisition into the segment. The integration went extremely well and the collaboration was excellent. We will leverage this business capabilities as we continue to assess opportunities to broaden our product line within the Food and Household and Beverage segments. 
Aerospace had a strong quarter with EBIT of $18.4 million versus $16.2 million a year ago on essentially flat revenue. Exceptional program performance and on-orbit completion awards favorably impacted the quarter. While the recent wins in our Aerospace business were contemplated, as you know, we had mentioned that we were ahead a number of irons [ph] in the fire, it is gratifying to see some of them come to fruition, and we still have good opportunities for additional wins in the future. 
As Dave mentioned, backlog is up significantly, which sets us up nicely going into 2011 and beyond. The recently awarded JPSS and WorldView-3 contracts, as well as others, are multi-year programs that will ramp up during 2011 allowing for more meaningful earnings impact being recorded in 2012. 
So in summary, our operations are in a strong position as we approach the end of 2010 and continued execution of selected opportunities as we move forward will only add to our strong base. 
And with that, we'll turn it over to Dave to wrap it up. Dave?"

Typically, when we perform well, that bodes well for us. You had mentioned investment. I don't think we anticipate much investment, if you will, in that business. Yes, we're making sure we have the right skill set of people, but as many of our successful programs are rolling off this year and we're building the ones next year, we are going to have higher sales in that business. Most likely, are going to have higher profits in that business, but the margin is probably going to be a little bit more muted just because there's mix of starting programs versus finishing successful programs.

But in terms of absolute EBIT dollars, we, the guys have been doing a great job. We've gotten to the targets, we think, we can achieve. Is there some upside? There's always some upside. You're never perfect, but it is where we think it should have been when we made the U.S. can acquisition. As we go forward in terms of steel, it remains to be seen. What happens there, one of the issues around processed food is the Steel Food Can has a big installed-base in terms of processing. And for our customers to recapitalize that, that is a significant capital throw. And so yes, we always are concerned about substitution and talk with our suppliers all the time about being penny-wise and pound-foolish.

The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ in the company's latest 10-Q and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. And if you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website.
Joining me this morning on the call is John Hayes, our Chief Operating Officer and President; and Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. And in a moment, Scott's going to talk about our financial results for the quarter and for 2010, and then John will follow with details about the operating performance.
While Ball reported strong third quarter results due largely to excellent operating performance and the impact of strategic actions taken during the last year or so. In addition, to improve results, key achievements in the third quarter included the sale of the Plastics business, the acquisition of Neuman Aluminum and announcement about the consolidation of our salmon can production, the acquisition of an incremental 10.1% of our Brazilian beverage can joint venture and an announcement that we were expanding on production of our commercially successful Alumi-Tek bottle to meet customer demand.
Also and importantly, Ball aerospace won significant new business increasing our backlog to $852 million at the end of the quarter, up from $539 million at the end of the second quarter of 2010. And after that active quarter, we had significant opportunities in front of us to improve performance and carry momentum into 2011 and beyond. 
Well I'll turn it over to Scott to talk about the quarter, and then as I said, John will provide color on our operations before I address our outlook. Scott?

These positive factors were offset somewhat by a $5 million increase quarter-to-quarter in G&A, primarily due to compensation costs. Purchase accounting and other costs associated with Brazil totaled approximately $5 million, and we had higher interest expense also related to Brazil. 
During the quarter, the company realized an $80 million gain on the consolidation of our Brazilian joint venture, which is recorded in equity earnings. A 10% weaker Euro negatively impacted diluted earnings per share by $0.07 in the quarter and $0.13 year-to-date. For a complete summary of third quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release.
Turning to some key financial metrics. Interest expense in the quarter was up as expected due to the acquisition financing from last year's purchase of the four metal beverage plants and two months of interest expense from debt consolidated from Brazil. We now anticipate full year interest expense to be in the range of $145 million on a comparable basis and the full year effective tax rate on continuing operations should be in the range of 31%.
At current exchange rates, year end net debt is expected to be approximately $2.5 billion, or roughly $100 million reduction from 2009 taken into account the $250 million outstanding under the company's AR securitization program in 2009. 
Given the growth opportunities before the company and the consolidation of Brazil, we see full year CapEx approaching $300 million. However, free cash flow is expected to be at least $500 million, excluding the impact of the AR securitization coming on the balance sheet. We continue to be focused on returning value to shareholders. Our plan is to repurchase more than a net $400 million of our stock for 2010, and that's on track. 
With that, I'll turn it over to John to talk more about the operations.

170352,113905536,82916,"Ball Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Ball Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Scott. In the third quarter, our businesses performed very well across-the-board with EBIT in every segment up year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Comparable results for the quarter in our Metal Beverage Packaging Americas and Asia segm",777,"Thanks, Scott. In the third quarter, our businesses performed very well across-the-board with EBIT in every segment up year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. 
Comparable results for the quarter in our Metal Beverage Packaging Americas and Asia segment were up nearly 10% with EBIT of $112.8 million versus $102.9 million in the third quarter last year. This increase was driven largely by the impact of the acquired plants, strong volume growth in emerging markets and growth of certain specialty can sizes, offset by previously disclosed unfavorable volume comparisons in our legacy 12-ounce business and the impact of purchase accounting and other costs associated with consolidating Brazil into the segment that Scott referenced earlier. 
In North America, Ball's legacy volumes were down mid-single digits versus a flat overall market. Something we mentioned would happen during 2010 before a step-up in volume in 2011. As we described in the second quarter conference call, the strong promotional activity we saw in the early part of the summer subsided after the Fourth of July holiday, while in the Beer segment, cans continue to take share from other packaging types as consumers focused on value. Ready-to-drink treat teas and energy drinks continue to grow relative to a soft 2009.
Given the growth in Specialty Beverage cans, capital will be deployed to meet customers' needs. Our recent announcement to install a second Alumi-Tek bottle can line in North America is an example of the type of projects that will benefit us in 2011 and beyond. We continue to monitor C store trends where certain single-served product categories are growing upwards of 10%. In Brazil, we continue to see strong growth in demand driven by overall growth beer growth and beverage can share gains. We remain optimistic about our growth and future profitability in Brazil. 
In China, herbal teas and beer demand, as well as packaged share gains by two-piece beverage cans over three-piece cans and glass continue to be the main catalyst behind strong volume improvement. We're expanding output in our recently acquired Foshan plant in order to meet demand for beverage cans in Southern China and have many exciting opportunities in the future.
In our European operations, third quarter EBIT was $63.1 million versus $68.8 million in the third quarter last year. Volumes in Europe were up mid-single digits and excellent cost controls and plant efficiencies were offset by lower-than-anticipated export volume and the FX translation headwind that Scott mentioned earlier. 
On a Euro basis, Europe's earnings were up in the quarter versus last year. The momentum in the German beverage can market recovery continues. Total industry can sales in Germany were up more than 56% in the quarter versus third quarter 2009 and 41% year-to-date versus last year. We remain bullish on recent trends in Germany. And as you know, Ball is well positioned to benefit from the continuing return of the Can in that market. 
Our Food and Household Products segment had an excellent quarter, given the early end to the seasonal fruit and vegetable harvest in the Midwest. Volumes in this segment were down mid-single digits during the period. Third quarter EBIT of $49.4 million was up significantly versus the $27.8 million recorded in the third quarter of 2009, excellent operating performance. Our plants are doing a tremendous job and better mix contributed to better results.
During the quarter, we integrated the Neuman Aluminum acquisition into the segment. The integration went extremely well and the collaboration was excellent. We will leverage this business capabilities as we continue to assess opportunities to broaden our product line within the Food and Household and Beverage segments. 
Aerospace had a strong quarter with EBIT of $18.4 million versus $16.2 million a year ago on essentially flat revenue. Exceptional program performance and on-orbit completion awards favorably impacted the quarter. While the recent wins in our Aerospace business were contemplated, as you know, we had mentioned that we were ahead a number of irons [ph] in the fire, it is gratifying to see some of them come to fruition, and we still have good opportunities for additional wins in the future. 
As Dave mentioned, backlog is up significantly, which sets us up nicely going into 2011 and beyond. The recently awarded JPSS and WorldView-3 contracts, as well as others, are multi-year programs that will ramp up during 2011 allowing for more meaningful earnings impact being recorded in 2012. 
So in summary, our operations are in a strong position as we approach the end of 2010 and continued execution of selected opportunities as we move forward will only add to our strong base. 
And with that, we'll turn it over to Dave to wrap it up. Dave?

I think David mentioned earlier, historically we do the full spectrum, everything from cost plus to firm fix price and sometimes cost plus with the success fee and it goes everything from one end to the other. I think as we look forward to some of the projects that we've won, they are a little bit more biased towards fixed price and they are cost plus. Typically, when we perform well, that bodes well for us. You had mentioned investment. I don't think we anticipate much investment, if you will, in that business. Yes, we're making sure we have the right skill set of people, but as many of our successful programs are rolling off this year and we're building the ones next year, we are going to have higher sales in that business. Most likely, are going to have higher profits in that business, but the margin is probably going to be a little bit more muted just because there's mix of starting programs versus finishing successful programs. But again, nothing to worry about it. And as we go into 2012, as we execute on these programs, we feel very good about where we stand with that business.

And we have a tech services part of the business for our software people that work in DoD. And both of those are well above $100 million of sales for each of them, so out of the total. And even through this period where the Hardware business was down a little bit, they've been continuing to grow and certainly contribute to the success. We contract both the civil and DoD and some commercial work, but that's sort of the mix of business. I think we used to talk over time if we're when our game and sort of the cost-type work, we should be able to make 8% or so. In the fixed price, we're going to make a little more than that because it would take a little more risk. And you can look at the numbers and see that, that's kind of the year we're having.

What we endeavor to do is pass forth all the price increases on the steel side of the business. So it's always tough to talk about margins in a business in which that's a business model. But in terms of absolute EBIT dollars, we, the guys have been doing a great job. We've gotten to the targets, we think, we can achieve. Is there some upside? There's always some upside. You're never perfect, but it is where we think it should have been when we made the U.S. can acquisition. As we go forward in terms of steel, it remains to be seen. What happens there, one of the issues around processed food is the Steel Food Can has a big installed-base in terms of processing. And for our customers to recapitalize that, that is a significant capital throw. And so yes, we always are concerned about substitution and talk with our suppliers all the time about being penny-wise and pound-foolish. But on the other hand, we haven't seen to date any meaningful change in package share mix in the food can market or in the Food market, I should say.

The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ in the company's latest 10-Q and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. And if you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website.
Joining me this morning on the call is John Hayes, our Chief Operating Officer and President; and Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. And in a moment, Scott's going to talk about our financial results for the quarter and for 2010, and then John will follow with details about the operating performance.
While Ball reported strong third quarter results due largely to excellent operating performance and the impact of strategic actions taken during the last year or so. In addition, to improve results, key achievements in the third quarter included the sale of the Plastics business, the acquisition of Neuman Aluminum and announcement about the consolidation of our salmon can production, the acquisition of an incremental 10.1% of our Brazilian beverage can joint venture and an announcement that we were expanding on production of our commercially successful Alumi-Tek bottle to meet customer demand.
Also and importantly, Ball aerospace won significant new business increasing our backlog to $852 million at the end of the quarter, up from $539 million at the end of the second quarter of 2010. And after that active quarter, we had significant opportunities in front of us to improve performance and carry momentum into 2011 and beyond. 
Well I'll turn it over to Scott to talk about the quarter, and then as I said, John will provide color on our operations before I address our outlook. Scott?"
170352,113905536,82968,"Ball Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Ball Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dave. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were at $1.40, well ahead of last year's $1.21.

Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were at $1.40, well ahead of last year's $1.21. 
The following factors contributed to improved results: positive impact from the four acquired beverage can plants, volume improvement that our global Metal Packaging businesses, exceptional operating performance in our various businesses. These positive factors were offset somewhat by a $5 million increase quarter-to-quarter in G&A, primarily due to compensation costs. Purchase accounting and other costs associated with Brazil totaled approximately $5 million, and we had higher interest expense also related to Brazil. 
During the quarter, the company realized an $80 million gain on the consolidation of our Brazilian joint venture, which is recorded in equity earnings. A 10% weaker Euro negatively impacted diluted earnings per share by $0.07 in the quarter and $0.13 year-to-date. For a complete summary of third quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release.
Turning to some key financial metrics. Interest expense in the quarter was up as expected due to the acquisition financing from last year's purchase of the four metal beverage plants and two months of interest expense from debt consolidated from Brazil. We now anticipate full year interest expense to be in the range of $145 million on a comparable basis and the full year effective tax rate on continuing operations should be in the range of 31%.
At current exchange rates, year end net debt is expected to be approximately $2.5 billion, a roughly $100 million reduction from 2009 taken into account the $250 million outstanding under the company's AR securitization program in 2009. 
Given the growth opportunities before the company and the consolidation of Brazil, we see full year CapEx approaching $300 million. However, free cash flow is expected to be at least $500 million, excluding the impact of the AR securitization coming on the balance sheet. We continue to be focused on returning value to shareholders. Our plan is to repurchase more than a net $400 million of our stock for 2010, and that's on track. 
With that, I'll turn it over to John to talk more about the operations."
170352,113905536,82968,"Ball Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Ball Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Scott. In the third quarter, our businesses performed very well across-the-board with EBIT in every segment up year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Comparable results for the quarter in our Metal Beverage Packaging Americas and Asia segm",776,"Thanks, Scott. In the third quarter, our businesses performed very well across-the-board with EBIT in every segment up year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. 
Comparable results for the quarter in our Metal Beverage Packaging Americas and Asia segment were up nearly 10% with EBIT of $112.8 million versus $102.9 million in the third quarter last year. This increase was driven largely by the impact of the acquired plants, strong volume growth in emerging markets and growth of certain specialty can sizes, offset by previously disclosed unfavorable volume comparisons in our legacy 12-ounce business and the impact of purchase accounting and other costs associated with consolidating Brazil into the segment that Scott referenced earlier. 
In North America, Ball's legacy volumes were down mid-single digits versus a flat overall market. Something we mentioned would happen during 2010 before a step-up in volume in 2011. As we described in the second quarter conference call, the strong promotional activity we saw in the early part of the summer subsided after the Fourth of July holiday, while in the Beer segment, cans continue to take share from other packaging types as consumers focused on value. Ready-to-drink treat teas and energy drinks continue to grow relative to a soft 2009.
Given the growth in Specialty Beverage cans, capital will be deployed to meet customers' needs. Our recent announcement to install a second Alumi-Tek bottle can line in North America is an example of the type of projects that will benefit us in 2011 and beyond. We continue to monitor, see store trends where certain single-served product categories are growing upwards of 10%. In Brazil, we continue to see strong growth in demand driven by overall growth beer growth and beverage can share gains. We remain optimistic about our growth and future profitability in Brazil. 
In China, herbal teas and beer demand, as well as packaged share gains by two-piece beverage cans over three-piece cans and glass continue to be the main catalyst behind strong volume improvement. We're expanding output in our recently acquired Foshan plant in order to meet demand for beverage cans in Southern China and have many exciting opportunities in the future.
In our European operations, third quarter EBIT was $63.1 million versus $68.8 million in the third quarter last year. Volumes in Europe were up mid-single digits and excellent cost controls and plant efficiencies were offset by lower-than-anticipated export volume and the FX translation headwind that Scott mentioned earlier. 
On a Euro basis, Europe's earnings were up in the quarter versus last year. The momentum in the German beverage can market recovery continues. Total industry can sales in Germany were up more than 56% in the quarter versus third quarter 2009 and 41% year-to-date versus last year. We remain bullish on recent trends in Germany. And as you know, Ball is well positioned to benefit from the continuing return of the can in that market. 
Our Food and Household Products segment had an excellent quarter, given the early end to the seasonal fruit and vegetable harvest in the Midwest. Volumes in this segment were down mid-single digits during the period. Third quarter EBIT of $49.4 million was up significantly versus the $27.8 million recorded in the third quarter of 2009, excellent operating performance. Our plants are doing a tremendous job and better mix contributed to better results.
During the quarter, we integrated the Neuman Aluminum acquisition into the segment. The integration went extremely well and the collaboration was excellent. We will leverage this business’ capabilities as we continue to assess opportunities to broaden our product line within the Food and Household and Beverage segments. 
Aerospace had a strong quarter with EBIT of $18.4 million versus $16.2 million a year ago on essentially flat revenue. Exceptional program performance and on-orbit completion awards favorably impacted the quarter. While the recent wins in our Aerospace business were contemplated, as you know, we had mentioned that we were ahead a number of irons in the fire, it is gratifying to see some of them come to fruition, and we still have good opportunities for additional wins in the future. 
As Dave mentioned, backlog is up significantly, which sets us up nicely going into 2011 and beyond. The recently awarded JPSS and WorldView-3 contracts, as well as others, are multi-year programs that will ramp up during 2011 allowing for more meaningful earnings impact being recorded in 2012. 
So in summary, our operations are in a strong position as we approach the end of 2010 and continued execution of selected opportunities as we move forward will only add to our strong base. 
And with that, we'll turn it over to Dave to wrap it up. Dave?"

The other thing is that some of the programs that we're getting involved with, like the national weather satellites and so forth, there's a continuous kind of need in their long-term operational programs. And some that we can't talk about, but they're just a real good basic business for our company. We had it on our board meeting yesterday, a discussion about this. And we had a number of pretty good growth years, a couple of years ago then we had a bit of a dip through the last year or so. I think and hope that we're back on the kind of trajectory we were. So I don't know that we would project above double digits or single-digit growth over time, but it could happen. I mean the business, a decade ago, was 10% of the company when we were $3 billion, and it's still 10% of the company when we're $8 billion. And so it is at a pretty good growth trajectory during that time. We think it will continue."

You're never perfect, but it is where we think it should have been when we made the U.S. can acquisition. As we go forward in terms of steel, it remains to be seen. What happens there, one of the issues around process food is the Steel Food Can has a big installed-base in terms of processing. And for our customers to recapitalize that, that is a significant capital throw. And so yes, we always are concerned about substitution and talk with our suppliers all the time about being penny-wise and pound-foolish.

The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ in the company's latest 10-Q and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. And if you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website.
Joining me this morning on the call is John Hayes, our Chief Operating Officer and President; and Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. And in a moment, Scott's going to talk about our financial results for the quarter and for 2010, and then John will follow with details about the operating performance.
While Ball reported strong third quarter results due largely to excellent operating performance and the impact of strategic actions taken during the last year or so. In addition, to improve results, key achievements in the third quarter included the sale of the Plastics business, the acquisition of Neuman Aluminum and announcement about the consolidation of our salmon can production, the acquisition of an incremental 10.1% of our Brazilian beverage can joint venture and an announcement that we were expanding on production of our commercially successful Alumi-Tek bottle to meet customer demand.
Also and importantly, Ball aerospace won significant new business increasing our backlog to $852 million at the end of the quarter, up from $539 million at the end of the second quarter of 2010. And after that active quarter, we had significant opportunities in front of us to improve performance and carry momentum into 2011 and beyond. 
Well I'll turn it over to Scott to talk about the quarter, and then as I said, John will provide color on our operations before I address our outlook. Scott?"

Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were at $1.40, well ahead of last year's $1.21. 
The following factors contributed to improved results: positive impact from the four acquired beverage can plants, volume improvement that our global Metal Packaging businesses, exceptional operating performance in our various businesses. These positive factors were offset somewhat by a $5 million increase quarter-to-quarter in G&A, primarily due to compensation costs. Purchase accounting and other costs associated with Brazil totaled approximately $5 million, and we had higher interest expense also related to Brazil. 
During the quarter, the company realized an $80 million gain on the consolidation of our Brazilian joint venture, which is recorded in equity earnings. A 10% weaker Euro negatively impacted diluted earnings per share by $0.07 in the quarter and $0.13 year-to-date. For a complete summary of third quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release.
Turning to some key financial metrics. Interest expense in the quarter was up as expected due to the acquisition financing from last year's purchase of the four metal beverage plants and two months of interest expense from debt consolidated from Brazil. We now anticipate full year interest expense to be in the range of $145 million on a comparable basis and the full year effective tax rate on continuing operations should be in the range of 31%.
At current exchange rates, year end net debt is expected to be approximately $2.5 billion, a roughly $100 million reduction from 2009 taken into account the $250 million outstanding under the company's AR securitization program in 2009. 
Given the growth opportunities before the company and the consolidation of Brazil, we see full year CapEx approaching $300 million. However, free cash flow is expected to be at least $500 million, excluding the impact of the AR securitization coming on the balance sheet. We continue to be focused on returning value to shareholders. Our plan is to repurchase more than a net $400 million of our stock for 2010, and that's on track. 
With that, I'll turn it over to John to talk more about the operations."
170352,113905536,83428,"Ball Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Ball Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Scott. In the third quarter, our businesses performed very well across-the-board with EBIT in every segment up year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Comparable results for the quarter in our Metal Beverage Packaging Americas and Asia segm",776,"Thanks, Scott. In the third quarter, our businesses performed very well across-the-board with EBIT in every segment up year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. 
Comparable results for the quarter in our Metal Beverage Packaging Americas and Asia segment were up nearly 10% with EBIT of $112.8 million versus $102.9 million in the third quarter last year. This increase was driven largely by the impact of the acquired plants, strong volume growth in emerging markets and growth of certain specialty can sizes, offset by previously disclosed unfavorable volume comparisons in our legacy 12-ounce business and the impact of purchase accounting and other costs associated with consolidating Brazil into the segment that Scott referenced earlier. 
In North America, Ball's legacy volumes were down mid-single digits versus a flat overall market. Something we mentioned would happen during 2010 before a step-up in volume in 2011. As we described in the second quarter conference call, the strong promotional activity we saw in the early part of the summer subsided after the Fourth of July holiday, while in the Beer segment, cans continue to take share from other packaging types as consumers focused on value. Ready-to-drink treat teas and energy drinks continue to grow relative to a soft 2009.
Given the growth in Specialty Beverage cans, capital will be deployed to meet customers' needs. Our recent announcement to install a second Alumi-Tek bottle can line in North America is an example of the type of projects that will benefit us in 2011 and beyond. We continue to monitor, see store trends where certain single-served product categories are growing upwards of 10%. In Brazil, we continue to see strong growth in demand driven by overall growth beer growth and beverage can share gains. We remain optimistic about our growth and future profitability in Brazil. 
In China, herbal teas and beer demand, as well as packaged share gains by two-piece beverage cans over three-piece cans and glass continue to be the main catalyst behind strong volume improvement. We're expanding output in our recently acquired Foshan plant in order to meet demand for beverage cans in Southern China and have many exciting opportunities in the future.
In our European operations, third quarter EBIT was $63.1 million versus $68.8 million in the third quarter last year. Volumes in Europe were up mid-single digits and excellent cost controls and plant efficiencies were offset by lower-than-anticipated export volume and the FX translation headwind that Scott mentioned earlier. 
On a Euro basis, Europe's earnings were up in the quarter versus last year. The momentum in the German beverage can market recovery continues. Total industry can sales in Germany were up more than 56% in the quarter versus third quarter 2009 and 41% year-to-date versus last year. We remain bullish on recent trends in Germany. And as you know, Ball is well positioned to benefit from the continuing return of the can in that market. 
Our Food and Household Products segment had an excellent quarter, given the early end to the seasonal fruit and vegetable harvest in the Midwest. Volumes in this segment were down mid-single digits during the period. Third quarter EBIT of $49.4 million was up significantly versus the $27.8 million recorded in the third quarter of 2009, excellent operating performance. Our plants are doing a tremendous job and better mix contributed to better results.
During the quarter, we integrated the Neuman Aluminum acquisition into the segment. The integration went extremely well and the collaboration was excellent. We will leverage this business’ capabilities as we continue to assess opportunities to broaden our product line within the Food and Household and Beverage segments. 
Aerospace had a strong quarter with EBIT of $18.4 million versus $16.2 million a year ago on essentially flat revenue. Exceptional program performance and on-orbit completion awards favorably impacted the quarter. While the recent wins in our Aerospace business were contemplated, as you know, we had mentioned that we were ahead a number of irons in the fire, it is gratifying to see some of them come to fruition, and we still have good opportunities for additional wins in the future. 
As Dave mentioned, backlog is up significantly, which sets us up nicely going into 2011 and beyond. The recently awarded JPSS and WorldView-3 contracts, as well as others, are multi-year programs that will ramp up during 2011 allowing for more meaningful earnings impact being recorded in 2012. 
So in summary, our operations are in a strong position as we approach the end of 2010 and continued execution of selected opportunities as we move forward will only add to our strong base. 
And with that, we'll turn it over to Dave to wrap it up. Dave?"

This is the third in a series of satellites that we've built. It will ramp up starting kind of now and through next year, I don't really know when the peak employment will be, but probably not even next year. And so that gives you an idea of how these work. It's going to take a few years to build at least the initial parts of these. The other thing is that some of the programs that we're getting involved with, like the national weather satellites and so forth, there's a continuous kind of need in their long-term operational programs. And some that we can't talk about, but they're just a real good basic business for our company. We had it on our board meeting yesterday, a discussion about this. And we had a number of pretty good growth years, a couple of years ago then we had a bit of a dip through the last year or so. I think and hope that we're back on the kind of trajectory we were. So I don't know that we would project above double digits or single-digit growth over time, but it could happen. I mean the business, a decade ago, was 10% of the company when we were $3 billion, and it's still 10% of the company when we're $8 billion. And so it is at a pretty good growth trajectory during that time. We think it will continue."

You're never perfect, but it is where we think it should have been when we made the U.S. can acquisition. As we go forward in terms of steel, it remains to be seen. What happens there, one of the issues around process food is the Steel Food Can has a big installed-base in terms of processing. And for our customers to recapitalize that, that is a significant capital throw.

The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ in the company's latest 10-Q and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. And if you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website.
 Joining me this morning on the call is John Hayes, our Chief Operating Officer and President; and Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. And in a moment, Scott's going to talk about our financial results for the quarter and for 2010, and then John will follow with details about the operating performance.
 While Ball reported strong third quarter results due largely to excellent operating performance and the impact of strategic actions taken during the last year or so. In addition, to improve results, key achievements in the third quarter included the sale of the Plastics business, the acquisition of Neuman Aluminum and announcement about the consolidation of our salmon can production, the acquisition of an incremental 10.1% of our Brazilian beverage can joint venture and an announcement that we were expanding on production of our commercially successful Alumi-Tek bottle to meet customer demand.
 Also and importantly, Ball aerospace won significant new business increasing our backlog to $852 million at the end of the quarter, up from $539 million at the end of the second quarter of 2010. And after that active quarter, we had significant opportunities in front of us to improve performance and carry momentum into 2011 and beyond.
 Well I'll turn it over to Scott to talk about the quarter, and then as I said, John will provide color on our operations before I address our outlook. Scott?

Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were at $1.40, well ahead of last year's $1.21.
 The following factors contributed to improved results: positive impact from the four acquired beverage can plants, volume improvement that our global Metal Packaging businesses, exceptional operating performance in our various businesses. These positive factors were offset somewhat by a $5 million increase quarter-to-quarter in G&A, primarily due to compensation costs. Purchase accounting and other costs associated with Brazil totaled approximately $5 million, and we had higher interest expense also related to Brazil.
 During the quarter, the company realized an $80 million gain on the consolidation of our Brazilian joint venture, which is recorded in equity earnings. A 10% weaker Euro negatively impacted diluted earnings per share by $0.07 in the quarter and $0.13 year-to-date. For a complete summary of third quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release.
 Turning to some key financial metrics. Interest expense in the quarter was up as expected due to the acquisition financing from last year's purchase of the four metal beverage plants and two months of interest expense from debt consolidated from Brazil. We now anticipate full year interest expense to be in the range of $145 million on a comparable basis and the full year effective tax rate on continuing operations should be in the range of 31%.
 At current exchange rates, year end net debt is expected to be approximately $2.5 billion, or roughly $100 million reduction from 2009 taken into account the $250 million outstanding under the company's AR securitization program in 2009.
 Given the growth opportunities before the company and the consolidation of Brazil, we see full year CapEx approaching $300 million. However, free cash flow is expected to be at least $500 million, excluding the impact of the AR securitization coming on the balance sheet. We continue to be focused on returning value to shareholders. Our plan is to repurchase more than a net $400 million of our stock for 2010, and that's on track.
 With that, I'll turn it over to John to talk more about the operations.

170352,113905536,86274,"Ball Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Ball Corporation","Executives"," Thanks, Scott. In the third quarter, our businesses performed very well across-the-board with EBIT in every segment up year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Comparable results for the quarter in our Metal Beverage Packaging Americas and Asia seg",777," Thanks, Scott. In the third quarter, our businesses performed very well across-the-board with EBIT in every segment up year-over-year on a constant-currency basis.
 Comparable results for the quarter in our Metal Beverage Packaging Americas and Asia segment were up nearly 10% with EBIT of $112.8 million versus $102.9 million in the third quarter last year. This increase was driven largely by the impact of the acquired plants, strong volume growth in emerging markets and growth of certain specialty can sizes, offset by previously disclosed unfavorable volume comparisons in our legacy 12-ounce business and the impact of purchase accounting and other costs associated with consolidating Brazil into the segment that Scott referenced earlier.
 In North America, Ball's legacy volumes were down mid-single digits versus a flat overall market. Something we mentioned would happen during 2010 before a step-up in volume in 2011. As we described in the second quarter conference call, the strong promotional activity we saw in the early part of the summer subsided after the Fourth of July holiday, while in the Beer segment, cans continue to take share from other packaging types as consumers focused on value. Ready-to-drink treat teas and energy drinks continue to grow relative to a soft 2009.
 Given the growth in Specialty Beverage cans, capital will be deployed to meet customers' needs. Our recent announcement to install a second Alumi-Tek bottle can line in North America is an example of the type of projects that will benefit us in 2011 and beyond. We continue to monitor C store trends where certain single-served product categories are growing upwards of 10%. In Brazil, we continue to see strong growth in demand driven by overall growth beer growth and beverage can share gains. We remain optimistic about our growth and future profitability in Brazil.
 In China, herbal teas and beer demand, as well as packaged share gains by two-piece beverage cans over three-piece cans and glass continue to be the main catalyst behind strong volume improvement. We're expanding output in our recently acquired Foshan plant in order to meet demand for beverage cans in Southern China and have many exciting opportunities in the future.
 In our European operations, third quarter EBIT was $63.1 million versus $68.8 million in the third quarter last year. Volumes in Europe were up mid-single digits and excellent cost controls and plant efficiencies were offset by lower-than-anticipated export volume and the FX translation headwind that Scott mentioned earlier.
 On a Euro basis, Europe's earnings were up in the quarter versus last year. The momentum in the German beverage can market recovery continues. Total industry can sales in Germany were up more than 56% in the quarter versus third quarter 2009 and 41% year-to-date versus last year. We remain bullish on recent trends in Germany. And as you know, Ball is well positioned to benefit from the continuing return of the Can in that market.
 Our Food and Household Products segment had an excellent quarter, given the early end to the seasonal fruit and vegetable harvest in the Midwest. Volumes in this segment were down mid-single digits during the period. Third quarter EBIT of $49.4 million was up significantly versus the $27.8 million recorded in the third quarter of 2009, excellent operating performance. Our plants are doing a tremendous job and better mix contributed to better results.
 During the quarter, we integrated the Neuman Aluminum acquisition into the segment. The integration went extremely well and the collaboration was excellent. We will leverage this business capabilities as we continue to assess opportunities to broaden our product line within the Food and Household and Beverage segments.
 Aerospace had a strong quarter with EBIT of $18.4 million versus $16.2 million a year ago on essentially flat revenue. Exceptional program performance and on-orbit completion awards favorably impacted the quarter. While the recent wins in our Aerospace business were contemplated, as you know, we had mentioned that we were ahead a number of irons [ph] in the fire, it is gratifying to see some of them come to fruition, and we still have good opportunities for additional wins in the future.
 As Dave mentioned, backlog is up significantly, which sets us up nicely going into 2011 and beyond. The recently awarded JPSS and WorldView-3 contracts, as well as others, are multi-year programs that will ramp up during 2011 allowing for more meaningful earnings impact being recorded in 2012.
 So in summary, our operations are in a strong position as we approach the end of 2010 and continued execution of selected opportunities as we move forward will only add to our strong base.
 And with that, we'll turn it over to Dave to wrap it up. Dave?

But just to give you a context, the overall market was, call it up, 4% or so, and we were right in line with that. We might have been a little bit better if the export had been better.

This is the third in a series of satellites that we've built. It will ramp up starting kind of now and through next year, I don't really know when the peak employment will be, but probably not even next year. And so that gives you an idea of how these work. It's going to take a few years to build at least the initial parts of these. The other thing is that some of the programs that we're getting involved with, like the national weather satellites and so forth, there's a continuous kind of need in their long-term operational programs. And some that we can't talk about, but they're just a real good basic business for our company. We had it on our board meeting yesterday, a discussion about this. And we had a number of pretty good growth years, a couple of years ago then we had a bit of a dip through the last year or so. I think and hope that we're back on the kind of trajectory we were. So I don't know that we would project above double digits or single-digit growth over time, but it could happen. I mean the business, a decade ago, was 10% of the company when we were $3 billion, and it's still 10% of the company when we're $8 billion. And so it is at a pretty good growth trajectory during that time. We think it will continue.

What's driving both West and East, the growth there, is actually not beer, it's more soft drink, which has been a reversal. Back through the most of the 2000s, beer was really driving it hard. And not the down, so to speak, but it's a little bit more muted than some of the things we're seeing in the soft drink side. And so as we look into 2011, I think a lot of it has to do with the economic recovery. The Eastern Europe is a bit behind Western Europe in terms of recovery from an economic perspective. And I think that drives some of the use of our product and the use of beer versus soft drink generally. And so we remained constructive about Eastern Europe. Don't get me wrong, but the economic recovery has to accelerate before we see a strong acceleration of beer and CSD consumption.

Yes, we're making sure we have the right skill set of people, but as many of our successful programs are rolling off this year and we're building the ones next year, we are going to have higher sales in that business.

You're never perfect, but it is where we think it should have been when we made the U.S. can acquisition. As we go forward in terms of steel, it remains to be seen. What happens there, one of the issues around processed food is the Steel Food Can has a big installed-base in terms of processing. And for our customers to recapitalize that, that is a significant capital throw. And so yes, we always are concerned about substitution and talk with our suppliers all the time about being penny-wise and pound-foolish.
