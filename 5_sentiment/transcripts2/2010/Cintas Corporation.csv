For the quarter ending February 28, 2010, total revenue was $862 million, a 3.7% decrease from the third quarter revenue of fiscal 2009, when adjusting for",550,"Good day and thank you for joining us for our discussion of our third quarter fiscal 2010 results. For the quarter ending February 28, 2010, total revenue was $862 million, a 3.7% decrease from the third quarter revenue of fiscal 2009, when adjusting for the one less work day in this year's third quarter versus last year. Earnings per share were $0.32 versus $0.47 a year ago. This is $0.01 higher than the upper end of our previously issued guidance.We are pleased to see the stabilization in the economy and the significant reduction in job losses. In fact, our total revenues have been relatively comparable over the last four quarters when adjusting for work day differentials. We find this development encouraging but at the same time, we expect job recovery to be sluggish.We have updated our internal estimates with our third quarter actual results and continue to believe that our previously released fourth quarter guidance is appropriate. Therefore, we are reiterating our guidance for the fourth quarter of revenue between $870 million to $890 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.30 to $0.34. Our businesses have been greatly impacted by the large number of job losses and facility closures that have occurred since early in calendar 2008. During this time, we continue to focus on taking care of our customers but working also to reduce our cost structure and conserve cash. The price environment remains extremely competitive.Despite the most significant recession since the 1930s, we are pleased to report that our financial condition has strengthened, leaving us with over $550 million in cash and marketable securities and with no short-term debt. Our ratio of net debt to capitalization improved to 9%, down from over 21% a year ago. Reflecting the strong cash flow and confidence in our business, last week, we paid an annual dividend of $0.48 per share continuing our practice of raising the dividend every year since going public in 1983.We continue to be very disciplined in making acquisitions by continue to search for great opportunities at good values. During this quarter, in addition to some small U.S.-based Document Management and fire service acquisitions, Cintas expanded its presence in the Document Management business in Europe by purchasing a company in Belgium. Combined with our prior European acquisitions in the Netherlands and Germany, we continue to see great opportunities with this business in Northern Europe.We wish to express again our sincere appreciation to all of our employees who we call partners. They are to be complimented for their unwavering focus on taking care of the customer and making Cintas the strong company it is and will continue to be. With me today is Mike Thompson, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer; and Mike Hansen, Cintas' Corporate Controller. After some comments from Mike Thompson and Mike Hansen, we will open the call to questions.The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements.

260725,99287976,54117,"Cintas Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Mar-18-2010",2010-03-18,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thanks Bill. Now let's talk about our income statements. Our third quarter had 64 work days, one less than last year's third quarter as well as this year's second quarter, both of which had 65 work days. Total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal '10 w",1625,"Thanks Bill. Now let's talk about our income statements. Our third quarter had 64 work days, one less than last year's third quarter as well as this year's second quarter, both of which had 65 work days. Total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal '10 was $862 million and represented a 3.7% decrease from the third quarter of last year on an adjusted work day basis. As compared to this year's second quarter, revenue declined 1% on an adjusted work day basis.While U.S. job losses and revenue pressures continue, new business sold to prospects and to existing customers has generally offset these losses, allowing total revenue to be stable over the last four quarters on an adjusted work day basis. Total company internal growth was negative 3.6%, an improvement from second quarter internal growth of negative 10%. As a reminder, there are 66 work days in this year's fourth quarter. Note that in fiscal 2011, workdays will actually be the same as fiscal 2010. That means there will be 66 work days in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3 and 66 in Q4.We have four reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 72% of company revenue in the third quarter.Rental revenue was $622.5 million for the quarter, a 6.3% decrease as compared to last year's third quarter on an adjusted work day basis, and down 1.8% as compared to last quarter on an equivalent work day basis. The sequential decrease of 1.8% is largely due to the impact of holiday closures and weather-related issues. Internal growth was negative 6%, an improvement from second quarter internal growth of negative 9.5%.While still declining, U.S. job losses have moderated. This moderation of job losses, as well as our efforts to maintain our existing customer base, has resulted in improvements on our lost business metric and the stops within our add stop metric as compared to both last year's third quarter and this year's second quarter. However, achieving new business and traditional customer adds continues to be difficult in an economy where jobs have not yet been added. Competitive pricing in the marketplace for both customer retention and new business continues to be aggressive. However, as long as it makes economic sense, we will continue to vigorously fight our competition in the marketplace. We are protecting our market share and our customer satisfaction level remains high.Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the third quarter.  Revenue levels in this segment continue to be soft as customers are maintaining uniform programs but few are upgrading or refreshing them. Last year's third quarter marked the most dramatic sequential revenue decline in this business during the current downturn. We are now 12 months out from that decline. Internal growth was negative 1% in the current third quarter. While growth has not returned, we have seen stabilization in this business. The third quarter internal growth rate of negative 1% marks a sizable improvement from the 17% decline last quarter. Looking forward, we continue to believe further economic stabilization needs to occur before customer spending under these more discretionary types of programs returns to more traditional levels.Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, Safety Products in training and Fire Protection products. First Aid Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 9% of company revenue in the third quarter.During the quarter, revenues within our First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment decreased 8% versus last year's third quarter. Internal growth was negative 6%, an improvement from negative 17% last quarter. As with Uniform Direct Sales, last year's third quarter marked the most dramatic sequential decline in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue throughout this economic downturn. Going forward, we expect to see better year-over-year revenue comparisons.The First Aid and Safety revenue in this segment decreased 5% from last year's third quarter, and was down slightly compared to the second quarter excluding the normal holiday impact. Fire Protection services revenue is down 12% from the third quarter of last year. However, Fire Services revenue increased 7% over the second quarter as we continue to focus on tests, inspection and repair service.Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document Management increased to 8% of third quarter total company revenue, up from 7% in the second quarter. Revenue increased 29% over the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and 10% over the second quarter of this year. Internal growth was 27%.Recycled paper prices strengthened significantly during the third quarter and accounted for the significant lift in the internal growth rate from 9% in the second quarter to 27% in the third quarter. When excluding the impact of recycled paper revenue, internal growth for Document Destruction Service and Purge business was a robust 15%.We continue to expand our geographic presence. And as Bill mentioned earlier, we have expanded into Belgium. While small relative to the company in total, our European businesses are performing to expectations. We continue to look for additional document management acquisition opportunities both domestically and abroad.Turning to margins. We continue to actively manage our cost structure in order to maximize results during this challenging environment. Total company gross margin for the third quarter was 41.7%, a 30 basis point improvement from the third quarter of last year. This improvement came in spite of a 20 basis point increase in energy costs from last year's third quarter.Third quarter total company gross margin decreased 10 basis points from the second quarter. However, total energy costs increased 40 basis points from the second quarter to the third quarter. Rental gross margin of 42.7% was down 110 basis points from last year's third quarter. Lower revenue levels and one fewer workday this year compared to last year's third quarter pressured rental gross margins. In addition, energy costs increased by 20 basis points.  However, as compared to last year's third quarter, expenses were reduced by $23 million on a dollar basis.Rental gross margin declined 80 basis points compared to the second quarter. Energy costs increased 50 basis points in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. The one fewer work day in the third quarter also contributed to the lower margin. Other services gross margin was 39.2% for the quarter as compared to 34.7% in last year's third quarter and 37.3% last quarter. All operating segments within other services had gross margin improvements compared to last year's third quarter and compared to the second quarter.Uniform Direct Sales gross margin improved significantly from last year due to our cost savings initiatives of the past year and the rightsizing of the organization. Gross margin improved slightly from last quarter. However, gross margins continue to be stressed relative to historical levels due to lower fixed cost absorption from lower revenue levels and fewer new program redesigns and rollouts.Third quarter First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection margins improved primarily due to the elimination of the lower margin Fire Installation business over the past year. Document Management gross margin improved primarily as a result of recycled paper prices. Gross margins also benefited from revenue gains allowing local operations to cover a larger portion of their fixed costs.Selling and administrative expenses were 32% of revenue, an increase from 28.3% for the third quarter last year. In addition to the impact of lower revenues and one less workday, selling expenses increased by 120 basis points compared to last year's third quarter. Sales commissions paid on adds, where the sales force was involved, have increased. Traditionally, adds have occurred when our existing customers hire additional workers and/or add additional services for growth reasons. Unfortunately, this is still not the case today. Rather, the primary adds, which we are achieving are by selling new and different products or services to our existing customers and in many cases, using our sales force to obtain this further customer penetration.We also continued our planned increase in sales force headcount. As the economy stabilizes, we have positioned ourselves to take advantage of opportunities as they begin to arise. In addition, medical expenses increased 80 basis points compared to last year due to higher employee utilization of the medical plans. Sequentially, SG&A increased from the second quarter mainly due to a combination of the reset of payroll taxes on January 1, the increased planned investment in selling and an increase in medical costs.Our effective tax rate was 32.8% for the quarter, which reflects the timing of specific reserve builds and releases under FIN 48. Since the adoption of FIN 48, our effective tax rate has decreased during the third quarter due to the timing of reserve requirements but then return to higher levels for the remainder of the year. We expect this to be the case again this year, and anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 will be approximately 37.3%. And now, Mike Hansen will discuss our balance sheet and cash flow."

Over the last 12 months, we have increased our cash and marketable securities on",394,"Thanks, Mike. Our balance sheet continues to get stronger primarily due to robust cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities increased almost $72 million from November 30. Over the last 12 months, we have increased our cash and marketable securities on hand by over $390 million and paid an annual dividend of $74 million.DSOs on accounts receivable were 39, an improvement from November's DSOs of 41. We continue to aggressively manage our accounts receivable in order to lessen any impact from current economic conditions. New goods inventory levels at February 28 were consistent with the levels at the end of the last quarter. We believe current levels are appropriate based on our current revenue level and mix.Net property plants and equipment balances increased slightly from November 30 to $895 million. CapEx through the first nine months of this year was $79 million including $31 million in the third quarter. This is about 60% of the amount we spent through nine months of last year when CapEx was $133 million.Accrued liabilities increased as of February 28 due to the $74 million accrual of the annual dividend, which was paid on March 10. The dividend of $0.48 continued the company's track record of increasing the annual dividend every year since going public in 1983.Long-term debt at February 28 has remained at $786 million, as all outstanding debt is now fixed rate. Any early retirement of this debt would require a prepayment penalty and is not currently attractive. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is approximately 6%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization remained at 24% while net debt or long term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization improved to 9%.As mentioned earlier, our cash flow continues to be strong. Through nine months we have generated over $275 million in cash and cash equivalents. Acquisition activity has picked up to some degree as we spent $35 million during the quarter with acquisitions primarily in Document Management and fire repair and inspection services. Our combined cash flow, current cash balances and access to additional capital have provided us the ability to weather the economic difficulties of the last 18 months and are allowing us to now begin to act on acquisition opportunities that become available at attractive valuations.Thank you and we will now take any of your questions."

So we're very close to having a neutral impact on that for several weeks over the last couple of quarters. So that's a positive sign. Now keep in mind some of those adds or a lot of those adds are not necessarily new wares but rather are additional products and services at existing customers. As far as pricing is concerned, I think as we've mentioned in our comments, it continues to be very, very competitive. And we are finding it probably one of the most aggressive price environments that we have seen for quite some time, meaning that many of our competitors are in our customers at the end of a contract and offering very low prices. We are finding some difficulty in obtaining price increases during the contracts themselves. And as we get new business, we're often meeting very competitive environment and having to basically get business with lower prices than what we would have seen several years ago. We think a lot of this is due to the desire on the part of our competitors to keep volume in their facilities and cover their fixed costs. So we expect this to continue for some time. But hopefully, we'll resume to more traditional pricing in the not too distant future."

We have $600 million CP line out there that's being untapped really because there's no reason to tap it and put it on the balance sheet. We continue to look at acquisition opportunities. But certainly we have plenty of cash in our balance sheet to use. Historically, we've gone as high as a 35% to 40% debt to capital and we're comfortable with that. Right now, we're at net debt to capital of less than 10. So it gives us a lot of space to move. And looking at the current markets, we are certainly in constant communication with our banking group. And we believe we could easily float quite a bit of debt easily, $500 million even up to $1 billion depending with the CP line. Not that we need it today, but you're talking rates in the 5.5% and 6% range depending on the term. Our name in the market has been very good. Whenever we floated CP, it's never been an issue to put it out to the marketplace and get very favorable rates. It's just finding the opportunity for the need for that cash.

So if we cannot make good acquisitions and utilize this cash, that would be in the best long-term interest of our shareholders and the Board is committed to look at other ways to get return back to our shareholders. If that means buying our stock, increasing the dividend, whatever it will take to make sure that we generate an adequate return for the shareholders.

Remember, we've had to adjust our cost structure dramatically over the last 18 months, and have done a decent job of doing that given the revenue declines. Certainly, when you rotate that, the fixed costs we have in place will remain such that when the revenues grow or stabilize, we will see some other benefits of what we've been doing internally. But right now, job losses continue. Revenues are still declining to some degree, although lessened as far as existing business. So there's still that churn effect going on within Cintas of your profitable business of 15 men in uniform going to 13 men while I'm adding in new services. So I've got a, kind of, a double hit. And I'm losing profitable business and adding in the first year of agreement where it's pretty expensive. As you move forward, depending on how much new business you sell and what that material cost impact is and the sales costs, you should see gross margins improve. Especially because we're selling below the gross margin line. So we expect it to improve again depending on what goes on in the marketplace. We need the job loss to be stable at zero versus continuing to drag down. It seems like we're getting closer to that.

In other words are there some mid-sized assets out there that could be attractive in Document or Fire or is it much more likely to be as you've done historically, more often than not, in a bunch of small Mom and Pop?"

And we have interest in companies both large and small in all of our businesses. I would tell you in the Fire Service business, there really isn't another big competitor outside of Cintas and Tyco. And I don't think Tyco is going to be interested in selling their division. And it's much larger than ours is anyway. But in Document Management there are several good-sized companies that would be attractive. There are a lot of good regional players that would be attractive. And in Uniform Rental I don't need to tell you that there are some very good-sized players, there are some great regional players and there's still a lot of local players. So we know who they are and we will certainly pursue those that look like that they could be doable at the right price."

For the quarter ending February 28, 2010, total revenue was $862 million, a 3.7% decrease from the third quarter revenue of fiscal 2009, when adjusting for the one less work day in this year's third quarter versus last year. Earnings per share were $0.32 versus $0.47 a year ago. This is $0.01 higher than the upper end of our previously issued guidance.We are pleased to see the stabilization in the economy and the significant reduction in job losses. In fact, our total revenues have been relatively comparable over the last four quarters when adjusting for work day differentials. We find this development encouraging but at the same time, we expect job recovery to be sluggish.We have updated our internal estimates with our third quarter actual results and continue to believe that our previously released fourth quarter guidance is appropriate. Therefore, we are reiterating our guidance for the fourth quarter of revenue between $870 million to $890 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.30 to $0.34. Our businesses have been greatly impacted by the large number of job losses and facility closures that have occurred since early in calendar 2008. During this time, we continue to focus on taking care of our customers but working also to reduce our cost structure and conserve cash. The price environment remains extremely competitive.Despite the most significant recession since the 1930s, we are pleased to report that our financial condition has strengthened, leaving us with over $550 million in cash and marketable securities and with no short-term debt. Our ratio of net debt to capitalization improved to 9%, down from over 21% a year ago. Reflecting the strong cash flow and confidence in our business, last week, we paid an annual dividend of $0.48 per share continuing our practice of raising the dividend every year since going public in 1983.We continue to be very disciplined in making acquisitions by continue to search for great opportunities at good values. During this quarter, in addition to some small U.S.-based Document Management and fire service acquisitions, Cintas expanded its presence in the Document Management business in Europe by purchasing a company in Belgium. Combined with our prior European acquisitions in the Netherlands and Germany, we continue to see great opportunities with this business in Northern Europe.We wish to express again our sincere appreciation to all of our employees who we call partners. They are to be complimented for their unwavering focus on taking care of the customer and making Cintas the strong company it is and will continue to be. With me today is Mike Thompson, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer; and Mike Hansen, Cintas' Corporate Controller.

Our third quarter had 64 work days, one less than last year's third quarter as well as this year's second quarter, both of which had 65 work days. Total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal '10 w",1625,"Thanks Bill. Now let's talk about our income statements. Our third quarter had 64 work days, one less than last year's third quarter as well as this year's second quarter, both of which had 65 work days. Total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal '10 was $862 million and represented a 3.7% decrease from the third quarter of last year on an adjusted work day basis. As compared to this year's second quarter, revenue declined 1% on an adjusted work day basis.While U.S. job losses and revenue pressures continue, new business sold to prospects and to existing customers has generally offset these losses, allowing total revenue to be stable over the last four quarters on an adjusted work day basis. Total company internal growth was negative 3.6%, an improvement from second quarter internal growth of negative 10%. As a reminder, there are 66 work days in this year's fourth quarter. Note that in fiscal 2011, workdays will actually be the same as fiscal 2010. That means there will be 66 work days in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3 and 66 in Q4.We have four reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 72% of company revenue in the third quarter.Rental revenue was $622.5 million for the quarter, a 6.3% decrease as compared to last year's third quarter on an adjusted work day basis, and down 1.8% as compared to last quarter on an equivalent work day basis. The sequential decrease of 1.8% is largely due to the impact of holiday closures and weather-related issues. Internal growth was negative 6%, an improvement from second quarter internal growth of negative 9.5%.While still declining, U.S. job losses have moderated. This moderation of job losses, as well as our efforts to maintain our existing customer base, has resulted in improvements on our lost business metric and the stops within our add stop metric as compared to both last year's third quarter and this year's second quarter. However, achieving new business and traditional customer adds continues to be difficult in an economy where jobs have not yet been added. Competitive pricing in the marketplace for both customer retention and new business continues to be aggressive. However, as long as it makes economic sense, we will continue to vigorously fight our competition in the marketplace. We are protecting our market share and our customer satisfaction level remains high.Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the third quarter.  Revenue levels in this segment continue to be soft as customers are maintaining uniform programs but few are upgrading or refreshing them. Last year's third quarter marked the most dramatic sequential revenue decline in this business during the current downturn. We are now 12 months out from that decline. Internal growth was negative 1% in the current third quarter. While growth has not returned, we have seen stabilization in this business. The third quarter internal growth rate of negative 1% marks a sizable improvement from the 17% decline last quarter. Looking forward, we continue to believe further economic stabilization needs to occur before customer spending under these more discretionary types of programs returns to more traditional levels.Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, Safety Products in training and Fire Protection products. First Aid Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 9% of company revenue in the third quarter.During the quarter, revenues within our First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment decreased 8% versus last year's third quarter. Internal growth was negative 6%, an improvement from negative 17% last quarter. As with Uniform Direct Sales, last year's third quarter marked the most dramatic sequential decline in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue throughout this economic downturn. Going forward, we expect to see better year-over-year revenue comparisons.The First Aid and Safety revenue in this segment decreased 5% from last year's third quarter, and was down slightly compared to the second quarter excluding the normal holiday impact. Fire Protection services revenue is down 12% from the third quarter of last year. However, Fire Services revenue increased 7% over the second quarter as we continue to focus on tests, inspection and repair service.Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document Management increased to 8% of third quarter total company revenue, up from 7% in the second quarter. Revenue increased 29% over the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and 10% over the second quarter of this year. Internal growth was 27%.Recycled paper prices strengthened significantly during the third quarter and accounted for the significant lift in the internal growth rate from 9% in the second quarter to 27% in the third quarter. When excluding the impact of recycled paper revenue, internal growth for Document Destruction Service and Purge business was a robust 15%.We continue to expand our geographic presence. And as Bill mentioned earlier, we have expanded into Belgium. While small relative to the company in total, our European businesses are performing to expectations. We continue to look for additional document management acquisition opportunities both domestically and abroad.Turning to margins. We continue to actively manage our cost structure in order to maximize results during this challenging environment. Total company gross margin for the third quarter was 41.7%, a 30 basis point improvement from the third quarter of last year. This improvement came in spite of a 20 basis point increase in energy costs from last year's third quarter.Third quarter total company gross margin decreased 10 basis points from the second quarter. However, total energy costs increased 40 basis points from the second quarter to the third quarter. Rental gross margin of 42.7% was down 110 basis points from last year's third quarter. Lower revenue levels and one fewer workday this year compared to last year's third quarter pressured rental gross margins. In addition, energy costs increased by 20 basis points.  However, as compared to last year's third quarter, expenses were reduced by $23 million on a dollar basis.Rental gross margin declined 80 basis points compared to the second quarter. Energy costs increased 50 basis points in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. The one fewer work day in the third quarter also contributed to the lower margin. Other services gross margin was 39.2% for the quarter as compared to 34.7% in last year's third quarter and 37.3% last quarter. All operating segments within other services had gross margin improvements compared to last year's third quarter and compared to the second quarter.Uniform Direct Sales gross margin improved significantly from last year due to our cost savings initiatives of the past year and the rightsizing of the organization. Gross margin improved slightly from last quarter. However, gross margins continue to be stressed relative to historical levels due to lower fixed cost absorption from lower revenue levels and fewer new program redesigns and rollouts.Third quarter First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection margins improved primarily due to the elimination of the lower-margin Fire Installation business over the past year. Docu [Document] Management gross margin improved primarily as a result of recycled paper prices. Gross margins also benefited from revenue gains allowing local operations to cover a larger portion of their fixed costs.Selling and administrative expenses were 32% of revenue, an increase from 28.3% for the third quarter last year. In addition to the impact of lower revenues and one less workday, selling expenses increased by 120 basis points compared to last year's third quarter. Sales commissions paid on adds, where the sales force was involved, have increased. Traditionally, adds have occurred when our existing customers hire additional workers and/or add additional services for growth reasons. Unfortunately, this is still not the case today. Rather, the primary adds which we are achieving are by selling new and different products or services to our existing customers and, in many cases, using our sales force to obtain this further customer penetration.We also continued our planned increase in sales force headcount. As the economy stabilizes, we have positioned ourselves to take advantage of opportunities as they begin to arise. In addition, medical expenses increased 80 basis points compared to last year, due to higher employee utilization of the medical plans. Sequentially, SG&A increased from the second quarter mainly due to a combination of the reset of payroll taxes on January 1, the increased planned investment in selling and an increase in medical costs.Our effective tax rate was 32.8% for the quarter, which reflects the timing of specific reserve builds and releases under FIN 48. Since the adoption of FIN 48, our effective tax rate has decreased during the third quarter due to the timing of reserve requirements, but then returned to higher levels for the remainder of the year. We expect this to be the case again this year, and anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 will be approximately 37.3%. And now, Mike Hansen will discuss our balance sheet and cash flow."

Our balance sheet continues to get stronger primarily due to robust cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities increased almost $72 million from November 30. Over the last 12 months, we have increased our cash and marketable securities on",392,"Thanks, Mike. Our balance sheet continues to get stronger primarily due to robust cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities increased almost $72 million from November 30. Over the last 12 months, we have increased our cash and marketable securities on hand by over $390 million and paid an annual dividend of $74 million.DSOs on accounts receivable were 39, an improvement from November's DSOs of 41. We continue to aggressively manage our accounts receivable in order to lessen any impact from current economic conditions. New goods inventory levels at February 28 were consistent with the levels at the end of the last quarter. We believe current levels are appropriate based on our current revenue level and mix.Net property, plant and equipment balances increased slightly from November 30 to $895 million. CapEx through the first nine months of this year was $79 million, including $31 million in the third quarter. This is about 60% of the amount we spent through nine months of last year when CapEx was $133 million.Accrued liabilities increased as of February 28 due to the $74 million accrual of the annual dividend, which was paid on March 10. The dividend of $0.48 continued the company's track record of increasing the annual dividend every year since going public in 1983.Long-term debt at February 28 remained at $786 million, as all outstanding debt is now fixed rate. Any early retirement of this debt would require a prepayment penalty and is not currently attractive. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is approximately 6%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization remained at 24%, while net debt or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization improved to 9%.As mentioned earlier, our cash flow continues to be strong. Through nine months, we have generated over $275 million in cash and cash equivalents. Acquisition activity has picked up to some degree as we spent $35 million during the quarter, with acquisitions primarily in Document Management and fire, repair and inspection services. Our combined cash flow, current cash balances and access to additional capital have provided us the ability to weather the economic difficulties of the last 18 months and are allowing us to now begin to act on acquisition opportunities that become available at attractive valuations.Thank you and we will now take any of your questions."

Now keep in mind some of those adds, or a lot of those adds, are not necessarily new wares but rather are additional products and services at existing customers. As far as pricing is concerned, I think as we've mentioned in our comments, it continues to be very, very competitive. And we are finding it probably one of the most aggressive price environments that we have seen for quite some time, meaning that many of our competitors are in our customers at the end of a contract and offering very low prices. We are finding some difficulty in obtaining price increases during the contracts themselves. And as we get new business, we're often meeting very competitive environment and having to basically get business with lower prices than what we would have seen several years ago. We think a lot of this is due to the desire on the part of our competitors to keep volume in their facilities and cover their fixed costs. So we expect this to continue for some time. But hopefully, we'll resume to more traditional pricing in the not too distant future."

Remember, we've had to adjust our cost structure dramatically over the last 18 months, and have done a decent job of doing that given the revenue declines. Certainly, when you rotate that, the fixed costs we have in place will remain such that when the revenues grow or stabilize, we will see some other benefits of what we've been doing internally.

So there's still that churn effect going on within Cintas of your profitable business of 15 men in uniform going to 13 men while I'm adding in new services. So I've got a, kind of, a double hit. And I'm losing profitable business and adding in the first year of agreement where it's pretty expensive. As you move forward, depending on how much new business you sell and what that material cost impact is and the sales costs, you should see gross margins improve. Especially because we're selling below the gross margin line. So we expect it to improve again depending on what goes on in the marketplace. We need the job loss to be stable at zero versus continuing to drag down. It seems like we're getting closer to that.

The Uniform Rental business is still very attractive to us. As we've mentioned on several of these calls recently, there is a big disconnect between the sellers and the buyers as to what the business was really doing and what the future held in the short term. What kind of volume were you buying and how much of it was going to be there six months later or a year later. If stabilization does continue, then I think that the attractiveness of Uniform Rental will start to increase because we know we'll have a better idea of what we're getting.

Typically when we look forward to Energy, we forecast based on where it is the current time of that guideline announcement. So we have energy factored in at this point at current levels. As far as what happened in the quarter, certainly, as we indicated, the workday adjustment and also if this being our third quarter, the holiday always impacts that gross margin in that business. And I think certainly as we discussed with others on the call, we expect it to improve going forward albeit we need the economy to stabilize. We're not continuing to chase the route structure et cetera, as jobs lessen and you continue to lose that very-profitable business. And that continues to be, to some degree, existing today. Now it's not as bad as it was six or nine months ago but it continues to occur. So if it's still bad, it's still worst than last quarter on a go-forward basis when you lose those jobs. So we need that to stop and be zero so that we can start generating it on the upside. Certainly, energy did impact us this quarter to the tune of about 20 basis points sequentially.

For the quarter ending February 28, 2010, total revenue was $862 million, a 3.7% decrease from the third quarter revenue of fiscal 2009, when adjusting for",550,"Good day and thank you for joining us for our discussion of our third quarter fiscal 2010 results. For the quarter ending February 28, 2010, total revenue was $862 million, a 3.7% decrease from the third quarter revenue of fiscal 2009, when adjusting for the one less work day in this year's third quarter versus last year. Earnings per share were $0.32 versus $0.47 a year ago. This is $0.01 higher than the upper end of our previously issued guidance.We are pleased to see the stabilization in the economy and the significant reduction in job losses. In fact, our total revenues have been relatively comparable over the last four quarters when adjusting for work day differentials. We find this development encouraging but at the same time, we expect job recovery to be sluggish.We have updated our internal estimates with our third quarter actual results and continue to believe that our previously released fourth quarter guidance is appropriate. Therefore, we are reiterating our guidance for the fourth quarter of revenue between $870 million to $890 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.30 to $0.34. Our businesses have been greatly impacted by the large number of job losses and facility closures that have occurred since early in calendar 2008. During this time, we continue to focus on taking care of our customers but working also to reduce our cost structure and conserve cash. The price environment remains extremely competitive.Despite the most significant recession since the 1930s, we are pleased to report that our financial condition has strengthened, leaving us with over $550 million in cash and marketable securities and with no short-term debt. Our ratio of net debt to capitalization improved to 9%, down from over 21% a year ago. Reflecting the strong cash flow and confidence in our business, last week, we paid an annual dividend of $0.48 per share continuing our practice of raising the dividend every year since going public in 1983.We continue to be very disciplined in making acquisitions by continue to search for great opportunities at good values. During this quarter, in addition to some small U.S.-based Document Management and fire service acquisitions, Cintas expanded its presence in the Document Management business in Europe by purchasing a company in Belgium. Combined with our prior European acquisitions in the Netherlands and Germany, we continue to see great opportunities with this business in Northern Europe.We wish to express again our sincere appreciation to all of our employees who we call partners. They are to be complimented for their unwavering focus on taking care of the customer and making Cintas the strong company it is and will continue to be. With me today is Mike Thompson, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer; and Mike Hansen, Cintas' Corporate Controller.

Our third quarter had 64 work days, one less than last year's third quarter as well as this year's second quarter, both of which had 65 work days. Total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal '10 w",1625,"Thanks Bill. Now let's talk about our income statements. Our third quarter had 64 work days, one less than last year's third quarter as well as this year's second quarter, both of which had 65 work days. Total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal '10 was $862 million and represented a 3.7% decrease from the third quarter of last year on an adjusted work day basis. As compared to this year's second quarter, revenue declined 1% on an adjusted work day basis.While U.S. job losses and revenue pressures continue, new business sold to prospects and to existing customers has generally offset these losses, allowing total revenue to be stable over the last four quarters on an adjusted work day basis. Total company internal growth was negative 3.6%, an improvement from second quarter internal growth of negative 10%. As a reminder, there are 66 work days in this year's fourth quarter. Note that in fiscal 2011, workdays will actually be the same as fiscal 2010. That means there will be 66 work days in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3 and 66 in Q4.We have four reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 72% of company revenue in the third quarter.Rental revenue was $622.5 million for the quarter, a 6.3% decrease as compared to last year's third quarter on an adjusted work day basis, and down 1.8% as compared to last quarter on an equivalent work day basis. The sequential decrease of 1.8% is largely due to the impact of holiday closures and weather-related issues. Internal growth was negative 6%, an improvement from second quarter internal growth of negative 9.5%.While still declining, U.S. job losses have moderated. This moderation of job losses, as well as our efforts to maintain our existing customer base, has resulted in improvements on our lost business metric and the stops within our add stop metric as compared to both last year's third quarter and this year's second quarter. However, achieving new business and traditional customer adds continues to be difficult in an economy where jobs have not yet been added. Competitive pricing in the marketplace for both customer retention and new business continues to be aggressive. However, as long as it makes economic sense, we will continue to vigorously fight our competition in the marketplace. We are protecting our market share and our customer satisfaction level remains high.Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the third quarter.  Revenue levels in this segment continue to be soft as customers are maintaining uniform programs but few are upgrading or refreshing them. Last year's third quarter marked the most dramatic sequential revenue decline in this business during the current downturn. We are now 12 months out from that decline. Internal growth was negative 1% in the current third quarter. While growth has not returned, we have seen stabilization in this business. The third quarter internal growth rate of negative 1% marks a sizable improvement from the 17% decline last quarter. Looking forward, we continue to believe further economic stabilization needs to occur before customer spending under these more discretionary types of programs returns to more traditional levels.Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, Safety Products in training and Fire Protection products. First Aid Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 9% of company revenue in the third quarter.During the quarter, revenues within our First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment decreased 8% versus last year's third quarter. Internal growth was negative 6%, an improvement from negative 17% last quarter. As with Uniform Direct Sales, last year's third quarter marked the most dramatic sequential decline in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue throughout this economic downturn. Going forward, we expect to see better year-over-year revenue comparisons.The First Aid and Safety revenue in this segment decreased 5% from last year's third quarter, and was down slightly compared to the second quarter excluding the normal holiday impact. Fire Protection services revenue is down 12% from the third quarter of last year. However, Fire Services revenue increased 7% over the second quarter as we continue to focus on tests, inspection and repair service.Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document Management increased to 8% of third quarter total company revenue, up from 7% in the second quarter. Revenue increased 29% over the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and 10% over the second quarter of this year. Internal growth was 27%.Recycled paper prices strengthened significantly during the third quarter and accounted for the significant lift in the internal growth rate from 9% in the second quarter to 27% in the third quarter. When excluding the impact of recycled paper revenue, internal growth for Document Destruction Service and Purge business was a robust 15%.We continue to expand our geographic presence. And as Bill mentioned earlier, we have expanded into Belgium. While small relative to the company in total, our European businesses are performing to expectations. We continue to look for additional document management acquisition opportunities both domestically and abroad.Turning to margins. We continue to actively manage our cost structure in order to maximize results during this challenging environment. Total company gross margin for the third quarter was 41.7%, a 30 basis point improvement from the third quarter of last year. This improvement came in spite of a 20 basis point increase in energy costs from last year's third quarter.Third quarter total company gross margin decreased 10 basis points from the second quarter. However, total energy costs increased 40 basis points from the second quarter to the third quarter. Rental gross margin of 42.7% was down 110 basis points from last year's third quarter. Lower revenue levels and one fewer workday this year compared to last year's third quarter pressured rental gross margins. In addition, energy costs increased by 20 basis points.  However, as compared to last year's third quarter, expenses were reduced by $23 million on a dollar basis.Rental gross margin declined 80 basis points compared to the second quarter. Energy costs increased 50 basis points in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. The one fewer work day in the third quarter also contributed to the lower margin. Other services gross margin was 39.2% for the quarter as compared to 34.7% in last year's third quarter and 37.3% last quarter. All operating segments within other services had gross margin improvements compared to last year's third quarter and compared to the second quarter.Uniform Direct Sales gross margin improved significantly from last year due to our cost savings initiatives of the past year and the rightsizing of the organization. Gross margin improved slightly from last quarter. However, gross margins continue to be stressed relative to historical levels due to lower fixed cost absorption from lower revenue levels and fewer new program redesigns and rollouts.Third quarter First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection margins improved primarily due to the elimination of the lower-margin Fire Installation business over the past year. Docu [Document] Management gross margin improved primarily as a result of recycled paper prices. Gross margins also benefited from revenue gains allowing local operations to cover a larger portion of their fixed costs.Selling and administrative expenses were 32% of revenue, an increase from 28.3% for the third quarter last year. In addition to the impact of lower revenues and one less workday, selling expenses increased by 120 basis points compared to last year's third quarter. Sales commissions paid on adds, where the sales force was involved, have increased. Traditionally, adds have occurred when our existing customers hire additional workers and/or add additional services for growth reasons. Unfortunately, this is still not the case today. Rather, the primary adds which we are achieving are by selling new and different products or services to our existing customers and, in many cases, using our sales force to obtain this further customer penetration.We also continued our planned increase in sales force headcount. As the economy stabilizes, we have positioned ourselves to take advantage of opportunities as they begin to arise. In addition, medical expenses increased 80 basis points compared to last year, due to higher employee utilization of the medical plans. Sequentially, SG&A increased from the second quarter mainly due to a combination of the reset of payroll taxes on January 1, the increased planned investment in selling and an increase in medical costs.Our effective tax rate was 32.8% for the quarter, which reflects the timing of specific reserve builds and releases under FIN 48. Since the adoption of FIN 48, our effective tax rate has decreased during the third quarter due to the timing of reserve requirements, but then returned to higher levels for the remainder of the year. We expect this to be the case again this year, and anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 will be approximately 37.3%. And now, Mike Hansen will discuss our balance sheet and cash flow."

Our cash and marketable securities increased almost $72 million from November 30. Over the last 12 months, we have increased our cash and marketable securities on hand by over $390 million and paid an annual dividend of $74 million.DSOs on accounts receivable were 39, an improvement from November's DSOs of 41. We continue to aggressively manage our accounts receivable in order to lessen any impact from current economic conditions. New goods inventory levels at February 28 were consistent with the levels at the end of the last quarter. We believe current levels are appropriate based on our current revenue level and mix.Net property, plant and equipment balances increased slightly from November 30 to $895 million. CapEx through the first nine months of this year was $79 million, including $31 million in the third quarter. This is about 60% of the amount we spent through nine months of last year when CapEx was $133 million.Accrued liabilities increased as of February 28 due to the $74 million accrual of the annual dividend, which was paid on March 10. The dividend of $0.48 continued the company's track record of increasing the annual dividend every year since going public in 1983.Long-term debt at February 28 remained at $786 million, as all outstanding debt is now fixed rate. Any early retirement of this debt would require a prepayment penalty and is not currently attractive. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is approximately 6%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization remained at 24%, while net debt or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization improved to 9%.As mentioned earlier, our cash flow continues to be strong. Through nine months, we have generated over $275 million in cash and cash equivalents. Acquisition activity has picked up to some degree as we spent $35 million during the quarter, with acquisitions primarily in Document Management and fire, repair and inspection services. Our combined cash flow, current cash balances and access to additional capital have provided us the ability to weather the economic difficulties of the last 18 months and are allowing us to now begin to act on acquisition opportunities that become available at attractive valuations.Thank you and we will now take any of your questions."

So we're very close to having a neutral impact on that for several weeks over the last couple of quarters. So that's a positive sign. Now keep in mind some of those adds, or a lot of those adds, are not necessarily new wares but rather are additional products and services at existing customers. As far as pricing is concerned, I think as we've mentioned in our comments, it continues to be very, very competitive. And we are finding it probably one of the most aggressive price environments that we have seen for quite some time, meaning that many of our competitors are in our customers at the end of a contract and offering very low prices. We are finding some difficulty in obtaining price increases during the contracts themselves. And as we get new business, we're often meeting very competitive environment and having to basically get business with lower prices than what we would have seen several years ago. We think a lot of this is due to the desire on the part of our competitors to keep volume in their facilities and cover their fixed costs. So we expect this to continue for some time. But hopefully, we'll resume to more traditional pricing in the not too distant future."

Not that we need it today, but you're talking rates in the 5.5% and 6% range depending on the term. Our name in the market has been very good.

Remember, we've had to adjust our cost structure dramatically over the last 18 months, and have done a decent job of doing that given the revenue declines. Certainly, when you rotate that, the fixed costs we have in place will remain such that when the revenues grow or stabilize, we will see some other benefits of what we've been doing internally. But right now, job losses continue. Revenues are still declining to some degree, although lessened as far as existing business. So there's still that churn effect going on within Cintas of your profitable business of 15 men in uniform going to 13 men while I'm adding in new services. So I've got a, kind of, a double hit. And I'm losing profitable business and adding in the first year of agreement where it's pretty expensive. As you move forward, depending on how much new business you sell and what that material cost impact is and the sales costs, you should see gross margins improve. Especially because we're selling below the gross margin line. So we expect it to improve again depending on what goes on in the marketplace. We need the job loss to be stable at zero versus continuing to drag down. It seems like we're getting closer to that.

So there's a lot of discussions beginning to take place. But we're seeing the predominant amount of activity, or let's say, activity that where action could be taken on in the Document Management and in the Fire Service business. But when I say Fire Service I do not include Installation. We're looking at strictly the Service business itself of the inspection of fire extinguishers, emergency exit lights, et cetera, kitchen fire suppression systems. So that's what we're focusing on and there's a lot of acquisition candidates out there, albeit most of them are relatively small. But we're targeting them and Document Management to expand our footprint throughout the U.S. and then we're now beginning to look at tuck-ins in existing operations. The Uniform Rental business is still very attractive to us. As we've mentioned on several of these calls recently, there is a big disconnect between the sellers and the buyers as to what the business was really doing and what the future held in the short term. What kind of volume were you buying and how much of it was going to be there six months later or a year later. If stabilization does continue, then I think that the attractiveness of Uniform Rental will start to increase because we know we'll have a better idea of what we're getting. So we are still interested in it, there is tremendous synergies we can get from them. There are some very nice acquisition opportunities, both big and small, in the industry. And we will certainly pursue them if they make sense."

It takes a while to do the courting and to do the analysis and et cetera.

For the quarter ending February 28, 2010, total revenue was $862 million, a 3.7% decrease from the third quarter revenue of fiscal 2009, when adjusting for",550,"Good day and thank you for joining us for our discussion of our third quarter fiscal 2010 results. For the quarter ending February 28, 2010, total revenue was $862 million, a 3.7% decrease from the third quarter revenue of fiscal 2009, when adjusting for the one less work day in this year's third quarter versus last year. Earnings per share were $0.32 versus $0.47 a year ago. This is $0.01 higher than the upper end of our previously issued guidance.We are pleased to see the stabilization in the economy and the significant reduction in job losses. In fact, our total revenues have been relatively comparable over the last four quarters when adjusting for work day differentials. We find this development encouraging but at the same time, we expect job recovery to be sluggish.We have updated our internal estimates with our third quarter actual results and continue to believe that our previously released fourth quarter guidance is appropriate. Therefore, we are reiterating our guidance for the fourth quarter of revenue between $870 million to $890 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.30 to $0.34. Our businesses have been greatly impacted by the large number of job losses and facility closures that have occurred since early in calendar 2008. During this time, we continue to focus on taking care of our customers but working also to reduce our cost structure and conserve cash. The price environment remains extremely competitive.Despite the most significant recession since the 1930s, we are pleased to report that our financial condition has strengthened, leaving us with over $550 million in cash and marketable securities and with no short-term debt. Our ratio of net debt to capitalization improved to 9%, down from over 21% a year ago. Reflecting the strong cash flow and confidence in our business, last week, we paid an annual dividend of $0.48 per share continuing our practice of raising the dividend every year since going public in 1983.We continue to be very disciplined in making acquisitions by continue to search for great opportunities at good values. During this quarter, in addition to some small U.S.-based Document Management and fire service acquisitions, Cintas expanded its presence in the Document Management business in Europe by purchasing a company in Belgium. Combined with our prior European acquisitions in the Netherlands and Germany, we continue to see great opportunities with this business in Northern Europe.We wish to express again our sincere appreciation to all of our employees who we call partners. They are to be complimented for their unwavering focus on taking care of the customer and making Cintas the strong company it is and will continue to be. With me today is Mike Thompson, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer; and Mike Hansen, Cintas' Corporate Controller.

260725,99287976,54186,"Cintas Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Mar-18-2010",2010-03-18,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thanks Bill. Now let's talk about our income statements. Our third quarter had 64 work days, one less than last year's third quarter as well as this year's second quarter, both of which had 65 work days. Total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal '10 w",1625,"Thanks Bill. Now let's talk about our income statements. Our third quarter had 64 work days, one less than last year's third quarter as well as this year's second quarter, both of which had 65 work days. Total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal '10 was $862 million and represented a 3.7% decrease from the third quarter of last year on an adjusted work day basis. As compared to this year's second quarter, revenue declined 1% on an adjusted work day basis.While U.S. job losses and revenue pressures continue, new business sold to prospects and to existing customers has generally offset these losses, allowing total revenue to be stable over the last four quarters on an adjusted work day basis. Total company internal growth was negative 3.6%, an improvement from second quarter internal growth of negative 10%. As a reminder, there are 66 work days in this year's fourth quarter. Note that in fiscal 2011, workdays will actually be the same as fiscal 2010. That means there will be 66 work days in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3 and 66 in Q4.We have four reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 72% of company revenue in the third quarter.Rental revenue was $622.5 million for the quarter, a 6.3% decrease as compared to last year's third quarter on an adjusted work day basis, and down 1.8% as compared to last quarter on an equivalent work day basis. The sequential decrease of 1.8% is largely due to the impact of holiday closures and weather-related issues. Internal growth was negative 6%, an improvement from second quarter internal growth of negative 9.5%.While still declining, U.S. job losses have moderated. This moderation of job losses, as well as our efforts to maintain our existing customer base, has resulted in improvements on our lost business metric and the stops within our add stop metric as compared to both last year's third quarter and this year's second quarter. However, achieving new business and traditional customer adds continues to be difficult in an economy where jobs have not yet been added. Competitive pricing in the marketplace for both customer retention and new business continues to be aggressive. However, as long as it makes economic sense, we will continue to vigorously fight our competition in the marketplace. We are protecting our market share and our customer satisfaction level remains high.Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the third quarter.  Revenue levels in this segment continue to be soft as customers are maintaining uniform programs but few are upgrading or refreshing them. Last year's third quarter marked the most dramatic sequential revenue decline in this business during the current downturn. We are now 12 months out from that decline. Internal growth was negative 1% in the current third quarter. While growth has not returned, we have seen stabilization in this business. The third quarter internal growth rate of negative 1% marks a sizable improvement from the 17% decline last quarter. Looking forward, we continue to believe further economic stabilization needs to occur before customer spending under these more discretionary types of programs returns to more traditional levels.Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, Safety Products in training and Fire Protection products. First Aid Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 9% of company revenue in the third quarter.During the quarter, revenues within our First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment decreased 8% versus last year's third quarter. Internal growth was negative 6%, an improvement from negative 17% last quarter. As with Uniform Direct Sales, last year's third quarter marked the most dramatic sequential decline in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue throughout this economic downturn. Going forward, we expect to see better year-over-year revenue comparisons.The First Aid and Safety revenue in this segment decreased 5% from last year's third quarter, and was down slightly compared to the second quarter excluding the normal holiday impact. Fire Protection services revenue is down 12% from the third quarter of last year. However, Fire Services revenue increased 7% over the second quarter as we continue to focus on tests, inspection and repair service.Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document Management increased to 8% of third quarter total company revenue, up from 7% in the second quarter. Revenue increased 29% over the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and 10% over the second quarter of this year. Internal growth was 27%.Recycled paper prices strengthened significantly during the third quarter and accounted for the significant lift in the internal growth rate from 9% in the second quarter to 27% in the third quarter. When excluding the impact of recycled paper revenue, internal growth for Document Destruction Service and Purge business was a robust 15%.We continue to expand our geographic presence. And as Bill mentioned earlier, we have expanded into Belgium. While small relative to the company in total, our European businesses are performing to expectations. We continue to look for additional document management acquisition opportunities both domestically and abroad.Turning to margins. We continue to actively manage our cost structure in order to maximize results during this challenging environment. Total company gross margin for the third quarter was 41.7%, a 30 basis point improvement from the third quarter of last year. This improvement came in spite of a 20 basis point increase in energy costs from last year's third quarter.Third quarter total company gross margin decreased 10 basis points from the second quarter. However, total energy costs increased 40 basis points from the second quarter to the third quarter. Rental gross margin of 42.7% was down 110 basis points from last year's third quarter. Lower revenue levels and one fewer workday this year compared to last year's third quarter pressured rental gross margins. In addition, energy costs increased by 20 basis points.  However, as compared to last year's third quarter, expenses were reduced by $23 million on a dollar basis.Rental gross margin declined 80 basis points compared to the second quarter. Energy costs increased 50 basis points in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. The one fewer work day in the third quarter also contributed to the lower margin. Other services gross margin was 39.2% for the quarter as compared to 34.7% in last year's third quarter and 37.3% last quarter. All operating segments within other services had gross margin improvements compared to last year's third quarter and compared to the second quarter.Uniform Direct Sales gross margin improved significantly from last year due to our cost savings initiatives of the past year and the rightsizing of the organization. Gross margin improved slightly from last quarter. However, gross margins continue to be stressed relative to historical levels due to lower fixed cost absorption from lower revenue levels and fewer new program redesigns and rollouts.Third quarter First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection margins improved primarily due to the elimination of the lower-margin Fire Installation business over the past year. Docu [Document] Management gross margin improved primarily as a result of recycled paper prices. Gross margins also benefited from revenue gains allowing local operations to cover a larger portion of their fixed costs.Selling and administrative expenses were 32% of revenue, an increase from 28.3% for the third quarter last year. In addition to the impact of lower revenues and one less workday, selling expenses increased by 120 basis points compared to last year's third quarter. Sales commissions paid on adds, where the sales force was involved, have increased. Traditionally, adds have occurred when our existing customers hire additional workers and/or add additional services for growth reasons. Unfortunately, this is still not the case today. Rather, the primary adds which we are achieving are by selling new and different products or services to our existing customers and, in many cases, using our sales force to obtain this further customer penetration.We also continued our planned increase in sales force headcount. As the economy stabilizes, we have positioned ourselves to take advantage of opportunities as they begin to arise. In addition, medical expenses increased 80 basis points compared to last year, due to higher employee utilization of the medical plans. Sequentially, SG&A increased from the second quarter mainly due to a combination of the reset of payroll taxes on January 1, the increased planned investment in selling and an increase in medical costs.Our effective tax rate was 32.8% for the quarter, which reflects the timing of specific reserve builds and releases under FIN 48. Since the adoption of FIN 48, our effective tax rate has decreased during the third quarter due to the timing of reserve requirements, but then returned to higher levels for the remainder of the year. We expect this to be the case again this year, and anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 will be approximately 37.3%. And now, Mike Hansen will discuss our balance sheet and cash flow."

Over the last 12 months, we have increased our cash and marketable securities on",392,"Thanks, Mike. Our balance sheet continues to get stronger primarily due to robust cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities increased almost $72 million from November 30. Over the last 12 months, we have increased our cash and marketable securities on hand by over $390 million and paid an annual dividend of $74 million.DSOs on accounts receivable were 39, an improvement from November's DSOs of 41. We continue to aggressively manage our accounts receivable in order to lessen any impact from current economic conditions. New goods inventory levels at February 28 were consistent with the levels at the end of the last quarter. We believe current levels are appropriate based on our current revenue level and mix.Net property, plant and equipment balances increased slightly from November 30 to $895 million. CapEx through the first nine months of this year was $79 million, including $31 million in the third quarter. This is about 60% of the amount we spent through nine months of last year when CapEx was $133 million.Accrued liabilities increased as of February 28 due to the $74 million accrual of the annual dividend, which was paid on March 10. The dividend of $0.48 continued the company's track record of increasing the annual dividend every year since going public in 1983.Long-term debt at February 28 remained at $786 million, as all outstanding debt is now fixed rate. Any early retirement of this debt would require a prepayment penalty and is not currently attractive. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is approximately 6%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization remained at 24%, while net debt or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization improved to 9%.As mentioned earlier, our cash flow continues to be strong. Through nine months, we have generated over $275 million in cash and cash equivalents. Acquisition activity has picked up to some degree as we spent $35 million during the quarter, with acquisitions primarily in Document Management and fire, repair and inspection services. Our combined cash flow, current cash balances and access to additional capital have provided us the ability to weather the economic difficulties of the last 18 months and are allowing us to now begin to act on acquisition opportunities that become available at attractive valuations.Thank you and we will now take any of your questions."

So we're very close to having a neutral impact on that for several weeks over the last couple of quarters. So that's a positive sign. Now keep in mind some of those adds, or a lot of those adds, are not necessarily new wares but rather are additional products and services at existing customers. As far as pricing is concerned, I think as we've mentioned in our comments, it continues to be very, very competitive. And we are finding it probably one of the most aggressive price environments that we have seen for quite some time, meaning that many of our competitors are in our customers at the end of a contract and offering very low prices. We are finding some difficulty in obtaining price increases during the contracts themselves. And as we get new business, we're often meeting very competitive environment and having to basically get business with lower prices than what we would have seen several years ago. We think a lot of this is due to the desire on the part of our competitors to keep volume in their facilities and cover their fixed costs. So we expect this to continue for some time. But hopefully, we'll resume to more traditional pricing in the not too distant future."

Right now, we're at net debt to capital of less than 10. So it gives us a lot of space to move. And looking at the current markets, we are certainly in constant communication with our banking group. And we believe we could easily float quite a bit of debt easily, $500 million even up to $1 billion depending with the CP line. Not that we need it today, but you're talking rates in the 5.5% and 6% range depending on the term. Our name in the market has been very good.

Remember, we've had to adjust our cost structure dramatically over the last 18 months, and have done a decent job of doing that given the revenue declines. Certainly, when you rotate that, the fixed costs we have in place will remain such that when the revenues grow or stabilize, we will see some other benefits of what we've been doing internally. But right now, job losses continue. Revenues are still declining to some degree, although lessened as far as existing business. So there's still that churn effect going on within Cintas of your profitable business of 15 men in uniform going to 13 men while I'm adding in new services. So I've got a, kind of, a double hit. And I'm losing profitable business and adding in the first year of agreement where it's pretty expensive. As you move forward, depending on how much new business you sell and what that material cost impact is and the sales costs, you should see gross margins improve. Especially because we're selling below the gross margin line. So we expect it to improve again depending on what goes on in the marketplace. We need the job loss to be stable at zero versus continuing to drag down. It seems like we're getting closer to that. But every time we think the next month is going to be the zero month, it's still a little bit down. So hopefully, we'll get there."

It wasn't more than 12 months ago, I think, many people felt we were dropping into a depression, and there was tremendous concern about the viability of the financial industry and the whole U.S. economy, the world economy for that matter. So to say that we maybe missed an opportunity to buy our stock, I think we were looking at making sure the company could continue to survive and withstand anything that it met. And so it's really just been very recently that things are starting to look a little bit better, and we're not out of the woods yet. In acquisitions, you don't just decide day one, you're going to start buying companies up and then, you'll start seeing them happening within a couple of months. It takes a while to do the courting and to do the analysis and et cetera. So I think you need to be a little patient and just recognize that we're not going to just rush into something until we have confidence in the future, and then we know what we're getting makes a lot of sense. And I think, hopefully, you'll begin to see some of that happen. But as I said earlier to Nate, if it doesn't, then we'll have to deploy the cash somehow. And either through buying our stock back or doing some other way of giving better returns for our shareholders."

Mike Hansen was recently promoted to this position from Corporate Controller to replace Mike Thompson, who has assumed a role in a rental organization as Senior Vice President, Facility Services.
We are pleased to report that revenues increased 3.5% from last year’s fourth quarter. Internal growth, adjusting for acquisitions and the one additional workday in this year’s fourth quarter, compared to last year was also positive at 1.9%. After the very difficult economic conditions experienced since the beginning of the recession, this marks our first positive growth period in revenue since our quarter ending August 31, 2008.
Our fourth quarter revenue of $909 million was above our previously released guidance of $870 to $890 million. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.36, compared to last year’s $0.03 per share. Prior year numbers included restructuring and impairment charges of approximately $49 million before tax or $0.35 per share. Current year earnings per share were positively impacted by approximately $0.01 due to the reversal of certain restructuring charges.
As we have reported in the last couple of quarters, we continue to see signs of stability with the employment levels of our customers. While customers continue to be hesitant to add employees, we no longer see the significant reductions that occurred during the past couple of years.
The result is that our new business is beginning to offset the impact of lost business or stops at existing customers. The pricing environment continues to be very competitive both with the new business, as well as, renewal of existing contracts.
We continue to be very pleased with the overall financial condition. During fiscal 2010, we paid our annual dividend amounting to $74 million and still increased our cash and marketable securities by over $300 million. As of May 31, 2010, we had no commercial paper outstanding and have cash and marketable securities of over $560 million.
During the recession, we continued to generate substantial cash flow and are able to keep our debt capacity available for opportunities that will arise for additional acquisitions or more rapid expansion throughout the world.
Now that we have more confidence in our view of the future economic environment, we are resuming providing guidance. Our expectations are for revenues for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2011 to be between $3.55 and $3.75 billion, and earnings per share to be between $1.50 and $1.58.
This guidance assumes a slowly improving economy with a relatively modest increase in employment levels and no significant increases in costs such as energy or medical benefits. We also expect our growth in both sales and profits to improve, as the year progresses on a workday adjusted basis.
We are pleased to report our continued expansion outside of North America. Earlier this month, we acquired Squirrel Storage in the United Kingdom that has 10 record storage centers, serving six markets in England, Scotland and Wales.
This acquisition, which has over 10 million pounds in annual revenue, now gives Cintas the opportunity to provide Document Management Services to customers in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, as well as, the U.K. We are excited to have a Cintas presence in the United Kingdom.
We are encouraged with the stabilization of the economy. Through the very hard work of our employees, coupled with our strong customer relationships, we have weathered the most serious economic downturn since the 1930s. With our breadth of business services and strong financial position, we believe that we are prepared to benefit from the improved economic conditions that we expect to prevail in the next several years.

On an adjusted workday basis, total revenue grew 1.9%, compared to last year’s fourth quarter. Total company internal growth was also 1.9%, an improvement over a third quarter internal growth of negative 3.6%. As compared to this year’s third quarter, revenue increased 2% on an adjusted workday basis.

We have four reportable operating segments. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection Services, and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services, and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement.
The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services.
Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the fourth quarter, within rental, based on fourth quarter revenue levels, uniform rental accounts for approximately 52% of revenue, dust control, which is mainly entrance mats, accounts for 22%, hygiene, which is mainly restroom supply and cleaning is 11%, shop towel revenue is 6% and linen and other, which is mainly non-person specific garments, such as aprons and butcher coats, is 9%.
Rental revenue was $647.7 million for the quarter, down 1.5% compared to last year’s fourth quarter on an adjusted workday basis, but up 1% compared to last quarter on an equivalent workday basis. Internal growth was negative 1.1%, an improvement from the third quarter internal growth of negative 5.9%.
Our rental revenue benefited from the modest U.S. private sector job growth during our fourth quarter, as well as, our efforts to maintain and further penetrate our existing customer base. Our uniform wearers increased during the quarter, as we had improvements in our new and lost business metrics and our add/stop metric.
Pricing continues to be aggressive for both customer retention and new business. We are protecting our market share by maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction and by fighting our competition in the marketplace.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the fourth quarter.
Fourth quarter revenue of $103.2 million represents an increase of 10%, compared to last year’s fourth quarter and represents internal growth of 8.3%. Additionally, this revenue level represents an increase of approximately 6% over last quarter on an adjusted workday basis.
Within this segment, our global accounts and strategic markets division has a significant amount of business within the lodging, hospitality and gaming industries. These industries gained jobs in our fourth quarter and we began to see some willingness on our customer’s part to resume spending. We also experienced improved levels of spending at the local level through our direct sale catalog. However, the fourth quarter segment revenue is still well below pre-recession levels.
Our First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection Services operating segment, includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training, and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the fourth quarter.
During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment increased 5.8% versus last year’s fourth quarter. Internal growth was 2.8%, which is an improvement over last year’s - over last quarter’s internal growth of negative 6.1%. Both the first aid and safety revenue and the fire protection services revenue showed improved levels and growth rates in the fourth quarter, compared to last quarter.
First aid and safety revenue increased by 3.4%, compared to last year, while fire protection services increased by 9.5%, compared to last year. As with Uniform Direct Sales revenue, the revenue in this segment is still well below pre-recession levels.
Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document management accounted for 8% of fourth quarter total company revenue. Revenue increased 30% over last year’s fourth quarter with internal growth of 25%.
Recycled paper prices remained at historically elevated levels during the fourth quarter and this was a significant contributor to the relatively high internal growth rate of 25%. Internal growth excluding the recycled paper revenue for document destruction service and purge business was 10.5%.
Turning to margins, we continue to actively manage our cost structure to ensure it is appropriate, given our revenue levels. Total company gross margin for the fourth quarter was 42.4%, an increase over last year’s gross margin of 38.1%.
Keep in mind that last year’s fourth quarter gross margin included a loss on inventory valuation of $27.5 million due to excess inventory levels caused by the significant deterioration in the U.S. and Canadian economies.
Excluding this charge, the adjusted gross margin in last year’s fourth quarter was 41.2%, compared to this year’s fourth quarter of 42.4%. This 120-basis point improvement in gross margin was in spite of a 50-basis point increase in energy-related costs.
Fourth quarter total company gross margin improved by 70 basis points from the third quarter, energy-related costs accounted for a 10% basis point improvement. Higher volumes were also a contributor to this improvement.
Rental gross margin of 43.5% was down 10 basis points from last year’s fourth quarter, adjusted for last year’s loss on inventory evaluation. However, energy-related costs increased by 50 basis points from last year’s fourth quarter to this year’s fourth quarter.
Aside from the effective energy, our improvement was due in part to better capacity utilization in fiscal 2010, driven by the impact of our restructuring activities, which were completed throughout this year.
Rental gross margin improved 80 basis points compared to the third quarter. Energy costs decreased 10 basis points in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. The remaining improvement is mainly due to higher overall rental volume.
Other services gross margin was 39.8% for the quarter, as compared to 34.5% in last year’s fourth quarter adjusted for last year’s loss on inventory valuation and 39.2% last quarter. Improvements over both last year’s fourth quarter and this year’s third quarter are generally due to better fixed cost absorption due to improved volumes.
Selling and administrative expenses were 31.5% of revenue, an increase from 28.9% for the fourth quarter last year. Selling expenses were 120 basis points higher than last year’s fourth quarter.
As we discussed on last quarter's call, we have continued to use our sales force to penetrate our existing customers with new and different products or services. Sales commissions paid on these non-traditional ads where the sales force was involved have resulted in increased commissions compared to last year. We also continued our planned increase in sales force head count.
Future increases in our sales force will depend on the direction of the economic environment. In addition to the increase in selling expense, medical expenses increased 50 basis points compared to last year, due to higher utilization of the medical plans and profit sharing expense increased by 40 basis points due to the higher net income levels in this year's fourth quarter compared to last year.
Sequentially, SG&A decreased from our third quarter, mainly due to a combination of the lower payroll taxes and lower bad debt expense due to improved collections of past due accounts. We were positively impacted by a $2.9 million change in estimate to the restructuring reserve during the fourth quarter. This change in estimate represents the difference between severance and other exit costs estimated during last year's fourth quarter and the costs actually paid during fiscal 2010.
Our effective tax rate was 38.2% for the quarter, which reflects the timing of specific reserve, bills and releases under FIN 48. For the full fiscal 2010 year, our effective tax rate was 37.3%. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 to again be approximately 37.3%.
Our balance sheet and cash flow continue to be strong. Our cash and marketable securities increased $14 million from February 28, despite paying our annual dividend of $74 million. Since May 31, 2009, our cash and marketable securities increased $316 million.
DSOs on accounts receivable were 42, a slight increase from last quarter, but consistent with last year's fourth quarter. Although we had a slight increase in DSOs from last quarter, our aging improved substantially due to a focus on past due accounts.
New goods and inventory levels at May 31 were relatively consistent with the levels at the end of the past two quarters. We believe the current balance is appropriate based on our current revenue level and mix.
Accrued liabilities decreased $58 million compared to February 28, due to the $74 million payment of the annual dividend, which was paid on March 10. The dividend of 0.48 marks the 27th straight year in which we increased the dividend. The decrease in accrued liabilities due to the dividend was offset by a $12 million increase in accrued bond interest.
Long-term debt at May 31 remained at $786 million as all outstanding debt is now at fixed rate. Any early retirement of this debt would require a prepayment penalty and is not currently attractive.
Our average rate on the outstanding debt is approximately 6%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 24% while net debt or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization improved to 8%.
As mentioned earlier, our cash flow remain - continues to be strong. Our cash flow provided by operations in fiscal 2010 was $562 million, an increase of 7% over fiscal 2009. And our free cash flow was $450 million for fiscal 2010, an increase of 24%.
CapEx for the year was $111 million, including $32 million in the fourth quarter. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows. $68 million in rental, $7 million in Uniform Direct Sales, $8 million in First Aid, Safety And Fire Protection and $28 million in Document Management.
We expect our CapEx to modestly increase in fiscal 2011 to be between $125 million to $150 million. We invest $50 million in fiscal 2010 on strategic acquisitions, primarily in our Document Management Services operating segment.
We continued to evaluate acquisition candidates and we have sufficient cash and access to capital for when opportunities arise. As Bill mentioned in his opening comments, we expect fiscal 2011 revenue to be between $3.55 billion and $3.75 billion and earnings per diluted share to be between $1.50 and $1.58.
While we expect a return to growth of sales on profits in fiscal 2011, the U.S. economic environment still appears mixed and we expect job growth to continue to be sluggish. Any downturns in the U.S. economic climate and further job losses in fiscal 2011 will have an adverse effect on our results.
Additionally, the low end of our earnings per diluted share considers slight deterioration in medical and energy-related expenses and recycled paper prices. Thank you and we will now take any of your questions.

We expect the businesses that are really impacted by employment levels, such as Uniform Rental, Uniform Direct Sales and even First Aid and Safety, to basically show some very modest growth as we go through the year.
Reason being, that we are seeing customers at least starting the process of adding some employees in some sectors and therefore needing some uniforms. We're seeing, you know, additional hands in the first aid cabinets. We're seeing some of the hospitality customers, as Mike mentioned. We're looking now to refresh their programs and buy some uniforms but until we see a dramatic increase in employment, I don’t think we’re going to see a dramatic increase in those particular line - in those particular segments. So while we continue to sell new business, the fact that the customers are not reducing head count is going to help us show positive growth albeit at relatively modest rates.

Right now, though, you know, we are hopeful that we can find some very good acquisitions that we can deploy this cash with.

Well, the acquisition in the U.K. is strictly storage. And we really like that company. It's great management team, gives us a nice presence throughout the United Kingdom and it's a very good business. So we found what we think is a gem and that has been our approach any time we look at storage. If we can find a good acquisition that isn’t ready to all of a sudden require millions of dollars of capital expenditures to expand their capacity, you know, we will entertain that.
In the U.K., let me just say that - now, this will give us a platform on which to maybe perhaps launch other products and services as we go forward. In the U.S. and in Canada, we continue to look at potential storage acquisitions, but we also are saying to ourselves that, you know, the opportunities in shredding appear to be more actionable and viable for us right now.
So while storage acquisitions might come along, we tend to find most storage, most companies that are selling their storage business really are maxed out in the facilities they have. And so it makes the return on capital not so attractive because we have to inject so much money right upfront to expand their facility.
We have looked at starting up some storage operations in a couple of different cities and we've been successful in doing that when you can get a good base customer. So those are some of the - you know, we continue to look for the right things to do, but I would say most of our acquisitions in the U.S. will be more on the shredding side.

And while we have seen a slowdown on the outward transfer of jobs outside of the United States, there's really no growth we're seeing in the manufacturing sector right now. It's just finally stabilizing somewhat.

So, we, we feel like there will be an increase in sales in that category, but we're still probably a ways from returning to the heyday of that particular segment.

If it is from new business, new customers, in the short run, you don't get a lot of profit from that, but as that customer evolves and after the selling costs have been absorbed and the injection of the new garments, those customers become more profitable as we go forward.
Right now, I would say our thoughts are that there's going to be, not a lot of growth within existing customers, but there will be some new customers, either that we're going to get from competitors or that we're going to convince that should entertain the uniform rental program. So there will be a little bit of margin pressure from the new customers, but in the long run, they are certainly with five-year contracts, very attractive business.

With me this evening is Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer, Mike Hansen. Mike Hansen was recently promoted to this position from Corporate Controller to replace Mike Thompson who has assumed a role in our rental organization as Senior Vice President, Facility Services.
We are pleased to report that revenues increased 3.5% from last year's fourth quarter. Internal growth adjusting for acquisitions and the one additional workday in this year's fourth quarter compared to last year was also positive at 1.9%. After the very difficult economic conditions experienced since the beginning of the recession, this marks our first positive growth period in revenue since our quarter ending August 31, 2008. 
Our fourth quarter revenue of $909 million was above our previously released guidance of $870 million to $890 million. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.36 compared to last year's $0.03 per share. Prior year numbers included restructuring and impairment charges of approximately $49 million before tax or $0.35 per share. Current year earnings per share were positively impacted by approximately $0.01 due to the reversal of certain restructuring charges.
As we have reported in the last couple of quarters, we continue to see signs of stability with the employment levels of our customers. While customers continue to be hesitant to add employees, we no longer see the significant reductions that occurred during the past couple of years. The result is that our new business is beginning to offset the impact of lost business or stops at existing customers. The pricing environment continues to be very competitive both with the new business as well as renewal of existing contracts.
We continue to be very pleased with our overall financial condition. During fiscal 2010, we paid our annual dividend amounting to $74 million and still increased our cash and marketable securities by over $300 million. As of May 31, 2010, we had no commercial paper outstanding and have cash and marketable securities of over $560 million.
During the recession, we continue to generate substantial cash flow and are able to keep our debt capacity available for opportunities that will arise for additional acquisitions or more rapid expansion throughout the world. Now that we have more confidence in our view of the future economic environment, we are resuming providing guidance. Our expectations are for revenues for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2011, to be between $3.55 billion and $3.75 billion and earnings per share to be between $1.50 and $1.58.
This guidance assumes a slowly improving economy with a relatively modest increase in employment levels and no significant increases in costs such as energy or medical benefits. We also expect our growth in both sales and profits to improve as the year progresses on a workday-adjusted basis.
We are pleased to report our continued expansion outside of North America. Earlier this month, we acquired Squirrel Storage in the United Kingdom that has 10 record storage centers serving six markets in England, Scotland and Wales. This acquisition, which has over £10 million in annual revenue, now gives Cintas the opportunity to provide Document Management Services to customers in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, as well as the U.K. We are excited to have a Cintas presence in the United Kingdom.
We are encouraged with the stabilization of the economy. Through the very hard work of our employees, coupled with our strong customer relationships, we have weathered the most serious economic downturn since the 1930s. With our breadth of business services and strong financial position, we believe that we are prepared to benefit from the improved economic conditions that we expected to prevail in the next several years.

This year's fourth quarter had 66 workdays, one more than last year's fourth quarter and two more than this year's third quarter. On an adjusted workday basis, total revenue grew 1.9% compared to last year's fourth quarter.
Total company internal growth was also 1.9%, an improvement over third quarter internal growth of negative 3.6%. As compared to this year's third quarter, revenue increased 2% on an adjusted workday basis.
Before discussing the quarter in more detail, please note that our fiscal 2011 workdays will actually be the same as fiscal 2010. That means there will be 66 workdays in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3 and 66 in Q4.
We have four reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services are combined and presented as Other Services on the face of the income statement.
The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, maps, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. Within Rental, based on fourth quarter revenue levels, uniform rental accounts for approximately 52% of revenue. Dust control, which is mainly entrance mats, accounts for 22%; hygiene, which is mainly restroom supply and cleaning is 11%; shop towel revenue is 6%; and linen and other, which is mainly non-person specific garments such as aprons and butcher coats, is 9%.
Rental revenue was $647.7 million for the quarter, down 1.5% compared to last year's fourth quarter on an adjusted workday basis, but up 1% compared to last quarter on an equivalent workday basis. Internal growth was negative 1.1%, an improvement from the third quarter internal growth of negative 5.9%. Our Rental revenue benefited from the modest U.S. private sector job growth during our fourth quarter, as well as our efforts to maintain and further penetrate our existing customer base.
Our uniform wearers increased during the quarter, as we had improvements in our new and lost business metrics and our add/stop metric. Pricing continues to be aggressive for both customer retention and new business. We are protecting our market share by maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction and by fighting our competition in the marketplace.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the fourth quarter.
Fourth quarter revenue of $103.2 million represents an increase of 10% compared to last year's fourth quarter and represents internal growth of 8.3%. Additionally, this revenue level represents an increase of approximately 6% over last quarter on an adjusted workday basis.
Within this segment, our Global Accounts and Strategic Markets division has a significant amount of business within the lodging, hospitality and gaming industries. These industries gained jobs in our fourth quarter, and we began to see some willingness on our customers’ part to resume spending. We also experienced improved levels of spending at the local level through our direct sale catalog. However, the fourth quarter segment revenue is still well below pre-recession levels.
Our First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment increased 5.8% versus last year's fourth quarter. Internal growth was 2.8%, which is an improvement over last quarter's internal growth of negative 6.1%.
Both the First Aid and Safety revenue and the Fire Protection Services revenue showed improved levels and growth rates in the fourth quarter compared to last quarter. First Aid and Safety revenue increased by 3.4% compared to last year, while Fire Protection Services increased by 9.5% compared to last year. As with Uniform Direct Sales revenue, the revenue in this segment is still well below pre-recession levels.
Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document Management accounted for 8% of fourth quarter total company revenue. Revenue increased 30% over last year's fourth quarter with internal growth of 25%. Recycled paper prices remained at historically elevated levels during the fourth quarter, and this was a significant contributor to the relatively high internal growth rate of 25%. Internal growth, excluding the recycled paper revenue for document destruction service and purge business, was 10.5%.
Turning to margins. We continue to actively manage our cost structure to ensure it is appropriate given our revenue levels. Total company gross margin for the fourth quarter was 42.4%, an increase over last year's gross margin of 38.1%. Keep in mind that last year's fourth quarter gross margin included a loss on inventory valuation of $27.5 million due to excess inventory levels caused by the significant deterioration in the U.S. and Canadian economies.
Excluding this charge, the adjusted gross margin in last year's fourth quarter was 41.2% compared to this year's fourth quarter of 42.4%. This 120-basis-point improvement in gross margin was in spite of a 50-basis-point increase in energy-related costs.
Fourth quarter total company gross margin improved by 70 basis points from the third quarter. Energy-related costs accounted for a 10% basis point improvement; higher volumes were also a contributor to this improvement.
Rental gross margin of 43.5% was down 10 basis points from last year's fourth quarter, adjusted for last year's loss on inventory valuation. However, energy-related costs increased by 50 basis points from last year's fourth quarter to this year's fourth quarter. 
Aside from the effective energy, our improvement was due in part to better capacity utilization in fiscal 2010, driven by the impact of our restructuring activities which were completed throughout this year. Rental gross margin improved 80 basis points compared to the third quarter. Energy costs decreased 10 basis points in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. The remaining improvement is mainly due to higher overall rental volume.
Other Services gross margin was 39.8% for the quarter as compared to 34.5% in last year's fourth quarter, adjusted for last year's loss on inventory valuation and 39.2% last quarter. The improvements over both last year's fourth quarter and this year's third quarter are generally due to better fixed cost absorption due to improved volumes.
Selling and administrative expenses were 31.5% of revenue, an increase from 28.9% for the fourth quarter last year. Selling expenses were 120 basis points higher than last year's fourth quarter. As we discussed on last quarter’s call, we have continued to use our sales force to penetrate our existing customers with new and different products or services. Sales commissions paid on these non-traditional ads, where the sales force was involved, have resulted in increased commissions compared to last year. We also continued our planned increase in sales force headcount. Future increases in our sales force will depend on the direction of the economic environment. 
In addition to the increase in selling expense, medical expenses increased 50 basis points compared to last year due to higher utilization of the medical plans. And profit sharing expense increased by 40 basis points due to the higher net income levels in this year's fourth quarter compared to last year. Sequentially, SG&A decreased from our third quarter mainly due to a combination of the lower payroll taxes and lower bad debt expense due to improved  collections of past due accounts.
We were positively impacted by a $2.9 million change in estimate to the restructuring reserve during the fourth quarter. This change in estimate represents the difference between severance and other exit costs estimated during last year's fourth quarter and the costs actually paid during fiscal 2010. 
Our effective tax rate was 38.2% for the quarter, which reflects the timing of specific reserve builds and releases under FIN 48. For the full fiscal 2010 year, our effective tax rate was 37.3%. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 to again be approximately 37.3%.
Our balance sheet and cash flow continue to be strong. Our cash and marketable securities increased $14 million from February 28 despite paying our annual dividend of $74 million. Since May 31 of 2009, our cash and marketable securities increased $316 million.
DSOs on accounts receivable were 42, a slight increase from last quarter, but consistent with last year's fourth quarter. Although we had a slight increase in DSOs from last quarter, our aging improved substantially due to a focus on past due accounts. 
New goods inventory levels at May 31 were relatively consistent with the levels at the end of the past two quarters. We believe the current balance is appropriate based on our current revenue level and mix.
Accrued liabilities decreased $58 million compared to February 28 due to the $74 million payment of the annual dividend which was paid on March 10. The dividend of $0.48 marks the 27th straight year in which we increased the dividend. The decrease in accrued liabilities due to the dividend was offset by a $12 million increase in accrued bond interest.
Long-term debt at May 31 remained at $786 million, as all outstanding debt is now fixed rate. Any early retirement of this debt would require a prepayment penalty and is not currently attractive. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is approximately 6%. 
Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 24%, while net debt, or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization, improved to 8%.
As mentioned earlier, our cash flow continues to be strong. Our cash flow provided by operations in fiscal 2010 was $562 million, an increase of 7% over fiscal 2009. And our free cash flow was $450 million for fiscal 2010, an increase of 24%.
CapEx for the year was $111 million, including $32 million in the fourth quarter. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $68 million in Rental; $7 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $8 million in First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection; and $28 million in Document Management. We expect our CapEx to modestly increase in fiscal 2011 to be between $125 million to $150 million.
We invested $50 million in fiscal 2010 on strategic acquisitions primarily in our Document Management Services operating segment. We continue to evaluate acquisition candidates, and we have sufficient cash and access to capital for when opportunities arise. 
As Bill mentioned in his opening comments, we expect fiscal 2011 revenue to be between $3.55 billion and $3.75 billion and earnings per diluted share to be between $1.50 and $1.58. While we expect a return to growth of sales and profits in fiscal 2011, the U.S. economic environment still appears mixed, and we expect job growth to continue to be sluggish. Any downturns in the U.S. economic climate and further job losses in fiscal 2011 will have an adverse effect on our results. Additionally, the low end of our earnings per diluted share can see a slight deterioration in medical and energy-related expenses and recycled paper prices. 
Thank you, and we will now take any of your questions."

So that will continue to do well. We expect the businesses that are really impacted by employment levels, such as Uniform Rental, Uniform Direct Sale and even First Aid and Safety, to basically show some very modest growth as we go through the year; reason being that we are seeing customers at least starting the process of adding some employees in some sectors and therefore needing some uniforms. We're seeing additional hands in the first aid cabinets. We're seeing some of the hospitality customers, as Mike mentioned, looking out to refresh their programs and buy some uniforms. But until we see a dramatic increase in employment, I don't think we're going to see a dramatic increase in those particular segments. So while we continue to sell new business, the fact that customers are not reducing headcount is going to help us show positive growth, albeit at relatively modest rates."

If we can find a good acquisition that isn't ready to, all of a sudden, require million of dollars of capital expenditure to expand their capacity, we will entertain that. In the U.K., let me just say that now this will give us a platform on which to maybe perhaps launch other products and services as we go forward. In the U.S. and in Canada, we continue to look at potential storage acquisitions. But we also are saying to ourselves that the opportunities in shredding appear to be more actionable and viable for us right now. So while storage acquisitions might come along, we tend to find most storage -- most companies that are selling their storage business really are maxed out in the facilities they have. And so it makes the return on capital not so attractive because we have to inject so much money right up front to expand their facility. We have looked at starting up some storage operations in a couple of different cities, and we've been successful in doing that when you can get a good base customer. So those are some of the -- we continue to look for the right things to do, but I'd say most of our acquisitions in the U.S. will be more on the shredding side."

We often also are able to use garments that are in our stock room. So the amortization of those garments continue whether they’re in service or not until they’re fully amortized. If it is from new business, new customers, in the short run, you don't get a lot of profit from that. But as that customer evolves and after the selling costs have been absorbed and the injection [ph] of the new garments, those customers become more profitable as we go forward. Right now I would say our thoughts are that there's going to be not a lot of growth within existing customers, but there will be some new customers, either that we’re going to get from competitors or that we’re going to convince should entertain a uniform-rental program. So there'll be a little bit of margin pressure from the new customers, but in the long run they’re certainly, with five-year contracts, a very attractive business."

With me this evening is Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer, Mike Hansen. Mike Hansen was recently promoted to this position from Corporate Controller to replace Mike Thompson who has assumed a role in our rental organization as Senior Vice President, Facility Services.
We are pleased to report that revenues increased 3.5% from last year's fourth quarter. Internal growth adjusting for acquisitions and the one additional workday in this year's fourth quarter compared to last year was also positive at 1.9%. After the very difficult economic conditions experienced since the beginning of the recession, this marks our first positive growth period in revenue since our quarter ending August 31, 2008. 
Our fourth quarter revenue of $909 million was above our previously released guidance of $870 million to $890 million. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.36 compared to last year's $0.03 per share. Prior year numbers included restructuring and impairment charges of approximately $49 million before tax or $0.35 per share. Current year earnings per share were positively impacted by approximately $0.01 due to the reversal of certain restructuring charges.
As we have reported in the last couple of quarters, we continue to see signs of stability with the employment levels of our customers. While customers continue to be hesitant to add employees, we no longer see the significant reductions that occurred during the past couple of years. The result is that our new business is beginning to offset the impact of lost business or stops at existing customers. The pricing environment continues to be very competitive both with the new business as well as renewal of existing contracts.
We continue to be very pleased with our overall financial condition. During fiscal 2010, we paid our annual dividend amounting to $74 million and still increased our cash and marketable securities by over $300 million. As of May 31, 2010, we had no commercial paper outstanding and have cash and marketable securities of over $560 million.
During the recession, we continue to generate substantial cash flow and are able to keep our debt capacity available for opportunities that will arise for additional acquisitions or more rapid expansion throughout the world. Now that we have more confidence in our view of the future economic environment, we are resuming providing guidance. Our expectations are for revenues for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2011, to be between $3.55 billion and $3.75 billion and earnings per share to be between $1.50 and $1.58.
This guidance assumes a slowly improving economy with a relatively modest increase in employment levels and no significant increases in costs such as energy or medical benefits. We also expect our growth in both sales and profits to improve as the year progresses on a workday-adjusted basis.
We are pleased to report our continued expansion outside of North America. Earlier this month, we acquired Squirrel Storage in the United Kingdom that has 10 record storage centers serving six markets in England, Scotland and Wales. This acquisition, which has over £10 million in annual revenue, now gives Cintas the opportunity to provide Document Management Services to customers in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, as well as the U.K. We are excited to have a Cintas presence in the United Kingdom.
We are encouraged with the stabilization of the economy. Through the very hard work of our employees, coupled with our strong customer relationships, we have weathered the most serious economic downturn since the 1930s. With our breadth of business services and strong financial position, we believe that we are prepared to benefit from the improved economic conditions that we expected to prevail in the next several years.

Total revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 of $909 million represented a 3.5% increase from the fourth quarter of last year.

Total revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 of $909 million represented a 3.5% increase from the fourth quarter of last year. This year's fourth quarter had 66 workdays, one more than last year's fourth quarter and two more than this year's third quarter. On an adjusted workday basis, total revenue grew 1.9% compared to last year's fourth quarter.
Total company internal growth was also 1.9%, an improvement over third quarter internal growth of negative 3.6%. As compared to this year's third quarter, revenue increased 2% on an adjusted workday basis.
Before discussing the quarter in more detail, please note that our fiscal 2011 workdays will actually be the same as fiscal 2010. That means there will be 66 workdays in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3 and 66 in Q4.
We have four reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services are combined and presented as Other Services on the face of the income statement.
The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, maps, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. Within Rental, based on fourth quarter revenue levels, uniform rental accounts for approximately 52% of revenue. Dust control, which is mainly entrance mats, accounts for 22%; hygiene, which is mainly restroom supply and cleaning is 11%; shop towel revenue is 6%; and linen and other, which is mainly non-person specific garments such as aprons and butcher coats, is 9%.
Rental revenue was $647.7 million for the quarter, down 1.5% compared to last year's fourth quarter on an adjusted workday basis, but up 1% compared to last quarter on an equivalent workday basis. Internal growth was negative 1.1%, an improvement from the third quarter internal growth of negative 5.9%. Our Rental revenue benefited from the modest U.S. private sector job growth during our fourth quarter, as well as our efforts to maintain and further penetrate our existing customer base.
Our uniform wearers increased during the quarter, as we had improvements in our new and lost business metrics and our add/stop metric. Pricing continues to be aggressive for both customer retention and new business. We are protecting our market share by maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction and by fighting our competition in the marketplace.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the fourth quarter.
Fourth quarter revenue of $103.2 million represents an increase of 10% compared to last year's fourth quarter and represents internal growth of 8.3%. Additionally, this revenue level represents an increase of approximately 6% over last quarter on an adjusted workday basis.
Within this segment, our Global Accounts and Strategic Markets division has a significant amount of business within the lodging, hospitality and gaming industries. These industries gained jobs in our fourth quarter, and we began to see some willingness on our customers’ part to resume spending. We also experienced improved levels of spending at the local level through our direct sale catalog. However, the fourth quarter segment revenue is still well below pre-recession levels.
Our First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment increased 5.8% versus last year's fourth quarter. Internal growth was 2.8%, which is an improvement over last quarter's internal growth of negative 6.1%.
Both the First Aid and Safety revenue and the Fire Protection Services revenue showed improved levels and growth rates in the fourth quarter compared to last quarter. First Aid and Safety revenue increased by 3.4% compared to last year, while Fire Protection Services increased by 9.5% compared to last year. As with Uniform Direct Sales revenue, the revenue in this segment is still well below pre-recession levels.
Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document Management accounted for 8% of fourth quarter total company revenue. Revenue increased 30% over last year's fourth quarter with internal growth of 25%. Recycled paper prices remained at historically elevated levels during the fourth quarter, and this was a significant contributor to the relatively high internal growth rate of 25%. Internal growth, excluding the recycled paper revenue for document destruction service and purge business, was 10.5%.
Turning to margins. We continue to actively manage our cost structure to ensure it is appropriate given our revenue levels. Total company gross margin for the fourth quarter was 42.4%, an increase over last year's gross margin of 38.1%. Keep in mind that last year's fourth quarter gross margin included a loss on inventory valuation of $27.5 million due to excess inventory levels caused by the significant deterioration in the U.S. and Canadian economies.
Excluding this charge, the adjusted gross margin in last year's fourth quarter was 41.2% compared to this year's fourth quarter of 42.4%. This 120-basis-point improvement in gross margin was in spite of a 50-basis-point increase in energy-related costs.
Fourth quarter total company gross margin improved by 70 basis points from the third quarter. Energy-related costs accounted for a 10% basis point improvement; higher volumes were also a contributor to this improvement.
Rental gross margin of 43.5% was down 10 basis points from last year's fourth quarter, adjusted for last year's loss on inventory valuation. However, energy-related costs increased by 50 basis points from last year's fourth quarter to this year's fourth quarter. 
Aside from the effective energy, our improvement was due in part to better capacity utilization in fiscal 2010, driven by the impact of our restructuring activities which were completed throughout this year. Rental gross margin improved 80 basis points compared to the third quarter. Energy costs decreased 10 basis points in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. The remaining improvement is mainly due to higher overall rental volume.
Other Services gross margin was 39.8% for the quarter as compared to 34.5% in last year's fourth quarter, adjusted for last year's loss on inventory valuation and 39.2% last quarter. The improvements over both last year's fourth quarter and this year's third quarter are generally due to better fixed cost absorption due to improved volumes.
Selling and administrative expenses were 31.5% of revenue, an increase from 28.9% for the fourth quarter last year. Selling expenses were 120 basis points higher than last year's fourth quarter. As we discussed on last quarter’s call, we have continued to use our sales force to penetrate our existing customers with new and different products or services. Sales commissions paid on these non-traditional ads, where the sales force was involved, have resulted in increased commissions compared to last year. We also continued our planned increase in sales force headcount. Future increases in our sales force will depend on the direction of the economic environment. 
In addition to the increase in selling expense, medical expenses increased 50 basis points compared to last year due to higher utilization of the medical plans. And profit sharing expense increased by 40 basis points due to the higher net income levels in this year's fourth quarter compared to last year. Sequentially, SG&A decreased from our third quarter mainly due to a combination of the lower payroll taxes and lower bad debt expense due to improved  collections of past due accounts.
We were positively impacted by a $2.9 million change in estimate to the restructuring reserve during the fourth quarter. This change in estimate represents the difference between severance and other exit costs estimated during last year's fourth quarter and the costs actually paid during fiscal 2010. 
Our effective tax rate was 38.2% for the quarter, which reflects the timing of specific reserve builds and releases under FIN 48. For the full fiscal 2010 year, our effective tax rate was 37.3%. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 to again be approximately 37.3%.
Our balance sheet and cash flow continue to be strong. Our cash and marketable securities increased $14 million from February 28 despite paying our annual dividend of $74 million. Since May 31 of 2009, our cash and marketable securities increased $316 million.
DSOs on accounts receivable were 42, a slight increase from last quarter, but consistent with last year's fourth quarter. Although we had a slight increase in DSOs from last quarter, our aging improved substantially due to a focus on past due accounts. 
New goods inventory levels at May 31 were relatively consistent with the levels at the end of the past two quarters. We believe the current balance is appropriate based on our current revenue level and mix.
Accrued liabilities decreased $58 million compared to February 28 due to the $74 million payment of the annual dividend which was paid on March 10. The dividend of $0.48 marks the 27th straight year in which we increased the dividend. The decrease in accrued liabilities due to the dividend was offset by a $12 million increase in accrued bond interest.
Long-term debt at May 31 remained at $786 million, as all outstanding debt is now fixed rate. Any early retirement of this debt would require a prepayment penalty and is not currently attractive. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is approximately 6%. 
Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 24%, while net debt, or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization, improved to 8%.
As mentioned earlier, our cash flow continues to be strong. Our cash flow provided by operations in fiscal 2010 was $562 million, an increase of 7% over fiscal 2009. And our free cash flow was $450 million for fiscal 2010, an increase of 24%.
CapEx for the year was $111 million, including $32 million in the fourth quarter. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $68 million in Rental; $7 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $8 million in First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection; and $28 million in Document Management. We expect our CapEx to modestly increase in fiscal 2011 to be between $125 million to $150 million.
We invested $50 million in fiscal 2010 on strategic acquisitions primarily in our Document Management Services operating segment. We continue to evaluate acquisition candidates, and we have sufficient cash and access to capital for when opportunities arise. 
As Bill mentioned in his opening comments, we expect fiscal 2011 revenue to be between $3.55 billion and $3.75 billion and earnings per diluted share to be between $1.50 and $1.58. While we expect a return to growth of sales and profits in fiscal 2011, the U.S. economic environment still appears mixed, and we expect job growth to continue to be sluggish. Any downturns in the U.S. economic climate and further job losses in fiscal 2011 will have an adverse effect on our results. Additionally, the low end of our earnings per diluted share can see a slight deterioration in medical and energy-related expenses and recycled paper prices. 
Thank you, and we will now take any of your questions."

So that will continue to do well. We expect the businesses that are really impacted by employment levels, such as Uniform Rental, Uniform Direct Sale and even First Aid and Safety, to basically show some very modest growth as we go through the year; reason being that we are seeing customers at least starting the process of adding some employees in some sectors and therefore needing some uniforms. We're seeing additional hands in the first aid cabinets. We're seeing some of the hospitality customers, as Mike mentioned, looking out to refresh their programs and buy some uniforms. But until we see a dramatic increase in employment, I don't think we're going to see a dramatic increase in those particular segments.

If we can find a good acquisition that isn't ready to, all of a sudden, require million of dollars of capital expenditure to expand their capacity, we will entertain that. In the U.K., let me just say that now this will give us a platform on which to maybe perhaps launch other products and services as we go forward. In the U.S. and in Canada, we continue to look at potential storage acquisitions. But we also are saying to ourselves that the opportunities in shredding appear to be more actionable and viable for us right now. So while storage acquisitions might come along, we tend to find most storage -- most companies that are selling their storage business really are maxed out in the facilities they have. And so it makes the return on capital not so attractive because we have to inject so much money right up front to expand their facility. We have looked at starting up some storage operations in a couple of different cities, and we've been successful in doing that when you can get a good base customer. So those are some of the -- we continue to look for the right things to do, but I'd say most of our acquisitions in the U.S. will be more on the shredding side."

But we do think that, as we saw in the fourth quarter, we think it's going to be some very slow, sluggish growth. And hopefully, no contraction of jobs."

We saw reve",544,"Good evening, and thank you for joining Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer and myself for our first quarter of fiscal 2011 earnings conference call. Cintas reported today growth and revenues and net income for the first quarter. We saw revenue growth in each of our operating segments. Overall revenue growth was 3.6% compared to last year. Revenues were also approximately 1.7% higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, a quarter with the same number of workdays as this quarter. Earnings per share were $0.40 this year compared to last year's $0.35 per share. Last year's first quarter earnings did include an $0.08 charge for a legal settlement on wage and hour litigation.
During the quarter, and continuing into September, the company purchased $7.6 million shares of its stock. Most of these purchases were made under a 10b-5 filing that went into effect when the company entered a quiet period in mid-August. The company made these purchases from cash and did not incur any debt. At August 31, 2010, Cintas had $369 million in cash and marketable securities. Of this amount, approximately $167 million is outside the U.S., resulting from cash flow from non-US operating units, leaving about $202 million of U.S. cash and marketable securities and no short-term debt.
In September, $72 million of the August 31, 2010 cash, was used for share purchases. This completes the authorization for share purchases by the Board. The Board will determine at its future meetings, whether any additional authorizations will be given. As noted in our release, the share purchases had no impact on earnings per share in the first quarter, but will increase earnings per share by about $0.05 over the rest of the year. As a result, while revenue guidance for the year remains unchanged from that provided in July, our earnings per share guidance is increased by $0.05 per share on both the lower and upper end of the range given in July.
We are encouraged with the recent modest growth, and we believe that the North American economy will continue to improve at a relatively slow pace. As a result, Cintas will continue to focus on taking care of its customers by providing valued products and services. In addition, we will continue to enhance our existing customer relations by providing additional products and services, as well as seeking out new customers in all of our business lines. 
Finally, we will focus on cost control and investment in acquisitions, our capital investment, that meet the appropriate return criteria. As a reminder, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, provides a safe harbor from civil litigations for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views, as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our almost recent filings with the SEC, as well as in the press release issued today, announcing our first quarter 2011 results. I will now turn the call over to Mike Hansen, who will discuss this quarter's results in more detail. We will then be happy to answer your questions."

Total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was $924 million, representing a 3.6% increase from the first quarter of last year. Total company internal growth was 2.8%. As Bill mentioned, each operating segments revenue grew compare",1717,"Thank you, Bill. Total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was $924 million, representing a 3.6% increase from the first quarter of last year. Total company internal growth was 2.8%. As Bill mentioned, each operating segments revenue grew compared to last year, both in total and organically. Before discussing the quarter in more detail, please note that our fiscal 2011 workdays are the same as last year. That means there are 66 workdays in the first quarter, 65 in the second quarter, 64 in Q3 and 66 in Q4.
We have four reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes rest room supplies and other facility products and services.
Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the first quarter. Rental revenue was $657.6 million for the quarter, which is relatively flat compared to last year's first quarter, but up 1.5% compared to the quarter ended May 31. Internal growth was 0.1% over last year, which is also an improvement from last quarter's internal growth of negative 1.1%. The steady revenue improvement that we saw in the fourth quarter continued through our first quarter. The modest U.S. private-sector job growth continued in the first quarter. In addition, the focus of our salesforce of adding new customers and penetrating existing customer accounts, positively impacted our first quarter rental revenue. Our wearers increased for the second straight quarter and our new business and net ad stops improved over the fourth quarter levels.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct-sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the first quarter. First quarter revenue of $98.8 million, represents an increase of 10.6% compared to last year's first quarter. Internal growth was also 10.6%.
We're encouraged that our Uniform Direct Sales customers have shown a willingness to spend uniform dollars on new hires and new programs. Our revenue growth over last year for our Global Accounts and Strategic markets division was a broad improvement, in which we saw large national accounts, as well as lodging, hospitality and gaming customers increased spending.
Our First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the first quarter. During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment increased 3.9% versus last year's first quarter. Internal growth was 2.2%. First Aid Safety and Fire Protection revenue increased sequentially over the fourth quarter by 6.4%. This sequential improvement came in both First Aid and Safety and in Fire Protection.
Our Document Management services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document Management accounted for 8% of first quarter total company revenue. Revenue increased 30.7% over last year's first quarter, with internal growth of 23.2%. Recycled paper prices remained at historically elevated levels during the quarter. Internal growth for Document Management services, excluding the recycled paper revenue, was 10.6%.
Moving on to margins. Total company gross margin for the first quarter was 42.6%, a decrease compared to last year's gross margin of 42.9%. This decrease is due to a 10 basis point increase in energy-related costs, and a 35 basis point increase in maintenance costs. As our volumes declined during the past two years, we reduced maintenance on certain equipment and trucks, not needed for the declining capacity requirements. Consequently, as volume now increases, we have some higher maintenance requirements. We expect this increased level may continue into the second quarter as well. The gross margin of 42.6% did represent a slight increase over the 42.4% gross margin for the quarter ended May 31. First quarter energy-related costs were down 15 basis points from the fourth quarter level.
Rental gross margins of 43.5% were down 110 basis points from last year's first quarter, and the same as that of the quarter ended May 31. Regarding comparisons to last year, energy-related costs were 15 basis points higher this year, and as just discussed, our maintenance costs increased 40 basis points. Other Services' gross margin was 40.4% for the quarter, as compared to 38.2% in last year's first quarter and 39.8% for the quarter ended May 31. Compared to last year, the Other Services gross margin improvement was due to an improved Document Management gross margin, resulting primarily from the higher paper prices and an improved First Aid Safety and Fire Protection gross margin, resulting from better sales mix in both First Aid and Safety and in Fire Protection.
Selling and administrative expenses were 31.8% of revenue, an increase from 29.7% for the first quarter last year. Selling expenses were up 110 basis points higher than last year's first quarter. As we've discussed on the last few calls, we had a planned increase in our salesforce during mid-fiscal 2010, as a result of the stabilization that we saw in the economy. Going forward, we expect our selling expenses to stabilize and start to come down as a percent of sales, as revenue levels continue to increase.
In addition to the increase in selling expense, professional service expenses increased 20 basis points compared to last year, due to our enterprise-wide system conversion, and bad debt expense increased by 40 basis points, due to a slight deterioration in our aging. Please keep in mind that our bad-debt expense and allowance for doubtful accounts are based on a consistent application of our established accounts receivable policy, which includes specific reserve percentages for each aging category.
Sequentially, SG&A increased from the quarter ended May 31, due to an 80 basis point increase in bad-debt expense. Please keep in mind that last year's first quarter included a legal settlement amounting to $19.5 million pretax, net of insurance proceeds. Our effective tax rate was 30.8% for the quarter compared to 38.1% last year. This rate was positively impacted by the closure of various tax audits in the quarter. Due to the timing of specific reserve builds and releases under FIN 48, our effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. We still expect our fiscal 2011 tax rate to be approximately 37.3%.
As Bill mentioned in his opening comments, we completed our authorized share buyback program by purchasing 7.6 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $202 million. And we did not incur any added debt as a result of these purchases. Since the purchases began at the latter part of the first quarter, these share buybacks did not impact our first quarter diluted earnings per share. As a result of completing our authorized share buyback program, we have now acquired 27.9 million shares since May of 2005, for a total cost of $1 billion. Primarily as a result of the completion of the share buyback program, our cash and marketable securities decreased $197 million to $369 million at August 31. We also increased our capital expenditures and acquisitions during the quarter.
The steadily improving economic conditions provided some incentive to begin returning to historical levels. Accounts receivable increased by $18 million since May 31, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable were 40, a slight decrease from last quarter's 42. However, we did have a slight deterioration in our aging since May 31, which caused the higher bad-debt expense mentioned earlier. Our August 31 aging though, is consistent with the aging of a year ago.
New goods inventory at August 31 was $184 million, up $15 million from May 31, mainly due to planning for the increased volume levels in the fall season. This balance is relatively consistent with the total at the end of last year's first quarter. Uniforms and other rental items and service increased by $15 million from May 31 to August 31, due to the higher volume levels throughout the first quarter. Accrued liability decreased $24 million compared to May 31, due to the payment of our annual profit-sharing contribution and other benefit-related accruals and scheduled bond interest payments.
Long-term debt at August 31 was $787 million. Any early retirement of this debt would require a prepayment penalty and is not currently attractive. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is approximately 6%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 24%, while net debt or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization was 14%.
Turning to our cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities was $35 million, a decrease from $145 million in last year's first quarter. Last year's cash flow benefited from lower working capital needs, associated with our decreasing volumes and the accrual of the legal settlement. This year, the increase in revenue levels have increased our working capital needs, such as increase inventory levels and higher accounts receivable balances.
CapEx for the first quarter was $48 million, including $15 million for our SAP conversion. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $23 million in Rental; $2 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $8 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $15 million in Document Management. The CapEx associated with the SAP conversion was largely in Document Management and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection operating segments.
We invested $48 million in the first quarter on strategic acquisitions, this includes the Document Management business in the U.K., which we announced in July, and also of several other smaller acquisitions in our Facility Services business, our Document Management business and our First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services business. We will continue to evaluate acquisition candidates as opportunities arise. That concludes our prepared remarks and we will now take any of your questions."

So we've had very little pricing improvement over the last year or so in our Rental business, due to the fact that there's basically no inflation. With regard to renewals, we're finding that to be the most competitive situation that we're running into. Our customers, when they're at the end of their contract terms, are vigorously approached by our competitors, and it has resulted in a more competitive environment than we have seen. We've been talking about that for some time, and that has continued into and through this first quarter. I talked to our salespeople with regard to new business, and while we have more competitive situation that we've had in the past, we haven't seen the degree of pricing pressure on brand new business that we see in renewals of our existing customers. So overall, to answer your question, we had very little impact in our revenue during the quarter from increased pricing.

We told everyone on prior calls that we continue to be active looking for acquisitions, but we were very disciplined. We wanted to make sure we didn't overpay in a declining economic environment, and it's very difficult to predict exactly when things will develop. But we saw a nice quarter of closures. And as a result of that, we're very happy with these acquisitions. None of them really, are large in and of themselves. The biggest one of course, was the one we talked about in July, and that's still a modest in size. The one that's in the United Kingdom, the Document Storage business. So right now, I would say that the acquisition pipeline is very active, we're continuing to pursue a number of targets. None of which though at this point or any of significant size, but I would certainly expect there to be more acquisitions made throughout the rest of this year. Regarding the Document Management business, continues to be a very good business for us, we're working diligently on expanding our footprint across North America and into Northern Europe. We're continuing to make small acquisitions in markets that we're not in, as well as acquisition to markets we are in, where we can tuck them in. And then it continues to be a very, very good business. The environment, as such that the paper prices remain high, therefore a lot of little competitors are being very price aggressive with our customers, because they're after the paper so they can get the recycled price, which is at relatively good levels. But it's a great business, continues to be small relative to our other businesses, but we have a lot of very positive feelings toward this business going forward and how it will continue to grow."

We saw reven",545,"Good evening, and thank you for joining Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer and myself for our first quarter of fiscal 2011 earnings conference call. Cintas reported today growth in revenues and net income for the first quarter. We saw revenue growth in each of our operating segments. Overall revenue growth was 3.6% compared to last year. Revenues were also approximately 1.7% higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, a quarter with the same number of work days as this quarter. Earnings per share were $0.40 this year compared to last year's $0.35 per share. Last year's first quarter earnings did include an $0.08 charge for a legal settlement on wage and hour litigation.
During the quarter, and continuing into September, the company purchased 7.6 million shares of its stock. Most of these purchases were made under a 10b-5 filing that went into effect when the company entered a quiet period in mid-August. The company made these purchases from cash and did not incur any debt. At August 31, 2010, Cintas had $369 million in cash and marketable securities. Of this amount, approximately $167 million is outside the U.S., resulting from cash flow from non-US operating units, leaving about $202 million of U.S. cash and marketable securities and no short-term debt.
In September, $72 million of the August 31, 2010 cash, was used for share purchases. This completes the authorization for share purchases by the Board. The Board will determine at its future meetings, whether any additional authorizations will be given. As noted in our release, the share purchases had no impact on earnings per share in the first quarter, but will increase earnings per share by about $0.05 over the rest of the year. As a result, while revenue guidance for the year remains unchanged from that provided in July, our earnings per share guidance is increased by $0.05 per share on both the lower and upper end of the range given in July.
We are encouraged with the recent modest growth, and we believe that the North American economy will continue to improve at a relatively slow pace. As a result, Cintas will continue to focus on taking care of its customers by providing valued products and services. In addition, we will continue to enhance our existing customer relations by providing additional products and services, as well as seeking out new customers in all of our business lines. 
Finally, we will focus on cost control and investment in acquisitions, our capital investment, that meet the appropriate return criteria. As a reminder, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, provides a safe harbor from civil litigations for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views, as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our almost recent filings with the SEC, as well as in the press release issued today, announcing our first quarter 2011 results. I will now turn the call over to Mike Hansen, who will discuss this quarter's results in more detail. We will then be happy to answer your questions."

Total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was $924 million, representing a 3.6% increase from the first quarter of last year. Total company internal growth was 2.8%. As Bill mentioned, each operating segment's revenue grew compar",1719,"Thank you, Bill. Total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was $924 million, representing a 3.6% increase from the first quarter of last year. Total company internal growth was 2.8%. As Bill mentioned, each operating segment's revenue grew compared to last year, both in total and organically. Before discussing the quarter in more detail, please note that our fiscal 2011 workdays are the same as last year. That means there are 66 workdays in the first quarter, 65 in the second quarter, 64 in Q3 and 66 in Q4.
We have four reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services.
Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the first quarter. Rental revenue was $657.6 million for the quarter, which is relatively flat compared to last year's first quarter, but up 1.5% compared to the quarter ended May 31. Internal growth was 0.1% over last year, which is also an improvement from last quarter's internal growth of negative 1.1%. The steady revenue improvement that we saw in the fourth quarter continued through our first quarter. The modest U.S. private-sector job growth continued in the first quarter. In addition, the focus of our sales force of adding new customers and penetrating existing customer accounts, positively impacted our first quarter rental revenue. Our wearers increased for the second straight quarter and our new business and net add stops improved over the fourth quarter levels.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct-sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the first quarter. First quarter revenue of $98.8 million, represents an increase of 10.6% compared to last year's first quarter. Internal growth was also 10.6%.
We are encouraged that our Uniform Direct Sales customers have shown a willingness to spend uniform dollars on new hires and new programs. Our revenue growth over last year for our Global Accounts and Strategic Markets division was a broad improvement, in which we saw large national accounts, as well as lodging, hospitality and gaming customers increased spending.
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the first quarter. During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment increased 3.9% versus last year's first quarter. Internal growth was 2.2%. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue increased sequentially over the fourth quarter by 6.4%. This sequential improvement came in both First Aid and Safety and in Fire Protection.
Our Document Management services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document Management accounted for 8% of first quarter total company revenue. Revenue increased 30.7% over last year's first quarter, with internal growth of 23.2%. Recycled paper prices remained at historically elevated levels during the quarter. Internal growth for Document Management services, excluding the recycled paper revenue, was 10.6%.
Moving on to margins. Total company gross margin for the first quarter was 42.6%, a decrease compared to last year's gross margin of 42.9%. This decrease is due to a 10 basis point increase in energy-related costs, and a 35 basis point increase in maintenance costs. As our volumes declined during the past two years, we reduced maintenance on certain equipment and trucks not needed for the declining capacity requirements. Consequently, as volume now increases, we have some higher maintenance requirements. We expect this increased level may continue into the second quarter as well. The gross margin of 42.6% did represent a slight increase over the 42.4% gross margin for the quarter ended May 31. First quarter energy-related costs were down 15 basis points from the fourth quarter level.
Rental gross margins of 43.5% were down 110 basis points from last year's first quarter, and the same as that of the quarter ended May 31. Regarding comparisons to last year, energy-related costs were 15 basis points higher this year, and as just discussed, our maintenance costs increased 40 basis points. Other Services' gross margin was 40.4% for the quarter, as compared to 38.2% in last year's first quarter and 39.8% for the quarter ended May 31. Compared to last year, the Other Services gross margin improvement was due to an improved Document Management gross margin, resulting primarily from the higher paper prices and an improved First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection gross margin, resulting from better sales mix in both First Aid and Safety and in Fire Protection.
Selling and administrative expenses were 31.8% of revenue, an increase from 29.7% for the first quarter last year. Selling expenses were up 110 basis points higher than last year's first quarter. As we've discussed on the last few calls, we had a planned increase in our sales force during mid-fiscal 2010, as a result of the stabilization that we saw in the economy. Going forward, we expect our selling expenses to stabilize and start to come down as a percent of sales, as revenue levels continue to increase.
In addition to the increase in selling expense, professional service expenses increased 20 basis points compared to last year, due to our enterprise-wide system conversion, and bad debt expense increased by 40 basis points, due to a slight deterioration in our aging. Please keep in mind that our bad-debt expense and allowance for doubtful accounts are based on a consistent application of our established accounts receivable policy, which includes specific reserve percentages for each aging category.
Sequentially, SG&A increased from the quarter ended May 31, due to an 80 basis point increase in bad-debt expense. Please keep in mind that last year's first quarter included a legal settlement amounting to $19.5 million pretax, net of insurance proceeds. Our effective tax rate was 30.8% for the quarter compared to 38.1% last year. This rate was positively impacted by the closure of various tax audits in the quarter. Due to the timing of specific reserve builds and releases under FIN 48, our effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. We still expect our fiscal 2011 tax rate to be approximately 37.3%.
As Bill mentioned in his opening comments, we completed our authorized share buyback program by purchasing 7.6 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $202 million. And we did not incur any added debt as a result of these purchases. Since the purchases began at the latter part of the first quarter, these share buybacks did not impact our first quarter diluted earnings per share. As a result of completing our authorized share buyback program, we have now acquired 27.9 million shares since May of 2005, for a total cost of $1 billion. Primarily as a result of the completion of the share buyback program, our cash and marketable securities decreased $197 million to $369 million at August 31. We also increased our capital expenditures and acquisitions during the quarter.
The steadily improving economic conditions provided some incentive to begin returning to historical levels. Accounts receivable increased by $18 million since May 31, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable were 40, a slight decrease from last quarter's 42. However, we did have a slight deterioration in our aging since May 31, which caused the higher bad-debt expense mentioned earlier. Our August 31 aging, though, is consistent with the aging of a year ago.
New goods inventory at August 31 was $184 million, up $15 million from May 31, mainly due to planning for the increased volume levels in the fall season. This balance is relatively consistent with the total at the end of last year's first quarter. Uniforms and other rental items and service increased by $15 million from May 31 to August 31, due to the higher volume levels throughout the first quarter. Accrued liability decreased $24 million compared to May 31, due to the payment of our annual profit-sharing contribution and other benefit-related accruals and scheduled bond interest payments.
Long-term debt at August 31 was $787 million. Any early retirement of this debt would require a prepayment penalty and is not currently attractive. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is approximately 6%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 24%, while net debt or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization was 14%.
Turning to our cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities was $35 million, a decrease from $145 million in last year's first quarter. Last year's cash flow benefited from lower working capital needs, associated with our decreasing volumes and the accrual of the legal settlement. This year, the increase in revenue levels have increased our working capital needs, such as increase inventory levels and higher accounts receivable balances.
CapEx for the first quarter was $48 million, including $15 million for our SAP conversion. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $23 million in Rental; $2 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $8 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $15 million in Document Management. The CapEx associated with the SAP conversion was largely in Document Management and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection operating segments.
We invested $48 million in the first quarter on strategic acquisitions, This includes the Document Management business in the U.K., which we announced in July, and also of several other smaller acquisitions in our Facility Services business, our Document Management business and our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services business. We will continue to evaluate acquisition candidates as opportunities arise. That concludes our prepared remarks and we will now take any of your questions."

I know there are sort of two pieces to pricing, what I'll call kind of the ordinary, annual pricing that will happen in the middle of a contract. And I actually think, during your fiscal first quarter that we just completed, there might be kind of an aggregation of some of that, typically in this season. And then of course, there's prices that come into play when contracts are renewed. And that's usually the more competitive side of the equation. If you could talk about kind of both sides of pricing, what I'll call kind of the annual pricing versus the competitive contract renewal or new business, and when you put those two together, is net pricing still positive?"

So we've had very little pricing improvement over the last year or so in our Rental business, due to the fact that there's basically no inflation. With regard to renewals, we're finding that to be the most competitive situation that we're running into. Our customers, when they're at the end of their contract terms, are vigorously approached by our competitors, and it has resulted in a more competitive environment than we have seen. We've been talking about that for some time, and that has continued into and through this first quarter. I talked to our salespeople with regard to new business, and while we have more competitive situation that we've had in the past, we haven't seen the degree of pricing pressure on brand new business that we see in renewals of our existing customers. So overall, to answer your question, we had very little impact in our revenue during the quarter from increased pricing. I would say that, basically, pricing for our services in the Rental business is probably flat compared to where it was over the last 12 months."

We told everyone on prior calls that we continue to be active looking for acquisitions, but we were very disciplined. We wanted to make sure we didn't overpay in a declining economic environment, and it's very difficult to predict exactly when things will develop. But we saw a nice quarter of closures. And as a result of that, we're very happy with these acquisitions. None of them really, are large in and of themselves. The biggest one of course, was the one we talked about in July, and that's still a modest in size. The one that's in the United Kingdom, the Document Storage business. So right now, I would say that the acquisition pipeline is very active, we're continuing to pursue a number of targets. None of which though at this point or any of significant size, but I would certainly expect there to be more acquisitions made throughout the rest of this year. Regarding the Document Management business, continues to be a very good business for us, we're working diligently on expanding our footprint across North America and into Northern Europe. We're continuing to make small acquisitions in markets that we're not in, as well as acquisitions in markets we are in, where we can tuck them in. And it continues to be a very, very good business. The environment is such that the paper prices remain high, therefore a lot of little competitors are being very price aggressive with their customers, because they're after the paper so they can get the recycled price, which is at relatively good levels. But it's a great business, continues to be small relative to our other businesses, but we have a lot of very positive feelings toward this business going forward and how it will continue to grow."

So there's still continued expansion. Just because we're in one city today doesn't mean that we can't add two or three more facilities within that same geographic area. So we will continue to look for that. I think we evaluate whether it makes sense just to continue to follow our branch and plan spoke scheme or to look for a tuck-in acquisition like we did when we bought Van Dyne Crotty here a few years ago. So there are a number of ways to do it. And as employment has finally stabilized, and now is beginning to show some life and some growth, and we think that you'll begin to start seeing some of those expansions in the areas as we go forward.

Cintas reported today growth in revenues and net income for the first quarter. We saw revenue growth in each of our operating segments. Overall revenue growth was 3.6% compared to last year. Revenues were also approximately 1.7% higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, a quarter with the same number of work days as this quarter.
Earnings per share were $0.40 this year compared to last year’s $0.35 per share. Last year’s first quarter earnings did include an $0.08 charge for a legal statement on wage and hour litigation.
During the quarter and continuing into September, the Company purchased 7.6 million shares of its stock. Most of these purchases were made under a 10b5 filing that went into effect when the Company entered quiet period in mid-August. The Company made these purchases from cash and did not incur any debt.
At August 31st, 2010, Cintas has $369 million in cash and marketable securities. Of this amount approximately $167 million is outside the U.S., resulting from cash flow from non-U.S. operating units, leaving about $202 million of U.S. cash and marketable securities and no short term debt.
In September, $72 million of the August 31st, 2010, cash was used for share purchases. This completes the authorization for share purchases by the board. The board will determine at its future meetings whether any additional authorizations will be given. As noted in our release, the share purchases had no impact on earnings per share in the first quarter, but will increase earnings per share by about $0.05 over the rest of the year.
As a result, while revenue guidance for the year remains unchanged from that provided in July, our earnings per share guidance is increased by $0.05 per share on both the lower and upper end of the range given in July. We are encouraged with the recent modest growth and we believe that the North American economy will continue to improve at a relatively slow pace.
As a result, Cintas will continue to focus on taking care of its customers by providing valued products and services. In addition, we will continue to enhance our existing customer relations by providing additional products and services as well as seeking out new customers in all of our business lines. Finally, we will focus on cost control and investment in acquisitions, our capital investment that meet the appropriate return criteria.
As a reminder, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigations for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company’s current views as to future events and financial performances. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent flings with the SEC as well as in the press release issued today announcing our first quarter 2011 results.
I will now turn the call over to Mike Hansen who will discuss this quarter’s results in more detail. We will then be happy to answer your questions.

Total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was $924 million, representing a 3.6% increase from the first quarter of last year. Total company internal growth was 2.8%. As Bill mentioned, each operating segment’s revenue grew compared to last year, both in total and organically.
Before discussing the quarter in more detail, please note that our fiscal 2011 work days are the same as last year. That means there are 66 work days in the first quarter, 65 in the second quarter, 64 in Q3, and 66 in Q4.
We have four reportable operating segments
Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services, and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services, and Document Management Services are combined and presented as Other Services on the face of the income statement.
The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental servicing of uniforms, mats, towels, and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of Company revenue in the first quarter. Rental revenue was $657.6 million for the quarter, which is relatively flat compared to last year’s first quarter, but up 1.5% compared to - ended May 31st. Internal growth was 0.1% over last year, which is also an improvement from last quarter’s internal growth of negative 1.1%.
The steady revenue improvement that we saw in the fourth quarter continued through our first quarter. The modest U.S. private sectors job growth continued in the first quarter. In addition, the focus of our sales of adding new customers and penetrating existing customer accounts positively impacted our first quarter rental revenue. Our wearers increased for the second straight quarter and our new business and net add/tops over the fourth quarter levels.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of Company revenue in the first quarter.
First quarter revenue of $98.8 million represents an increase of 10.6%, compared to last year’s first quarter. Internal growth was also 10.6%. We are encouraged that our Uniform Direct Sales customers have shown a willingness to spend uniform dollars on new hires and new programs. Our revenue growth over last year for our global accounts and strategic markets division was a broad improvement in which we saw large national accounts as well as lodging, hospitality and gaming customer increase spending.
Our First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training, and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of Company revenue in the first quarter.
During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment increased 3.9% versus last year’s first quarter. Internal growth was 2.2%. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue increased sequentially over the fourth quarter by 6.4%. This sequential improvement came in both first aid and safety and in fire protection.
Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document management accounted for 8% of first quarter total Company revenue. Revenue increased 30.7% over last year’s first quarter with internal growth of 23.2%.
Recycled paper prices remained at historically elevated levels during the quarter. Internal growth for Document Management Services excluding the recycled paper revenue was 10.6%.
Moving on to margins, total Company gross margin for the first quarter was 42.6%, a decrease compared to last year’s gross margin of 42.9%. This decrease is due to a 10 basis points increase in energy related costs and a 35 basis point increase in maintenance costs. As our volumes declined during the past two years, we reduced maintenance on certain equipments and trucks not needed for the declining capacity requirements. Consequently, as volume now increases, we have some higher maintenance requirements. We expect this increased level may continue into the second quarter as well.
The gross margin of 42.6% did represent a slight increase over e 42.4% gross margin for the quarter ended May 31st. First quarter energy related costs were down 15 basis points from the fourth quarter level. Rental gross margins of 43.5% were down 110 basis points from last year’s first quarter and the same as that of the quarter ended May 31st. Regarding comparison to last year, energy related costs were 15 basis points higher this year and as just discussed our maintenance cost increased 40 basis points.
Other services gross margin was 40.4% for the quarter as compared to 38.2% in last year’s first quarter, and 39.8% for the quarter ended May 31st. Compared to last year, the Other Services gross margin improvement was due to an improved document management gross margin, resulting primarily from the high paper prices and an improved First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection gross margin resulting from better sales mix in both first aid and safety and in fire protection.
Selling and administrative expenses were 31.8% of revenue, an increase from 29.7% for the first quarter last year. Selling expenses were up 110 basis points higher than last year’s first quarter. As we’ve discussed on the last few calls, we had a planned increase in our sales force during mid-fiscal 2010 as a result of the stabilization that we saw in the economy. Going forward, we expect our selling expenses to stabilize and start to come down as a percent of sales as revenue levels continue to increase.
In addition to the increase in selling, professional service expenses increased 20 basis points compared to last year due to our enterprise wide system conversion. And bad debt expense increased by 40 basis points due to a slight deterioration in our aging. Please keep in mind that our bad debt expense and allowance for doubtful accounts are based on a consistent application of our established accounts receivable policy, which includes specific reserve percentages for each aging category.
Sequentially, SG&A increased from the quarter ended May 31st, due to an 80 basis points increase in bad debt expense. Please keep in mind that last year’s first quarter included a legal settlement amounting to $19.5 million pretax net of insurance proceeds.
Our effective tax rate was 30.8% for the quarter compared to 38.1% last year. This rate was impacted by the closure of various tax audits in the quarter. Due to the timing of specific reserves builds and releases under FIN 48, our effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We still expect our fiscal 2011 tax rate to be approximately 37.3%.
As Bill mentioned in his opening comments, we completed our authorized share buyback program by purchasing 7.6 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $202 million. And we did not incur any added debt as a result of these purchases. Since the purchases began at the latter part of the first quarter, these share buybacks did not impact our first quarter diluted earnings per share.
As a result of completing our authorized share buyback program, we have now acquired 27.9 million shares since May of 2005 for a total cost of $1 billion. Primarily as a result of the completion of the share buyback program, our cash and marketable securities decreased $197 million to $369 million at August 31st. We also increased our capital expenditures and acquisitions during the quarter. The steadily improving economic conditions provided some incentive to begin returning to historical levels.
Accounts receivable increased by $18 million since May 31st, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable were 40, a slight decrease from last quarter’s 42. However, we did have a slight deterioration in our aging since May 31st, which caused the higher bad debt expense mentioned earlier. Our August 31st aging though is consistent with the aging of a year ago.
New goods inventory at August 31st was $184 million, up $15 million from May 31st, mainly due to planning for the increased volume levels and the fall season. This balance is relatively consistent with the total at the end of last year’s first quarter.
Uniforms and other rental items in service increased by $15 million from May 31st to August 31st due to the higher volume levels throughout the first quarter. Accrued liabilities decreased $24 million compared to May 31st due to the payment of our annual profit-sharing contribution and other benefit related accruals and scheduled bond interest payments.
Long term debt at August 31st was $787 million. Any early retirement of this debt would require a pre-payment penalty and is not currently attractive. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is approximately 6%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 24% while net debt or long term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization was 14%.
Turning to our cash flow, cash provided by operating activities was $35 million, a decrease from $145 million in last year’s first quarter. Last year’s cash flow benefitted from lower working capital needs associated with our decrease in volumes and the accrual of the legal statement. This year the increase in revenue levels have increased our working capital needs such as increased inventory levels and higher accounts receivable balances.
CapEx for the first quarter was $48 million including $15 million for our SAP conversion. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows
$23 million in Rental, $2 Million in Uniform Direct Sales, $8 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection, and $15 million in Document Management. The CapEx associated with the SAP conversion was largely in Document Management and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection operating segments.
We invested $48 million in the first quarter on strategic acquisitions. This includes the Document Management business in the U.K., which we announced in July and also several other smaller acquisitions in our Facility Services business, our Document Management business and our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services business. We will continue to evaluate acquisition candidates as opportunities arise.

I know there is sort of two pieces to pricing, what I will call kind of the ordinary annual pricing that will happen in the middle of a contract and I actually think during your fiscal first quarter that we just completed there might be kind of an aggregation of some of that typically in this season. And then of course there is prices that come into play when contracts are renewed. That’s usually the more competitive side the equation. If you could talk about kind of both sides of pricing, what I will call kind of the annual pricing versus the competitive contract renewal or new business, and when you put those tow together is net pricing still positive.

So we’ve had - we’ve got - we’ve had very little pricing improvement over the last year or so in our rental business due to the fact that there is basically no inflation.
With regard to renewals, we are finding that to be the most competitive situation that we are running into. Our customers, when they are at the end of their contract terms are vigorously approached by our competitors and it has resulted in a more competitive environment than we have seen. We have been talking about that for some time, and that has continued into and through this first quarter. I talked to our sales people with regard to new business, and while we have more competitive situations than we’ve had in the past, we haven’t seen the degree of pricing pressure on brand new business that we see in renewals of our existing customers.
So, overall, to answer your question, we had very little impact in our revenue during the quarter from increased pricing. I would say that basically pricing for our services in the rental business is probably flat compared to where it was over the last 12 months.

You know, we told everyone on prior calls that we continue to be active looking for acquisitions, but we were very disciplined, we wanted to make sure we didn’t overpay in a declining economic environment, and it’s very difficult to predict exactly when things will develop, but we saw a nice quarter of closures and as a result of that we are very happy with these acquisitions. None of them really are large in and of themselves. The biggest one of course was the one we talked about in July and that’s still modest in size: the one that’s in the United Kingdom, the document storage business. So, right now, I would say that the acquisition pipeline is very active. We are continuing to pursue a number of targets, none of which though at this point are any significant size, but I would certainly expect there to be more acquisitions made throughout the rest of this year.
Regarding the Document Management Business, continues to be a very good business for us. We are working diligently on expanding our footprint across North America and into northern Europe. We are continuing to make all acquisitions in markets that we are not in as well as acquisitions in markets that we are in where we can tuck them in. And it continues to be a very good business. The environment is such that the - paper prices remain high. Therefore, a lot of little competitors are being very price aggressive with their customers because they are after the paper so they can get the recycled price, which was set relatively good level. So - but it’s a great business, continues to be small relative to our other businesses, but we have a lot of very positive feelings towards this business going forward in how it will continue to grow.

I think Cintas is a little bit more aggressive going after local business as we continue to develop our footprint around the country. Our biggest competitive situation right now though rests primarily with the smaller players in all the market that we are at. And as I mentioned, they are being very aggressive on their pricing because they are after the paper itself to sell it to the recycler. So, while we certainly are going to continue to pursue business growth, we want to cautious that we don’t destroy the market by driving prices too far down. So, we think some of this is short term competitive situation on the part of some of the smaller players.
But even with that you could see our margins were still very good. We’re still continuing to grow that business and we still have a long way to go to really fill out our footprint and grow the relatively small size businesses we have throughout the United States into much bigger entities within each of those markets.

It’s very small right now. We are in about 50 markets, usually with just one or two trucks within those markets, but we are finding great reception on the part of many large institutions that have been looking for a provider that can take care of their carpets and tiles and refurbish them to the point where they don’t have to replace them as quickly as they need, primarily in the hospitality and in schools, colleges, convention centers, that sort of thing. So that’s - that is one big area that we are in and then I’d say the other one in our rental business, because we are not - we certainly don’t give up on the uniform rental business is we have now a relationship with a provider of garments called Carhartt, which is a very loyal customer base that is primarily serving outdoors type activities. We now have developed a rental garment that we are having some great success in penetrating new customers with - and as well as existing customers at higher prices and we think that this is - that will be a significant advantage going forward. We are chemical dispensing, which is doing very well. So, I would say all of our businesses are looking for opportunities, but those three that I mentioned seem to be - have quite a bit of momentum right now.

Net income was $55.9 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.38. Our tax rate in the second quarter was 38.3% versus 30.8% in our first quarter. The first quarter tax rate reflected the release of certain caps reserves resulting from the resolution of several tax audits. As we mentioned in our first quarter call, we expect that the tax rate to be higher in the second through fourth quarters.
While unemployment continues to be stubbornly high, we are encouraged that business confidence has appeared to turn the corner. We had seen the third consecutive quarter of increased wearers in our Uniform Rental business, and our Direct Sales business posted another good growth quarter. Our emerging businesses of First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection and Document Management had good revenue increases also.
We continue to reiterate the guidance we provided at the beginning of the fiscal year and updated at the end of the first quarter for the share buyback. We expect our revenues to be between $3.55 billion and $3.75 billion and our earnings per share to be between $1.55 and $1.63. Our financial condition remains very strong. While we did use approximately $200 million of our U.S. cash to purchase our stock, we still have sufficient borrowing capacity as well as sufficient cash outside the U.S. to fund our growth initiatives. The Board of Directors also gave us another $500 million share authorization in late October to be used as directed by the board if market conditions warrant. But not of that authorization has been used as at this time.
Cintas paid its annual dividend of $0.49 per share on December 15, approximately three months earlier than our traditional March date. The dividend was increased from the $0.48 paid last year, the 28th consecutive year we have increased our annual dividend since we went public in 1983.
The last couple of years had been very difficult for the U.S. economy with the loss of millions of jobs. While it could take some time for employment to return to prerecession levels, we are encouraged by some of the positive signs that are appearing. Generally speaking, our customers' businesses have stabilized their workforces and appeared to be on the verge of modestly expanding.
We also are very appreciative of the efforts of all of our employees who we call partners, who made it their mission to take care of our customers and to continue to keep Cintas profitable and cash flow-positive during the difficult past few years.
We see growth opportunities with all of our business segments. We believe that with the growth, as well as the ongoing productivity initiatives underway in the company, we will continue to see margin improvement and positive operating cash flow.

260725,117028827,91052,"Cintas Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Dec 21, 2010",2010-12-21,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill. Total revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was $936.6 million, representing a 5.9% increase from the second quarter last year. Total company internal growth was 4.2%, an increase from the 2.8% internal growth in our first quarter",1850,"Thank you, Bill. Total revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was $936.6 million, representing a 5.9% increase from the second quarter last year. Total company internal growth was 4.2%, an increase from the 2.8% internal growth in our first quarter. Each operating segments revenue grew compared to last year, both in total and organically. Before discussing the quarter in more detail, please note that our fiscal 2011 workdays are the same as last year. That means there were 65 days in the second quarter, and there will be 64 in Q3 and 66 in Q4.
We have four reportable operating segments, Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, maps, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services.
Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 70% of company revenue in the second quarter. Rental revenue was $657.8 million for the quarter, which was up 2.2% compared to last year's second quarter. Internal growth was 1.9% over last year, which is an improvement from last quarter's internal growth of 0.1%. Our revenue momentum of the last few quarters continued in our second quarter. The modest U.S. private-sector job growth in the second quarter positively impacted our business. In addition, the productivity of our sales force continue to improve. This improvement was due to the impact of new products and services like Carhartt and our tile and carpet service and was due to improved rep tenure. As you may recall, we increased our investment in sales about a year ago and has seen steady productivity improvements since then as new reps become more efficient.
In addition to the productivity improvements, our account retention improved compared to last year and compared to this year's first quarter. The stabilization of the economy has certainly helped, but we have also been very focused at providing outstanding customer service.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 12% of company revenue in the second quarter. Second quarter revenue of $108.8 million represents an increase of 9.4% compared to last year's second quarter. Internal growth was also 9.4%.
Our Uniform Direct Sales business have showed a nice rebound over the past three quarters. As in the first quarter, this rebound continued to be a broad improvement in which we saw large national account customers, as well as lodging, hospitality and gaming customers increased spending.
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the second quarter. During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment were $93.3 million, an increase of 14.4% versus last year's second quarter. Internal growth was 8.4%, a strong improvement over the first quarter internal growth rate of 2.2%. Both First Aid and Safety and Fire Protection Services internal growth improved relative to the first quarter, and the Fire Protection Services internal growth was in double digits. Fire benefited from an improving economic environment, growth in our national accounts business and greater sales team productivity.
Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document Management accounted for 8% of second quarter total company revenue. Revenue increased 27.9% over last year's second quarter to $76.6 million, with internal growth of 14.7%. While this is still very positive internal growth, it is a decrease from the first quarter internal growth of 23.2%. Much of this decrease in growth rate relates to recycled paper revenues. The price of recycled paper increased significantly during last year's second quarter and has remained at historically elevated level since that time. As a result, we have started to anniversary that large increase, thereby reducing our recycled paper revenue growth rate. If the recycled paper prices continue at current levels into our third quarter, we will see some further slowing of the growth rate.
Moving onto margins. Total company gross margin for the second quarter was 41.7%, which is in line with last year's second quarter gross margin of 41.8%. Energy-related costs were up 15 basis points, and as was the case in our first quarter, our maintenance expenses were up 25 basis points. The gross margin of 41.7% decrease compared to 42.6% gross margin for the first quarter. This decrease was largely due to having one less workday in the second quarter compared to the first. An example of the workday impact is that our in-service inventory material cost is based on a monthly amortization schedule, so we essentially have the same expenses as the first quarter, but one less revenue-generating day. We experienced a similar decrease, in that case 110 basis points, from last year's first quarter to the second quarter.
Rental gross margin of 42.6% was down 90 basis points from last year's second quarter. Higher energy and maintenance expenses accounted for 50 of the 90 basis points. The remaining decrease is due to higher material cost as our wearers have increased over the past three quarters and new business results accelerate, we have injected more garments into our in-service inventory. The rental gross margin of 42.6% was also a decrease from the 43.5% in our first fiscal quarter. As already discussed, this decrease is largely driven by one less workday in our second quarter.
Other services gross margin was 39.6% for the quarter as compared to 37.3% in last year's second quarter. All three of the operating segments within other services improved, with Fire Protection Services improving the most due to the elimination of installation work. All businesses also benefited from higher volumes this year.
Relative to the first quarter, the other services gross margin of 39.6% was a decrease of 80 basis points. This is primarily due to the Document Management Services gross margin, which decreased by 180 basis points from the first quarter for a few different reasons. Our European Document Management business, which now accounts for roughly 14% of our total Document Management business, had a decrease in its gross margin due to various initial expenses associated with our recent acquisitions. Our storage business had several Greenfield starts this fiscal year. And lastly, our imaging services business is primarily a project-based business, which makes the margins more volatile from quarter to quarter.
Selling and administrative expenses in the second quarter were 30.8% of revenue. This is a 100 basis point decrease from the 31.8% of revenue in the first quarter. A number of different areas contributed to this decrease including G&A, labor and medical expenses. Selling expenses, as a percent of revenue, were similar to the first quarter. The selling and administrative expense of 30.8% of revenue was an increase from the 29.3% for the second quarter last year. Selling expenses were 60 basis points higher than last year's second quarter. As we've discussed on the last few calls, we had a planned increase in our sales force during mid-fiscal 2010 as a result of the stabilization that we saw in the economy. In addition to the increase in selling expenses, professional service expenses increased 30 basis points due to our enterprise-wide system conversion, and bad debt expense was 20 basis points higher than last year due to a slight deterioration in our aging compared to last year.
Please keep in mind that last year's second quarter included a legal settlement amounting to $4.1 million pretax, net of insurance proceeds.
Our effective tax rate was 38.3% for the quarter compared to 39.3% last year due to the timing of specific reserve builds and releases under FIN 48, our effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We expect our fiscal 2011 effective tax rate to be approximately 37.3%.
Our cash and marketable securities were $285 million at November 30, a decrease of $85 million from August 31, 2010. As we discussed last quarter, we used $72 million in September for the execution of our share buyback program.
Accounts receivable increased by $18 million since August 31, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable remained at 40, the same as at August 31. New goods inventory at November 30 was $208 million, up $24 million from August 31. We will be converting our global supply chain to the SAP system in our third quarter as part of our company conversion to the enterprise-wide resource system. In anticipation of this and as a precaution, we have intentionally built up inventory levels prior to the conversion. We have also built up our Carhartt and our flame-resistant clothing inventory levels.
Uniforms and other rental items and service increased by $17 million from August 31 to November 30 due to the higher volume levels throughout the second quarter. Accrued liabilities increased $101 million compared to August 31 due to the $72 million accrual of the dividend, which was paid on December 15 and increased bondage and accrued profit sharing. Long-term debt at November 30 remained at $787 million. Any early retirement of this debt would require a prepayment penalty and is not currently attractive. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is approximately 6%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 25%, while net debt or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization was 17%.
Turning to our cash flow, cash provided by operating activities was $74 million for the second quarter, a decrease from $149 million in last year's second quarter. Last year's cash flow benefited from lower working capital needs associated with our decrease in volumes and the accrual of the legal settlements. This year, the increase in revenue levels have increased our working capital needs, such as increased inventory levels and higher accounts receivable balances. The second quarter cash provided by operating activities of $74 million was an increase over the first quarter's $35 million.
CapEx for the second quarter was $40 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $27 million in Rental; $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $5 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $7 million in Document Management. We invested $41 million in the second quarter on strategic acquisitions. This includes a number of small acquisitions in our Document Management business and our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services business. We will continue to evaluate acquisition candidates as opportunities arise. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions."

When you then think about that cost of the garment being amortized over 18 months, it almost acts like a natural hedge such that cotton costs need to be elevated for quite a long period of time before it has a significant impact on us. So we don't expect that big of an impact on us this fiscal year, but certainly, we're keeping our eyes on it, and we are working with our vendors to minimize the impact to us. As it relates to passing those costs on, we feel pretty good about the ability to do so to our customers. There is a lot of talk about this increase in cost, and I think it's a reasonable thing to do, to pass that on at some point. In the energy area, especially with gasoline, John, it's something that we're having to keep our eyes on. We do believe that if the gasoline prices continue to increase, we will have the ability to pass along those increases through our price increases tends to be a bit of a lag, but we'll be able to recoup that as we go forward, we expect at this time."

And I think that what we have seen for the last several quarters have continued and that our competitors in all of our business lines are looking to grow their own businesses. And as such, they have been aggressively going after our customers, as well as customers who are looking for the service from a number of different providers. So the competitive environment has not really changed in terms of aggressive pricing. I would say it has not gotten any more aggressive, but it certainly, there's not a lot of ability to get increased prices on new business at this time, in difference to what we've seen over the last several quarters."

As far as use of cash, I think the attitude is that we will continue to use our cash to grow our businesses. We are going to look for good acquisitions if we have the appropriate internal rates of return that we require, but the board did issue another authorization on the share buyback, depending upon what the availability is of acquisition opportunities, as well as the market conditions of our stock.

That is new customers or new products at existing customers. We have not really seen a significant amount of growth of like where is within our customers. There's been some of that, but not a significant amount. What we've seen is not further deterioration. So right now, it's mostly new storefronts that we're seeing the growth from.

The Rental margins themselves, I would be a little too optimistic to say we could can get back to pre-2005, 2004 levels because it's difficult to assume that all of the cost increases that we now have incurred is the result of a much higher medical costs, higher energy cost, expensing of stock options, it's not exactly expensive.

With me today is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some comments on the quarter's results, we will open the call to questions. For the quarter ending November 30, 2010, total revenue was $",658,"Good evening, and thank you for joining us. With me today is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some comments on the quarter's results, we will open the call to questions. For the quarter ending November 30, 2010, total revenue was $936.6 million, an increase of almost 6% compared to the second quarter last year. Organic growth was 4.2%.
As noted in the release, revenue in all of our business segments grew over last year, with rates even better in Rental and First Aid and Safety and Fire than what we saw in the first quarter of this fiscal year. We also saw improved revenue per workday of 3% compared to our first quarter results.
Net income was $55.9 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.38. Our tax rate in the second quarter was 38.3% versus 30.8% in our first quarter. The first quarter tax rate reflected the release of certain cash reserves resulting from the resolution of several tax audits. As we mentioned in our first quarter call, we expected the tax rate to be higher in the second through fourth quarters.
While unemployment continues to be stubbornly high, we are encouraged that business confidence has appeared to turn the corner. We had seen the third consecutive quarter of increased wearers in our Uniform Rental business, and our Direct Sales business posted another good growth quarter. Our emerging businesses of First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection and Document Management had good revenue increases also.
We continue to reiterate the guidance we provided at the beginning of the fiscal year and updated at the end of the first quarter for the share buyback. We expect our revenues to be between $3.55 billion and $3.75 billion and our earnings per share to be between $1.55 and $1.63. Our financial condition remains very strong. While we did use approximately $200 million of our U.S. cash to purchase our stock, we still have sufficient borrowing capacity, as well as sufficient cash outside the U.S. to fund our growth initiatives. The Board of Directors also gave us another $500 million share authorization in late October to be used as directed by the board if market conditions warrant. None of that authorization has been used as of this time.
Cintas paid its annual dividend of $0.49 per share on December 15, approximately three months earlier than our traditional March date. The dividend was increased from the $0.48 paid last year, the 28th consecutive year we have increased our annual dividend since we went public in 1983.
The last couple of years had been very difficult for the U.S. economy with the loss of millions of jobs. While it could take some time for employment to return to prerecession levels, we are encouraged by some of the positive signs that are appearing. Generally speaking, our customers' businesses have stabilized their workforces and appeared to be on the verge of modestly expanding.
We also are very appreciative of the efforts of all of our employees who we call partners, who made it their mission to take care of our customers and to continue to keep Cintas profitable and cash flow-positive during the difficult past few years.
We see growth opportunities with all of our business segments. We believe that with the growth, as well as the ongoing productivity initiatives underway in the company, we will continue to see margin improvement and positive operating cash flow.

Total revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was $936.6 million, representing a 5.9% increase from the second quarter of last year. Total company internal growth was 4.2%, an increase from the 2.8% internal growth in our first quar",1845,"Thank you, Bill. Total revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was $936.6 million, representing a 5.9% increase from the second quarter of last year. Total company internal growth was 4.2%, an increase from the 2.8% internal growth in our first quarter. Each operating segments revenue grew compared to last year, both in total and organically. Before discussing the quarter in more detail, please note that our fiscal 2011 workdays are the same as last year. That means there were 65 days in the second quarter, and there will be 64 in Q3 and 66 in Q4.
We have four reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services.
Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 70% of company revenue in the second quarter. Rental revenue was $657.8 million for the quarter, which is up 2.2% compared to last year's second quarter. Internal growth was 1.9% over last year, which is an improvement from last quarter's internal growth of 0.1%. Our revenue momentum of the last few quarters continued in our second quarter. The modest U.S. private-sector job growth in the second quarter positively impacted our business. In addition, the productivity of our sales force continue to improve. This improvement was due to the impact of new products and services like Carhartt and our tile and carpet service, and was due to improved rep tenure. As you may recall, we increased our investment in sales about a year ago and has seen steady productivity improvements since then as new reps become more efficient.
In addition to the productivity improvements, our account retention improved compared to last year and compared to this year's first quarter. The stabilization of the economy has certainly helped, but we have also been very focused at providing outstanding customer service.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 12% of company revenue in the second quarter. Second quarter revenue of $108.8 million represents an increase of 9.4% compared to last year's second quarter. Internal growth was also 9.4%.
Our Uniform Direct Sales business has shown a nice rebound over the past three quarters. As in the first quarter, this rebound continued to be a broad improvement in which we saw large national account customers, as well as lodging, hospitality and gaming customers increase spending.
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the second quarter. During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment were $93.3 million, an increase of 14.4% versus last year's second quarter. Internal growth was 8.4%, a strong improvement over the first quarter internal growth rate of 2.2%. Both First Aid and Safety and Fire Protection Services internal growth improved relative to the first quarter, and the Fire Protection Services internal growth was in double-digits. Fire benefited from an improving economic environment, growth in our national accounts business and greater sales team productivity.
Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document Management accounted for 8% of second quarter total company revenue. Revenue increased 27.9% over last year's second quarter to $76.6 million, with internal growth of 14.7%. While this is still very positive internal growth, it is a decrease from the first quarter internal growth of 23.2%. Much of this decrease in growth rate relates to recycled paper revenues. The price of recycled paper increased significantly during last year's second quarter and has remained at historically elevated levels since that time. As a result, we have started to anniversary that large increase, thereby reducing our recycled paper revenue growth rate. If the recycled paper prices continue at current levels into our third quarter, we will see some further slowing of the growth rate.
Moving onto margins. Total company gross margin for the second quarter was 41.7%, which is in line with last year's second quarter gross margin of 41.8%. Energy-related costs were up 15 basis points, and as was the case in our first quarter, our maintenance expenses were up 25 basis points. The gross margin of 41.7% decreased compared to 42.6% gross margin for the first quarter. This decrease is largely due to having one less workday in the second quarter compared to the first. An example of the workday impact is that our in-service inventory material cost is based on a monthly amortization schedule, so we essentially have the same expenses as the first quarter, but one less revenue-generating day. We experienced a similar decrease, in that case, 110 basis points, from last year's first quarter to the second quarter.
Rental gross margin of 42.6% was down 90 basis points from last year's second quarter. Higher energy and maintenance expenses accounted for 50 of the 90 basis points. The remaining decrease is due to higher material cost. As our wearers have increased over the past three quarters and new business results accelerate, we have injected more garments into our in-service inventory. The Rental gross margin of 42.6% was also a decrease from the 43.5% in our first fiscal quarter. As already discussed, this decrease is largely driven by one less workday in our second quarter.
Other services gross margin was 39.6% for the quarter as compared to 37.3% in last year's second quarter. All three of the operating segments within other services improved, with Fire Protection Services improving the most due to the elimination of installation work. All businesses also benefited from higher volumes this year.
Relative to the first quarter, the other services gross margin of 39.6% was a decrease of 80 basis points. This is primarily due to the Document Management Services gross margin, which decreased by 180 basis points from the first quarter for a few different reasons. Our European Document Management business, which now accounts for roughly 14% of our total Document Management business, had a decrease in its gross margin due to various initial expenses associated with our recent acquisitions. Our storage business had several greenfield starts this fiscal year. And lastly, our imaging services business is primarily a project-based business, which makes the margins more volatile from quarter-to-quarter.
Selling and administrative expenses in the second quarter were 30.8% of revenue. This is a 100 basis point decrease from the 31.8% of revenue in the first quarter. A number of different areas contributed to this decrease, including G&A, labor and medical expenses. Selling expenses, as a percent of revenue, were similar to the first quarter. The selling and administrative expense of 30.8% of revenue was an increase from the 29.3% for the second quarter last year. Selling expenses were 60 basis points higher than last year's second quarter. As we've discussed on the last few calls, we had a planned increase in our sales force during mid-fiscal 2010 as a result of the stabilization that we saw in the economy. In addition to the increase in selling expense, professional service expenses increased 30 basis points due to our enterprise-wide system conversion, and bad debt expense was 20 basis points higher than last year due to a slight deterioration in our aging compared to last year.
Please keep in mind that last year's second quarter included a legal settlement amounting to $4.1 million pretax, net of insurance proceeds. Our effective tax rate was 38.3% for the quarter compared to 39.3% last year. Due to the timing of specific reserve builds and releases under FIN 48, our effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. We expect our fiscal 2011 effective tax rate to be approximately 37.3%.
Our cash and marketable securities were $285 million at November 30, a decrease of $85 million from August 31, 2010. As we discussed last quarter, we used $72 million in September for the execution of our share buyback program.
Accounts receivable increased by $18 million since August 31, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable remained at 40, the same as at August 31. New goods inventory at November 30 was $208 million, up $24 million from August 31. We will be converting our global supply chain to the SAP system in our third quarter as part of our company conversion to the enterprise-wide resource system. In anticipation of this and as a precaution, we have intentionally built up inventory levels prior to the conversion. We have also built up our Carhartt and our flame-resistant clothing inventory levels.
Uniforms and other rental items and service increased by $17 million from August 31 to November 30 due to the higher volume levels throughout the second quarter. Accrued liabilities increased $101 million compared to August 31 due to the $72 million accrual of the dividend, which was paid on December 15 and increased bondage risk and accrued profit sharing. Long-term debt at November 30 remained at $787 million. Any early retirement of this debt would require a prepayment penalty and is not currently attractive. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is approximately 6%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 25%, while net debt or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization was 17%.
Turning to our cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities was $74 million for the second quarter, a decrease from $149 million in last year's second quarter. Last year's cash flow benefited from lower working capital needs associated with our decreasing volumes and the accrual of the legal settlements. This year, the increasing revenue levels have increased our working capital needs, such as increased inventory levels and higher accounts receivable balances. The second quarter cash provided by operating activities of $74 million was an increase over the first quarter's $35 million.
CapEx for the second quarter was $40 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $27 million in Rental; $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $5 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $7 million in Document Management. We invested $41 million in the second quarter on strategic acquisitions. This includes a number of small acquisitions in our Document Management business and our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services business. We will continue to evaluate acquisition candidates as opportunities arise. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions."

And the reason is because many of our garments are 65%, 35% poly-cotton blend, and then when you include the direct labor cost component, the overhead cost component, freight to get it in, the cotton content is not a significant piece of the garment in total cost. When you then think about that cost of the garment being amortized over 18 months, it almost acts like a natural hedge, such that cotton costs need to be elevated for quite a long period of time before it has a significant impact on us. So we don't expect that big of an impact on us this fiscal year. But certainly, we're keeping our eyes on it, and we are working with our vendors to minimize the impact to us. As it relates to passing those costs on, we feel pretty good about the ability to do so to our customers.

For the quarter ending November 30, 2010, total revenue was $9",661,"Good evening and thank you for joining us. With me today is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some comments on the quarter's results, we will open the call to questions. For the quarter ending November 30, 2010, total revenue was $936.6 million, an increase of almost 6% compared to the second quarter last year. Organic growth was 4.2%.
As noted in the release, revenue in all of our business segments grew over last year, with rates even better in Rental, and First Aid, and Safety and Fire than what we saw in the first quarter of this fiscal year. We also saw improved revenue per work day of 3% compared to our first quarter results. Net income was $55.9 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.38.
Our tax rate in the second quarter was 38.3% versus 30.8% in our first quarter. The first quarter tax rate reflected the release of certain tax reserves, resulting from the resolution of several tax audits. As we mentioned in our first quarter call, we expected the tax rate to be higher in the second through fourth quarters.
While unemployment continues to be stubbornly high, we are encouraged that business confidence has appeared to turn the corner. We have seen the third consecutive quarter of increased wears in our uniform rental business and our direct sale business posted another good growth quarter. Our emerging businesses are First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection and Document Management had good revenue increases also.
We continue to reiterate the guidance we've provided at the beginning of the fiscal year and updated at the end of the first quarter for the share buyback. We expect our revenues to be between $3.55 billion and $3.75 billion and our earnings per share to be between $1.55 and $1.63. Our financial condition remains very strong, while we did use approximately $200 million of our U.S. cash to purchase our stock.
We still have sufficient borrowing capacity, as well as sufficient cash outside the U.S. to fund our growth initiatives. The board of directors also gave us another $500 million share authorization in late October, to be used as directed by the board if market conditions warrant. None of that authorization has been used as of this time.
Cintas paid its annual dividend of $0.49 per share on December 15, approximately three months earlier than our traditional March date. The dividend was increased from the $0.48 paid last year, the 28th consecutive year we have increased our annual dividend since we went public in 1983.
The last couple of years have been very difficult for the U.S. economy with the loss of millions of jobs, while it could take some time for employment to return to pre-recession levels. We are encouraged by some of the positive signs that are appearing. Generally speaking, our customers businesses have stabilized their work forces and appear to be on the verge of modestly expanding.
We also are very appreciative of the efforts of all of our employees, who we call partners, who made it their mission to take care of our customers and to continue to keep Cintas profitable and cash flow positive during the difficult past few years. We see growth opportunities with all of our business segments. We believe that with the growth as well as the ongoing productivity initiatives underway in the company, we will continue to see margin improvement and positive operating cash flow.

Total company internal growth was 4.2%, an increase from the 2.8% internal growth in our first quarter. Each operating segment's revenue grew compared to last year, both in total and organically.
Before discussing the quarter in more detail, please note that our fiscal 2011 work days are the same as last year. That means there were 65 days in the second quarter and there will be 64 in Q3, and 66 in Q4.
We have four reportable operating segments, Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as Other Services on the face of the income statement.
The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and serving of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 70% of company revenue in the second quarter. Rental revenue was $657.8 million for the quarter, which is up 2.2% compared to last year's second quarter.
Internal growth was 1.9% over last year, which is an improvement from last quarter's internal growth of the 0.1%. Our revenue momentum of the last few quarters continued in our second quarter. The modest U.S. private sector job growth in the second quarter positively impacted our business.
In addition, the productivity of our sales force continued to improve. This improvement was due to the impact of new products and services like Carhartt and our tile and carpet service, and was due to improved rep tenure. As you may recall, we increased our investment in sales about a year ago and have seen steady productivity improvements since then as new reps become more efficient.
In addition to the productivity improvements, our account retention improved compared to last year and compared to this year's first quarter. The stabilization of the economy has certainly helped, but we have also been very focused at providing outstanding customer service.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog.
Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 12% of company revenue in the second quarter. Second quarter revenue of $180.8 million represents an increase of 9.4% compared to last year's second quarter. Internal growth was also 9.4%. Our Uniform Direct Sales business has shown a nice rebound over the past three quarters. As in the first quarter, this rebound continued to be broad improvement in which we saw large national account customers, as well as lodging, hospitality and gaming customers increase spending.
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, and training, and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the second quarter. During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment were $93.3 million, an increase of 14.4% versus last year's second quarter. Internal growth was 8.4%, a strong improvement over the first quarter internal growth rate of 2.2%. Both First Aid and Safety and Fire Protection Services internal growth improved relative to the first quarter, and the Fire Protection Services internal growth was in double digits.
Fire benefited from an improving economic environment, growth in our national accounts business and greater sales team productivity.
Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document Management accounted for 8% of second quarter total company revenue. Revenue increased 27.9% over last year's second quarter to $76.6 million, with internal growth of 14.7%. While this is still very positive internal growth, it is a decrease from the first quarter internal growth of 23.2%. Much of this decrease in growth rate relates to recycled paper revenues. The price of recycled paper increased significantly during last year's second quarter, and has remained at historically elevated levels since that time.
As a result, we have started to anniversary that large increase, thereby reducing our recycled paper revenue growth rate. If the recycled paper prices continue at current levels into our third quarter, we will see some further slowing of the growth rate.
Moving on to margins, total company gross margin for the second quarter was 41.7%, which is in line with last year's second quarter gross margin of 41.8%. Energy-related costs were up 15 basis points, and as was the case in our first quarter, our maintenance expenses were up 25 basis points.
The gross margin of 41.7% decreased, compared to the 42.6% gross margin for the first quarter. This decrease is largely due to having one less work day in the second quarter compared to the first. An example of the work day impact is that our in-service inventory material cost is based on a monthly amortization schedule. So we essentially have the same expenses as in the first quarter, but one less revenue-generating day.
We experienced a similar decrease, in that case 110 basis points from last year's first quarter to the second quarter. Rental gross margin of 42.6% was down 90 basis points from last year's second quarter. Higher energy and maintenance expenses accounted for 50 of the 90 basis points. The remaining decrease is due to higher material cost.
As our wearers have increased over the past three quarters and new business results accelerate, we have injected more garments into our in-service inventory.
The rental gross margin of 42.6% was also a decrease from the 43.5% in our first fiscal quarter. As already discussed, this decrease is largely driven by one less work day in our second quarter.
Other Services gross margin was 39.6% for the quarter as compared to 37.3% in last year's second quarter. All three of the operating segments within Other Services improved, with Fire Protection Services improving the most due to the elimination of installation work. All businesses also benefited from higher volumes this year. Relative to the first quarter, the Other Services gross margin of 39.6% was a decrease of 80 basis points. This is primarily due to the Document Management Services gross margin, which decreased by 180 basis points from the first quarter for a few different reasons. Our European Document Management business, which now accounts for roughly 14% of our total Document Management business, had a decrease in its gross margin due to various initial expenses associated with our recent acquisitions.
Our Storage business had several Greenfield starts this fiscal year. And lastly, our Imaging Services business is primarily a project-based business, which makes the margins more volatile from quarter-to-quarter.
Selling and administrative expenses in the second quarter were 30.8% of revenue. This is a 100 basis point decrease from the 31.8% of revenue in the first quarter. A number of different areas contributed to this decrease, including G&A labor and medical expenses. Selling expenses as a percent of revenue were similar to the first quarter.
The selling and administrative expense of 30.8% of revenue was an increase from the 29.3% for the second quarter last year. Selling expenses were 60 basis points higher than last year's second quarter.
As we have discussed on the last few calls, we had a planned increase in our sales force during mid fiscal 2010 as a result of the stabilization that we saw in the economy.
In addition to the increase in selling expense, Professional Service expenses increased 30 basis points due to our Enterprise Live system conversion, and bad debt expense was 20 basis points higher than last year due to a slight deterioration in our aging compared to last year.
Please keep in mind that last year's second quarter included a legal settlement amounting to $4.1 million pre-tax net of insurance proceeds.
Our effective tax rate was 38.3% for the quarter compared to 39.3% last year. Due to the timing of specific reserve bills and releases under FIN 48, our effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We expect our fiscal 2011 effective tax rate to be approximately 37.3%.
Our cash and marketable securities were $285 million at November 30, a decrease of $85 million from August 31, 2010. As we discussed last quarter, we used $72 million in September for the execution of our share buyback program.
Accounts receivable increased by $18 million since August 31, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable remained at 40, the same as at August 31.
New goods inventory at November 30 was $208 million, up $24 million from August 31. We will be converting our global supply chain to the SAP system in our third quarter as part of our company conversion to the Enterprise Live resource system.
In anticipation of this and as a precaution, we have intentionally built up inventory levels prior to the conversion. We have also built up our Carhartt and our flame-resistant clothing inventory levels.
Uniforms and other rental items in service increased by $17 million from August 31 to November 30 due to the higher volume levels throughout the second quarter. Accrued liabilities increased $101 million compared to August 31 due to the $72 million accrual of the dividend which was paid on December 15, and increased bondage risk and accrued profit sharing.
Long term debt at November 30 remained at $787 million. Any early retirement of this debt would require pre-payment penalty, and it is not currently attractive. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is approximately 6%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 25%, while net debt or long term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization was 17%.
Turning to our cash flow, cash provided by operating activities was $74 million for the second quarter, a decrease from $149 million in last year's second quarter. Last year's cash flow benefited from lower working capital needs associated with our decreasing volumes and the accrual of the legal settlements. This year, the increasing revenue levels have increased our working capital needs such as increased inventory levels and higher accounts receivable balances.
The second quarter cash provided by operating activities of $74 million dollars was an increase over the first quarter's $35 million.
CapEx for the second quarter was $40 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows; $27 million in rental, $1 million in uniform direct sales, $5 million in first aid, safety and fire protection and $7 million in document management.
We invested $41 million in the second quarter on strategic acquisitions. This includes a number of small acquisitions in our document management business and our first aid, safety and fire protection services business. We will continue to evaluate acquisition candidates as opportunities arise.
That concludes our prepared remarks and we will now take any of your questions.

And the reason is because many of our garments are 65/35 Poly Cotton Blend. And then when you include the direct labor cost component, the overhead cost component, freight, to get in, the cotton content is not a significant piece of the garment's total cost.
When you then think about that cost of the garment being amortized over 18 months, it almost acts like a natural hedge such that cotton costs need to be elevated for quite a long period of time before it has a significant impact on us. So we don't expect that big of an impact on us this fiscal year, but certainly we're keeping our eyes on it. And we are working with our vendors to minimize the impact to us. As it relates to passing those costs on, we feel pretty good about the ability to do so to our customers.
There is a lot of talk about this increasing cost, and I think it's a reasonable thing to do to pass that on at some point.
In the energy area, certainly, especially with gasoline, John, it's something that we are having to keep our eyes on. We believe that if the gasoline prices continue to increase, we will have the ability to pass along those increases through our price increases. Tends to be a bit of a lag, but we'll be able to recoup that as we go forward, we expect at this time.

So yes, it is a better environment than we have seen for the last few years. And we're cautiously optimistic that as we get into '11 we're going to see a reasonable growth rate in our wearers and continued expansion of all of our business lines.

At this time, I am not comfortable in breaking out the details of the growth in specifics. I would tell you that most of the growth though has come from new store fronts, that is new customers or new products at existing customers. We have not really seen a significant amount of growth like wearers within a customer. There has been some of that, but not a significant amount. What we have seen is no further deterioration.
Right now, it's mostly new store fronts that we're seeing the growth from. Pricing, we are not getting a lot of growth from pricing at all. The CPI is basically flat. So on our existing contracts at this point, it has been relatively minimal about price increases. So it's pretty much at the new store fronts.

Assuming stability in the recycled paper price, the margins in the paper destruction and shredding business should certainly be at levels that we see in kind of traditional rental type margins.
The rental margins themselves, I would be little too optimistic to say we could get back to pre-2005, 2004 levels, because it is difficult to assume that all of the cost increases that we now have incurred is the result of much higher medical cost, higher energy cost, expensing of stock options, Sarbanes-Oxley. I am not sure we can ever overcome all of those expenses.
But however, I will say that we are optimistic that we will see improved margins from what you're seeing today in the rental business as well as the other businesses and borrowing again a spectacular increase in some component of costs like energy or medical expenses or something along those lines.

With me today is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some comments on the quarter's results, we will open the call to questions. For the quarter ending November 30, 2010, total revenue was",659,"Good evening, and thank you for joining us. With me today is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some comments on the quarter's results, we will open the call to questions. 
For the quarter ending November 30, 2010, total revenue was $936.6 million, an increase of almost 6% compared to the second quarter last year. Organic growth was 4.2%.
As noted in the release, revenue in all of our business segments grew over last year, with rates even better in Rental and First Aid and Safety and Fire than what we saw in the first quarter of this fiscal year. We also saw improved revenue per workday of 3% compared to our first quarter results.
Net income was $55.9 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.38. Our tax rate in the second quarter was 38.3% versus 30.8% in our first quarter. The first quarter tax rate reflected the release of certain tax reserves resulting from the resolution of several tax audits. As we mentioned in our first quarter call, we expected the tax rate to be higher in the second through fourth quarters.
While unemployment continues to be stubbornly high, we are encouraged that business confidence has appeared to turn the corner. We have seen the third consecutive quarter of increased wearers in our Uniform Rental business, and our Direct Sale business posted another good growth quarter. Our emerging businesses of First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection and Document Management had good revenue increases also.
We continue to reiterate the guidance we provided at the beginning of the fiscal year and updated at the end of the first quarter for the share buyback. We expect our revenues to be between $3.55 billion and $3.75 billion and our earnings per share to be between $1.55 and $1.63. Our financial condition remains very strong. While we did use approximately $200 million of our U.S. cash to purchase our stock, we still have sufficient borrowing capacity, as well as sufficient cash outside the U.S. to fund our growth initiatives. The Board of Directors also gave us another $500 million share authorization in late October to be used as directed by the board if market conditions warrant. None of that authorization has been used as of this time.
Cintas paid its annual dividend of $0.49 per share on December 15, approximately three months earlier than our traditional March date. The dividend was increased from the $0.48 paid last year, the 28th consecutive year we have increased our annual dividend since we went public in 1983.
The last couple of years had been very difficult for the U.S. economy with the loss of millions of jobs. While it could take some time for employment to return to pre-recession levels, we are encouraged by some of the positive signs that are appearing. Generally speaking, our customers' businesses have stabilized their workforces and appear to be on the verge of modestly expanding.
We also are very appreciative of the efforts of all of our employees who we call partners, who made it their mission to take care of our customers and to continue to keep Cintas profitable and cash flow positive during the difficult past few years.
We see growth opportunities with all of our business segments. We believe that with the growth, as well as the ongoing productivity initiatives underway in the company, we will continue to see margin improvement and positive operating cash flow.

Total revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was $936.6 million, representing a 5.9% increase from the second quarter of last year. Total company internal growth was 4.2%, an increase from the 2.8% internal growth in our first quar",1846,"Thank you, Bill. Total revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was $936.6 million, representing a 5.9% increase from the second quarter of last year. Total company internal growth was 4.2%, an increase from the 2.8% internal growth in our first quarter. Each operating segments revenue grew compared to last year, both in total and organically. Before discussing the quarter in more detail, please note that our fiscal 2011 workdays are the same as last year. That means there were 65 days in the second quarter, and there will be 64 in Q3 and 66 in Q4.
We have four reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as Other Services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services.
Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 70% of company revenue in the second quarter. Rental revenue was $657.8 million for the quarter, which is up 2.2% compared to last year's second quarter. Internal growth was 1.9% over last year, which is an improvement from last quarter's internal growth of the 0.1%. Our revenue momentum of the last few quarters continued in our second quarter. The modest U.S. private-sector job growth in the second quarter positively impacted our business. In addition, the productivity of our sales force continued to improve. This improvement was due to the impact of new products and services like Carhartt and our tile and carpet service, and was due to improved rep tenure. As you may recall, we increased our investment in sales about a year ago and have seen steady productivity improvements since then as new reps become more efficient.
In addition to the productivity improvements, our account retention improved compared to last year and compared to this year's first quarter. The stabilization of the economy has certainly helped, but we have also been very focused at providing outstanding customer service.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 12% of company revenue in the second quarter. Second quarter revenue of $108.8 million represents an increase of 9.4% compared to last year's second quarter. Internal growth was also 9.4%.
Our Uniform Direct Sales business has shown a nice rebound over the past three quarters. As in the first quarter, this rebound continued to be a broad improvement in which we saw large national account customers, as well as lodging, hospitality and gaming customers increase spending.
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid Products, Safety Products and Training and Fire Protection Products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the second quarter. During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment were $93.3 million, an increase of 14.4% versus last year's second quarter. Internal growth was 8.4%, a strong improvement over the first quarter internal growth rate of 2.2%. Both First Aid and Safety and Fire Protection Services internal growth improved relative to the first quarter, and the Fire Protection Services internal growth was in double-digits. Fire benefited from an improving economic environment, growth in our national accounts business and greater sales team productivity.
Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document Management accounted for 8% of second quarter total company revenue. Revenue increased 27.9% over last year's second quarter to $76.6 million, with internal growth of 14.7%. While this is still very positive internal growth, it is a decrease from the first quarter internal growth of 23.2%. Much of this decrease in growth rate relates to recycled paper revenues. The price of recycled paper increased significantly during last year's second quarter and has remained at historically elevated levels since that time. As a result, we have started to anniversary that large increase, thereby reducing our recycled paper revenue growth rate. If the recycled paper prices continue at current levels into our third quarter, we will see some further slowing of the growth rate.
Moving onto margins. Total company gross margin for the second quarter was 41.7%, which is in line with last year's second quarter gross margin of 41.8%. Energy-related costs were up 15 basis points, and, as was the case in our first quarter, our maintenance expenses were up 25 basis points. The gross margin of 41.7% decreased compared to 42.6% gross margin for the first quarter. This decrease is largely due to having one less workday in the second quarter compared to the first. An example of the workday impact is that our in-service inventory material cost is based on a monthly amortization schedule, so we essentially have the same expenses as the first quarter, but one less revenue-generating day. We experienced a similar decrease, in that case 110 basis points, from last year's first quarter to the second quarter.
Rental gross margin of 42.6% was down 90 basis points from last year's second quarter. Higher energy and maintenance expenses accounted for 50 of the 90 basis points. The remaining decrease is due to higher material cost. As our wearers have increased over the past three quarters and new business results accelerate, we have injected more garments into our in-service inventory. The Rental gross margin of 42.6% was also a decrease from the 43.5% in our first fiscal quarter. As already discussed, this decrease is largely driven by one less workday in our second quarter.
Other services gross margin was 39.6% for the quarter as compared to 37.3% in last year's second quarter. All three of the operating segments within other services improved, with Fire Protection Services improving the most due to the elimination of installation work. All businesses also benefited from higher volumes this year.
Relative to the first quarter, the other services gross margin of 39.6% was a decrease of 80 basis points. This is primarily due to the Document Management Services gross margin, which decreased by 180 basis points from the first quarter for a few different reasons. Our European Document Management business, which now accounts for roughly 14% of our total Document Management business, had a decrease in its gross margin due to various initial expenses associated with our recent acquisitions. Our storage business had several greenfield starts this fiscal year. And lastly, our imaging services business is primarily a project-based business, which makes the margins more volatile from quarter-to-quarter.
Selling and administrative expenses in the second quarter were 30.8% of revenue. This is a 100 basis point decrease from the 31.8% of revenue in the first quarter. A number of different areas contributed to this decrease, including G&A, labor and medical expenses. Selling expenses, as a percent of revenue, were similar to the first quarter. The selling and administrative expense of 30.8% of revenue was an increase from the 29.3% for the second quarter last year. Selling expenses were 60 basis points higher than last year's second quarter. As we've discussed on the last few calls, we had a planned increase in our sales force during mid-fiscal 2010 as a result of the stabilization that we saw in the economy. In addition to the increase in selling expense, professional service expenses increased 30 basis points due to our enterprise-wide system conversion, and bad debt expense was 20 basis points higher than last year due to a slight deterioration in our aging compared to last year.
Please keep in mind that last year's second quarter included a legal settlement amounting to $4.1 million pretax, net of insurance proceeds. Our effective tax rate was 38.3% for the quarter compared to 39.3% last year. Due to the timing of specific reserve builds and releases under FIN 48, our effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. We expect our fiscal 2011 effective tax rate to be approximately 37.3%.
Our cash and marketable securities were $285 million at November 30, a decrease of $85 million from August 31, 2010. As we discussed last quarter, we used $72 million in September for the execution of our share buyback program.
Accounts receivable increased by $18 million since August 31, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable remained at 40, the same as at August 31. New goods inventory at November 30 was $208 million, up $24 million from August 31. We will be converting our global supply chain to the SAP system in our third quarter as part of our company conversion to the enterprise-wide resource system. In anticipation of this and as a precaution, we have intentionally built up inventory levels prior to the conversion. We have also built up our Carhartt and our flame-resistant clothing inventory levels.
Uniforms and other rental items in service increased by $17 million from August 31 to November 30 due to the higher volume levels throughout the second quarter. Accrued liabilities increased $101 million compared to August 31 due to the $72 million accrual of the dividend, which was paid on December 15 and increased bondage risk and accrued profit sharing. Long-term debt at November 30 remained at $787 million. Any early retirement of this debt would require a prepayment penalty and is not currently attractive. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is approximately 6%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 25%, while net debt, or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization, was 17%.
Turning to our cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities was $74 million for the second quarter, a decrease from $149 million in last year's second quarter. Last year's cash flow benefited from lower working capital needs associated with our decreasing volumes and the accrual of the legal settlements. This year, the increasing revenue levels have increased our working capital needs, such as increased inventory levels and higher accounts receivable balances. The second quarter cash provided by operating activities of $74 million was an increase over the first quarter's $35 million.
CapEx for the second quarter was $40 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $27 million in Rental; $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $5 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $7 million in Document Management. We invested $41 million in the second quarter on strategic acquisitions. This includes a number of small acquisitions in our Document Management business and our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services business. We will continue to evaluate acquisition candidates as opportunities arise. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions."

And the reason is because many of our garments are 65%, 35% poly-cotton blend, and then when you include the direct labor cost component, the overhead cost component, freight to get in, the cotton content is not a significant piece of the garment total cost. When you then think about that cost of the garment being amortized over 18 months, it almost acts like a natural hedge, such that cotton costs need to be elevated for quite a long period of time before it has a significant impact on us. So we don't expect that big of an impact on us this fiscal year. But certainly, we're keeping our eyes on it, and we are working with our vendors to minimize the impact to us. As it relates to passing those costs on, we feel pretty good about the ability to do so to our customers.
