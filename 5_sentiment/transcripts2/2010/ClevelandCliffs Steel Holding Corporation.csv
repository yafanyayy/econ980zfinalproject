In a moment, I'll review our fourth quarter and full-year results and provide some guidance for 2010. Following my remarks, Jim Wainscott, will offer his comments and field your questions.Today's call include c",1386,"Thank you, Patty and good morning, everyone. In a moment, I'll review our fourth quarter and full-year results and provide some guidance for 2010. Following my remarks, Jim Wainscott, will offer his comments and field your questions.Today's call include certain forward-looking guidance. Other than the comments on historical results, remarks we make today constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements include our expectations as to our future shipments, product mix, prices, costs, operating profit and liquidity. While we believe that our expectations are reasonable, we cannot assure you they will prove to have been correct since they are based on assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to risks. Such risks include economic, competitive and operational risks, uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are beyond our control, and based upon assumptions with respect to future business decisions that are subject to change.Except as required by law, the company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect future developments or events. For more detailed information, we encourage you to review the discussion of risks affecting forward-looking statements found in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, as updated in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q. To the extent we refer to material information that includes non-GAAP financial measures, the reconciliation information required by Regulation G is available on the company's website at aksteel.com.Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter 2009 results that reflect a significant improvement over the third quarter, with increases in shipments, revenues, operating profit and net income. In fact, our fourth quarter performance represents our third consecutive quarter of improved financial results and our best quarter of 2009. AK Steel reported net income of $39.8 million for the fourth quarter or $0.36 per share compared to $6.2 million or $0.06 per share in the third quarter. Our fourth quarter net income was negatively impacted by a $5.1 million charge related to a tax law change by the state of Pennsylvania, which we discussed in our third quarter earnings call. Fourth quarter shipments were 1,368,300 tons, an increase of 320,500 tons or 31% over the previous quarter. Average selling prices increased quarter-over-quarter for each of our three major product groups, carbon steels, stainless and electrical steels as well as tubular steel products. However, as expected, our overall average selling price of $964 per ton was roughly 3% lower quarter-to-quarter, primarily due to product mix. That is carbon steels comprised of higher percentage of our sales during the quarter.Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $1,320,000,000, which was $279 million or about 27% higher than our third quarter revenues. While general market conditions remained challenging in the fourth quarter, we saw increased demand from many of our customers, particularly among carbon steel buyers.Now looking at costs. We benefited from lower raw material costs compared to the third quarter, including lower costs for pellets and purchase coke, partially offset by higher carbon scrap, coating metals and natural gas costs. However, we do not expect the trend of overall lower raw material costs to continue in the first quarter of 2010.  Netting revenues and costs, we achieved an operating profit of $87 million or $64 per ton. This represents a very solid improvement of $71.7 million or roughly $49 per ton compared to the third quarter.Turning now to our full-year results. Despite the significant challenges of the great recession, AK Steel returned to solid profitability in the second half of the year. While we posted a net loss of $74.6 million or $0.68 per share for the year, we generated net income of $46 million or $0.42 per share during the second half of 2009. Shipments for 2009 totaled 3.9 million tons, with an average selling price of $1,036 per ton. 2009 revenues were $4.1 billion. Nearly 60% of total revenues occurred in the second half of the year as we benefited from the early stages of an economic recovery. Our sales outside the U.S. in 2009 were $767 million, representing approximately 19% of our total sales. By comparison, sales outside the U.S. in 2008 were roughly 17% of total sales. Our results also reflect a larger-than-expected LIFO credit of $417 million for 2009 due to significantly lower raw material and energy costs and a reduction in inventory levels. For the year 2009, we incurred an operating loss of $70.1 million or $18 per ton, all of which was incurred in the first half of the year before the company returned to profitability.Turning to the balance sheet. With the difficult market conditions, we intensified our focus on cash and liquidity throughout the year. As a result, we succeeded in maintaining a very solid cash position. We grew cash by more than $122 million or roughly 36% from the third quarter, ending the year with $462 million. Combined with the availability under our revolver, our total liquidity stood at more than $1 billion at December 31. Our focus on the balance sheet allowed us to maintain a strong financial position even while making some substantial investments in the company. For example, we invested $110 million in capital improvements, including the installation of a new hearth in our Middletown Works blast furnace. And we've contributed a total of $210 million to our pension plans, along with $65 million to the Middletown retirees VEBA.At the end of 2009, our net debt was less than $150 million. Our debt was favorably impacted by the repurchase during the year of $26.4 million in par value of our 7 3/4% senior notes at a cost of roughly $23 million. In the past two years, we have repurchased a total of $46 million at par value of these notes for an average purchase price of about $0.80 on the dollar. Other actions in 2009 to enhance shareholder value included the repurchase of more than $1.6 million shares of AK Steel's common stock at an average price of $6.13 per share. In the past two years, we have repurchased nearly 3.3 million shares at an average price of $7.43 per share, well below the current market value.Turning to the pension fund. In the calendar year 2009, we enjoyed an investment gain of more than 17% from our investment portfolio, a solid performance based on an asset mix of roughly 60% equities and 40% fixed income. Looking forward, funding requirements for our pension plans continue to be very manageable, with approximately $105 million required in 2010. As we announced this morning, our Board of Directors has approved the contribution of $75 million this quarter, which will meet a significant portion of the company's 2010 funding requirements.Now for some guidance for the first quarter of 2010. We expect shipments to be essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. As it's typically the case, we expect the first quarter to be our lowest shipment quarter of the year. We expect our average selling price to increase by 4% to 5% quarter-over-quarter. We expect lower operating costs in the first quarter due to improved operating rates and continuous improvements in all areas of our business.In addition, we expect maintenance outage costs will be lower than in the previous quarter. And while we experienced a significant LIFO credit in 2009, we do not expect that will be the case for 2010. Netting the positive and negatives including moving from a LIFO credit to a LIFO charge, we expect to report an operating profit of approximately $35 per ton for the first quarter of 2010.As we look to the remainder of the year, we expect our quarterly shipment levels and average selling price to be higher than during the first quarter. Finally, as we typically do, let me offer a few data points for the full-year 2010.We anticipate total capital investments of about $200 million in 2010, essentially equal to depreciation. We expect interest expense to be roughly flat year-over-year, but pension and OPEB expense will decrease by approximately $40 million in 2010, largely due to better-than-expected pension investment returns in 2009. And finally, with regard to income taxes, while we are projecting a book tax rate for 2010 of roughly 39%, we estimate our cash tax rate will be less than 5%. Now for his comments, here's Jim Wainscott."

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. We finished the year 2009 in strong fashion with higher shipments and lower costs than we had expected. And I'm proud of the fact that with each successive quarter in 2009",2849,"Thank you very much, Al. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. We finished the year 2009 in strong fashion with higher shipments and lower costs than we had expected. And I'm proud of the fact that with each successive quarter in 2009, our results continued to improve. And as we concluded one of the most challenging years in the 110-year history of AK Steel, our fourth quarter performance represented our strongest quarter of 2009, and that is a credit to all of the employees of AK Steel who responded to the challenges of one of the most severe economic downturns in our country's history.Not only did we conclude a very challenging year, but 2009 also represented the end of a rather adventurous decade for AK Steel and the steel industry for that matter. It was certainly a time frame during which the Board of Directors and the management team of AK Steel repositioned the company for success in the coming decade.But in 2009, we did what we had to do in order to survive what economists called the great recession. That's what great leadership is all about, managing through tough times. As we look ahead to 2010, it's our intent that AK Steel to move from the great recession to the great recovery. That's because our production has returned to about 85% of capacity for our first quarter of 2010 compared to our low point, the second quarter of last year, when we were operating on average at only 45% of capacity.These higher current operating rates are great for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the fact that they put our people back to work. In fact, we've recently been hiring new employees at our Ashland Works. Things are certainly better. Recall, as I mentioned that in the second quarter of 2009, we experienced record low quarterly shipments of only 740,000 tons but we've recovered nicely from that low point, reporting fourth quarter 2009 shipments, as Al mentioned, of nearly 1,370,000 tons or some 85% higher.While we're still not where we want to be back to pre-recession production and shipment levels, we are absolutely moving in the right direction. As a company, we've made solid progress throughout the year with each successive quarter better than the previous one, both in terms of operating and net profitability, truly a testament once again to the can-do spirit of the employees of AK Steel. Throughout our company, we have a resilient group of people who simply refuse to lose. We may get knocked down, but we get right back up and we get after it.Speaking of our people, I'm pleased that late in the fourth quarter, we obtained a three-year labor contract extension at our Coshocton Works with the United Auto Workers union. This agreement replaced the existing contract that was set to expire on April 1 of 2010. And while we're on the subject of labor, it's worth noting that our only other labor agreement expiring this year is with the United Steelworkers at the Ashland Works main plant. That agreement is set to expire on September 1.Take care of your customers and your people, and all things are possible. That has been our approach at AK Steel for quite a while now, and I'm confident that a high degree of our success is due to following that approach. As a management team, we are most proud of the way we treated our customers and our people in 2009. And through it all, we stayed true to our core values of safety, quality and productivity.At AK Steel, we have no higher priority than the safety of our people. For 2009, we exceeded our company-specific safety goals, and we continue to lead the entire steel industry once again by a wide margin in terms of safety performance. We set a new company record of only 15 OSHA-recordable injuries. While that's the best that we've ever done, our goal is and must always be zero. And guess what, employees at two of our plants, Rockport and Zanesville, actually delivered zeroes. They worked the entire year without a single recordable injury. That is a terrific achievement by everyone at those two locations.Also during Q4, the Columbus, Indiana plant of our AK Tube subsidiary was re-certified by the Department of Labor under the DOL's Voluntary Protection Program for having safety programs that go above and beyond OSHA requirements. Congratulations to our AK Tube Columbus employees.Now let me shift gears from safety to quality, a subject that matters a great deal to our customers. At AK Steel, we build our reputation based upon making great quality products, delivering them on time and providing superior customer service. This is only possible when the entire organization, sales, customer technical services, research, operations and all the staff functions realize that without our customers, there is no need for AK Steel.Speaking of research, we continue to do everything we can to meet the needs of our customers for the finest quality, most energy-efficient carbon, stainless and electrical steels. During the fourth quarter, the hard work that AK Steel's researchers performed got some well-deserved recognition. Our researchers were the recipients of the 42nd Annual Outstanding Author Award from the Galvanizers Association. This honor was presented in connection with a technical paper on the subject of Furnace Atmosphere Monitoring at our coating lines. By the way, this marked the 10th time that AK Steel has received this very prestigious recognition.Once again, in our company, our focus is on serving our customers better than any other steelmaker. And our performance on that front continues to differentiate AK Steel from its peers. Despite operating in a very, very difficult environment in 2009, last year was one of our best years ever in terms of quality. That opinion of mine was recently validated by the annual results of an independent customer survey performed by Jacobson & Associates. According to the Jacobson survey, our carbon and specialty steel customers rated AK Steel number one in overall customer satisfaction, as well as number one in quality and delivery for the year 2009. Ladies and gentlemen, that is about as good as it gets.For 2009, in short, we rolled on. As we work through the very tough economic challenges of the day, we remained focused on our core values as we outperformed the expectations of our customers and shareholders. In addition, we lowered our costs, and we lifted or grew our cash position. In essence, we return to our three Cs approach of focusing on customers, costs and cash. The things that matter very much last year. Those were the items that really drove our priorities. And at the bottom line, although we reported net income, as Al mentioned, for the third and fourth quarters of 2009, we did report a net loss for the full-year 2009. Excluding special charges, it's our first annual loss since the year 2003. Let me assure you that we have no intention of a repeat performance of this sort for 2010. Quite contrary, AK Steel expects to be solidly profitable for the year 2010.As was the case in 2009, we expect sequential quarterly improvement in our results throughout 2010 as we enjoy the benefits of higher production and shipments as well as higher pricing. That said, from a profitability standpoint, we expect the first quarter to be our weakest, given product lead times we came into 2010 with a portion of our sales already in the order book for the first quarter.These sales were made prior to our recently announced spot market price increases. Thus, as a result, much of the steel that will ship in the first quarter will be at prices below the current pricing levels. Accordingly, we'll have, what I term, a bit of a mismatch between our first quarter sales prices and our costs. It's because our costs will reflect the real-time increases that are going on in scrap, and the expected increases for iron ore prices, whereas our selling prices for most of our first quarter shipments will not fully comprehend these cost increases until next quarter.Let's take a moment to expand on this thought. It's important to realize that the higher iron ore prices that we anticipate, once in fact the deals are settled, are retroactive to January 1 of this year. In contrast, most of our selling prices have already been set for the first quarter, hence the mismatch situation of which I spoke.Having said that, as we look to future quarters and to the full year, we expect a much improved 2010 as compared to 2009. Our annual sales volumes for 2010 should be about 40% higher than 2009. We are seeing an improvement in overall demand from our customers, but the biggest change that we're seeing is that customers are once again purchasing steel in quantities that are equal to their sales levels. That's a big change from a year ago, and even a couple of quarters ago when customers were selling product from their stock of inventory.Our average selling prices are expected to improve as well, as a function of the increased demand and the need to recover higher costs. Let me confirm that we are indeed now booking new spot market sales at increasingly higher sales prices. We have to because, again, our costs are rising rapidly.On the subject of steelmaking input costs, we have experienced a large increase recently in the price we pay for steel scrap. Scrap prices in 2010 have already risen by about 18% from early December of 2009. Matter of fact, scrap prices are now at pre-recession price levels. In terms of iron ore, most analysts who have covered the raw material sector, now forecast that iron ore prices are likely to rise by 20% to 25% in 2010 as compared to 2009. Given the current supply and demand conditions, in particular, increased demand from China, we too expect higher iron ore prices to be on the rise again in 2010.Accordingly, as it has been the case in recent years, steel producers including AK Steel, will be under significant cost pressures this year from higher prices for raw materials. In response to these cost pressures, we've announced the series of spot market price increases in recent months for carbon and stainless steel products, as well as the related surcharges for these products. And once again, the price increases are reflective of increases in input costs and increased order intake rates for us.Speaking of orders, our lead times for carbon products are lengthening with hot-rolled out to the first half of March, and cold-rolled and coated products out to the second half of March. And depending on the product, some of our stainless steel lead times are now out into April.With that, let me take a couple of minutes, before taking your questions, to comment on what we're seeing in the markets for each of our products. In general, we see the year 2010 as one of gradual recovery in the markets that we serve. In terms of the automotive market, according to our customers and several forecasters, we look for an auto build rate in 2010 of about 10.6 million vehicles compared to an estimated 8.5 million units for 2009. On the sales side, the numbers climb to about 12 million units for 2010 compared to an estimated 10.4 million units for 2009. Auto inventories are in much better shape now than they were a year ago. 2010 auto inventories finished at 53 days of supply compared to 93 days at the end of 2008. Now let me turn to service centers and distributors whereby historical measures, inventory levels also remain low. Based on the December 31, 2009, MSCI report, carbon flat-rolled steel inventories stood at 2.6 months of supply on hand. By comparison, this figure was 3.6 months of supply on hand a year ago.  Using MSCI's seasonally-adjusted numbers, the December 2009 inventories represented 2.2 months of supply compared to 2.1 months of supply on hand at the end of November.On a tonnage basis, total carbon flat-rolled steel inventories stood at 3.5 million tons at the end of 2009, which represented a 24% reduction compared to 4.7 million tons on hand at the end of 2008. Importantly, the MSCI data also showed that December shipments of carbon flat-rolled steel were up by about 4% compared to a year ago.Turning to stainless, stainless steel inventories stood at 2.9 months of supply on hand at the end of 2009, and that compared to 3.2 months supply at the end of 2008. And on a tonnage basis, total stainless steel inventories stood at 287,000 tons at the end of '09, which was 20% below the 359,000 tons of stainless at the end of 2008. We take our lead from our customers, and what they're telling us is that business conditions continue to improve. But to date, except for automotive, the pace of that recovery remains relatively slow in comparison to previous recessions. Speaking of automotive, our Auto Chrome business has strengthened as automotive production and sales have picked up. This business rose by more than 20% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. And when you compare the fourth quarter to the second quarter, our Auto Chrome business nearly doubled. We look for a continued strong demand in 2010.On the electrical steel front, the fourth quarter of 2009 continued the recent trend of weaker demand from both NAFTA and export customers. As we look ahead to the year 2010, we expect a slow but steady recovery in demand for electrical steels. In light of the depressed NAFTA and export market conditions, not surprisingly, our electrical steel contract selling prices have declined. However, we expect that an increase in our 2010 sales volumes of this product, coupled with a richer product mix, will more than offset the lower selling prices. We believe that the gradually-recovering economy here at home, as well as the recovering economies abroad, will spur increases in consumption of electrical steel, and we will continue to be advantaged by our products and our approach. In other words, we're well positioned to serve the high end of the electrical steel market, and we believe that our approach to customer service and the overall strength of our relationships will result in increased market share for AK Steel going forward.The U.S. and the world will continue to have a growing need for new and more efficient electrical power. That is a need that AK Steel is perfectly suited to fill.As most of you know, AK Steel is one of the largest suppliers in the world of manufacturers of power generation and distribution transformers. In the United States beginning this month, federal law now mandates higher energy efficiency standards for distribution transformers. Our electrical steels will be used to help transformer manufacturers meet those higher standards for both replacement technology and to modernize our nation's electricity grid.With the weak U.S dollar, we'll also continue to capitalize on export opportunities where possible. However, with respect to sales of electrical steel in China, our ability to capitalize on export opportunities has been hampered by a recent decision by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. This organization which is known as MOFCOM, ruled preliminarily to impose duties of about 22% on our electrical steel imported into China.We're very disappointed by that decision, but we're cooperating with the MOFCOM officials in this ongoing trade proceeding. We'll continue to try to impress upon them that their preliminary findings lack any factual or legal basis. We anticipate a final determination by the Chinese Ministry with respect to the duties some time this spring. If they continue to impose duties on our electrical steel products, we would expect to file an appeal to the WTO, vigorously challenging the imposition of those duties.As we enter the new year and the new decade, we are ready for the recovery at AK Steel. Accordingly in 2010, we'll remain focused on our core values. We'll execute with world-class precision. We'll aggressively control those costs that we can, as we strive to deliver shareholder value and work to achieve year-long continuous improvement in every way. Not only are we ready for the recovery but we are experiencing the early stages of a recovery and positioning the company to compete and to win in the global steel marketplace as the recovery takes hold. Thanks to all of the progress that we've made over the past six years at AK Steel. We were well positioned to weather this severe economic storm, to capitalize on the chaos and to secure market opportunities that will serve us well in the days ahead. Our management team has a track record of overcoming adversity, and we did so once again during the great recession of 2008 and 2009. Now we position the company for economic recovery in 2010 and for a continued prosperity beyond that.Once again, thank you for being with us today. This concludes my prepared remarks and at this time, we'd be happy to take your questions."

We will benefit from a richer product mix, probably our richest mix ever in this product line, as customers that we have continue to seek the highest efficiency grades of electrical steels, so pricing will be down. Mix will be up. Volume will be up. And overall, it'll be a better year for us in terms of electrical steel."

In a moment, I'll review our fourth quarter and full year results and provide some guidance for 2010. Following my remarks, Jim Wainscott, will offer his comments and field your questions.Today's call include certain forward-looking guidance. Other than the comments on historical results, remarks we make today constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements include our expectations as to our future shipments, product mix, prices, costs, operating profit and liquidity. While we believe that our expectations are reasonable, we cannot assure you they will prove to have been correct since they are based on assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to risks. Such risks include economic, competitive and operational risks, uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are beyond our control, and based upon assumptions with respect to future business decisions that are subject to change.Except as required by law, the company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect future developments or events. For more detailed information, we encourage you to review the discussion of risks affecting forward-looking statements found in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, as updated in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q. To the extent we refer to material information that includes non-GAAP financial measures, the reconciliation information required by Regulation G is available on the company's website at aksteel.com.Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter 2009 results that reflect a significant improvement over the third quarter, with increases in shipments, revenues, operating profit and net income. In fact, our fourth quarter performance represents our third consecutive quarter of improved financial results and our best quarter of 2009. AK Steel reported net income of $39.8 million for the fourth quarter or $0.36 per share compared to $6.2 million or $0.06 per share in the third quarter. Our fourth quarter net income was negatively impacted by a $5.1 million charge related to a tax law change by the state of Pennsylvania, which we discussed in our third quarter earnings call. Fourth quarter shipments were 1,368,300 tons, an increase of 320,500 tons or 31% over the previous quarter. Average selling prices increased quarter-over-quarter for each of our three major product groups, carbon steels, stainless and electrical steels as well as tubular steel products. However, as expected, our overall average selling price of $964 per ton was roughly 3% lower quarter-to-quarter, primarily due to product mix. That is carbon steels comprised of higher percentage of our sales during the quarter.Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $1,320,000,000, which was $279 million or about 27% higher than our third quarter revenues. While general market conditions remained challenging in the fourth quarter, we saw increased demand from many of our customers, particularly among carbon steel buyers.Now looking at costs. We benefited from lower raw material costs compared to the third quarter, including lower costs for pellets and purchase coke, partially offset by higher carbon scrap, coating metals and natural gas costs. However, we do not expect the trend of overall lower raw material costs to continue in the first quarter of 2010.  Netting revenues and costs, we achieved an operating profit of $87 million or $64 per ton. This represents a very solid improvement of $71.7 million or roughly $49 per ton compared to the third quarter.Turning now to our full-year results. Despite the significant challenges of the great recession, AK Steel returned to solid profitability in the second half of the year. While we posted a net loss of $74.6 million or $0.68 per share for the year, we generated net income of $46 million or $0.42 per share during the second half of 2009. Shipments for 2009 totaled 3.9 million tons, with an average selling price of $1,036 per ton. 2009 revenues were $4.1 billion. Nearly 60% of total revenues occurred in the second half of the year as we benefited from the early stages of an economic recovery. Our sales outside the U.S. in 2009 were $767 million, representing approximately 19% of our total sales. By comparison, sales outside the U.S. in 2008 were roughly 17% of total sales. Our results also reflect a larger-than-expected LIFO credit of $417 million for 2009 due to significantly lower raw material and energy costs and a reduction in inventory levels. For the year 2009, we incurred an operating loss of $70.1 million or $18 per ton, all of which was incurred in the first half of the year before the company returned to profitability.Turning to the balance sheet. With the difficult market conditions, we intensified our focus on cash and liquidity throughout the year. As a result, we succeeded in maintaining a very solid cash position. We grew cash by more than $122 million or roughly 36% from the third quarter, ending the year with $462 million. Combined with the availability under our revolver, our total liquidity stood at more than $1 billion at December 31. Our focus on the balance sheet allowed us to maintain a strong financial position even while making some substantial investments in the company. For example, we invested $110 million in capital improvements, including the installation of a new hearth in our Middletown Works blast furnace. And we've contributed a total of $210 million to our pension plans, along with $65 million to the Middletown retirees VEBA.At the end of 2009, our net debt was less than $150 million. Our debt was favorably impacted by the repurchase during the year of $26.4 million in par value of our 7 3/4% senior notes at a cost of roughly $23 million. In the past two years, we have repurchased a total of $46 million at par value of these notes for an average purchase price of about $0.80 on the dollar. Other actions in 2009 to enhance shareholder value included the repurchase of more than $1.6 million shares of AK Steel's common stock at an average price of $6.13 per share. In the past two years, we have repurchased nearly 3.3 million shares at an average price of $7.43 per share, well below the current market value.Turning to the pension fund. In the calendar year 2009, we enjoyed an investment gain of more than 17% from our investment portfolio, a solid performance based on an asset mix of roughly 60% equities and 40% fixed income. Looking forward, funding requirements for our pension plans continue to be very manageable, with approximately $105 million required in 2010. As we announced this morning, our Board of Directors has approved the contribution of $75 million this quarter, which will meet a significant portion of the company's 2010 funding requirements.Now for some guidance for the first quarter of 2010. We expect shipments to be essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. As it's typically the case, we expect the first quarter to be our lowest shipment quarter of the year. We expect our average selling price to increase by 4% to 5% quarter-over-quarter. We expect lower operating costs in the first quarter due to improved operating rates and continuous improvements in all areas of our business.In addition, we expect maintenance outage costs will be lower than in the previous quarter. And while we experienced a significant LIFO credit in 2009, we do not expect that will be the case for 2010. Netting the positive and negatives including moving from a LIFO credit to a LIFO charge, we expect to report an operating profit of approximately $35 per ton for the first quarter of 2010.As we look to the remainder of the year, we expect our quarterly shipment levels and average selling price to be higher than during the first quarter. Finally, as we typically do, let me offer a few data points for the full-year 2010.We anticipate total capital investments of about $200 million in 2010, essentially equal to depreciation. We expect interest expense to be roughly flat year-over-year, but pension and OPEB expense will decrease by approximately $40 million in 2010, largely due to better-than-expected pension investment returns in 2009. And finally, with regard to income taxes, while we are projecting a book tax rate for 2010 of roughly 39%, we estimate our cash tax rate will be less than 5%. Now for his comments, here's Jim Wainscott."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We finished the year 2009 in strong fashion with higher shipments and lower costs than we had expected. And I'm proud of the fact that with each successive quarter in 200",2850,"Thank you very much, Al. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We finished the year 2009 in strong fashion with higher shipments and lower costs than we had expected. And I'm proud of the fact that with each successive quarter in 2009, our results continued to improve. And as we concluded one of the most challenging years in the 110-year history of AK Steel, our fourth quarter performance represented our strongest quarter of 2009, and that is a credit to all of the employees of AK Steel who responded to the challenges of one of the most severe economic downturns in our country's history.Not only did we conclude a very challenging year, but 2009 also represented the end of a rather adventurous decade for AK Steel and the steel industry for that matter. It was certainly a time frame during which the Board of Directors and the management team of AK Steel repositioned the company for success in the coming decade.But in 2009, we did what we had to do in order to survive what economists called the great recession. That's what great leadership is all about, managing through tough times. As we look ahead to 2010, it's our intent that AK Steel to move from the great recession to the great recovery. That's because our production has returned to about 85% of capacity for our first quarter of 2010 compared to our low point, the second quarter of last year, when we were operating on average at only 45% of capacity.These higher current operating rates are great for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the fact that they put our people back to work. In fact, we've recently been hiring new employees at our Ashland Works. Things are certainly better. Recall, as I mentioned that in the second quarter of 2009, we experienced record low quarterly shipments of only 740,000 tons. But we've recovered nicely from that low point, reporting fourth quarter 2009 shipments, as Al mentioned, of nearly 1,370,000 tons or some 85% higher.While we're still not where we want to be back to pre-recession production and shipment levels, we are absolutely moving in the right direction. As a company, we've made solid progress throughout the year with each successive quarter better than the previous one, both in terms of operating and net profitability, truly a testament once again to the can-do spirit of the employees of AK Steel. Throughout our company, we have a resilient group of people who simply refuse to lose. We may get knocked down but we get right back up and we get after it.Speaking of our people, I'm pleased that late in the fourth quarter, we obtained a three-year labor contract extension at our Coshocton Works with the United Auto Workers union. This agreement replaced the existing contract that was set to expire on April 1, 2010. And while we're on the subject of labor, it's worth noting that our only other labor agreement expiring this year is with the United Steelworkers at the Ashland Works main plant. That agreement is set to expire on September 1.Take care of your customers and your people, and all things are possible. That has been our approach at AK Steel for quite a while now, and I'm confident that a high degree of our success is due to following that approach. As a management team, we are most proud of the way we treated our customers and our people in 2009. And through it all, we stayed true to our core values of safety, quality and productivity.At AK Steel, we have no higher priority than the safety of our people. For 2009, we exceeded our company-specific safety goals, and we continue to lead the entire steel industry once again by a wide margin in terms of safety performance. We set a new company record of only 15 OSHA-recordable injuries. While that's the best that we've ever done, our goal is and must always be zero. And guess what, employees at two of our plants, Rockport and Zanesville, actually delivered zeroes. They worked the entire year without a single recordable injury. That is a terrific achievement by everyone at those two locations.Also during Q4, the Columbus, Indiana plant of our AK Tube subsidiary was recertified by the Department of Labor under the DOL's Voluntary Protection Program for having safety programs that go above and beyond OSHA requirements. Congratulations to our AK Tube Columbus employees.Now let me shift gears from safety to quality, a subject that matters a great deal to our customers. At AK Steel, we build our reputation based upon making great quality products, delivering them on time and providing superior customer service. This is only possible when the entire organization, sales, customer technical services, research, operations and all the staff functions realize that without our customers, there is no need for AK Steel.Speaking of research, we continue to do everything we can to meet the needs of our customers for the finest quality, most energy-efficient carbon, stainless and electrical steels. During the fourth quarter, the hard work that AK Steel's researchers performed got some well-deserved recognition. Our researchers were the recipients of the 42nd Annual Outstanding Author Award from the Galvanizers Association. This honor was presented in connection with a technical paper on the subject of Furnace Atmosphere Monitoring at our coating lines. By the way, this marked the 10th time that AK Steel has received this very prestigious recognition.Once again, in our company, our focus is on serving our customers better than any other steelmaker. And our performance on that front continues to differentiate AK Steel from its peers. Despite operating in a very, very difficult environment in 2009, last year was one of our best years ever in terms of quality. That opinion of mine was recently validated by the annual results of an independent customer survey performed by Jacobson & Associates. According to the Jacobson survey, our carbon and specialty steel customers rated AK Steel number one in overall customer satisfaction, as well as number one in quality and delivery for the year 2009. Ladies and gentlemen, that is about as good as it gets.For 2009, in short, we rolled on. As we work through the very tough economic challenges of the day, we remained focused on our core values as we outperformed the expectations of our customers and shareholders. In addition, we lowered our costs and we lifted or grew our cash position. In essence, we return to our three Cs approach of focusing on customers, costs and cash. The things that matter very much last year. Those were the items that really drove our priorities. And at the bottom line, although we reported net income, as Al mentioned, for the third and fourth quarters of 2009, we did report a net loss for the full year 2009. Excluding special charges, it's our first annual loss since the year 2003. Let me assure you that we have no intention of a repeat performance of this sort for 2010. Quite contrary, AK Steel expects to be solidly profitable for the year 2010.As was the case in 2009, we expect sequential quarterly improvement in our results throughout 2010, as we enjoy the benefits of higher production and shipments, as well as higher pricing. That said, from a profitability standpoint, we expect the first quarter to be our weakest, given product lead times we came into 2010 with a portion of our sales already in the order book for the first quarter.These sales were made prior to our recently-announced spot market price increases. Thus, as a result, much of the steel that we'll ship in the first quarter will be at prices below the current pricing levels. Accordingly, we'll have, what I term, a bit of a mismatch between our first quarter sales prices and our costs. It's because our costs will reflect the realtime increases that are going on in scrap and the expected increases for iron ore prices, whereas our selling prices for most of our first quarter shipments will not fully comprehend these cost increases until next quarter.Let's take a moment to expand on this thought. It's important to realize that the higher iron ore prices that we anticipate, once in fact the deals are settled, are retroactive to January 1 of this year. In contrast, most of our selling prices have already been set for the first quarter, hence, the mismatch situation of which I spoke.Having said that, as we look to future quarters and to the full year, we expect a much improved 2010 as compared to 2009. Our annual sales volumes for 2010 should be about 40% higher than 2009. We are seeing an improvement in overall demand from our customers, but the biggest change that we're seeing is that customers are once again purchasing steel in quantities that are equal to their sales levels. That's a big change from a year ago, and even a couple of quarters ago when customers were selling product from their stock of inventory.Our average selling prices are expected to improve as well, as a function of the increased demand and the need to recover higher costs. Let me confirm that we are indeed now booking new spot market sales at increasingly higher sales prices. We have to because, again, our costs are rising rapidly.On the subject of steelmaking input costs, we have experienced a large increase recently in the price we pay for steel scrap. Scrap prices in 2010 have already risen by about 18% from early December of 2009. As a matter of fact, scrap prices are now at pre-recession price levels. In terms of iron ore, most analysts who have covered the raw material sector now forecast that iron ore prices are likely to rise by 20% to 25% in 2010 as compared to 2009. Given the current supply and demand conditions, in particular, increased demand from China, we too expect iron ore prices to be on the rise again in 2010.Accordingly, as it has been the case in recent years, steel producers including AK Steel, will be under significant cost pressures this year from higher prices for raw materials. In response to these cost pressures, we have announced a series of spot market price increases in recent months for carbon and stainless steel products, as well as the related surcharges for these products. And once again, the price increases are reflective of increases in input costs and increased order intake rates for us.Speaking of orders, our lead times for carbon products are lengthening with hot-rolled out to the first half of March, and cold-rolled and coated products out to the second half of March. And depending on the product, some of our stainless steel lead times are now out into April.With that, let me take a couple of minutes before taking your questions to comment on what we're seeing in the markets for each of our products. In general, we see the year 2010 as one of gradual recovery in the markets that we serve. In terms of the automotive market, according to our customers and several forecasters, we look for an auto build rate in 2010 of about 10.6 million vehicles compared to an estimated 8.5 million units for 2009. On the sales side, the numbers climb to about 12 million units for 2010 compared to an estimated 10.4 million units for 2009. Auto inventories are in much better shape now than they were a year ago. 2009 auto inventories finished at 53 days of supply compared to 93 days at the end of 2008. Now let me turn to service centers and distributors whereby historical measures, inventory levels also remain low. Based on the December 31, 2009, MSCI report, carbon flat-rolled steel inventories stood at 2.6 months of supply on hand. By comparison, this figure was 3.6 months of supply on hand a year ago.  Using MSCI's seasonally-adjusted numbers, the December 2009 inventories represented 2.2 months of supply compared to 2.1 months of supply on hand at the end of November.On a tonnage basis, total carbon flat-rolled steel inventories stood at 3.5 million tons at the end of 2009, which represented a 24% reduction compared to 4.7 million tons on hand at the end of 2008. Importantly, the MSCI data also showed that December shipments of carbon flat-rolled steel were up by about 4% compared to a year ago.Turning to stainless. Stainless steel inventories stood at 2.9 months of supply on hand at the end of 2009, and that compared to 3.2 months supply at the end of 2008. And on a tonnage basis, total stainless steel inventories stood at 287,000 tons at the end of '09, which was 20% below the 359,000 tons of stainless at the end of 2008. We take our lead from our customers, and what they're telling us is that business conditions continue to improve. But to date, except for automotive, the pace of that recovery remains relatively slow in comparison to previous recessions. Speaking of automotive, our Auto Chrome business has strengthened as automotive production and sales have picked up. This business rose by more than 20% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. And when you compare the fourth quarter to the second quarter, our Auto Chrome business nearly doubled. We look for a continued strong demand in 2010.On the electrical steel front, the fourth quarter of 2009 continued the recent trend of weaker demand from both NAFTA and export customers. As we look ahead to the year 2010, we expect a slow but steady recovery in demand for electrical steels. In light of the depressed NAFTA and export market conditions, not surprisingly, our electrical steel contract selling prices have declined. However, we expect that an increase in our 2010 sales volumes of this product, coupled with a richer product mix, will more than offset the lower selling prices. We believe that the gradually-recovering economy here at home, as well as the recovering economies abroad, will spur increases in consumption of electrical steel, and we will continue to be advantaged by our products and our approach. In other words, we're well positioned to serve the high end of the electrical steel market, and we believe that our approach to customer service and the overall strength of our relationships will result in increased market share for AK Steel going forward.The U.S. and the world will continue to have a growing need for new and more efficient electrical power. That is a need that AK Steel is perfectly suited to fill.As most of you know, AK Steel is one of the largest suppliers in the world of manufacturers of power generation and distribution transformers. In the United States beginning this month, federal law now mandates higher energy efficiency standards for distribution transformers. Our electrical steels will be used to help transformer manufacturers meet those higher standards for both replacement technology and to modernize our nation's electricity grid.With the weak U.S dollar, we'll also continue to capitalize on export opportunities where possible. However, with respect to sales of electrical steel in China, our ability to capitalize on export opportunities has been hampered by a recent decision by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. This organization which is known as MOFCOM, ruled preliminarily to impose duties of about 22% on our electrical steel imported into China.We're very disappointed by that decision, but we're cooperating with the MOFCOM officials in this ongoing trade proceeding. We'll continue to try to impress upon them that their preliminary findings lack any factual or legal basis. We anticipate a final determination by the Chinese Ministry with respect to the duties some time this spring. If they continue to impose duties on our electrical steel products, we would expect to file an appeal to the WTO, vigorously challenging the imposition of those duties.As we enter the new year and the new decade, we are ready for the recovery at AK Steel. Accordingly in 2010, we'll remain focused on our core values. We'll execute with world-class precision. We'll aggressively control those costs that we can, as we strive to deliver shareholder value and work to achieve year-long continuous improvement in every way. Not only are we ready for the recovery but we are experiencing the early stages of a recovery and positioning the company to compete and to win in the global steel marketplace as the recovery takes hold. Thanks to all of the progress that we've made over the past six years at AK Steel. We were well positioned to weather this severe economic storm, to capitalize on the chaos and to secure market opportunities that will serve us well in the days ahead. Our management team has a track record of overcoming adversity, and we did so once again during the great recession of 2008 and 2009. Now we position the company for economic recovery in 2010 and for a continued prosperity beyond that.Once again, thank you for being with us today. This concludes my prepared remarks and at this time, we'd be happy to take your questions."

The volume for 2009, of what's continuously under fire and probably came in roughly 30% or so down year-over-year, that is when we compared it to 2008, as we look to the question of volume for 2010, we expect at least a 30% increase in our volumes compared to 2009. So that's obviously, very, very good news in function of the quality of our product and the value of our relationships. On the pricing front, again as I mentioned, in light of global supply and demand conditions, right now we expect our pricing for this sub-product line in 2010 to be less, but less by something less than double digits, less than a 10% decline. We will benefit from a richer product mix, probably our richest mix ever in this product line, as customers that we have continue to seek the highest efficiency grades of electrical steels, so pricing will be down. Mix will be up. Volume will be up. And overall, it'll be a better year for us in terms of electrical steel."

But again, we're already booking out into March and April as we speak, so we won't be able to go back and recoup those higher costs at this point. I think prices for scrap, prices for iron ore have been going up if you believe the trade press, almost weekly. And we're trying to stay current with that but in a rising cost environment, we're a little bit behind the curve. We'll catch up but I think it'll be meaningful."

A lot of our deals will expire in the first half and I think that will be very, very helpful. We still have a very significant place at the table that I want to emphasize for plants, manufacturers, for infrastructure and manufacturing participants and certainly, the service centers and distributors and all of our specialty steel customers.

That is paying dividends for us. We're able to get some business that we've been seeking, and I think that our volumes this year will reflect that. I don't know what others are doing. We make independent production and pricing decisions but I can tell you that our outlook is a positive one, because that's reflective of the orders and the pricing that we're getting.

In a moment, I'll review our fourth quarter and full year results and provide some guidance for 2010. Following my remarks, Jim Wainscott, will offer his comments and field your questions.Today's call include certain forward-looking guidance. Other than the comments on historical results, remarks we make today constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements include our expectations as to our future shipments, product mix, prices, costs, operating profit and liquidity. While we believe that our expectations are reasonable, we cannot assure you they will prove to have been correct since they are based on assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to risks. Such risks include economic, competitive and operational risks, uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are beyond our control, and based upon assumptions with respect to future business decisions that are subject to change.Except as required by law, the company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect future developments or events. For more detailed information, we encourage you to review the discussion of risks affecting forward-looking statements found in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, as updated in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q. To the extent we refer to material information that includes non-GAAP financial measures, the reconciliation information required by Regulation G is available on the company's website at aksteel.com.Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter 2009 results that reflect a significant improvement over the third quarter, with increases in shipments, revenues, operating profit and net income. In fact, our fourth quarter performance represents our third consecutive quarter of improved financial results and our best quarter of 2009. AK Steel reported net income of $39.8 million for the fourth quarter or $0.36 per share compared to $6.2 million or $0.06 per share in the third quarter. Our fourth quarter net income was negatively impacted by a $5.1 million charge related to a tax law change by the state of Pennsylvania, which we discussed in our third quarter earnings call. Fourth quarter shipments were 1,368,300 tons, an increase of 320,500 tons or 31% over the previous quarter. Average selling prices increased quarter-over-quarter for each of our three major product groups, carbon steels, stainless and electrical steels as well as tubular steel products. However, as expected, our overall average selling price of $964 per ton was roughly 3% lower quarter-to-quarter, primarily due to product mix. That is carbon steels comprised of higher percentage of our sales during the quarter.Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $1,320,000,000, which was $279 million or about 27% higher than our third quarter revenues. While general market conditions remained challenging in the fourth quarter, we saw increased demand from many of our customers, particularly among carbon steel buyers.Now looking at costs. We benefited from lower raw material costs compared to the third quarter, including lower costs for pellets and purchase coke, partially offset by higher carbon scrap, coating metals and natural gas costs. However, we do not expect the trend of overall lower raw material costs to continue in the first quarter of 2010.  Netting revenues and costs, we achieved an operating profit of $87 million or $64 per ton. This represents a very solid improvement of $71.7 million or roughly $49 per ton compared to the third quarter.Turning now to our full-year results. Despite the significant challenges of the great recession, AK Steel returned to solid profitability in the second half of the year. While we posted a net loss of $74.6 million or $0.68 per share for the year, we generated net income of $46 million or $0.42 per share during the second half of 2009. Shipments for 2009 totaled 3.9 million tons, with an average selling price of $1,036 per ton. 2009 revenues were $4.1 billion. Nearly 60% of total revenues occurred in the second half of the year as we benefited from the early stages of an economic recovery. Our sales outside the U.S. in 2009 were $767 million, representing approximately 19% of our total sales. By comparison, sales outside the U.S. in 2008 were roughly 17% of total sales. Our results also reflect a larger-than-expected LIFO credit of $417 million for 2009 due to significantly lower raw material and energy costs and a reduction in inventory levels. For the year 2009, we incurred an operating loss of $70.1 million or $18 per ton, all of which was incurred in the first half of the year before the company returned to profitability.Turning to the balance sheet. With the difficult market conditions, we intensified our focus on cash and liquidity throughout the year. As a result, we succeeded in maintaining a very solid cash position. We grew cash by more than $122 million or roughly 36% from the third quarter, ending the year with $462 million. Combined with the availability under our revolver, our total liquidity stood at more than $1 billion at December 31. Our focus on the balance sheet allowed us to maintain a strong financial position even while making some substantial investments in the company. For example, we invested $110 million in capital improvements, including the installation of a new hearth in our Middletown Works blast furnace. And we've contributed a total of $210 million to our pension plans, along with $65 million to the Middletown retirees VEBA.At the end of 2009, our net debt was less than $150 million. Our debt was favorably impacted by the repurchase during the year of $26.4 million in par value of our 7 3/4% senior notes at a cost of roughly $23 million. In the past two years, we have repurchased a total of $46 million at par value of these notes for an average purchase price of about $0.80 on the dollar. Other actions in 2009 to enhance shareholder value included the repurchase of more than $1.6 million shares of AK Steel's common stock at an average price of $6.13 per share. In the past two years, we have repurchased nearly 3.3 million shares at an average price of $7.43 per share, well below the current market value.Turning to the pension fund. In the calendar year 2009, we enjoyed an investment gain of more than 17% from our investment portfolio, a solid performance based on an asset mix of roughly 60% equities and 40% fixed income. Looking forward, funding requirements for our pension plans continue to be very manageable, with approximately $105 million required in 2010. As we announced this morning, our Board of Directors has approved the contribution of $75 million this quarter, which will meet a significant portion of the company's 2010 funding requirements.Now for some guidance for the first quarter of 2010. We expect shipments to be essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. As it's typically the case, we expect the first quarter to be our lowest shipment quarter of the year. We expect our average selling price to increase by 4% to 5% quarter-over-quarter. We expect lower operating costs in the first quarter due to improved operating rates and continuous improvements in all areas of our business.In addition, we expect maintenance outage costs will be lower than in the previous quarter. And while we experienced a significant LIFO credit in 2009, we do not expect that will be the case for 2010. Netting the positive and negatives including moving from a LIFO credit to a LIFO charge, we expect to report an operating profit of approximately $35 per ton for the first quarter of 2010.As we look to the remainder of the year, we expect our quarterly shipment levels and average selling price to be higher than during the first quarter. Finally, as we typically do, let me offer a few data points for the full-year 2010.We anticipate total capital investments of about $200 million in 2010, essentially equal to depreciation. We expect interest expense to be roughly flat year-over-year, but pension and OPEB expense will decrease by approximately $40 million in 2010, largely due to better-than-expected pension investment returns in 2009. And finally, with regard to income taxes, while we are projecting a book tax rate for 2010 of roughly 39%, we estimate our cash tax rate will be less than 5%. Now for his comments, here's Jim Wainscott."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We finished the year 2009 in strong fashion with higher shipments and lower costs than we had expected. And I'm proud of the fact that with each successive quarter in 200",2850,"Thank you very much, Al. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We finished the year 2009 in strong fashion with higher shipments and lower costs than we had expected. And I'm proud of the fact that with each successive quarter in 2009, our results continued to improve. And as we concluded one of the most challenging years in the 110-year history of AK Steel, our fourth quarter performance represented our strongest quarter of 2009, and that is a credit to all of the employees of AK Steel who responded to the challenges of one of the most severe economic downturns in our country's history.Not only did we conclude a very challenging year, but 2009 also represented the end of a rather adventurous decade for AK Steel and the steel industry for that matter. It was certainly a time frame during which the Board of Directors and the management team of AK Steel repositioned the company for success in the coming decade.But in 2009, we did what we had to do in order to survive what economists called the great recession. That's what great leadership is all about, managing through tough times. As we look ahead to 2010, it's our intent that AK Steel to move from the great recession to the great recovery. That's because our production has returned to about 85% of capacity for our first quarter of 2010 compared to our low point, the second quarter of last year, when we were operating on average at only 45% of capacity.These higher current operating rates are great for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the fact that they put our people back to work. In fact, we've recently been hiring new employees at our Ashland Works. Things are certainly better. Recall, as I mentioned that in the second quarter of 2009, we experienced record low quarterly shipments of only 740,000 tons. But we've recovered nicely from that low point, reporting fourth quarter 2009 shipments, as Al mentioned, of nearly 1,370,000 tons or some 85% higher.While we're still not where we want to be back to pre-recession production and shipment levels, we are absolutely moving in the right direction. As a company, we've made solid progress throughout the year with each successive quarter better than the previous one, both in terms of operating and net profitability, truly a testament once again to the can-do spirit of the employees of AK Steel. Throughout our company, we have a resilient group of people who simply refuse to lose. We may get knocked down but we get right back up and we get after it.Speaking of our people, I'm pleased that late in the fourth quarter, we obtained a three-year labor contract extension at our Coshocton Works with the United Auto Workers union. This agreement replaced the existing contract that was set to expire on April 1, 2010. And while we're on the subject of labor, it's worth noting that our only other labor agreement expiring this year is with the United Steelworkers at the Ashland Works main plant. That agreement is set to expire on September 1.Take care of your customers and your people, and all things are possible. That has been our approach at AK Steel for quite a while now, and I'm confident that a high degree of our success is due to following that approach. As a management team, we are most proud of the way we treated our customers and our people in 2009. And through it all, we stayed true to our core values of safety, quality and productivity.At AK Steel, we have no higher priority than the safety of our people. For 2009, we exceeded our company-specific safety goals, and we continue to lead the entire steel industry once again by a wide margin in terms of safety performance. We set a new company record of only 15 OSHA-recordable injuries. While that's the best that we've ever done, our goal is and must always be zero. And guess what, employees at two of our plants, Rockport and Zanesville, actually delivered zeroes. They worked the entire year without a single recordable injury. That is a terrific achievement by everyone at those two locations.Also during Q4, the Columbus, Indiana plant of our AK Tube subsidiary was recertified by the Department of Labor under the DOL's Voluntary Protection Program for having safety programs that go above and beyond OSHA requirements. Congratulations to our AK Tube Columbus employees.Now let me shift gears from safety to quality, a subject that matters a great deal to our customers. At AK Steel, we build our reputation based upon making great quality products, delivering them on time and providing superior customer service. This is only possible when the entire organization, sales, customer technical services, research, operations and all the staff functions realize that without our customers, there is no need for AK Steel.Speaking of research, we continue to do everything we can to meet the needs of our customers for the finest quality, most energy-efficient carbon, stainless and electrical steels. During the fourth quarter, the hard work that AK Steel's researchers performed got some well-deserved recognition. Our researchers were the recipients of the 42nd Annual Outstanding Author Award from the Galvanizers Association. This honor was presented in connection with a technical paper on the subject of Furnace Atmosphere Monitoring at our coating lines. By the way, this marked the 10th time that AK Steel has received this very prestigious recognition.Once again, in our company, our focus is on serving our customers better than any other steelmaker. And our performance on that front continues to differentiate AK Steel from its peers. Despite operating in a very, very difficult environment in 2009, last year was one of our best years ever in terms of quality. That opinion of mine was recently validated by the annual results of an independent customer survey performed by Jacobson & Associates. According to the Jacobson survey, our carbon and specialty steel customers rated AK Steel number one in overall customer satisfaction, as well as number one in quality and delivery for the year 2009. Ladies and gentlemen, that is about as good as it gets.For 2009, in short, we rolled on. As we work through the very tough economic challenges of the day, we remained focused on our core values as we outperformed the expectations of our customers and shareholders. In addition, we lowered our costs and we lifted or grew our cash position. In essence, we return to our three Cs approach of focusing on customers, costs and cash. The things that matter very much last year. Those were the items that really drove our priorities. And at the bottom line, although we reported net income, as Al mentioned, for the third and fourth quarters of 2009, we did report a net loss for the full year 2009. Excluding special charges, it's our first annual loss since the year 2003. Let me assure you that we have no intention of a repeat performance of this sort for 2010. Quite contrary, AK Steel expects to be solidly profitable for the year 2010.As was the case in 2009, we expect sequential quarterly improvement in our results throughout 2010, as we enjoy the benefits of higher production and shipments, as well as higher pricing. That said, from a profitability standpoint, we expect the first quarter to be our weakest, given product lead times we came into 2010 with a portion of our sales already in the order book for the first quarter.These sales were made prior to our recently-announced spot market price increases. Thus, as a result, much of the steel that we'll ship in the first quarter will be at prices below the current pricing levels. Accordingly, we'll have, what I term, a bit of a mismatch between our first quarter sales prices and our costs. It's because our costs will reflect the realtime increases that are going on in scrap and the expected increases for iron ore prices, whereas our selling prices for most of our first quarter shipments will not fully comprehend these cost increases until next quarter.Let's take a moment to expand on this thought. It's important to realize that the higher iron ore prices that we anticipate, once in fact the deals are settled, are retroactive to January 1 of this year. In contrast, most of our selling prices have already been set for the first quarter, hence, the mismatch situation of which I spoke.Having said that, as we look to future quarters and to the full year, we expect a much improved 2010 as compared to 2009. Our annual sales volumes for 2010 should be about 40% higher than 2009. We are seeing an improvement in overall demand from our customers, but the biggest change that we're seeing is that customers are once again purchasing steel in quantities that are equal to their sales levels. That's a big change from a year ago, and even a couple of quarters ago when customers were selling product from their stock of inventory.Our average selling prices are expected to improve as well, as a function of the increased demand and the need to recover higher costs. Let me confirm that we are indeed now booking new spot market sales at increasingly higher sales prices. We have to because, again, our costs are rising rapidly.On the subject of steelmaking input costs, we have experienced a large increase recently in the price we pay for steel scrap. Scrap prices in 2010 have already risen by about 18% from early December of 2009. As a matter of fact, scrap prices are now at pre-recession price levels. In terms of iron ore, most analysts who have covered the raw material sector now forecast that iron ore prices are likely to rise by 20% to 25% in 2010 as compared to 2009. Given the current supply and demand conditions, in particular, increased demand from China, we too expect iron ore prices to be on the rise again in 2010.Accordingly, as it has been the case in recent years, steel producers including AK Steel, will be under significant cost pressures this year from higher prices for raw materials. In response to these cost pressures, we have announced a series of spot market price increases in recent months for carbon and stainless steel products, as well as the related surcharges for these products. And once again, the price increases are reflective of increases in input costs and increased order intake rates for us.Speaking of orders, our lead times for carbon products are lengthening with hot-rolled out to the first half of March, and cold-rolled and coated products out to the second half of March. And depending on the product, some of our stainless steel lead times are now out into April.With that, let me take a couple of minutes before taking your questions to comment on what we're seeing in the markets for each of our products. In general, we see the year 2010 as one of gradual recovery in the markets that we serve. In terms of the automotive market, according to our customers and several forecasters, we look for an auto build rate in 2010 of about 10.6 million vehicles compared to an estimated 8.5 million units for 2009. On the sales side, the numbers climb to about 12 million units for 2010 compared to an estimated 10.4 million units for 2009. Auto inventories are in much better shape now than they were a year ago. 2009 auto inventories finished at 53 days of supply compared to 93 days at the end of 2008. Now let me turn to service centers and distributors whereby historical measures, inventory levels also remain low. Based on the December 31, 2009, MSCI report, carbon flat-rolled steel inventories stood at 2.6 months of supply on hand. By comparison, this figure was 3.6 months of supply on hand a year ago.  Using MSCI's seasonally-adjusted numbers, the December 2009 inventories represented 2.2 months of supply compared to 2.1 months of supply on hand at the end of November.On a tonnage basis, total carbon flat-rolled steel inventories stood at 3.5 million tons at the end of 2009, which represented a 24% reduction compared to 4.7 million tons on hand at the end of 2008. Importantly, the MSCI data also showed that December shipments of carbon flat-rolled steel were up by about 4% compared to a year ago.Turning to stainless. Stainless steel inventories stood at 2.9 months of supply on hand at the end of 2009, and that compared to 3.2 months supply at the end of 2008. And on a tonnage basis, total stainless steel inventories stood at 287,000 tons at the end of '09, which was 20% below the 359,000 tons of stainless at the end of 2008. We take our lead from our customers, and what they're telling us is that business conditions continue to improve. But to date, except for automotive, the pace of that recovery remains relatively slow in comparison to previous recessions. Speaking of automotive, our Auto Chrome business has strengthened as automotive production and sales have picked up. This business rose by more than 20% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. And when you compare the fourth quarter to the second quarter, our Auto Chrome business nearly doubled. We look for a continued strong demand in 2010.On the electrical steel front, the fourth quarter of 2009 continued the recent trend of weaker demand from both NAFTA and export customers. As we look ahead to the year 2010, we expect a slow but steady recovery in demand for electrical steels. In light of the depressed NAFTA and export market conditions, not surprisingly, our electrical steel contract selling prices have declined. However, we expect that an increase in our 2010 sales volumes of this product, coupled with a richer product mix, will more than offset the lower selling prices. We believe that the gradually-recovering economy here at home, as well as the recovering economies abroad, will spur increases in consumption of electrical steel, and we will continue to be advantaged by our products and our approach. In other words, we're well positioned to serve the high end of the electrical steel market, and we believe that our approach to customer service and the overall strength of our relationships will result in increased market share for AK Steel going forward.The U.S. and the world will continue to have a growing need for new and more efficient electrical power. That is a need that AK Steel is perfectly suited to fill.As most of you know, AK Steel is one of the largest suppliers in the world of manufacturers of power generation and distribution transformers. In the United States beginning this month, federal law now mandates higher energy efficiency standards for distribution transformers. Our electrical steels will be used to help transformer manufacturers meet those higher standards for both replacement technology and to modernize our nation's electricity grid.With the weak U.S dollar, we'll also continue to capitalize on export opportunities where possible. However, with respect to sales of electrical steel in China, our ability to capitalize on export opportunities has been hampered by a recent decision by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. This organization which is known as MOFCOM, ruled preliminarily to impose duties of about 22% on our electrical steel imported into China.We're very disappointed by that decision, but we're cooperating with the MOFCOM officials in this ongoing trade proceeding. We'll continue to try to impress upon them that their preliminary findings lack any factual or legal basis. We anticipate a final determination by the Chinese Ministry with respect to the duties some time this spring. If they continue to impose duties on our electrical steel products, we would expect to file an appeal to the WTO, vigorously challenging the imposition of those duties.As we enter the new year and the new decade, we are ready for the recovery at AK Steel. Accordingly in 2010, we'll remain focused on our core values. We'll execute with world-class precision. We'll aggressively control those costs that we can, as we strive to deliver shareholder value and work to achieve year-long continuous improvement in every way. Not only are we ready for the recovery but we are experiencing the early stages of a recovery and positioning the company to compete and to win in the global steel marketplace as the recovery takes hold. Thanks to all of the progress that we've made over the past six years at AK Steel. We were well positioned to weather this severe economic storm, to capitalize on the chaos and to secure market opportunities that will serve us well in the days ahead. Our management team has a track record of overcoming adversity, and we did so once again during the great recession of 2008 and 2009. Now we position the company for economic recovery in 2010 and for a continued prosperity beyond that.Once again, thank you for being with us today. This concludes my prepared remarks and at this time, we'd be happy to take your questions."

The volume for 2009, of what's continuously under fire and probably came in roughly 30% or so down year-over-year, that is when we compared it to 2008, as we look to the question of volume for 2010, we expect at least a 30% increase in our volumes compared to 2009. So that's obviously, very, very good news in function of the quality of our product and the value of our relationships. On the pricing front, again as I mentioned, in light of global supply and demand conditions, right now we expect our pricing for this sub-product line in 2010 to be less, but less by something less than double digits, less than a 10% decline. We will benefit from a richer product mix, probably our richest mix ever in this product line, as customers that we have continue to seek the highest efficiency grades of electrical steels, so pricing will be down. Mix will be up. Volume will be up. And overall, it'll be a better year for us in terms of electrical steel."

But again, we're already booking out into March and April as we speak, so we won't be able to go back and recoup those higher costs at this point. I think prices for scrap, prices for iron ore have been going up if you believe the trade press, almost weekly.

A lot of our deals will expire in the first half and I think that will be very, very helpful. We still have a very significant place at the table that I want to emphasize for plants, manufacturers, for infrastructure and manufacturing participants and certainly, the service centers and distributors and all of our specialty steel customers.

That is paying dividends for us. We're able to get some business that we've been seeking, and I think that our volumes this year will reflect that. I don't know what others are doing. We make independent production and pricing decisions but I can tell you that our outlook is a positive one, because that's reflective of the orders and the pricing that we're getting.

Our blast furnaces are run pretty much full up. And we haven't if you will, juiced them up as much as we might. That's something that we're looking at doing if demand continues to strengthen. We're running at somewhat less than full capacity at Mansfield and also at Butler in terms of steelmaking. And finishing really, is dependent really on the products that are moving. But again, I think as an overall indicator, substantially up from where we were in the first part of last year, we like that for a number of reasons. As I've said, it helps our cost and it helps our people."

Welcome to AK Steel’s first quarter 2010 conference call and webcast. In a moment I’ll review our first quarter financial results as well as provide some guidance for the second quarter of 2010. Following",1010,"Thank you, Patty, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to AK Steel’s first quarter 2010 conference call and webcast. In a moment I’ll review our first quarter financial results as well as provide some guidance for the second quarter of 2010. Following my remarks Jim will offer his comments in view with your questions.
Today’s call includes certain forward-looking guidance. Other than our comments on historical results, the remarks we make today constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements include our expectations as to our future shipments, product mix, prices, costs, operating profit and liquidity.
While we believe that our expectations are reasonable, we cannot assure you that they will prove to have been correct since they are based on assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to risks. Such risks include economic competitive and operational risks, uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are beyond our control and based upon assumptions with respect to future business decisions that are subject to change.
Except as required by law of the company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect future developments or events. For more detailed information we encourage you to review the discussion of risks affecting forward-looking statements found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2009.
To the extent that we refer to material information that includes non-GAAP financial measures, the reconciliation information required by Regulation G is available on the Company’s Web site at aksteel.com.
Earlier today, AK Steel reported net income of $1.9 million for the first quarter of 2010. The results include a $25.3 million non-cash charge resulting from the recently enacted Federal Healthcare Legislation.
The charges due to a reduction in the value of AK Steel’s deferred tax assets as a result of the change to the tax treatment, Medicare Part D reimbursement that were established by Congress in 2003. The charges modestly lower than originally announced principally as a result of the two-year delay in the start day contained in the subsequent reconciliation bill.
Excluding this special charge AK Steel would have reported net income of $27.2 million or $0.25 per share. First quarter shipments totaled $1,386,000 tons, an increase of more than 600,000 tons compared to the first quarter a year ago and the third straight quarter improvement in our shipping levels.
Our average selling price was $1,014 per-ton which was a 5% increase over the prior quarter and consistent with our guidance. The average selling price was favorably impacted by improving market conditions, richer product mix and higher surcharges reflecting rising input cost.
Revenues were $1, 406 billion which was $484 million or more than 50% higher than our revenues in the first quarter of 2009. Sales outside the U.S. remains an important source of revenue for us totaling approximately $200 million for the quarter or about 14% of our total sales. However, due to strengthening of the dollar, our first quarter results were negatively impacted by a $4.9 million foreign exchange loss equals to $0.03 per share.
Turning to costs, we turned in a solid performance on those costs that were under our control. With respect to iron ore pellet prices, as noted in our 2009 Form 10-K which we filed on February the 23rd, in the absence of any final determination yet of the 2010 benchmark price, we have assumed a 30% increase for 2010.
Our results also include a LIFO charge of $8 million. By comparison we had of LIFO credit of $151 million in the prior quarter. This LIFO swing represents an approximate $159 million change in operating profit or $115 per-ton for the quarter.
Excluding the effects of LIFO, our operating results improved substantially in the first quarter of 2010 as compared with fourth quarter of 2009. In fact, despite increased costs we generated a first quarter operating profit of $57.6 million or $42 per-ton.
Turning to the balance sheet, our continuing focus on cash and liquidity has allowed us to maintain a strong financial position. We entered the first quarter with a solid cash balance of $330 million. Combined with the $700 million of availability under our revolving credit facility AK Steel’s total liquidity stood at more than $1 billion as of March 31st.
With regard to pension and debug funding, we contributed $75 million to our pension trust during the first quarter and speaking of pension contribution, AK Steel’s Board of Directors has authorized another pension contribution. This time in the amount of $35 million which would be paid during the second quarter of 2010. With this contribution, our 2010 pension funding requirement will be satisfied.
Also during the first quarter we contributed $65 million to the Middletown VEBA. We now have only one $65 million contribution remaining on this obligation.
Now, let me provide some guidance for the second quarter of 2010. We expect shipments to be approximately 1,450,000 million tons or nearly 5% higher than in the first quarter. We expect our average selling price to increase by approximately 5% to 6% quarter-over-quarter, as we benefit from the realization of announced spot market price increases, our contract selling prices and increase surcharges.
We expect our maintenance outage costs to increase by approximately $15 million compared to the previous quarter, primarily due to a planned outage at our Middletown hot strip mill. Because iron ore pricing for 2010 has not yet been determined. We are unable at this time to reliably estimate our quarterly operating results for the second quarter of 2010. There remains substantial uncertainty with respect to global iron ore pricing for 2010.
If there is an increase in the price of iron ore beyond a 30% we have assumed with respect to our first quarter results it will have a negative impact on our second quarter financial performance as we true up our year-to-date iron ore costs. When there is further clarity with respect to our iron ore cost for 2010 we will update our guidance.
Now, for his comments, here is Jim Wainscott.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for being a part of today’s conference call. After during a severe economic downturn for the past 18 months I am delighted to report to you that AK Steel is on the road to economic recovery.",2440,"Thank you very much, Al. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for being a part of today’s conference call. After during a severe economic downturn for the past 18 months I am delighted to report to you that AK Steel is on the road to economic recovery. Thankfully, we appeared to be looking at the great recession in the rear view mirror.
That said similar to the road conditions that we are driving on here at the Midwest after a tough winter, our road to recovery is expected to contain some potholes. Despite some bumps along the way, AK Steel achieved a series of above expectation performances in our first quarter of 2010.
In each instance, our shipments, average selling price, cost reductions and operating profitability were better than we previously anticipated. And at the bottom-line excluding the special charge that Al spoke over relating to the recent healthcare legislation, our first quarter of 2010 results showed an earnings improvement of $100 million compared to the year ago first quarter. That is a great way to start our recovery.
Let me offer a few comments on the things that are contributing to our improved results. Overall, demand for our products is higher, especially from our automotive and service at our customers. In fact, demand from customers in these markets has been stronger than we had expected. All the electrical steel market has been a bit more challenging than we had planned.
For carbon steel orders our lead times have been extended and are currently early June or hot rolled products in, mid to late June for cold rolled and coated products. Lead times for stainless steel orders range from mid June for standard rates and sizes to July for specialty sheet and strip.
North American light vehicle production has been steadily increasing and we experienced strong pour rates from auto makers in Q1. Analysts now predict U.S. light vehicle sales of about 12 million units for 2010, up from about 10 million units for 2009. Automotive inventories are at pretty good shape and so that 53 days of sales as of March 31, the comparable figure was 67 days in February, and it stood at 82 days at the end of March of 2009.
Speaking of sales and inventory levels another positive sign is that level of activity at carbon and stainless steel service centers. Just yesterday, the Metals Service Center Institute reported that carbon flat rolled steel service center inventories stood at 2.1 month of supply on hand at the end of March. This compares to an historical average of about 2.4 month of supply on hand.
Daily service center shipments for March rose by 4% over February and by 32% when compared to March a year ago. At the end of March this year, stainless steel inventories at service center stood at about 2.5 months of supply on hand and historically that figure has been about 3.8 months. Daily shipments for March showed a 7% improvement over February and they were up 21% from March of 2009 for stainless steel.
Turning to electrical steels our electrical steel customers have faced a slower than expected recovery in the housing and construction markets as well as lower than anticipated capital and maintenance spending by utility companies due to reduced electricity consumption. As a result, for the first quarter, steel purchases by electrical steel customers fell short of earlier expectations.
Coming into the year most analysts forecasted that housing starts would approximate an annual rate of about 900,000 units for 2010, but in a span of just three months those same analysts have reduced their full year estimates to less than 700,000 units currently.
Consistent with these updated forecasts AK Steel experienced lower grain oriented electrical steel shipments than we had anticipated for the first quarter. That said, compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, our first quarter of 2010 electrical steel shipments grew by nearly 8%.
One of the many economists that we follow as a particular individual has a pretty good track record for these things noted “A positive and promising trend in housing starts.” in his March report. Importantly, trend data suggests that we pass the bottom of the cycle.
With the electrical steel market having stabilized we expect our second quarter electrical steel shipments to remain at level roughly comparable to that of the first quarter with demand picking up in the second half of 2010 and beyond.
Let me now offer a few thoughts on another one of those potholes that I referenced at the start of my remarks. In the first quarter, experienced substantially higher steel making input costs, in particular, for carbon scrap and nickel. For example, scrap prices which have risen by about 17% since November increased by more than $100 per ton in the first quarter. In fact, scrap costs are now actually higher than pre-recession 2008 levels.
Regarding iron ore pellets as we said at the outlook section of our earnings release our data’s in fact remain substantial uncertainty with respect to the cost of those pellets for 2010. We continue to expect and we have accounted for a substantial increase. 30% to be exact in the price of iron ore pellets. And to be clear an increase in pellet costs beyond that level for the year 2010 would negatively impact our second quarter results.
As the global economy recovers, the cost of just about every one of our steel making inputs is on the rise, including coal and coke, taking advantage of the bottom of the market, AK Steel secured its 2010 coal needs early in 2009 that is. So our costs for this commodity are largely fixed. It is possible however, that impacts of a recent mine closing could result in the need to purchase higher price coal on the spot market.
In terms of coke, delighted to report that SunCoke Middletown has proceeded its New Source review permit as a result although appeals have been filed, construction of the SunCoke Middletown plant is finally underway. Completion of that faculty, which is expected in mid 2011, cannot happen soon enough. The price and availability of blast furnace coke continue to be of significant long-term concern to us.
Of a long-term strategy standpoint we continue to look for opportunities to improve our vertical integration, enhance our self-sufficiency and reduce our costs. And as business conditions continue to improve in 2010 and it appears that as though we will need all of the raw material inputs we can get. With increased orders our coke batteries and blast furnaces are currently operating at nearly full capacity.
In response to increased demand and higher steel making input costs, AK Steel has announced the total of four spot market price increases for carbon steel products since the beginning of 2010. Stainless steel transaction prices are also on the rise. We have announced one price increase and we have succeeded in passing through the costs increases that we have experienced for nickel and other alloys. For example, our stainless steel surcharge on Type III or IV products has increased by $411 a ton between January and April. And for May, our shipments then will continue surcharge that will grow by an additional $380 per-ton.
Increased order intake rates mean higher operating rates the steel production is still finishing. And that translates into more work for our employees. In the depths of the great recession a year ago, our layoffs peaked at more than 1200 employees. As of yesterday, only 12 employees remained on layoff status. Only 12, that’s great progress.
Despite the challenging times we remain trued to our company’s core values of safety, quality and productivity. Take care of your people and your customers and results will follow. The recent years this approach has been responsible for much of our success.
On the safety front, AK Steel’s Ashland works Coke Plant received a Max Eward Safety Award for its outstanding safety performance in 2009. I congratulate each and every employee at our Ashland Coke Plant for working the entire year without a single OSHA recordable injury. This marks the fifth year in a row at the Ashland Coke plant has earned us prestigious award and it’s the 12th time in the past 13 years that an AK Steel coke making facility has been honored in this fashion.
Staying on subject of safety for a moment both of our AK Tube plants were recently honored for their safety performances by the Fabricators & Manufacturers Association for 2009 our Walbridge, Ohio and our Columbus, Indiana plant. Each received the FMA Safety Award of Merit for 2009 and we congratulate those employees on a job well done.
Turning to quality during the first quarter, our internal measures, quality, for example, internal rejections and retreated products some of the benefit underwent. Externally, we experienced the lowest level of customer claims in our company’s history.
And according to the Jacobson & Associates independent survey of our carbon stainless and electrical steel customers for the initial quarter of this year AK Steel was ranked No. 1 in Quality, Customer Service and On-Time Delivery as well as Inside and Outside Sales Support. These performances translated into a number one rating in overall customer satisfaction. Attaining this lofty ranking took a tremendous team effort throughout the entire company. Thanks to all of our employees for that achievement. I salute you.
In my opinion, one of the shortcomings of income statements and balance sheets is that they fail to recognize the value of customer relationships. When customers are pleased with your performance one thing is certain. They will buy more. Even though customer satisfaction is one of the most important pieces of data regarding a company it’s simply does not show up in any financial statement. Nonetheless, our recent performance and service to our customers gives me great confidence in the future of AK Steel.
Couple of weeks ago AK Steel celebrated its 15th anniversary of trading at the New York Stock Exchange. As the company has grown into a globally competitive steel maker this represented yet another milestone for us.
When one considers the tough time faced by this steel industry and the challenges faced by our company over the past decade and a half it’s a great tribute to the dedication and the resiliency of the employee of AK Steel who have repeatedly overcome adversity. And because of that AK Steel is well positioned to compete and win in the global steel marketplace, especially if there is a level playing field.
And with that in mind, let me offer just a few thoughts about the importance of pro-manufacturing government policy-making in America. Having just survived one of the most severe recessions in the history of the United States, if not the great recession itself.
It’s my sincere hope that our policy makers encourage the maintenance of existing and the creation of new jobs. Because without job creation sustaining an economic recovery will be incredibly difficult. It is truly about jobs. Real economic recovery depends upon consumers. Cash, credit and confidence. And without jobs, without employment, you don’t get any of those things.
In large measure, AK Steel’s business relies on consumers purchasing durable goods. Automobiles and appliances, for example. When a person does not have a job it’s tough enough to provide for one family, a little known, bike, car and appliance. Last month, as you know, the U.S. government enacted sweeping health care legislation. We took a charge for that. We deem the impact that will be material for AK Steel and because of that we were transparent, timely and communicated this information to all of you at the financial community.
Frankly, AK Steel is proud to be among a select few steel companies that preserve the pension and healthcare benefits of its retiring. We will continue to do everything we can to meet our legacy obligations in the future, but at a time when our global competitiveness is at stake we see our healthcare costs going up or down.
We are even more concerned about the potential impact of comprehensive energy and climate change legislation and maybe introduce as soon as next week in the senate. As a nation it’s very important that we get this legislation right. The fact of the matter is that acting as a single nation we can do a little to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.
Setting aside the scientific debate for the time being if one believes that there is a global warming problem then by definition has to be a global solution to this problem. Acting alone in the U.S. will not solve anything. It will only serve to further outsource U.S. manufacturing jobs and dramatically increase global greenhouse gas emissions. No one wins when there are a fewer American jobs and more global emissions.
AK Steel and the steel industry are well positioned and ready to be part of the solution. Since 1990 AK Steel and other domestic steel makers have reduced energy consumption by about 33% and the steel industry has voluntarily exceeded the Kyoto protocol targets for greenhouse gas emissions.
As many of you know AK Steel were providing innovative products and solutions to enhance energy (inaudible). For example, we make specialty steels that enhance the efficiency of power generation, distribution in our country and around the world. And we are making lighter, high strength steels for vehicles that improve their fuel economy and credit worthiness. Decision virtually all forms of alternative, renewable and advanced energy sources will rely on one or more AK Steel’s product line.
Finally, we are considering future projects that would make use of waste, heat and gas generate more than 150 megawatts of electricity at just one of our mills. Well, I could go on but I think you get the idea. At AK Steel we support public policies that recognize the significant energy and environmental advancements already achieved by U.S. steel makers and policies that treat steel companies around the world in an affordable manner.
Ladies and gentlemen, in order to have a stronger economy for more and better jobs and for a better environment we need to make things in America. Let’s get behind American manufacturing and support a pro-manufacturing legislative agenda and let’s do so while we still can.
Before taking your questions let me simply say that at AK Steel we are ready for the economic recovery in 2010. And we are doing everything we can to position ourselves for continued success in the future. Thank you all very much. With that we would be happy to take your questions.

It’s not unusual for volatility to have been in our raw materials we have experienced fluctuating raw materials in a big way over the last decade or so, so we’re used to that. Obviously, there is a lot of push back out there and so, no one has yet agreed that we know of any particular benchmark.
We use a variety of get outsource our iron ore from a variety of producers around the globe and get at this point we heard rumors that price increases we’ve also heard some discussion about quarterly pricing, but candidly, since there have been no benchmark set, we have no piece of paper in front of us that says with from many of our iron ore producers what our increases will be, know what the pricing reset mechanism will be whether it’s annually or quarterly, again, it’s difficult to give guidance.
I just offer a couple of thoughts there. It’s obviously a concern expressed and we’re just raising the flag, but and also remind all of our listeners today that in 2008, we experienced an 87% or 88% increase in cost of our iron ore pellets. That was the best year in a history of AK Steel. In 2009, we experienced the decline of about 40% to 45% and that was one of our toughest years. So we plan to manage through this. There is just this degree of uncertainty and part of the issue is with most of our steel having been sold already for the second quarter, again, you can get into a bit of a mismatch situation, Beyond that there is the LIFO true-up, and I will turn that over to Al.

In other words, that we would expect a negative impact in the second quarter due to two factors. The first of which is cost of goods sold. Then we had the increased price pellets would come in. It would adversely affect our cost of goods sold not only for those pellets, received in a second quarter, but also that those we would have to true-up from the first quarter that we’ve received, we received about 15% of our annual pellets in the first quarter. The other effect would be a LIFO effect. We’ve assumed a 30% increase that would go into our LIFO calculation at the end of the year if that was higher we would have to essentially true-up our LIFO in the second quarter for the full year and you most certainly would see an increase LIFO charge in the second quarter. So it will be two-fold effect.

Today, we offer no fixed price contracts. All of our deals that we have and it vary by customer as to the nature of the items that vary are contain some pass through mechanism or some CRU reset or some combination thereof. Again, those reset at various times some more frequently than others I don’t know that it’s a game changer per se, but there would be a period in which we would have to adapt in others, might have to adapt to this new pricing mechanism.
What we would not want to happen of course is to have some sort of mismatch. That could go either way. In a declining raw materials environment we might be benefiting but we would be more concerned about a rising raw material environment. But we think we’ve done a number of things in negotiating agreements this year and in recent years to help cover a number of those costs. To the issue of trying to fix our price for iron ore in order to ensure availability we’re not really concerned, we don’t anticipate a problem in terms of pinning the iron ore we need to operate, obviously, if we had the opportunity and we continually keep our eyes open for this, we prefer to be somewhat more vertically integrated with respect to ore and some of our other raw materials than we are today that’s something that we remain very focused on.

If you look at that in conjunction with the LIFO change, which is as we mentioned about a $115 that comes to about a $130 of negatives, but offsetting that large measure, we had stronger selling prices about $50 per ton, we had better operating performance about $50, another $50 and another $8 in maintenance beneficial. Again, taking that forward to Jim’s point earlier we had about better than a $90 per ton improvement quarter-over-quarter excluding LIFO, which again, we’re very, very proud of.

The NAFTA markets really depend on a couple of things as we’ve talked about. Housing is one of those because you need transformers, obviously, produce subdivisions and that came pretty much to a grinding halt here in the last couple of years, similarly, and commercial construction has been on its back and really remains there. The replacement transformer business is still okay.
And then the other aspect of course is capital spending and maintenance spending by the utility companies, which has obviously been down as less electricity is spent consumed in America. So America has had its challenges, we have outstanding relationships with all of our customers here, we would expect to take our lead from them as we always do and it's their opinion that we reach sort of the bottom things have leveled out, we’re coming off of that and we should particularly see a bit of a benefit here in the second half. With respect to outside of the country that’s mostly spot business. We have continued to do everything we can to be opportunistic there, not only to serve our customers well, but also advantage ourselves relative to what has been weak U.S. dollar.
One of the things, the other comment I would just offer as a footnote to the NAFTA market is for the first time, in many years, we have seen the reappearance of the Japanese, and the Germans in terms of product so, we’re competing once again with the foreigners on our turf, and I would just say that we’re watching that very, very carefully to ensure that dumping is not occurring.

And I thought we did a very nice job of that I do say so myself in the Q1 I mentioned in my prepared remarks that was our best quarter internally and externally we ever had from a quality standpoint. So that goes a long way towards improving our cost as does productivity. Our productivity but for some of the maintenance outages that we talked about, in particular, the hot strip mill outage at Middletown, should be outstanding, should be ramping up continually in the Q2, and then we will assess the second half, but those are the two key drivers really are virtually anybody’s business offset to some extent again by what is likely would be a rising input cost environment.

So I don’t know if there is any one market that’s stronger than the other. We’re seeing good demand and solid pricing in each of those.
As I reflect back just over the last year, our automotive business is double. Our service center business is double. And we are delighted about that obviously and the carbon steel business, which was down dramatically. I think at one point last year we were probably producing at 40% of our capacity and now we’re 90 plus. Those are all positive things. So it's not any one individual market, it's really all the markets and again, bringing up the real and we expect it will contribute handsomely in the future as our old friend electrical steel.

We’ve evaluated that, we’ve actually made six price increases that took effect, if you will, recently, two were announced late last year and four this quarter as I mentioned, in the carbon arena, one in stainless. We will continue to look hard at that, we will make an independent judgment if and when we know what the final iron ore scrap and other steel making input costs are. Don’t know really that the market fully comprehends any level of iron ore cost increase wouldn’t try and guesstimate what that is at this point, but if iron ore is up substantially more than what we have guided I think it's fair to say that we will have to recover those costs.
Look, at the end of the day I have always said to our sales force and I will just mention here. It does us no good as a company, rated as highly as we are for quality service and delivery and the relationships that we have, to not establish a price that allows us to recover our costs, reinvest in our business and be there to serve our customers long-term. That’s why we’re here, for that’s we’re trying to do.

Welcome to AK Steel's First Quarter 2010 Conference Call and Webcast. In a moment, I will review our first quarter financial results, as well as provide some guidance for the second quarter of 2010.  Following",1009,"Thank you, Patty, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to AK Steel's First Quarter 2010 Conference Call and Webcast. In a moment, I will review our first quarter financial results, as well as provide some guidance for the second quarter of 2010.  Following my remarks, Jim will offer his comments and field your questions. 
Today's call includes certain forward-looking guidance. Other than our comments on historical results, the remarks we make today constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements include our expectations as to our future shipments, product mix, prices, costs, operating profit and liquidity. While we believe that our expectations are reasonable, we cannot assure you they will prove to have been correct since they are based on assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to risks. Such risks include economic, competitive and operational risks, uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are beyond our control and based upon assumptions with respect to future business decisions that are subject to change.
Except as required by law, the company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect future developments or events. For more detailed information, we encourage you to review the discussion of risks affecting forward-looking statements found in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. To the extent that we refer to material information that includes non-GAAP financial measures, the reconciliation information required by Regulation G is available on the company's website at aksteel.com.
Earlier today, AK Steel reported net income of $1.9 million for the first quarter of 2010. The results include a $25.3 million non-cash charge resulting from the recently enacted federal healthcare reform legislation. The charge is due to a reduction in the value of AK Steel's deferred tax asset as a result of the change to the tax treatment of Medicare Part D reimbursements that were established by Congress in 2003. The charge is modestly lower than originally announced principally as a result of the two-year delay in the start date contained in the subsequent reconciliation bill.  Excluding this special charge, AK Steel would have reported net income of $27.2 million or $0.25 per share. 
First quarter shipments totaled 1,386,000 tons, an increase of more than 600,000 tons compared to the first quarter a year ago and the third straight quarterly improvement in our shipping levels. Our average selling price was $1,014 per ton, which was a 5% increase over the prior quarter and consistent with our guidance. The average selling price was favorably impacted by improving market conditions, a richer product mix and higher surcharges reflecting rising input costs. Revenues were $1,406,000,000  which was $484 million or more than 50% higher than our revenues in the first quarter of 2009.
Sales outside the U.S. remained an important source of revenue for us, totaling approximately $200 million for the quarter or about 14% of our total sales. However, due to strengthening of the dollar, our first quarter results were negatively impacted by a $4.9 million foreign exchange loss equal to $0.03 per share.
Turning to costs. We turned in a solid performance on those costs that were under our control. With respect to iron ore pellet prices, as noted in our 2009 Form 10-K which we filed on February 23, in the absence of any final determination yet of the 2010 benchmark price, we have assumed a 30% increase for 2010. Our results also include a LIFO charge of $8 million. By comparison, we had a LIFO credit of $151 million in the prior quarter. This LIFO swing represents an approximate $159 million change in operating profit or $115 per ton quarter-over-quarter. Excluding the effects of LIFO, our operating results improved substantially in the first quarter of 2010 as compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. In fact, despite increased costs, we generated a first quarter operating profit of $57.6 million or $42 per ton.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our continuing focus on cash and liquidity has allowed us to maintain a strong financial position. We ended the first quarter with a solid cash balance of $330 million. Combined with the $700 million of availability under our revolving credit facility, AK Steel's total liquidity stood at more than $1 billion as of March 31.
With regard to pension and VEBA funding, we contributed $75 million to our pension trust during the first quarter. And speaking of pension contributions, AK Steel's Board of Directors has authorized another pension contribution, this time in the amount of $35 million, which will be made during the second quarter of 2010. With this contribution, our 2010 pension funding requirements will be satisfied. Also during the first quarter, we contributed $65 million to the Middletown VEBA. We now have only $165 million contribution remaining on this obligation.
Now let me provide some guidance for the second quarter of 2010. We expect shipments to be approximately 1,450,000 tons or nearly 5% higher than in the first quarter. We expect our average selling price to increase by approximately 5% to 6% quarter-over-quarter, as we benefit from the realization of announced spot market price increases, higher contract selling prices and increased surcharges. We expect our maintenance outage costs to re-increase by approximately $15 million compared to the previous quarter, primarily due to a planned outage at our Middletown Hot Strip Mill. Because iron ore pricing for 2010 has not yet been determined, we are unable at this time to reliably estimate our quarterly operating results for the second quarter of 2010.
There remains substantial uncertainty with respect to global iron ore pricing for 2010. If there is an increase in the price of iron ore beyond the 30% we have assumed with respect to our first quarter results, it will have a negative impact on our second quarter financial performance as we true up our year-to-date iron ore costs. When there is further clarity with respect to our iron ore costs for 2010, we will update our guidance.
Now for his comments, here's Jim Wainscott."

That said, similar to the road conditions that we're driving on here in the Midwest after a tough winter, our road to recovery is expected to contain some potholes. But despite some bumps along the way, AK Steel achieved a series of above-expectation performances in our first quarter of 2010. And each instance, our shipments, average selling price, cost reductions and operating profitability were better than we've previously anticipated. And at the bottom line, excluding the special charge that Al spoke of relating to the recent healthcare legislation, our first quarter of 2010 results showed an earnings improvement of $100 million compared to the year-ago first quarter. That is a great way to start our recovery.
Let me offer a few comments on the things that are contributing to our improved results. Overall demand for our products is higher, especially from our automotive and service center customers. In fact, demand from customers in these markets has been stronger than we had expected. While the electrical steel market has been a bit more challenging than we had planned.
For carbon steel orders, our lead times have been extended and are currently early June for Hot Rolled products and mid- to late-June for Cold Rolled and Coated products. Lead times for stainless steel orders range from mid-June for standard rates and sizes to July for specialty sheet and strip. North American light vehicle production has been steadily increasing, and we experienced strong pour rates from automakers in Q1. Analysts now predict U.S. light vehicle sales of about 12 million units for 2010, up from about 10 million units for 2009. Automotive inventories are in pretty good shape and stood at 53 days of sales as of March 31. The comparable figure was 67 days in February, and it stood at 82 days at the end of March of 2009.
Speaking of sales and inventory levels, another positive sign is the level of activity at carbon and stainless steel service centers. Just yesterday, the Metals Service Center Institute reported that carbon flat-rolled steel service center inventories stood at 2.1 months of supply on hand at the end of March. This compares to an historical average of about 2.4 months of supply on hand. Daily service center shipments for March rose by 4% over February and by 32% when compared to March a year ago.
At the end of March this year, stainless steel inventories at service centers stood at about 2.5 months of supply on hand, and historically, that figure has been about 3.8 months. Daily shipments for March showed a 7% improvement over February, and they were up 21% for March of 2009 for stainless.
Turning to electrical steels, our electrical steel customers have faced a slower-than-expected recovery in the housing and construction markets, as well as lower-than-anticipated capital and maintenance spending by utility companies due to reduced electricity consumption. As a result, for the first quarter, steel purchases by electrical steel customers fell short of earlier expectations. Coming into the year, most analysts forecasted that housing starts would approximate an annual rate of about 900,000 units for 2010. But in a span of just three months, those same analysts have reduced their full year estimates to less than 700,000 units currently. Consistent with these updated forecasts, AK Steel experienced lower grain-oriented electrical steel shipments than we had anticipated for the first quarter. That said, compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, our first quarter of 2010 electrical steel shipments grew by nearly 8%.
One of the many economists that we follow, this particular individual has a pretty good track record for these things noted, ""a positive and promising trend in housing starts"" in his March report. Importantly, his trend data suggest that we've passed the bottom of the cycle. With the electrical steel market having stabilized, we expect our second quarter electrical steel shipments to remain at a level roughly comparable to that of the first quarter, with demand picking up in the second half of 2010 and beyond.
Let me now offer a few thoughts of another one of those potholes that I referenced at the start of my remarks. In the first quarter, we experienced substantially higher steelmaking input costs. In particular, for carbon scrap and nickel. For example, scrap prices, which have risen by about 70% since November, increased by more than $100 per ton in the first quarter. In fact, scrap costs are now actually higher than pre-recession 2008 levels. Regarding iron ore pellets, as we said in the outlook section of our earnings release, there does in fact remains substantial uncertainty with respect to the costs of those pellets for 2010. We continue to expect and we've accounted for a substantial increase, 30% to be exact, in the price of iron ore pellets. And to be clear, an increase in pellet costs beyond that level for the year 2010 would negatively impact our second quarter results.
As the global economy recovers, the cost of just about every one of our steelmaking inputs is on the rise, including coal and coke. Taking advantage of the bottom of the market, AK Steel secured its 2010 coal needs early in 2009, that is, so our costs for this commodity are largely fixed. It's possible, however, that impacts of a recent mind closing could result in the need to purchase higher-priced coal on the spot market. 
In terms of coke, I'm delighted to report that SunCoke Middletown has received its New Source Review permit. And as a result, although appeals have been filed, construction of the SunCoke Middletown plant is finally underway.  Completion of that facility, which is expected in mid-2011, cannot happen soon enough, as the price and availability of blast furnace coke continue to be a significant long-term concern to us. 
From a long-term strategy standpoint, we continue to look for opportunities to improve our vertical integration, enhance our self-sufficiency and reduce our costs. And as business conditions continue to improve in 2010, it appears as though we will need all of the raw material inputs we can get. With increased orders, our coke batteries and blast furnaces are currently operating at nearly full capacity.
In response to increased demand and higher steelmaking input costs, AK Steel has announced the total of four spot market price increases for carbon steel products since the beginning of 2010. Stainless steel transaction prices are also on the rise. We've announced one price increase, and we've succeeded in passing through the cost increases that we've experienced for nickel and other alloys. For example, our stainless steel surcharge on Type 304 product has increased by $411 a ton between January and April. And for May, our shipments then will contain a surcharge that will grow by an additional $380 per ton. Increased order intake rates mean higher operating rates in steel production and steel finishing. And that translates into more work for our employees. 
In the depths of the Great Recession a year ago, our layoffs peaked at more than 1,200 employees. As of yesterday, only 12 employees remained on layoff status. Only 12. That's great progress. Despite the challenging times, we have remained true to our company's core values of safety, quality and productivity. Take care of your people and your customers, and results will follow. In recent years, this approach has been responsible for much of our success. 
On the safety front, AK Steel's Ashland Works coke plant received the Max Eward Safety Award for its outstanding safety performance in 2009. I congratulate each and every employee on our Ashland coke plant for working the entire year without a single OSHA recordable injury. This marks the fifth year in a row that the Ashland coke plant has earned this prestigious award, and it's the 12th time in the past 13 years that an AK Steel cokemaking facility has been honored in this fashion.
Staying on the subject of safety for a moment, both of our AK Tube plants were recently honored for their safety performances by the Fabricators & Manufacturers Association for 2009. Our Walbridge, Ohio and our Columbus, Indiana plants each received the FMA's Safety Award of Merit for 2009. Again, we congratulate those employees on a job well done.
Turning to quality, during the first quarter, our internal measures for quality, for example, internal rejections and retreated products, were some of the best they've ever met. Externally, we experienced the lowest level of customer claims in our company's history. And according to the Jacobson and Associates independent survey of our carbon stainless and electrical steel customers for the initial quarter of this year, AK Steel was ranked number one in quality, customer service and on-time delivery, as well as inside and outside sales support.
These performances translated into a number one rating in overall customer satisfaction. Attaining this lofty ranking took a tremendous team effort throughout the entire company, and thanks to all of our employees for that achievement. I salute you. 
In my opinion, one of the shortcomings of income statements and balance sheets is that they fail to recognize the value of customer relationships. When customers are pleased with your performance, one thing is certain. They will buy more. And even though customer satisfaction is one of the most important pieces of data regarding a company, it simply doesn't show up in any financial statement. Nonetheless, our recent performance and service to our customers gives me great confidence in the future of AK Steel.
A couple of weeks ago, AK Steel celebrated its 15th anniversary of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. As the company has grown into a globally competitive steelmaker, this represented yet another milestone for us. When one considers the tough times faced by the steel industry and the challenges faced by our company over the past decade and a half, it's a great tribute to the dedication and the resiliency of the employees of AK Steel who have repeatedly overcome adversity. And because of that, AK Steel is well positioned to compete and to win in the global steel market place, especially if there is a level playing field. And with that in mind, let me offer just a few thoughts about the importance of pro-manufacturing government policymaking in America.
Having just survived one of the most severe recessions in the history of the United States, if not the Great Recession itself. It's my sincere hope that our policy-makers encourage the maintenance of existing and the creation of new jobs. Because without job creation, sustaining an economic recovery will be incredibly difficult. It is truly about jobs. Real economic recovery depends upon consumers with cash, credit and confidence. And without jobs, without employment, we don't get any of those things.
In large measure, AK Steel's business relies on consumers purchasing durable goods, automobiles and appliances, for example. And when a person does not have a job, it's tough enough to provide for one's family, let alone buy a car and appliances. Last month, as you know, the U.S. government enacted sweeping healthcare legislation. We took a charge for that. We deem the impact to be a material for AK Steel. And because of that, we were transparent and timely in communicating this information to all of you in the financial community.
Frankly, AK Steel is proud to be among a select few steel companies that preserve the pension and healthcare benefits of its retirees. We will continue to do everything we can to meet our legacy obligations in the future. But at the time when our global competitiveness is at stake, we see our healthcare costs going up, not down.
We're even more concerned about the potential impact of comprehensive energy and climate change legislation that may be introduced as soon as next week in the Senate. As a nation, it's very important that we get this legislation right. Fact to the matter is that acting as a single nation, we can do little to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. 
Setting aside the scientific debate for the time being, if one believes that there is a global warming problem, then by definition, there has to be a global solution to this problem. Acting alone in the U.S. will not solve anything. It will only serve to further outsource U.S. manufacturing jobs and dramatically increase global greenhouse gas emissions. No one wins when there are fewer American jobs and more global emissions. 
AK Steel and the steel industry are well positioned and ready to be part of the solutions. Since 1990, AK Steel and other domestic steel makers have reduced energy consumption by about 33%, and the steel industry has voluntarily exceeded the Kyoto Protocol targets for greenhouse gas emissions. As many of you know, at AK Steel, we're providing innovative products and solutions to enhance energy [indiscernible] (34:40). For example, we make specialty steels that enhance the efficiency of power generation and distribution in our country and around the world. And we're making lighter high-strength steels for vehicles that improve their fuel economy and crashworthiness. Positioned virtually all forms of alternative, renewable and advanced energy sources, we'll rely on one or more of AK Steel's product lines. Finally, we are considering future projects that would make use of waste, heat and gas to generate more than 150 megawatts of electricity at just one of our mills. 
Well, I could go on, but I think you get the idea. At AK Steel, we support public policies that recognize the significant energy and environmental advancements already achieved by U.S. the steelmakers and policies that treat steel companies around the world in an equitable manner.
Ladies and gentlemen, in order to have a stronger economy for more and better jobs and for a better environment, we need to make things in America. Let's get behind American manufacturing and support a pro-manufacturing legislative agenda, and let's do so while we still can. Before taking your questions, let me simply say that at AK Steel, we are ready for the economic recovery in 2010, and we're doing everything we can to position ourselves for continued success in the future.
Thank you all very much. And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

It's not unusual for volatility to happen in our raw materials. We've experienced fluctuating raw materials in a big way over the last decade or so, so we're used to that. Obviously, there's a lot of pushback out there and so no one has yet agreed that we know of to any particular benchmark. We use a variety of and get outsource our iron ore from a variety of producers around the globe. And again, at this point, we've heard rumors as to price increases. We've also heard some discussion about quarterly pricing. But candidly, since there had been no benchmark set, we have no piece of paper in front of us that says, for many of our iron ore producers, what our increases will be, nor what the pricing reset mechanism will be, whether it's annually or quarterly. Again, it's difficult to give guidance. I'd just offer a couple of thoughts there. It's obviously a concern expressed and we're just raising the flag. But I'd also remind all of our listeners today that in 2008, we experienced an 87% or 88% increase in the costs of our iron ore pellets. That was the best year in the history of AK Steel. In 2009, we experienced the decline of about 40% to 45%, and that was one of our toughest years. So we plan to manage through this. There is just this degree of uncertainty. And part of the issue is with most of our steel having been sold already for the second quarter, again, you could get into a bit of a mismatch situation. Beyond that, there is the LIFO true up, and I'll turn that over to Al."

The impact is a difference quarter-over-quarter, in other words, that we would expect a negative impact in the second quarter due to two factors.

And not only for those pellets received in the second quarter, but also those we would have to true up from the first quarter that we received. We received about 15% of our annual pellets in the first quarter. The other effect would be a LIFO effect. We've assumed a 30% increase that would go into our LIFO calculation at the end of the year. If that was higher, we would have to redo the -- essentially true up our LIFO in the second quarter for the full year. And you most certainly would see an increased LIFO charge in the second quarter.

That number probably is more currently about 60-40, international. Notwithstanding some of the challenges of not dealing in China, recently. But NAFTA markets really depend on a couple things, as we've talked about. Housing is one of those, because you need transformers obviously for new subdivisions. And that came pretty much to a grinding halt here in the last couple of years. Similarly, commercial construction has been on it's back and really remains there. The Replacement Transformer business is still okay. And then the other aspect of course is capital spending and maintenance spending by the utility companies, which is obviously has been down as less electricity is spend and consumed in America. So America had its challenges, we have outstanding relationships with all of our customers here, we would expect to take our lead from them as we always do. And it's their opinion that we bridge sort of a bottom things that leveled out. We're coming off of that and we should particularly see a bit of a benefit here in the second half. With respect to outside of the country, that's mostly Spot business. We have continued to do everything we can to be opportunistic there. Not only to serve our customers well, but also advantage ourselves relative to what has been a weak U.S. dollar. One other things, the other comment I would just to offer as footnote NAFTA market is for the first time in many years, we have seen the reappearance of the Japanese and the Germans in terms of product.

Today’s call includes certain forward-looking guidance. Other than our comments on historical results, remarks we make today constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements include our expectations as to our future shipments, product mix, prices, costs, operating profit and liquidity.
While we believe that our expectations are reasonable, we cannot assure you they will prove to have been correct since they are based on assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to risks. Such risks include economic, competitive and operational risks, uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are beyond our control and based upon assumptions with respect to future business decisions that are subject to change.
Except as required by law, the Company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect future developments or events. For a more detailed information, we encourage you to review the discussion of risks affecting forward-looking statements found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 as updated in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.
To the extent that we refer to material information that includes non-GAAP financial measures, the reconciliation information required by Regulation G is available on the Company’s Web site, at aksteeel.com.
Earlier today, AK Steel reported net income of $26.7 million or $0.24 per share for the second quarter of 2010. This result represents a substantial improvement from the same quarter a year ago when we were operating in the midst of the great recession.
Additionally, AK Steel’s strong performance in the second quarter of 2010 was achieved despite the impact of significantly increased cost for iron ore, which Jim and I will detail later in this conference call.
Shipments for the second quarter of 2010 totaled 1,449,400 tons, an increase of more than 700,000 tons compared to the second quarter of 2009. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of increased shipments and our highest quarterly level since the third quarter of 2008.
Our average selling price was $1,101 per ton, which was a 9% increase over the prior quarter. The average selling price was favorably impacted by improved market conditions and higher surcharges that reflected rising input costs. Revenues were $1,596 million, more than double our revenues for the second quarter a year ago.
Sales outside the U.S. remained an important source of revenue for us, totaling approximately $229 million for the quarter. However, due to the continued strengthening of the dollar, our second quarter results were negatively impacted by a $7 million foreign exchange loss equal to about $0.04 per share.
Looking at our cost, we turned in another solid performance on those costs that were within our control. That said let me comment on cost of two items that were not within our control. Namely, iron ore and coal.
First, with respect to iron ore; in the absence of a global benchmark price for 2010 iron ore purchases, we used and assumed 65% increase over the 2009 benchmark for our second quarter 2010 results.
For purposes of our first quarter 2010 financial results we had assumed a 30% increase from the 2009 benchmark price. As a result, our second quarter 2010 results include the impact of higher iron ore cost versus the first quarter of 2010.
In addition, we recognized as an expense in the second quarter the incremental amount of the assumed 65% benchmark increase that is attributable to our first quarter results. In short, iron ore pricing impacted our second quarter 2010 results in two ways.
First, related solely to the second quarter the 65% estimate for increased iron ore cost impacted our expenses by $32 million. Second, a true-up expense of approximately $18 million was recognized in the second quarter for a total increase of $50 million due to iron ore quarter-over-quarter.
Turning to metallurgical coal, let me comment on the impact of our coal supply and cost resulting from the closure of Massey Energy’s Upper Big Branch Mine in April. As noted in our first quarter Form 10-Q, we had expected about 25% of our coal supply in 2010 to be produced at the Upper Big Branch Mine.
I am pleased to report that we successfully obtained the necessary alternative sources of coal supply in the second quarter and we are confident of the adequate supply for the remainder of 2010.
The financial impact of purchasing coal from other sources was about $2 million during the second quarter. We expect our additional coal cost in the third and fourth quarters will be similar or below our second quarter costs.
Despite the increased cost of iron and coal we generated a second quarter operating profit of $65.6 million or $45 per ton. Included in our second quarter results was an iron ore true-up expense of approximately $18 million or $12 per ton.
Now, turning to the balance sheet, with short-term interest rates at anemic levels, we prudently put our cash to work in the second quarter. We issued $400 million of new 7.625% senior notes due in 2020. We used the proceeds from the new notes, plus cash-on-hand to redeem $504 million of 7.75% senior notes due in 2012.
As a result of this transaction we; one, reduced the interest rate on outstanding debt; two, extended maturity date by eight years; three, dramatically improved the covenant structure; and four, continued to strengthen our balance sheet by paying down more than $100 million of debt.
I am also pleased to point out that during the second quarter AK Steel’s debt was upgraded by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s raised its outlook for our Company.
With respect to pension funding, we contributed $35 million through our pension trust in the second quarter. This contribution, combined with the $75 million contribution made during the first quarter of 2010, fulfils our full year 2010 pension funding requirements.
In addition, we believe that we now have the flexibility to reduce our required funding for the years 2011 and 2012 to about $180 million per year or about $95 million per year less than we had previously anticipated. The new estimate is the result of an updated analysis by our independent actuary after federal pension relief legislation was signed into law on June 25.
While we now have some additional flexibility, let me emphasize that we remain committed to funding our pension trust as evidenced by the nearly $1.2 billion we’ve contributed since 2005.
We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $129 million, and except for outstanding letters of credit, our $850 million revolving credit facility remains undrawn.
Now let’s take a brief look at our results for the first six months of 2010. Revenues for the first half were $3 billion compared to revenues of $1.7 billion in the first half of 2009. Sales outside the U.S. totaled $427 million for the first six months compared to $371 million for the first six months of last year.
Shipments in the first six months of 2010 were 2.8 million tons, an improvement of more than 85% compared to our shipment level for the first six months of 2009. Our average selling price for the first half of 2010 was $1,059 per ton, which was approximately 6% lower for the first two quarters of last year.
At the bottom-line we had adjusted net income of $53.9 million for the first six months of 2010 or $0.49 per diluted share, and that compares to a net loss of $120.6 million or $1.10 per diluted share for the same period of 2009.
Let me now provide some guidance for the third quarter of 2010. We expect shipments to be approximately 3% higher than for the second quarter. We expect our average selling price to decrease by approximately 5% quarter-over-quarter primarily due to product mix with along lower spot market prices and surcharges. We expect our maintenance cost to decrease by approximately $4 million compared to the previous quarter.
There are a number of factors that impact operating profit. I would note that with regard to iron ore pricing we have assumed a continuation of the 65% increase in the benchmark price for the third quarter. That said we expect to generate an operating profit for the third quarter of approximately $15 per ton.
Finally, in order to provide more clarity regarding our outlook, let me offer an additional metric related to iron ore pricing. We estimate that a change of 5 percentage points in the actual iron ore benchmark price compared to our assumed price would impact our operating profit in the third quarter by roughly $11 million or $7 per ton.
Now, for his comments, here is Jim Wainscott. Jim?

Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us on today’s conference call.AK Steel’s second quarter of 2010 represented another quarter of very solid progress in this year of recovery for our Company. Indeed, by virtu",2640,"Thanks very much, Al. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us on today’s conference call.
AK Steel’s second quarter of 2010 represented another quarter of very solid progress in this year of recovery for our Company. Indeed, by virtually every measure, our recovery was underway in the first and second quarters of 2010.
For example, compared to the year ago second quarter, our 2Q of 2010 employment, production and shipments levels as well as our revenues and earnings are all substantially higher, and compared to the first quarter of this year, we made meaningful gains in every facet of our business. These gains are a credit to the men and women of AK Steel whose never quit attitude to move us and our Company forward.
As we entered the second quarter, there was a lot of uncertainty and perhaps some confusion regarding three items in particular; iron ore prices, coal availability and pricing and electrical steel sales volumes. I’d like to take just a couple of minutes to provide you with an update on each of these items.
As Al mentioned, although global benchmark prices have not yet been established for iron ore or iron ore pellets, which is what we buy at AK Steel, on an interim basis we are currently paying each of our three iron ore pellet suppliers based on an assumed 65% increase in the benchmark price for the year 2010. Since this is what we’re currently paying for iron ore pellets, our actual experience form the basis for our first half 2010 iron ore pellet cost assumption when the books were closed on June 30.
In addition, this assumption is pretty close to current spot market pricing conditions. Since late April, the spot market price for iron ore has been declining, and only in the last week or so has it begun to tick back up.
Since our first quarter results assumed an increase of 30% over the 2009 benchmark price, our reported second quarter 2010 results included the impact of higher iron ore pellet cost within this quarter, the second quarter, as well as the true-up impact of our first quarter iron ore costs.
To be clear, the first quarter true-up portion alone lowered our second quarter operating profit by some $18 million or $12 per ton and also lowered our second quarter net income by $0.10 per share. In other words, but for the effect of the first quarter, iron ore true-up would have reported net income of $0.34 per share for Q2.
We continue to have regular ongoing dialog with each of our iron ore suppliers, and of course, we’re monitoring daily developments around the world on this subject. In the meantime, we are receiving iron ore pellets that we need to operate each of our two blast furnaces.
Candidly, ladies and gentlemen, we have no way of knowing when or if global iron ore benchmark pricing will be established for 2010 nor do we know if the benchmark pricing will be for an annual or for a quarterly basis.
What we do know is this in light of diminished demand for iron ore in the past few months, spot market prices for iron ore have been steadily declining. In fact, since peaking in April, Platts Iron Ore Index has fallen by more than 30%. As a result, the current spot market price for iron ore is about 59% above the 2009 price.
If and when a benchmark price is established or if we reach final agreements on 2010 pricing with one or all of our suppliers, we’ll provide updated guidance and disclosure in that regard. During that quarter, whenever that may be, we’ll also be required to true-up our estimated costs to the actual cost for pellets that we’ve purchased to-date.
As with iron ore, we’re securing all of the necessary coal that we need to operate our coke batteries. To-date, the disruptive impact on our operations of the Massey coal situation has been minimal and we, frankly, expect it to remain so.
Following our first quarter conference call, some steel industry analysts had estimated that by having to replace the Massey coals with more expensive coals purchased in the spot market, AK Steel’s cost would soar by tens of millions of dollars. In reality, the impact is much less than that.
As Al detailed in his remarks, we currently estimate that the higher coal cost for AK Steel resulting from the Massey force majeure event will approximate $6 million or less for the entire year 2010.
Another item that seems to be of concern was the state of the electrical steel business. I’m happy to report that the electrical steel business is improving not by leaps and bounds, but our electrical steel shipment volumes have certainly been increasing in each of the past two quarters. Grain-oriented electrical steel shipments rose by 13% in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2010, and they were up by some 22% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009.
Granted our electrical steel shipments and pricing are still a long way from their 2008 levels, however, shipments have been improving as power generation and distribution activities have begun to pick up around the world and we are benefiting from that pickup in activity.
So, I hope these updates on iron ore, coal and electrical steel provide you with a sense of the progress that we’re making and dealing with each of these three challenges; challenges that we’d spoken about on our first quarter 2010 conference call, and again, each of which, I might, add were outside of our control.
In contrast, for those items that are within our control, such as our core values of safety, quality and productivity, our performances were pretty good in the second quarter. Let me take just a moment on each of these subjects to give you some idea of how good.
On the safety front, we tried our best ever first half of the year as measured by lost workday cases. During the first half of this year, we had only two accidents that resulted in lost workday cases for the entire company. In addition, staying with safety, I’m pleased to report that during Q2 safety honors were bestowed upon our Coshocton Works and our AK Tube plants in Walbridge, Ohio and in Columbus, Indiana.
Turning to quality, during the second quarter we established record performances for our internal quality measures, and externally we experienced the lowest level of customer claims in the history of the Company.
We appreciate the business we enjoy from all of our customers, and two of those customers chose to honor AK Steel during the second quarter with awards of merit. We received the Supplier of the Year award from Kenwal Steel and the Zero Defect Award from Rheem Manufacturing Company.
On a broader basis, AK Steel was rated number one in quality, customer service and on-time delivery, as well as both inside and outside sales support for the second quarter. Those were the findings of the Jacobson & Associates independent survey of our carbon, stainless and electrical steel customers. Taken together, our performances translated into a number one rating in overall customer satisfaction.
In terms of productivity, thanks to increased orders from our customers, we’ve been running at about double the level of productivity we were operating at a year ago.
Doubling our operating rates has enabled us to return to work 99% of our employees who had been laid off during the great recession. I might add that those employees, and all of our employees for that matter, are doing a great job for us in producing and finishing some of the finest flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steel products made anywhere in the world.
For example, during the second quarter at our Butler Works, we set a number of production records at the number three tandem mill. And during the second quarter at Middletown Works we established a new world record for casting sequence. So, having stayed true to our core values during the great recession, we remain true to those same values today.
With that let me take a moment to comment on what we’re seeing in terms of the economic recovery, and in particular, what we are observing in our chosen markets. As far as the economic recovery is concerned, there is no doubt in my mind that things are better, but even though things are better than they were say a year ago, we still have a long way to go.
Positive signs are emerging in terms of corporate profits and household incomes. GDP is positive and is expected to be up by about 3% for 2010. Consumer spending improved at a 3% rate for Q1 and is forecasted to increase by a similar amount for Q2.
Business spending is on the rise, companies are increasing their capital investments, and the Institute for Supply Management Index read 56.2 in June. That by the way was the 11th consecutive month of expansion.
Inflation remains in check with the CPI having increased by only about 1.5% for Q1. Interest rates are at their lowest level in many decades; inventory levels are reasonable compared to historical standards, and imports by and large are currently not a problem. So then just exactly what is the problem?
Well, as we all know, there are many issues that continue to get in the way of a full scale economic recovery, starting with the employment level. Unemployment remains stubbornly high. Although the unemployment rate decreased to about 9.5% in June, the broader measure of unemployment, as many of you know, was about 16.5%.
This higher percentage of unemployment takes into account those people who stop looking for work and those working part times, who would rather be working full time.
So, I suppose you might ask, why does all this matter to AK Steel? Quite simply, it matters because these are same people who would otherwise be purchasing homes and cars and appliances, all of which contain some form of the products that we make here at AK Steel.
With that in mind, each of us must do everything that we can to encourage investment, innovation and certainly job growth right here in America, because if we’re going to continue to make things in America, which we need to do, then we need Americans to buy those things and today for obvious reasons they are doing so in smaller numbers.
Analysts currently forecast that 2010 U.S. light vehicle sales will approximate 12 million units. Good news is that’s up from about 10 million units last year, but unfortunately that’s down from a peak of about 17 million units in the year 2007, and many believe that sales levels achieved before 2008 will not return until 2013 or later.
Incredibly, the housing and construction markets are in even worse shape than automotive. First quarter 2010 weakness caused projections of full year 2010 housing starts to be reduced to an estimated 660,000 units, by comparison the entire year of 2009 finished at 560,000 units. So, again things are better, but only marginally so.
Many of us can recall the peak in housing starts in 2005, the good old days of nearly 2.1 million units. No one today is willing to forecast when or if we may see that level of housing starts again. Believe it or not things are even tougher in the commercial construction market.
Having said that, AK Steel has enjoyed some gains in serving what we term the infrastructure and manufacturing or I&M market group. Despite being mired in the second lowest home building year and the lowest non-residential construction year in about three decades, AK Steel set a new monthly shipment record in June to the I&M market. Among other things second quarter activity was spurred by the federal tax credits offered to consumers to purchase energy efficient appliances.
Similarly, our automotive shipments were 95% higher than the year ago second quarter. Generally speaking, automotive build schedules have outperformed analysts’ expectations. Several automotive plants have reduced or even eliminated their traditional mid-year down time to catch up on critical platforms. Automotive inventories remained in good shape as well at the end of June. Light vehicle inventory stood at 55 days compared to 63 days a year ago.
Speaking of inventory levels let me briefly comment on inventories at service centers. Historically carbon steel inventories at service centers have averaged about 2.4 months of supply on-hand, as of June 30th that figure was 2.3 months. Stainless steel service center inventories had historically averaged 3.8 months of supply on hand, that compared to an actual figure of 2.8 months of supply on-hand as of the end of June.
So, all-in-all, service center inventories are in reasonable shape at this time. Service centers are simply buying what they need and when they need to buy it, no more, no less, and that’s the way we think it’s going to be for a while.
Let me take just a moment then to provide a little more insight into what we’re seeing on the specialty steel business. Commodity 300 series stainless is holding its own. Our volumes have remained pretty steady, but surcharges have fallen in tandem with declining nickel prices. Our 400 series stainless used in automotive exhaust applications enjoyed another solid quarter and the outlook remains positive.
Some of our specialty stainless steel applications, including stainless products for appliance makers and medical device makers, are in high demand with lead times out to October.
Lastly, as I mentioned earlier, our electrical steel shipments are improving as we’re capturing an increasing level of export opportunities. So, in terms of the markets that we serve at AK Steel, things are definitely better, but by no means are they great.
Before wrapping up, let me briefly comment on a labor agreement that we recently reached at our Ashland Works with the United Steelworkers I think it’s a pretty good deal for both parties. It’s a three-year contract extension that provides AK Steel with the kind of operating flexibility that we need in exchange for some manageable capital commitments and some economic rewards. With the ratification of this agreement by the USW members at Ashland, AK Steel has no expiring labor agreements for the balance of 2010.
Before taking your questions, I’d also like to take this opportunity to highlight a couple of honors that American Metal Market recently awarded to AK Steel. We were honored to receive the Steel Producer of the Year Award for our 2009 performance as well as the Best Turnaround of the Decade Award for our efforts in initial decade of this century.
While we’re grateful for these honors, this recognition would not have happened without the dedication and hard work of more than 6,000 men and women of AK Steel. It is their spirit that gives me faith and confidence in the future of our Company.
Finally, a tip of the hard hat goes to our Board of Directors as well. Directorship Magazine recently honored our Board from a select group of companies in the Fortune 500 with the top ranking in the category of corporate governance and citizenship. We are fortunate at AK Steel to have such an experienced group of leaders on our Board.
Together our Board, our management team and all of our employees are focused on serving the needs of our customers better than any other steelmaker. With that in mind, we’ll continue to focus our efforts on continuous improvement in the short term as well as the implementation of our long-term strategic initiatives to position AK Steel for future success.
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, Al and I would be happy to respond to your questions.

We look independently based on our order intake rates and they’ve been down a little bit in the last few weeks and we’re adjusting accordingly in our production schedules. Well, it’s anecdotal, we had very good order intake rate yesterday. So we’ll have our ups and downs along the way. For us, speaking to our capacity utilization, it really varies of course by plant and by product. As a Company for second quarter, we operated somewhere between 85% and 90% overall. Again, that compares to about 45% year ago second quarter.
I think according to AISI, the industry operated something like 70%, so we’re fairing well, we think based on how we’re treating our customers and some of the product lines that we are in. Looking out to the third quarter, the quarter we’re in, we currently expect to operate on an average at between 80% to 85%. Each of our two blast furnaces, one each at Middletown and Ashland, as you know, will be paced, we’ll match the order intake rate and we’ll probably not produce any carbon slabs at our Butler Works that’s sort of an available swing production capacity for us.

We hope that it turns out to be conservative, but it’s not our intent to be. So, I think that the real challenge for us that we see this quarter is the average selling price decline, which I think is 5% or $50 a ton, thereabout.
Just to that point, Sal, there are a number of factors at work that contribute to the decline. First, I would argue that probably the most significant is carbon steel spot market prices have eroded, scrap prices have fallen, and some sentiment that iron ore is down, we’ve entered the traditional seasonal slowdown period. I think a lot of people want to conjecture that this is something other than that and that it’s something structural or double dip. I’d be happy to comment on that if you’d like to. We don’t really see it that way. So carbon spot market prices are down.
Secondly, our mix is slightly less rich in the third quarter compared to the second. We’ve been running at about 84%, 85% value added. We’ll be closer to 80% in Q3 as we take advantage of a bit more hot-rolled business, and obviously hot-rolled carries a lower price, so that bring it down.
Lastly, with nickel prices having fallen recently, the near-term nickel surcharges declining, the combination of all those factors are really at play in the third quarter and they really largely tell the tale with respect to the lower guidance with respect to operating profitability.

Two, we followed the general direction of the spot market, and both of those things, which has been coming down significantly.

And I don’t know that if there is an agreement on an interim basis why you’d want to book anything beyond that because I don’t know if the direction is going to continue to be down in spot market pricing, and when we get a benchmark we’ll have more to say about it.

From our perspective on this business of where is the economy and where are things heading, look, we don’t see a double dip recession on the horizon. The economy is not retracting or retrenching, we’re in a slow growth economic recovery mode. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, things are improving, albeit, not as fast as we would like and perhaps not as fast as previous recoveries. That’s my take. I think it’s generally shared by our current Fed Chairman, our Former Fed Chairman, Alan Greenspan and the very famous Warren Buffett amongst others. One has to pick one’s timing in all of this and I suspect again that it’s more seasonal than structural and at least that is factored into our planning and in our guidance.

In a moment, I’ll review our third quarter financial results as well as provide some guidance for the fourth quarter of 2010. Following my remarks, Jim will offer his comments and field your questions.
Our comments today will include certain forward-looking guidance within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Included among those forward-looking statements will be any comments concerning our expectations as to future shipments, product mix, prices, costs, operating profit and liquidity.
Please note that our actual results may differ materially from what is contained in the forward-looking statements provided during this call. The information concerning factors that could cause such material differences in results is contained in our earnings release issued earlier today.
Except as required by law, the company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect future developments or events. To the extent that we refer to material information that includes non-GAAP financial measures, the reconciliation information required by Regulation G is available on the company’s Web site at aksteeel.com.
Earlier today, AK Steel reported a net loss of $59.2 million or $0.54 per share for the third quarter of 2010. Our results were negatively impacted by a significant increase in raw material costs, principally for iron ore, along with costs related to the acceleration of a plant maintenance outage at our Ashland Works blast furnace. We also experienced the modest cost increase associated with an environmental remediation project.
In a moment, I’ll expand on our costs, but first let me make a few comments about our quarterly shipments and selling prices. Shipments for the third quarter of 2010 totaled 1,465,800 tons, an increase of about 16,000 tons compared to the second quarter. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of increased shipments, and it represents our highest quarterly shipment level since the third quarter of 2008.
Our average selling price was $1,075 per ton, which was slightly higher than expected. However, it did represent a decrease of roughly 2% compared to the prior quarter.
Third quarter revenues totaled $1.576 billion, slightly less than revenues for the prior quarter. Sales outside the U.S. remained an important source of revenue for us, totaling approximately $203 million for the quarter.
Due to strengthening of the euro, our third quarter results were positively impacted by a foreign exchange gain of approximately $8 million.
Now, let me return to cost to provide a few more details. In mid-September, we announced that we would take an 11-day maintenance outage at our Ashland Works blast furnace. This outage was previously planned to take place in the first half of 2011, but was advanced due to furnace conditions. The outage was successfully completed and the furnace has returned to normal operation. However, as a result of the outage, we incur higher operating costs during the third quarter.
With respect to iron ore, we have agreed with two of our three primary iron ore suppliers that the annual benchmark price of iron ore for 2010 has been set. That 2010 benchmark is an increase of 98.65% over the 2009 benchmark and is higher than the 65% increase we have previously estimated for the first half and for our third quarter guidance.
Our third primary supplier of iron ore has not yet acknowledged that an annual benchmark price has been established. Instead, that supplier continues to seek a price increase in excess of the 98.65% annual benchmark price.
We do not agree that this supplier has a right under our contract to charge based on other than an annual benchmark price and for purposes the iron ore purchased from this supplier, we have used an estimated benchmark increase of 98.65% in our third quarter financial results.
Our third quarter of 2010 financial results reflect the year-to-date impact of the 98.65% increase in the benchmark iron ore price, which increased our third quarter operating loss by approximately $76 million or $52 per ton.
On an operating basis for the third quarter, we incurred a loss of $102.5 million or $70 per ton. Excluding the effect of the change in the price of iron ore, AK Steel’s operating loss in the third quarter was approximately $26.5 million or $18 per ton, which was slightly better than our revised guidance provided in mid-September.
Turning for a moment to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $81 million. Except for about $149 million of outstanding letters of credit, our $850 million revolving credit facility was fully available at the end of the quarter.
Now let’s take a brief look at our results for the first nine months of 2010. Shipments were of 4.3 million tons, an increase of more than 1.7 million tons or 68% compared to our shipment level for the same year-ago period. Revenues for the first nine months were $4.6 billion, a 66% increase compared to revenues of $2.8 billion for the first nine months of 2009.
Our average selling price was $1064 per ton, about 1% lower than for the first three quarters of last year. Sales outside the U.S. totaled $630 million for the first nine months of 2010 compared to $565 million for the first nine months of last year.
We generated an operating profit for the first nine months of 2010 of $20.7 million or $5 per ton compared to an operating loss of $157.1 million or $61 per ton for the same period a year-ago.
Excluding a non-cash charge of $25.3 million in the first quarter related to federal healthcare legislation, we had an adjusted net loss of $5.3 million for the first nine months of 2010 or $0.05 per diluted share that compares to a net loss of $114.4 million or $1.05 per share for the same period of 2009.
Let me now provide some guidance for our fourth quarter of 2010. In light of market softness and seasonal factors, we expect shipments to decline to between 1,300,000 tons to 1,350,000 tons for the fourth quarter.
In addition, we expect our average selling price to decrease by approximately 4% quarter-over-quarter due to lower spot market pricing and changes in product mix, and while we expect lower maintenance costs of approximate $20 million for the previous quarter. This benefit will be more than offset by lower sales prices and lower production. On an overall basis, we expect to incur operating loss of approximately $80 per ton for the fourth quarter.
Now for his comments on our third quarter results and our outlook, here is Jim Wainscott. Jim?

Good morning, everyone. Let me take just a few minutes to comment on our third quarter 2010 results and our outlook, before we entertain your questions. First, let me state the obvious.Third quarter was a tough one for AK Steel for a coup",2010,"Thank you, Al. Good morning, everyone. Let me take just a few minutes to comment on our third quarter 2010 results and our outlook, before we entertain your questions. First, let me state the obvious.
Third quarter was a tough one for AK Steel for a couple of primary reasons, namely maintenance cost and iron ore cost and as we said in pre-announcing our third quarter results in September as, Al briefly discussed, we prudently advanced the maintenance outage at our Ashland Works blast furnace.
That job went extremely well and that’s a credit to our engineers and our operating and maintenance personnel. Following its successful completion, the action blast furnace is again stable and productive, and we are well positioned to produce slabs at Ashland for the next 18 to 24 months, without any major planned outages.
On the iron ore front, as Al described, we reached agreement during Q3 on a 2010 benchmark price increase with two of our three major suppliers. Unfortunately, the benchmark price increase is 98.65%, and in addition, it’s retroactive to January 1 of 2010. We’re continuing to negotiate with our third supplier, but to-date we have not reached agreement with them on a price.
Just to give you some insight that supplier is seeking to impose quarterly pricing on us, which would result in a higher annual cost to AK Steel in 2010, then if the benchmark increase is 98.65%. Simply stated under our contract, we do not agree that the supplier has a right to charge something other than the annual benchmark price.
In reaching a benchmark price increase for 2010, iron ore pellets with our other iron ore pellet suppliers, we’ve removed most of the uncertainties surrounding our 2010 iron ore pricing, which we believe has been an overhang on our company for most of this year. Our third quarter 2010 results include higher iron ore pellet costs for the third quarter itself, as well as the true-up effect for the first and second quarters of this year.
Excluding those iron ore true-up costs, once again our third quarter results reflect an operating loss of $18 per ton, which is slightly better than our updated guidance, which was an operating loss of about $20 a ton.
That said let me be perfectly clear about this. There are no moral victories in losing less money than we had anticipated. Losing money either on an operating or a net basis is not something that we’re used to doing at AK Steel. In fact, even during the great recession, we were among the first steel companies either integrated or mini-mill, to return to profitability.
We offer no excuses, but the fact is that we faced some extenuating circumstances in the third quarter of 2010 and for that matter; we’ll face a challenging fourth quarter of 2010 as well.
The primary reasons for this are lower shipments and prices and higher costs. We expect 8% to 10% sequential decline in shipments and about a 4% decline in the average selling price of our products for 4Q compared to 3Q. And this scenario is coupled with stubbornly high iron ore pellet costs. I suppose we’re somewhere between recession and recovery and with that kind of an economy that we’re facing, demand for our products is less than we had previously anticipated.
Accordingly, selling prices, in particular, for carbon steel products have been under pressure. Paradoxically, even though demand is sluggish, the cost of raw materials remains at or near record highs. I suspect that AK Steel is paying about double for iron ore pellets on a delivered basis compared to our integrated competitors, who own their own pellets.
The near-term challenges of lower average selling prices and higher steal making input costs have caused us to renew our focus on what we call our ‘3 Cs’ program. This is a program that has served us very well during challenging times in the past. Of course, I’m speaking about customers, costs, and cash.
We want to make sure that we’re doing everything we can to take great care of our customers, lower our costs and conserve our cash. All these ‘3 Cs’ are always important in every business. They matter even more now as we face a challenging near-term outlook in terms of selling prices and input costs.
The market prices for the products we sell and steel making input costs frankly are not things that we have control over, and yet they have eroded our historically profitable operating income and net income positions.
We’re hard at work to address our position of being raw material short. We understand the need to take appropriate actions to become more self sufficient and reduce our costs for the long-term. But in the short-term we have to control those things that we can control that’s our focus and that’s exactly what we’re doing.
We continue to place the safety of our employees at the top of our list of priorities. That’s what taking care of your people is all about. We continue to differentiate the quality of our products to the satisfaction of our customers.
On the quality front, we continue to perform quite well in service to our customers for the third quarter. In fact, five of our seven steel plants are on track for best-ever quality performances in 2010.
Also for the third quarter I’m delighted to report that AK Steel took top honors in the latest Jacobson surveys, for both carbon and specialty steel products. These surveys indicated that our customers ranked AK Steel number one in quality, in customer service, and on-time delivery and number one, in overall customer satisfaction. At the end of the day ladies and gentlemen, that’s what it’s all about to serve customers with great quality, delivering customer service better than any other steel maker.
In terms of productivity, companywide we operated at about 82% of capacity for the third quarter compared to approximately 89% for the second quarter. In the process, we set a number of production records at our Coshocton Works, where we are serving the increased appetite for our bright annealed products that are being consumed by auto manufacturers and other OEMS.
Speaking of the automotive market, it continues to be our strongest market for 2010, representing about one third of our shipments. We expect our automotive shipments for 2010 to coincidentally be about one third higher than they were for 2009.
Increased shipments are being driven by the year-over-year increase in North American light vehicle production, which is now forecasted to come in at about $11.8 million units for 2010 and that compares to about $8.6 million units for 2009. Similarly, North American light vehicle sales are expected to reach about 11.4 million this year compared to 10.3 million units for all of last year.
With that, let me shift gears to another key market for AK Steel, the service center market. At the end of September, carbon steel service center inventories stood at about 2.3 months of supply on hand, compared to a historical average of about 2.5 months and for a flat-rolled products, which is what we’re interested in, September service center daily shipments were at the highest level they have been since September of 2008.
Having said that, steel buyers that are our service center customers continue to exhibit a cautious buying mood, they appear to be holding off on placing future orders until they work of existing inventory and sense that the steel price declines have bottomed.
What that means is at the present time, carbon steel service centers are purchasing only to meet their immediate needs. Clearly, this is one of the reasons that we’re forecasting and guiding to lower shipments for our fourth quarter compared to our third quarter.
On the other hand, during the third quarter we saw strong demand for our Commodity 300 series stainless products. For the month of September, for example, we established a new monthly shipping record for Commodity from nickel products.
Of late, however, we have observed cautious customer buying activity rather in 300 series stainless products, and we expect that to continue as we move forward in the fourth quarter. We expect service centers to reduce their inventories as well and we expect them to take a wait-and-see approach with respect to the direction of nickel prices and the outlook for surcharges.
400 series stainless, our auto exhaust business, remained strong in Q3 and we expect to see continued strength for this product line in Q4. One of our strongest products is bright annealed stainless material that we produced at our Coshocton plant for a variety of trim and appliance applications.
We expect demand to remain very strong for this product in the fourth quarter as we continue to see strong demand exhibited by appliance makers, and in fact, we’re sold out into the early part of 2011.
Lastly, let me comment on the electrical steel market. Throughout 2010, this is a market that has been under significant pressure around the globe, and we expect that pressure to continue into the fourth quarter.
Orders from our NAFTA customers have stabilized, while non-NAFTA business which is primarily spot business remains volatile at best. At present, we’re in negotiations with customers regarding supply of electrical steel products for 2011.
Meanwhile, we applaud the decision in September by the U.S. Trade Representative to file a complaint against China for violating the rules of WTO and imposing antidumping and countervailing duties against imports of grain-oriented electrical steel from the United States.
As one of the largest and most advanced global producers of grain-oriented electrical steels, AK Steel is well-positioned to meet the growing need for efficient electricity generation, transmission and distribution in all parts of the world including China. Frankly, all we seek is a level-playing field.
Let’s spend just a moment on AK Steel’s cash and liquidity positions. As Al discussed, we’ve been putting our cash to work. With short-term investment rates at roughly 0%, we thought earlier this year, it made lot of sense to pay down more than $100 million in debt, when refinanced our 7.75% quarter senior notes and that action saves us more than $700,000 each month.
In addition, we’ve been funding our capital program, funding our working capital needs and meeting our pension funding obligations, entirely with cash generated from operations.
All told, since 2003 when the management changes occurred, we’ve used $3.5 billion of all internally generated cash to fund capital investments, pension contributions, reduce debt and make payments for various labels.
Because of these actions and in light of the near-term challenges, including the make whole payments due for iron pellets, our cash balance is lower than we’ve experienced in recent years. That said, as Al detailed, our liquidity remain solid, and we will continue to focus on improving our future earnings and cash flow going forward.
Not surprisingly, one of our major focus areas is to obtain raw material equity positions and as I mentioned earlier, we’re actively attempting to increase our raw materials vertical integration and lower our costs for the long term to improve our competitiveness.
We’re engaged in discussions with a number of parties around the globe, regarding potential raw material transactions, and we’ll seek to bring those discussions to fruition just as soon as it is practicable.
Everything we do at AK Steel is intended to add value for AK Steel shareholders. We continue to focus on the long-term recognizing that you have to deal with these short-term challenges in order to get to the long-term and while the challenges ahead of us are numerous in that same vein the opportunities are limitless.
Having repeatedly faced and overcome adversity, we’re committed to coming back from this latest challenge and emerging stronger than ever. AK Steel employees have endured challenging times in the past and we have always found a way to win. I’m confident that we’ll weather this latest storm and emerge victorious as well.
With that, let’s open up the phone lines for your questions.

I think we’ll continue to look hard at that to say where is the sweet spot, we’ve been as high as 75%, 80% contract and as low as about 45%, 50%. We’ll probably gravitate a bit more towards contract as we go forward, but there are still very important place at the table at AK Steel for our spot market customers.
With respect to being able to pass on some of these higher costs, maybe just a bit of history in order. I think as you know, we are obviously in the carbon steel, as well as stainless and electrical market and historically the stainless and electrical steel agreements that we’ve negotiated with customers have included pass-throughs for items like nickel, chrome, scrap and natural gas among others. In recent years, we’ve pushed hard for similar acceptance of variable pricing agreements with our carbon steel customers and frankly, we’ve had a lot of success in that regard.
Today, if you look at our overall portfolio, about 85% of our contract sales contain some form of variable pricing, in most cases, including a raw material surcharge component. So if you do that math about 85% or 55% something like 45% of our overall shipments have a variable component. We have more work to do here, certainly because it’s not a dollar for dollar pass-through. We’re going to need to continue to modify our agreements and continue to have our customers work with us to recognize the extraordinary times we’ve been particularly for things like iron ore and coal.

We negotiated a number of favorable coal deals, most of which expire at the end of 2010. One of which does not happens to be with our good friends at Massey, but they’ve got other issues as you know. I think clearly given an increase in demand here and abroad for coal, we expect to pay more for that commodity in 2011. Our deals are being negotiated as we speak. We do not yet have them completed, but I think it’s fair to say that we’re expect to incur higher costs, if not substantially higher costs for that commodity going forward.
It’s another area that we’re looking hard at going forward as to whether or not it makes sense to own a piece of that steel making input. As you know, we’re in the blast furnace business in particular at Middletown and Ashland and coal is important to make coke and coke is the fuel for those blast furnaces. So, we’re taking a very long-term view at this. Notwithstanding that, we’re likely going to pay more for that commodity next year.

In 2009, we bounced off the bottom for the first of this year. We’re up about 10%, I think as we look out near term. Third quarter was pretty much flat with second quarter, and I think the fourth quarter will be flat to slightly down. Situation candidly were global supply continues to outpace global demand and you can sort of draw your own interferences as to what that means with respect to price. We’re favoring export opportunities given the value of the dollar, although again, competition there is really brutal.
I’d just say with respect to 2010 contract negotiations, those are also underway. It’d be a little premature to discuss that much, but supply and demand being what it is and competition being what it is, we’re under pressure there and we’ll have more to say as we know more. Certainly, the longer term prospects remain very, very favorable for this product line for us as the world continues to what we want in America, which is a quality of life and that includes electricity.

We’ll see how all of that evolves, but if it does move to something other than an annual benchmark of course that will have to be negotiated with us. But if it is and if it moves to something along the lines of quarterly or monthly or more often, our sales agreements are going to have to track that, so that we can manage our margins and really manage our business to cover our cost.

I would say that in recent weeks, our order intake rates have moderated, demand remained sluggish as we’ve tried to characterize it. Some of that is obviously seasonal in nature as you know, Mark.
In addition, I think it’s fair to say that perhaps not the actual steel supply, but the psychological effect of TK’s Alabama facility entering the market is also having an effect on things. This is not just here in our country in terms of the slide in price, but really something that is around the world. We’re adjusting at AK Steel. Accordingly, there is a level below, which we won’t go and we’re pretty much right there and that’s why we’ve guided to roughly 8% to 10% down quarter-over-quarter in terms of shipments.

We really had plenty of domestic supply before the arrival of TK and with them, now putting product into the market even in small quantities. I believe it is having a depressing effect on pricing as I mentioned earlier. Simply, too much supply, too little demand. It’ll take a while for that supply to assimilate into the marketplace. Perhaps, as some head of pine displays the imports, we’ll see, but it’s certainly poorly timed just when the U.S economy starts to recover.
I think probably the strategic decision was made back when the view was that there would be 18 million units to 20 million units sold in America. I certainly heard that from guys like Jim Press, formerly of Toyota and Chrysler and that may have caused the people to spend multi-billions of dollars in any event I think look the reality is, it’s one thing to produce hot-rolled and put that into the market. It’s a whole another matter to get into the exposed automotive business which is a sweet spot for AK Steel.
I think that it’s going to take time to bring the units online and its going to take time to qualify those units and its going to take time to take business away if in fact, that can even happen. We speak from experience at AK Steel having built Rockport Works in the last decade, and well let’s just say that we built it, they came and they paid us less money. Look, our relationships with customers is good as anybody’s in our business, and when you are number one in quality, delivery and service, and number one, in overall customer satisfaction other than someone undercutting your price, why would they want to move to TK?

I am honored and humbled to have the job, just as much I was seven years ago. We are really very proud of the progress that we have made. Seven years of serving customers better than any other steel makers, staying true to our core values of safety, quality and productivity in good times and tough times, negotiating good deals with customers labor unions and suppliers and really returning AK Steel to sustain profitability at least up until the world turned upside down with these record high steel making input cost. We’ve added value for our shareholders after greatly strengthening of the balance sheet meeting all of our legacy obligations.
Fact of the matter is Timna, our customers tell us, they like us. They like the size that we are. They like the products that we produce, and we’re only small in commodity-type markets. In the value added markets that we serve in carbon, stainless and electrical, we certainly have a place at the table. So, we acknowledge our work is not done, far from it. We simply positioned ourselves to compete effectively. We need more vertical integration, we need to lower our cost, and we’ll do so and we’ll grow profitably to sustain long-term profitability. The company is not for sale, and I appreciate you bringing up the question.
