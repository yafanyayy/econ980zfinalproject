ICE delivered dou",1862,"Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. I'm pleased to report that ICE once again, achieved record quarterly results during the fourth quarter and for the full year 2009, we delivered exceptional results by virtually any metrics. ICE delivered double-digit revenue growth, resulting in our sixth consecutive year of record revenues. This was coupled with record operating income, record net income and record cash flow. Not only did we turn in a strong growth in our core business, we also executed on the ambitious set of strategic and financial objectives that we committed to at the start of 2009. These included the successful launch of the leading CDS clearing houses in Europe and the U.S., the introduction of over 200 new OTC energy contracts and the integration of two acquired companies. These objectives were achieved despite an economic environment that remained weak throughout the year. Our ability to sustain growth and capitalize on new opportunities, regardless of the business cycle, as a result of our diversification and consistent innovation. Our GAAP results for the fourth quarter and full year, which are reflected in this presentation, include a number of non-recurring items, which are detailed in the appendix of the presentation. This morning, we'll focus our comments on the objective figures, as we believe they provide a more accurate view of our business performance. If you turn to Slide 4, I'll begin with the fourth quarter 2009 results. We achieved record consolidated revenues of $257 million, up 24% over 4Q '08. Consolidated adjusted net income, attributable to ICE grew 39% to $84 million compared to $60 million adjusted net income in the prior fourth quarter. Our tax rate for the quarter and the year was 36%, which was at the high-end of our guidance. This primarily related to changes in state tax laws and the mix of our business across the state. We expect our tax rate in 2010 to once again, be in the 34% to 36% range.  Adjusted diluted EPS rose 37% to $1.12 and our adjusted EBITDA increased 32% versus the fourth quarter of 2008. Let's move now to Slide 5, starting on the left hand side of the chart, transaction and clearing revenues were 29% to $229 million during the quarter. This includes $102 million from our Futures segment, $87 million from OTC Energy and $39 million from OTC Credit. Market data and other revenues totaled $27 million. Shifting to the right side of the slide, we detail fourth quarter consolidated operating expenses on a GAAP and adjusted basis. Our 4Q expense includes a number of items, which are not reflective our of our normal operating expenses. These items include additional severance expenses associated with our recent acquisitions, an additional compensation of SG&A expense from true ups related to adjustments of withholding and sales and use taxes. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter operating expenses increased 12% year-to-year, driven primarily by investments in our CDS clearing initiative and a $5 million true up of our full year bonus accruals, as a result of a very strong end to a very strong year. While this true up is for the full year and thus, not reflective of our quarterly run rate compensation expense, we've not excluded it from our adjusted expense because it is consistent with our pay-for-performance culture. Adjusted operating margin, which you can see on the lower right side of the slide, improved to 52% compared to 47% in the prior fourth quarter. The adjusted operating margin, excluding our CDS Brokerage business were 62%. Despite some of the noise in our operating expense, we delivered strong profit and cash growth in the fourth quarter and are well positioned to continue to profitably expand our business, launch meaningful new products that leverage our clearing and execution infrastructure and enter new markets.Moving to Slide 6, I'll cover our Energy Futures business. During the fourth quarter, ICE Futures Europe achieved record transaction revenues of $68 million, up 28% year-to-year with average daily volume or ADV of 689,000 contracts. Notably, our benchmark, Brent Crude and Gasoil Futures revenues reached record levels during the quarter. Open interest for ICE Futures Europe grew 24% during 2009, reflecting the strong presence of global commercial customers in our markets and our attractive product suite. As reported last week, volumes in our Energy Futures market remained strong with January ADV up 21% over January 2009, including Brent ADV up 20% and Gasoil up 36%. Importantly, growth rates have accelerated further in the first part of February.Turning to Slide 7, you'll see the fourth quarter performance of our agricultural and financial futures exchange. ADV with 360,000 contracts per day, which was up about 1% from last 4Q. Our ag [agricultural] complex and Sugar in particular, was generally strong and recovered throughout the year following the challenges of a difficult credit market. However, the Russell Index volume, like the rest of the equity product market were soft. Nonetheless, we continue to increase our Russell 2000 market share relative to the S&P 500 Futures and believe we are well positioned to benefit when markets recover.Earlier this month, we reported that January 2010 average daily volume for ICE Futures U.S. increased 30% and gross has continued to accelerate in the first part of February. Our OTC segment performance is detailed on Slide 8.  Total OTC transaction revenues rose 37% in the fourth quarter with average daily commission, or ADC, for energy reaching a record $1.3 million, up 53% from 4Q '08. This was also the third consecutive quarter of record revenues in our OTC oil and power market, and we had the best quarter for our Natural Gas business since 3Q '08. Our strong results were also driven by the more than 200 new products that we began clearing in 2009. These new products contributed over $3.5 million in net revenue or roughly $0.03 of earnings per share in the fourth quarter. For all of 2009, these new OTC products added over $7 million in revenue, and this is despite being very early in our product life cycle. In total, a record 97% of our 4Q volume was cleared. Our OTC Energy business continued to perform well in January with average daily commissions exceeding $1.4 million and February results thus far, are very encouraging.Turning to our credit businesses, revenues totaled $39 million during the fourth quarter. This includes $29 million from Creditex and $10 million from CDS Clearing. Creditex's electronic transaction services accounted for 39% of our fourth quarter Creditex revenues. The traditional brokerage business for credit derivatives is showing some early signs of improvement and our electronic product offerings continue to provide attractive margins. On the CDS Clearing side, we generated $10 million of revenue during the fourth quarter and full year revenues of $31 million, which was slightly above the high-end of our prior guidance. Despite heavy investment, typical of any start up business, CDS Clearing was cash flow positive during its first nine months of operations. While our credit derivatives strategy is in an early stage, we believe it is an important platform for future growth, but will offer healthy returns when credit markets normalize. Turning now to Slide 9, you'll see the summary financials for our full year performance. Consolidated revenues were $995 million, up 22% versus 2008. Adjusted net income, attributable to ICE rose to a record $334 million. Adjusted EBITDA grew 14% and operating cash flow increased 30% over 2008. And another year of economic turmoil, we continue to invest and expand our business, and we emerge with more earnings, more cash and more revenue producing assets.On Slide 10, you'll find a snapshot of our guidance for 2010. I won't review it now in detail, but I will note one item. For CDS Clearing, we have provided preliminary 2010 revenue guidance of $60 million to $80 million. This is based upon assumptions relating to product rollouts, regulatory approvals, additional customers, founding member pricing structures and a gradual improvement in the CDS market. The year-to-year revenue growth implicit in this guidance will be supported by lower expenses as start up investments subside. Thus, we expect net margins on this revenue guidance to be between 16% and 20% after accounting for the 50% profit sharing with the selling shareholders in the Clearing Corp.Before handing the call over to Jeff, I'd like to highlight the consistent track record of growth and strong financial returns we've established starting on Slide 11. This morning, I've cover the growth in our core business and the successful delivery of many strategic initiatives. All of this enabled us to grow revenues 22% in 2009, which contributes to our nearly 60% compound annual growth rate of 2005.  Importantly, of the $840 million of revenue growth from 2005 to 2009, more than half of that growth has been organic.  However, the key question is whether the top line growth and the associated investment required generate value for our shareholders. Let's turn to Slide 12, to answer that question. The metrics on this slide demonstrate the consistently strong financial returns our business model has produced. We have a strong core business, which provides solid growth and profitability, we take a very balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment and acquisition, we act quickly to identify and consistently deliver on synergies and finally, we have innovative customer-oriented culture with rewards tied directly to the company's results and aligned with our shareholders interests. This means that we come to work everyday, focused on growing our top line, improving margins and carefully managing every line of expense. However, we recognize that investors don't directly benefit from revenue and margins alone. They benefit from profit, cash and high returns on invested capital. These are the true measures of value creation. And that this chart demonstrate we have consistently delivered strong value and returns to our shareholders. We have grown adjusted EBITDA and operating cash by nearly 80% a year since 2005, including strong growth once again in 2009. As a result, we are generating industry-leading returns on invested capital or ROIC. ROIC matters because it considers the capital we deploy for acquisitions, CapEx and operating expenses and is passionately [ph] asked, whether management is making optimal decisions to deploy capital in an efficient manner and importantly, generating returns in excess of our cost of capital. We believe the answers to those questions is reflected on the lower left hand portion of this chart, is an unequivocal yes for ICE and our shareholders. Even as we have heavily invested in future growth over the last two years, and regardless of the economic environment, the nearly 16% returns we delivered in 2009 and the strong returns in '07 and '08 are well above our cost of capital and clearly, distinguished ICE from our peers and demonstrate a positive economic value we are creating for shareholders. With that, I'll ask that you please refer to this morning's earnings press release for further details on our quarterly performance, as well as more detailed guidance for 2010. I'd like to note that we filed our 10-K this morning and I'll be happy to address any questions during the Q&A. Jeff, over to you."

While ICE's strong financial performance speaks for itself, I want to update you on our strategies to continue to build the business. I also want to mention, on behalf of the global management team here at ICE, that we are never satisfied, regardless of our industry-leading results. Given the strong foundation we built, there are many avenues for our continued growth over the next several years. And as entrepreneurs, we will continue to create opportunity. ICE's core business comprises Execution, Clearing, Data and Trade Services across the futures and over-the-counter markets. Since the beginning of the decade and particularly, over the last two years, we've expanded our reach into the over-the-counter markets, by introducing successful new contracts and by building world-class clearing houses. In our broader business, we've expanded the number of customers and segments that we serve and we've taken advantage of change in technology to develop new approaches to our century-old business. While our regulation of our industry will continue to evolve, we've demonstrated that our markets continue to grow amidst change. Regulatory and legislative proposals are not factors that we believe will hinder or change the opportunity set before our global franchise. The factors that have driven our growth, historically, are much larger than these and they're secular in nature. Any changes that have occurred have more often than not presented opportunities rather than risks. And today, we operate a business that's likely to benefit from regulatory change, including clearing houses, electronic trade execution and processing platforms.Despite the economic and regulatory uncertainty that's existed in one form or another for several years, we have a demonstrated track record of developing solutions to support such evolution. And our revenues, our earnings, our volume and our open interest, all stand at record levels. In other words, we are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that come along with change. Our results continue to reinforce the fact that ICE can deliver solutions that are responsive to a dynamic environment and accretive to our shareholders. I'll take a few moments to provide some context for the foundation of our growth. Our core businesses rooted in the physical commodity markets, which continue to significantly outperform within the exchange sector. These markets have provided steady and healthy earnings growth and cash flow, as well as access to new business opportunities for us. As Scott has just detailed, our core businesses has been a consistent performer despite the difficult economic climate. You'll see beginning on Slide 13, that strategic diversification across our business is an important driver of our opportunity set. First, we acquired new businesses that have diversified and expanded our reach into new markets. You can see on the slide the healthy diversification that we've achieved among products, market participants and geography.  Since the start of 2007, we've added five clearing houses and three new asset classes. These classes include agricultural futures, financial futures and credit derivatives. And today, they account for about a third of our revenues. Each represents a significant addressable market in which we have just begun to tap the potential. These moves require adopting a strategic vision about what it would take to produce revenue growth down the road, rather than just relying on cost cutting as a strategy. In terms of customers, we're one of the most commercially-oriented exchange operators based on our customers mix. ICE's markets have been generally defined and developed out of commercial hedging needs, particularly in the over-the-counter markets.  In 2009, over 50% of our over-the-counter energy revenues came from commercial end-users. And this percentage has been rising through the years, as we have diversified our product offering. You can also see that we've established attractive geographic diversification with 40% of our revenues now coming from outside the United States. The broad addition of our electronic markets for commodities has served us well, amid the economic downturn. As countries outside of the West continue to grow, the reliance on commodity markets and the use of hedging is also growing. We're also seeing growth across Europe and in natural resource-based economies. I've spoken many times about the growth potential that commodities hold, and this continues to bear out in our results. We've effectively tapped new geographies and developed new products simply by leveraging our core commodity business. Great examples of our global product platform are ICE's Brent Crude and Gasoil futures markets. Both of these products just turned in their twelfth consecutive annual-record volume years and Gasoil set yet another daily volume record just yesterday. Brent continues to be a dominant global oil benchmark due to its role in princing the majority of physical crude markets around the world and Gasoil, has become a dominant refined oil product benchmark due to its role in setting refined product prices outside the U.S. These are just two examples of products that we use to provide entrées in the new geographies at very low incremental costs to ICE. The next area that I'd like to touch on is our measurable results in developing new products. Many of you are aware the success that we've had with the ICE West Texas Intermediate crude oil contract, which we launched in 2006 and last year, which contributed $49 million to our consolidated revenues. But there are many, many more recent new product success stories at ICE. In 2009, we had success with the launch of the coal futures market, and we continue to set records with this suite of coal products into the new year. Coal is another globally-relevant product and we're forging new trading relationships in Asia, Europe and the United States. In addition, we've just cleared our first iron ore contract last week. And according to many estimates, iron ore is one of the largest commodities purchased by China. Our futures contracts, such as iron ore and coal, are designed as hedging tools for both buyers and sellers of physical commodity, as well as for firms with exposure to industrialization in these emerging economies.In the energy markets, we bought new markets to quickly and effectively. As we discussed in our fourth quarter earnings call last year, we had a pipeline of new over-the-counter energy products to roll through ICE Clear Europe in 2009. And we did so successfully with over 200 new contracts introduced resulting in market share and volume gains. The $7 million from these products, as Scott mentioned earlier, is on top of the incremental revenues related to cross-selling and basis trading with our existing core products. As a result of these efforts to grow our markets, last year, we achieved our sixth consecutive record for average daily commission in the over-the-counter markets. As you can see, we've tangible results from new products, which have helped to establish ICE's Futures and over-the-counter energy market places, as perhaps the most comprehensive available. Now if you'll turn to Slide 14, I'll touch on another milestone that we achieved in 2009, which was our move in the clearing financial over-the-counter markets. Based on our depth of understanding of over-the-counter markets, we were able to respond effectively to the call by regulators for credit default swap clearing. Today, we operate the leading global credit default swap clearing solution, serving both the buy side and the sell side. This was and continues to be, an important accomplishment, not only for ICE but for market participants and regulators. Many of you have followed our progress as we've assisted with the restructuring of the CDS markets over the past two years. On the slide here, you'll see the quantitative and qualitative results of our leadership. It requires substantial effort by the team here at ICE working non-stop over the last 18 months to successfully deliver this initiative. For those new to ICE, let me just recap briefly. In June 2008, seeing the need for clearing in credit markets, just as we did years earlier in the energy markets, we announced our acquisition of Creditex, a leading provider of CDS trade execution and trade processing. We moved very quickly to close that transaction in August of that year, and we incorporated a team with tremendous credit knowledge. The collapse of Lehman Brothers occurred between the closing of the Creditex transaction in August and the successful launch of our new European clearing house in November of 2008. And amid all of this, we announced that we were going to acquire The Clearing Corporation, furthering our clearing objectives.  Finally, in March 2009, we closed on that transaction and launched what is now the leading clearing house for credit default swaps in the United States. And in July, we launched what is now Europe's leading credit default swap clearing house.  ICE Trust and ICE Clear Europe have served as a model for addressing the complexities of the over-the-counter markets, serving the buy side and the sell side and working across regulatory jurisdictions. To date, ICE has cleared over $5.5 trillion in credit default swaps in the aggregate. And as of year-end, the cash in ICE's CDS guaranty funds, supporting the over-the-counter credit default swap markets exclusively, exceeded $3 billion, which we believe is one of the largest cash guaranty funds for any single product. In addition to providing the only dedicated default fund for credit default swaps, we put in place the most stringent risk standards of any competing model, a model that delivers capital efficiency without changing the workflow of our market participants. In other words, we've effectively removed financial and systemic risks without introducing operational risk. This year, we plan to deliver operational and product additions for credit default swap clearing and we're working closely with customers to ensure that our solution remains the most comprehensive in supporting the recovery and the growth of over-the-counter markets.So let me conclude on Slide 15 with a quick recap of some of the defining features of ICE's model that we believe will allow us to continue to outperform our peers. First, ICE's business is primarily driven by commercial participation. As a result, we grew and withstood the test of reduced liquidity during economic uncertainty. Secondly, our business is well diversified and global, providing access opportunities that arise across markets and across geographies. And thirdly, we've demonstrated our flexibility to respond to the needs across both futures market and over-the-counter markets. These strengths have produced consistently strong operational and financial performance. We grew our top and bottom line, while investing in future growth. In fact, ICE's net income for 2009 was 31% higher than 2007 when the financial crisis began. Importantly, our early results this year demonstrate continued health in our business with current quarter-to-date futures and over-the-counter average daily commissions, up over 30% year-over-year. Open interest and volumes in many of our major benchmark contracts are at there all-time highs. In closing, you can see that ICE's working to affect positive evolution in markets, responding to the risk management needs of our growing customer base and exploiting the opportunities that exists amid a sea of continued change. On behalf of everyone here at ICE, I want to thank our customers again for trusting us with their business in 2009 during a period of great uncertainty. And I want to thank all of my colleagues here on the ICE team for their hard work in exceeding our objectives last year. Let me now turn over to the operator. And operator, could you please moderate our question-and-answer session."

And in fact, pension in the market as to which names we should rollout first. As you can imagine right now, there's a big push to try to deal with the single names related to the sovereign debt, particularly in Europe with a lot of risk attached to that. So there's debate as these products get rolled out. But nonetheless, what we're seeing is tremendous use once we rolled them out. I think, implicit in your question is the buy side or people who are non-bank market participants are not under regulatory pressure to use clearing, and my sense is that some will and some won't and there will be an evolution. I think it looks a lot to us like the Energy business when we started in 2002. Clearing was very disliked by most market participants. And as we just comment in our prepared remarks, we now 97% of the business that goes across our trading platform goes to clearing. So let's call it a period of seven years or so. There's been a dramatic change and I would think it will be shortened in the credit markets, given regulatory pressure but nonetheless, it will be a multiyear process."

We're continuing every couple of weeks to rollout more single names. So as we work through that rollout, we'll see the notional grow and then revenue will go along with that. And just back to your question, embedded in the $60 million to $80 million is the rollout schedule we've got through single names that will occur, predominantly, through the first quarter, some into the early part of second quarter and an expectation that we will see good uptake, just as we did with indexes. And in addition to that, we're getting some good early signs from the market, both on the clearing side and in our Brokerage business.

And every prime broker has different rates and structures and are looking at their customer position slightly differently, so there's no one good answer. That's why I say, Roger, I think it'll be an evolutionary not a revolutionary process. The second part of your question on sovereigns, sovereigns present a unique risk and it's one that we're debating with the market and with regulators. For example, if you have an Italian bank that's writing protection against the default against the default of the Italian government, what is that risk? And is it possible for an Italian bank to survive the collapse of its own government? Those are the kinds of things that come into clearing sovereigns that the market has never really seen addressed in a holistic way before and we're being asked to be at the center of that discussion. There's obviously tremendous demand and I suspect once we moved through -- the distress in sovereign trading there'll be some other sector that will come to the forefront and will present unique challenges.

What we're seeing is that as emerging markets grow, even markets like China where we have no direct access, people that are doing business there are having to use more commodities and as they use more commodities they're taking up the concept of hedging around there. So broadly speaking, we've done well because there is growth outside of the West and there is risk outside of the West and people are hedging against that growth. And as you know, more than anyone can, even in economies where there's been economic shrinking, people still hedge because they're really trying to figure out their risk profile. And in many cases, we don't care whether prices are moving up or down. It's hard to put a specific number on it, but you can see the trends in our non-U.S. business which is -- and you can also see our Brent Crude oil, which is a marker for Europe and Asia is outperforming the volume growth of our West Texas intermediate contract which is levered to the United States economy.

And the reason I say that is because long ago, our principal competitor, NYMEX [New York Mercantile Exchange], adopted EFFs [Exchange of Futures for Futures] for look-alike products to us. So this issue was dealt with in energy years ago. And I would say that, that product is probably completely unsuccessful and irrelevant in energy and that's because the market has developed an active position management marketplace that exists between primarily ICE and CME-NYMEX where positions are moved back and forth as needed. We have no barriers that we've put up to allow those positions to move. And I think you can see that there's been tremendous growth in both Energy businesses over the last number of years while that market has become active. I would say just editorially, I think the reason that this is getting a lot of attention is the fact that there seems to be no demand for a moving positions back and forth between those two exchanges. And in other words, regulators would not have to be involved in this discussion at all if there was a demand. These markets will form up and brokers and market makers would be happy to make two-way markets to move positions as they do routinely now in energy. So we agree that with the CFTC that it was improper for the CME to adopt the rule that basically says that any trade done on a competitor is a wash trade. But we also agree with CME that it has an obligation to manage its markets and to make sure that trade in excess [ph] for clearing and puts across its ticker are a price discovery contracts. And so I believe this debate will be settled in the middle, if you will. And last thing, I would say is that part of the good debate that's coming out around financial reform, I think people are understanding that interconnecting clearing houses that are full of trades is no different than interconnecting a series of banks that are full of trades. And that was a bad idea two years ago in the banking sector and it potentially could lead to the same consequence in the exchange sector if we interconnected all of this. So I think there's much more caution on the part of the market now to make sure that trades are properly accounted for, that they've been entered into and in a price discovery manner, that they've been made transparent and that the risk is contained in places that regulators can get their hands on them in the time of crisis."

I think one of the things we've got inside our comp expense is we've got our Broker business. And so frankly, I hope to see comp growth with that because that means our revenue is growing in that business. But based on the assumptions we've got right now for growth in that business and 2010, I think on a normalized basis you should expect comp expense to kind of be in the $57 million to $60 million range a quarter. That obviously assumes that we've got on target performance relative to our bonuses and that's an issue I've touched on as well. Within those bonuses -- to the extent we do outperform, which is what all of us come to work everyday and trying to do, any upside that we have relative to our Board established objectives, which as is typical of every year prior to this require double digit top line and bottom line growth. 85% of every $1 of upside drops straight to the bottom line and the expense we do incur for additional outperformance that goes to employees largely reflect restricted stock unit that are given to employees, which have retention value because they continue to vest. And in addition to that, aligning the employees interest with shareholders because as the stock goes up, they benefit from that as well. So I think on a normalized basis, you'd be looking at somewhere in the $57 million to $60 million range a quarter. And again, our hope is that, that goes up because performance is better than the targeted budget right now. And I think overall, just to kind of put a head on it, expense overall for the year I would expect to be down a little bit on a GAAP basis and even adjusted for the one-time items that we detailed. I wouldn't expect this to have more than 3% to 5% growth on a year-over-year basis. And again as I mentioned, that's going to support double digit top line growth and margin expansion."

And so as we've rolled out new products, as more people want to move to a cleared solution, those trends will help to continue to support our growth. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our Natural Gas business had its best quarter since third quarter of 2008. Again, we've seen the prices move up in natural gas over the past quarter or so and the volatility around larger prices tends to drive larger volumes.

First of all, the debate that's been going on and the really thoughtful process that the CFTC has put in place, which has allowed ample time for input and thought on what should be done. It really has shed the light on the fact that there has not been a speculation problem, which is something that we and our peers have said when we look our own data. And the focus now has changed more to trying to limit concentration in markets, which is much more of a risk management focus than a price discovery focus. And we agree broadly that it's beneficial for exchanges not to have customers that have highly concentrated positions. It's in our exchange collective best interest to have as broader businesses we can with the most customers that we can. So the proposal that's out there now is relatively detailed, we will be making some comments again in the details of how such regulations would and could be implemented, and I expect that we'll be putting and filing input this month.

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. The first quarter of 2010 was ICE's best quarter ever in terms of revenue, volume, operating income and net income. Due to our global positioning and unique business mix, we continue",1473,"Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. The first quarter of 2010 was ICE's best quarter ever in terms of revenue, volume, operating income and net income. Due to our global positioning and unique business mix, we continue to benefit from a number of long-term secular trend. And last Friday, we announced the acquisition of the Climate Exchange, further diversifying our business on a product, geographic and customer basis, while ensuring that the leading emissions market will now be a permanent part of ICE's growth story.
I'd like to begin our discussion on Slide 4, which shows our track record of earnings growth consistency. The revenue in operating income growth we've delivered in each year since 2005 was enabled by our strategic vision and global business model. We've grown revenue by nearly 60% and operating cash by over 7% annually since 2005. And in the first quarter this year, we grew revenues 22%, delivered the highest net margins in our industry and achieved 50% growth in operating cash flow. Our performance continue to distinguish ICE from our peers and demonstrates the value we are creating for shareholders.
Not only have we positioned ourselves to benefit from a number of near- and long-term opportunities, but we've also built a business that is proven able to withstand changes in the business cycle. The result has been industry-leading financial return even as we invest to expand our diverse portfolio of assets. Now let's turn to our first quarter 2010 result on Slide 5.
The first quarter of 2010 represented our sixth consecutive quarter of record quarterly revenue. Our consolidated revenues grew 22% to $282 million over the first quarter of 2009. Net income grew 26% to a record $101 million, and our tax rate for the first quarter was 34%. Diluted earnings per share rose 25% to $1.36.
Moving to Slide 6, I'll detail the components of our revenues and expenses. Starting on the left side of the chart, first quarter transaction and clearing revenues rose 23% to $251 million. This includes $123 million from our Futures segment, $86 million from our OTC Energy business and $43 million from OTC Credit execution and clearing. Market data and other revenue totaled $31 million. 
Shifting to the right side of Slide 6, first quarter operating expenses increased 12% year-to-year compared to adjusted 1Q '09 expenses. Disciplined investment and healthy revenue growth has produced steady increases in our operating margin. Our first quarter operating margin improved at 58% compared to an adjusted 55% in the first quarter of 2009. And our non-brokerage operating margin improved to 67%. We are driving operating efficiency as revenues grow, which translates into improved margin and solid cash generation even as we invest in new businesses. Let's now turn to Slide 7, where I'll detail the first performance of our global Futures business. 
Total Futures revenues were $123 million, up 25% over 1Q '09. Average daily volume was 1.3 million contracts, which was up 28% over last year's first quarter. This record performance was enabled by the continued expansion of our European energy market, as well as the recovery of our agricultural commodity market. As a reminder, last year's first quarter was a record quarter for ICE. Our objective is not to grow every other year, but to consistently deliver growth on top of growth every year.  Continuing that trend, yesterday, we reported a 41% increase in April 2010 average daily volume for ICE's Futures market, including record volumes for ICE Futures Europe. Year-to-date to April, our aggregate Futures average daily volume is up 32%.
Next, on Slide 8, I'll walk through the performance of our OTC business for the first quarter. Total OTC transaction revenue rose 22% to $128 million, our seventh consecutive record quarter. This was largely driven by our OTC Energy market with average daily commissions of $1.4 million, up 27% from 1Q '09. Our OTC oil and power revenues continue to come in at record levels due to strong demand for clearing. This demand for cleared product, coupled with the growing contribution of new products introduced over the past five quarters, has helped us establish an increasingly diverse platform. The first quarter was our strongest quarter in natural gas since 2008. Lower volatility during the quarter was overridden by improved credit condition and a steady return of hedgers to the market. 
Natural gas is a key product for us, and we expect that it will grow over the long term as that market continues to globalize and a number of users for natural gas increase. That being said, in 2007, 73% of our OTC Energy transaction revenues were driven by natural gas. In the first quarter of this year, it comprised 60% of those revenue. 
You can see that the new product roll out over the past 18 months has increased our product diversification. Each of our major OTC Energy market, gas, power and oil, is turning in consistent growth. And in April, our OTC Energy business extended its solid performance with average daily commissions of $1.4 million.
Turning to our CDS business, revenues totaled $43 million during the first quarter, up 13% compared to revenues of $38 million in 1Q '09. This includes $31 million from Creditex and $12 million from ICE's global CDS Clearing business. Creditex's electronic transaction services accounted for 43% of our first quarter Creditex revenue where electronic trade processing continues to yield attractive margin. While growth in the brokerage CDS markets we serve remains muted, we continue to invest in innovative electronic capabilities and drive improved efficiencies, both of which contribute to relatively solid operating margin even in periods of lower revenue. These investments, coupled with our leadership position in U.S. and European index and single-name products, position us well for the eventual improvement of CDS market.
With regard to CDS clearing activity, recent volume has been driven by the launch of single-name CDS contracts, where our customers are moving their existing open interest into our clearing house. Our 2010 guidance anticipated that dynamic, noting the expectation for a gradual ramp in revenues throughout the year, as we expand our product offering, add new customers and work our way through the back-loading of existing trades. 
While bank, which has the natural exposure to CDS, have led the way with clearing, we've also worked closely with our Advisory Committee, made up of representatives from buy-side firms to develop the leading buy-side solution. We expect to launch our European buy-side offering, as well as clearing a sovereign CDS in the near term, subject to regulatory approval.
The CDS market continues to face structural reform, similar to what we saw in the energy market in 2002. Again though, despite being in the early stages of this investment and the challenging market environment, our CDS Clearing business is already contributing to the bottom line. Importantly, this investment positions us not only as the leader in the CDS market, but also strengthened our ability to serve the much broader OTC market as it continues to evolve.
I'm going to wrap up my comments on Slide 9 with an overview of our acquisition of the Climate Exchange, which we announced last week. Due to the U.K. takeover rules, we're precluded for saying much more than what we announced previously. We believe this combination is attractive, both financially and operationally. We offered £7.50 per share or roughly £395 million in total. The transaction will be all cash, including $220 million drawn from our lines of credit and the rest from available cash. 
Notably, even after this transaction, our cash balance will remain above $200 million. We will have over $200 million of available capacity in our lines of credit, and our leverage will remain low. Our valuation focus on the Climate Exchange is well established, market-leading European emissions business and a synergy that we believe exist with the combination of our two firms. We took into account the uncertainty regarding the implementation of the U.S. cap-and-trade program in making the acquisition and considered growth in global emission market as upside opportunity. 
We are confident that the deal will have a negligible impact to earnings for the remainder of this year, a modestly positive impact to 2011, and most importantly, provide another attractive long-term source of growth with attractive financial returns by our shareholders. We look forward to being able to provide more information once the transaction closes this summer. 
I encourage you to refer to this morning's press release for further details on our quarterly performance, as well as a couple of updated guidance points for the balance of 2010. We filed our 10-Q this morning, as well as the new shelf registration to replace the existing shelf, which expires this year. I'll be glad to address your questions during the Q&A. Jeff, over to you."

I'd like to first complete our discussion of the Climate Exchange acquisition, and then I'll update you on our global business by providing some context for the tremendous results that Scott just presented to",1955,"Thank you, Scott, and good morning to you all. I'd like to first complete our discussion of the Climate Exchange acquisition, and then I'll update you on our global business by providing some context for the tremendous results that Scott just presented to you. 
As many of you know, ICE and the Climate Exchange have long been partners. The successful business that Richard Sandor and his team built is the result of a decade of dedicated research, investment and execution on a global scale. This intensive effort has resulted in their being a leader in what is a very competitive space. We began working with the Climate Exchange in 2003 and supported the emergent of this nascent market. We're pleased that we'll be able to continue working with Dr. Sandor, following the close of the transaction. 
Over the past several years, emissions markets have proven to be among the fastest growing, and we believe they continue to hold significant potential over the longer term. For those not familiar with the Climate Exchange's business, it's a leader in the operation of the traded emissions markets. These markets include the European Climate Exchange, the Chicago Climate Exchange and the Chicago Climate Futures Exchange. So the team has established a broad geographic reach and deep market penetration. 
As Scott mentioned, and it's worth highlighting, our acquisition does not represent commentary on climate change policy or the probability of legislation surrounding climate issues. But I'd like to recognize that because of the European Union's emission schemes, which has been implemented in a thoughtful-phased and market-based manner, Europe has established a healthy environment in which these markets have grown and thrived. As the result, European customers, including carbon-intensive industrials, can put a price on carbon relative to other choices as they seek alternative energy solutions in a market-based environment. The addition of emissions markets further diversified our product set and add both an important industrial commercial base in Europe and longer-term exposure to Asia, while it offers us optionality around U.S. market developments. 
This transaction is representative of the deals on which we like to focus, those that provide exposure to global markets with growth potential and those that offer attractive returns on investment. We're committed to executing on opportunities to integrate our companies while we continue to grow the market, and we look forward to reporting back to you on our progress in this regard as soon as possible.
I'd now like to turn back to the discussion of the business that's delivered the results that we presented here today. I'll begin by repeating a question that we've been asked every quarter since our initial public offering in 2005. And that question is, ""Can ICE continue to grow?"" We've shown that the answer to be a consistent yes, and we've taken a deliberate, strategic approach to ensure that we deliver. 
This morning, I'll briefly review a few of our growth drivers and our strategy. If you'll follow me by turning to Slide 10, we've listed some of the basic drivers that we believe define the broad opportunities in the derivatives space. These drivers are long term and secular in nature, and they are the building blocks of an evolving market structure, shaping everything from an addressable market side to the regulatory framework in which markets operate.
First is the sustained role that commodities and derivatives play in global markets. This trend has continued for over a decade, and it's based on two key factors. One is the rising demand for commodities by a steadily growing middle class, and the other is rising demand for tools to hedge or gain exposure to this very phenomenon. Emerging economies cover about half of the world's population, where living standard and the resultant demand for goods are steadily rising. We're seeing this in our commodity markets, but this trend is manifesting itself in a number of ways. 
Anecdotally, in a recent economist article on sugar, it was noted that the increasing wealth in developing countries has raised demand for small luxuries, such as processed foods. As a result, the USDA estimates that worldwide sugar consumption is rising, including a $3 billion pound increase in sugar demand this year alone. Higher living standards translate into greater demand for commodities.
As we've seen, cyclical disruptions in any economy can occur. However, ICE's consistent performance and resiliency through the business cycle resulted from our positioning at the intersection of larger secular trends. The recovery of Western economy should further this upward momentum and provide a tailwind to capital market activities, including our derivatives markets. This year-to-date, a modest increase in confidence and economic recovery has improved market liquidity and driven gains in our commodity volumes.
I want to move on to another multi-year trend that we've spoken about many times, which is the shift towards greater price transparency and clearing. This move shows few signs of abating. The most obvious near-term example is the global financial reform is calling for an increase in market transparency and an increase for the use of clearing. In addition to providing opportunities for our business, we believe the adoption of financial reform will bring important certainty to our markets and to our customers. 
I'd like to point out that we've demonstrated that this transition towards clearing and automation can and have taken place well in advance of legislation. However, we're well positioned to support an expedited market transition due to the technology and clearing assets we own. This leads to a discussion of the tools that we've developed to position ICE at the intersection of secular trends and within this dynamic policy environment.
We believe that these assets are unique to ICE, and a few of these are listed on Slide 10. To our knowledge, no other exchange possesses such a broad range of market infrastructure assets. This include the automation of key over-the-counter processes for both the buy side and the sell side, front and back office connectivity, trade automation and clearing and trade repository capabilities. Most of the new legislative proposals require some or all of these tools to reduce systemic risk. Moreover, the development of these tools provides us with the unique set of assets for leverage as we address new markets. 
The most recent example of our success is in clearing CDS, an initiative of which we are all extremely proud. We continue to invest in building out our OTC Clearing platform, and we have related initiatives underway. We're continuously adding new products, adding new buy-side customers and enhancing our model. As a result, ICE leads the industry on virtually every metric. We've cleared $8 trillion across more than 200 index and single-name contracts that we list in the U.S. and Europe. ICE is supporting evolution in these markets by bringing our solution to existing market structures and then working with market participants to ensure the overall industry benefits from change.
Turning now to Slide 11, I'll touch on our success as an industry consolidator and as an innovator. We employ a rigorous framework for evaluating transactions and delivering on their potential. If you think about the transactions we've completed and the infrastructure we've developed in the past several years, it's difficult for us to identify any one asset that hasn't contributed to the strategic position that ICE has achieved by investing ahead of the curve. Over a decade ago and before the recognition of clearing and electronic trading, we saw an opportunity to transform the energy swaps markets. ICE continues to invest the necessary resources to build our infrastructure to serve these and other swaps markets, which are several times the size of the exchange-traded markets. Our track record in the over-the-counter markets has continued now with our seventh consecutive record revenue quarter.
Turning to Slide 12, you can see our solid diversification across customers, products and geographies as a result of our investments in markets globally. This diversification shows how we've positioned ICE at the center of long-term trends that we've been discussing today. With clearing houses in multiple jurisdictions, serving futures and over-the-counter asset classes, ICE has quickly become one of the new leaders in the provision of risk management and market structure services in innovation, technology and an understanding of our customer requirements.
I'll wrap up on Slide 13 by highlighting how we've positioned the company to capture positive secular trends. The first of these is to ensure that we maintain healthy exposure to areas of market expansion to drive earnings growth. In some cases, this maybe geography or product exposure, as we discussed on last quarter's earnings call with, for example, our oil products being driven by strong demand for energy commodities in Asia. ICE has also demonstrated that its strategy of extending our leadership in helping to organize and standardize global over-the-counter markets. We're leveraging our decade of experience in building out infrastructure to serve OTC markets, and we've demonstrated the growth potential where clearing, transparency, automation and increased regulation has been added. 
Over the past eight years, we took the over-the-counter energy markets from being 2% of contracts cleared to 97% cleared. At the same time, revenues grew six fold, markets recovered and many new products were introduced. The payoff has been larger, safer markets where more trading, and more risk management opportunities exist today than many thought possible just a decade ago.
Technology has been a core asset of ours since our inception. We began with a concept that modern technology, coupled to the Internet, could transform system performance, efficiency and distribution. And today, that's playing out. ICE maintains its multi- year lead in being one of the fastest, most reliable and feature-rich trading platforms. Its flexibility in being delivered over the web enables our markets to be distributed to customers in new geographies quickly and cost efficiently, without the expense that hard-line networks require of our customers.
Conversely for algorithmic customers who co-locate, we've established one of the leading co-location programs, and our technology team works closely with them to ensure that our services are responsive. At less than three milliseconds, our round-trip futures execution times are now twice as fast as our major competitor. This leadership has been driven by our work in translating customer requirements into technology requirements. And finally, our intense focus on technology has enabled us to deliver risk management solutions quickly and effectively. 
In the space of just two years, ICE has leveraged this capability by building two clearing houses, one in the U.S. and one in Europe, both of which have become leaders in their respective markets despite the existence of older and larger competitors. ICE is a growth- and results-focused company. We have a commitment to delivering the products and services that our customers require to manage their businesses, and we have a commitment to shareholders to grow our returns.
We aim to generate double-digit top and bottom line growth over the long run by executing on the items that I've discussed here today: First, growing and developing our existing business while we address new market opportunities; second, we focused on generating operating and capital efficiencies by maintaining expense discipline and generating investment returns that are above our cost of capital; and third, we focus on a culture of integrity, customer service and innovation. If we do these things well, we believe we will continue to outperform. 
Let me say that on behalf of all of my colleagues, I'd like to thank our customers for trusting us with their business last quarter. And again, I want to thank the entire ICE team for their hard work in meeting the objectives that we laid out this quarter. 
I'll turn it now back to April, our operator, to moderate the Q&A session."

And in that regard, I think we're viewing the process in the United States right now for U.S. financial reform to be very dynamic, and we would expect that there will be a lot of amendments that will be dealt with on the floor over the next few weeks and a lot of changes made of the legislation. So we're not necessarily looking at the current drafts in the Senate or the bill that came out of the House as really being the final say on what will happen. That's why, I think, Howard, we made more higher level statements in our prepared remarks that, broadly speaking, the trend is to use more clearing to provide more transparency, potentially pre-trade and then post-trade through trade repositories. And as you know, we have trading platforms in both futures and over-the-counter markets. We have clearing houses in various jurisdiction that serve both futures and over-the-counter markets, and we have the leading energy trade repository in the form of our eConfirm system. So all of that, I think, broadly bodes well. We just shipped a little bit to Europe. The process of adopting financial reform is slightly different. The European Union has been circulating concepts and drafts to build the consensus between the member states with an expectation of trying to pass something by the end of the year. There, we're quite pleased with what we've seen so far. They've started by a look at clearing infrastructure, and they've concluded broadly the same thing that we've concluded, which is that it would be a mistake to interlink derivatives clearing houses. That will be not much different than interlinking a bunch of banks with derivatives on their balance sheet. So those of us that are in the clearing and market structure business have been successful at educating people to make that point. I also think that the Europe is taking a slightly more measured approach than in the U.S., and part of that is just because the process is one of consensus building behind the scene. So I do expect that the European legislation has ultimately passed and U.S. legislation may look slightly different, and that may affect business and where it resides. So we obviously are in a good position since we have a global footprint."

And starting with natural gas, where ICE has been very involved in now about 10 years in the United States, I think we've gotten pretty heavily penetrated. Remember that these are over-the-counter products and they're governed by the CFTC through a regulation of our platform that requires you have at least $100 million in assets or $10 million in net worth to participate. So there is almost no penetration in any kind of retail or even small business desktop, and that's by regulation. These contracts may evolve more into futures like contracts, in which case there would be a tremendous amount of additional penetration possibility in terms of sheer numbers as we move into smaller entities. In electric power, in the U.S., that is really a merchants market. It's a utility market. We don't really have algorithmic traders in there yet. We certainly don't have retail or even small business. It's a young market because the U.S. power markets are just deregulating and still in a multi-decade process of that. In the oil markets, the penetration is very, very small. The oil markets have not, in the past, really focused much on credit because they involve large sovereign countries and large global energy firms and global banks. And so credit up until this recent crisis had not been an issue. You're seeing that the techniques of using clearing as credit amelioration is now coming into vogue in that market, and we're very, very early. And then if I look at Europe and Asia, on the regional products there, gas and power and coal and other related things, it's very, very young. So a long-winded way of saying we tried to say in our prepared remarks that we positioned ourselves at what we believe is the early stage of a very long term and very global trend for growth in using energy commodities as hedging tools."

And we continue to see strong demand as we have now for many, many years in requesting new user IDs and passwords. But that's about the best we can do. I think, really, it is the stepping back in looking at the less granular aspects of where we've positioned the company that I think is hard for people to understand sometimes. And that is that, unlike a lot of other exchanges around the world that are centered around equities or interest rates or financial products that tend to be local to that country or region, we built a business that's tried to pick the products that we think are the most global. Energy is an obvious one. It's traded in dollars. In every country, it's denominated in dollars primarily for oil 24 hours a day. So it has become a truly global franchise. And I believe that agriculture, particularly the kind of ags that we have, which are coffee, cocoa, cotton, the things that are not necessarily U.S.-centric or growth drivers. And I believe that some of the over-the-counter markets, particular credit, I think there will be -- because of inter-connectivity of the world, people are going to have credit exposure to corporations that are outside of their region. And I think credit is an asset class. That is a nascent asset class that will grow. And while the form of credit default swap that we're trading today may be materially different in the future, I do think that there's a fundamental reason for global credit to be traded. And that's really why we've outperformed. We're not as levered to the regional products as many of our peers."

I think there is efficiency opportunity around the CDS clearing initiative. And we had about $10 million in expense in the fourth quarter. We had around $9 million in the first quarter. That still has a fairly heavy professional services component to it as we continue through the start-up phase and the negotiation, finalizing the negotiation around some of our agreements.

Now if you kind of look back over to the past year or so, we have made a few million dollars in the business. I think the improvement you saw in the first quarter is similar to what I had projected coming out in the fourth quarter, which is we were very much in investment phase in that business. We're still in the investment phase, but we're now starting to be able to shed some of the legal expenses, to shed some of the consulting expenses, et cetera, that were in place as we built the business. So we did see a tick up in revenue from fourth quarter to first quarter which was good and helped the profit. But I think more importantly, we're starting to be able to shed some of those startup expenses, and I think you should expect that trend to continue as we move into the second quarter and certainly into the back half of the year."

The commodity markets, which include our energy markets and other similar markets, like metals and physical delivered commodities, the marketplace 10 years ago recognized that there was no true buy side or sell side. It was a many-to-many market even when it was on the telephone. And as a result, our energy markets in the over-the-counter space look a lot like futures markets. And you can see when we publish the breakdown of those markets of who is actually pushing the button and accessing the screen and it's heavy, heavy concentration by the commercial users that are executing on their own behalf. That's different than financial over-the-counter markets where there's a true buy side and sell side. And it's partly why when we decided to go into CDS and try to tackle clearing for over-the-counter financial products, we decided to do that in a separate clearing house, because I really believe that the infrastructure around that clearing house is going to evolve. It may ultimately look like futures, but right now, it doesn't. So one of the things that's going and the reason that Scott alluded the fact there's heavy professional service fees right now is there is a transition from the sell side, which acted as a prime broker, to some model where they're going to be providing clearing services. And the question is, is it going to be a futures-style clearing service where basically customers post collateral in the form of cash, and are mark-to-market in cash everyday? Or is there going to be some hybrid where customers post other kinds of assets to their prime brokers who then will basically lend against those and convert those to cash so that the clearing house can always be holding in cash? And what you're seeing right now is that transition, and I think the premise of your question alluded to your picking up on some of that. There are some broker dealers that would prefer to move quickly to a futures-style model. There are some broker dealers that would prefer to stay a more prime brokerage model. And I think if you were to really penetrate that, it depends on what assets and client bases and history those individual companies have. So as a result of that, I think we're going to end up with a hybrid, and that's partly why we've been doing well in CDS clearing is that we've respected that model and we've been evolving around it and having to work with regulators to do a lot of messaging on how we transition from what is currently on the books to where we think ultimately regulators want to take this."

So we think that, well, regulators may put that into the statue, it's already happened in that regard. In energy, we take trades from brokers and other people as does our competitor. Many, many people have tried to launch electronic platforms including our main competitor and some of the large brokers. Because the over-the-counter energy market and commodity market are so broad and so interrelated and so diverse with no one group of customers that dominate the business, no one has been able to do that just because of the network effect. So unlike equities, which a lot of people think about when we talk about open clearing, which where most order flow goes through a handful of brokers and a small number then of algorithmic traders that are playing in that market. You don't have that phenomenon in Energy. So we really have an open clearing house again and we've been growing. I think the main thrust is that it's been important for us to get into the Clearing business and control the technology, the risk management, and the processes in there.

So there's an extension of banking functionality and other parts around the clearing house. That's a great thing about getting into these emerging markets. They take you somewhere.

So I think it's 50,000 feet. You'd say that, that business is there. And regardless of what in the U.S. our Congress may do to restructure where that business goes, it does seem like it's a fundamental need that will be met. And it's amazing we even got people like Warren Buffett, who talk about derivatives as being potentially dangerous with quiet portfolio  derivatives. They've really, they really expand it through corporate America. ICE itself uses derivatives to hedge our foreign currency risks now routinely. So I just think that the demand for derivatives is bigger than the market participants right now."

If you adjust the comp and benefit, it's actually up 12% year-to-year, if you adjust for the severance payments that we made in the first quarter of last year. So comp was up in line with our total expense growth at 12%. And that is reflective of us growing from headcount as we continue to invest in our new initiative and our technology. The reason it's growing slower than revenue is because that's how we manage the business. We've committed to growing and expanding our margin, and so we literally, Jeff and Chuck and I spent time every quarter going to every single hire that we're going to do in the business and looking at where that hire is going and whether or not it's a hire we need to make. And so I think the comp expense, if you back up the $3 million from last year the 12% growth is wide inline with what you'd expect  from a company growing over 20% and committed to expanding margin."

And again, just to fuel back the covers a little bit further, the decline you saw year-over-year in the Creditex revenues was a 100% related to fewer credit events, less compression and less of the DNA offerings that we have last year. And again, if you go back to a year ago, we're coming out of the credit prices, we're having default, we get paid to do that. The compression is largely now irrelevant because of clearing, but that decline is solely due to that. If you then fuel back another step further, our U.S. index and single-name business is combined, we're up about 25% year-over-year. Our index and single-name in Europe was down a little bit. But overall, index and single-name, which is the area where we're focused, was up 8% on a year-over-year basis. So we are investing. What we're not doing is we're not going out and just hiring bodies to deliver revenue. We're focused on generating revenue at expense ratios that are closer to 60%, not the 70%. You see it in some of our competitors. We're focused on revenues that deliver double-digit operating margins as opposed to single-digit margins. So we are making the investment that we need to grow, as Jeff alluded to earlier, in the more liquid products where we see the opportunity for more future growth in demand, but we're doing that investment, and I would characterize it as a different manner in the Broker business."

All of the kinds of things you're alluding to would have to then be taken up by regulators as to figure out some kind of rule making or policies on how these things would be implemented.

You see huge initiatives going on to get interest rate swaps into clearing, and so the neat thing about market, and particularly we're well positioned being relatively small and flexible and dynamic, if these things are going to be in place, I think, before regulators really do. I mean, there was an earlier question about the Chicago Climate Exchange, which is a voluntary carbon market, which has unbelievable pedigree in terms of the companies that are participating in that. They're doing that voluntarily, because they want to build domain knowledge, they want to build infrastructure, they want a price carbon before Congress does so that they can get a sense on what it will do to their businesses. So it's amazing to watch markets, and so I think that's why we're building things now and there's a lot going on to position ourselves, because I do believe that this is going to happen quite quickly."

There are in Europe, there are many competitors, and Climate Exchange has emerged as the clear leader. To give you a sense, I think their complex has about, in total, has about 850,000 contracts in open interests. That's about the same amount of Brent oil that we have. So it has grown quickly in Europe and has a very large footprint. And we've been a partner with them, and one of the reasons that we've made a good partner is that ICE is really one of the dominant venues for trading electric power, and some of the industries most affected by carbon climate trading is the electric power industry. We have those people already in our clearing house. We have money on deposit by these people, and we're in a good position now that we control clearing to use technology to give offset against the carbon versus electric energy, coal and other related materials. In the U.S., we are the dominant player in electric power. We probably have at least a 90% market share, I would think, in electric power trading. Recall that where I came out of the electric power industry and as Chuck Vice. And when we started the company really focused on that. So it's long been at our core. And so I would anticipate that we haven't -- we already have the major industrials trading voluntary relationships with those people. We are the dominant place for clearing the regional greenhouse gas initiatives that go on in various parts of the U.S. So we're very well positioned if there is U.S. regulation for some kind of cap-and-trade, but beyond that, it's a natural fit for the current product suite that we have."

First of all, the power industry is in a long-term deregulation phase. And what is helping drive the growth of trading is public utility commission that hold their local utility accountable for increasing fuel than other expenses and don't let them pass 100% through to the rate payers. That one fact then causes utilities and others need to hedge, drives them into the gas and coal markets, but also into the power market. And broadly speaking, we're seeing a movement that we were somewhat involved with of moving away from trading physical power to trading financially settled power, and that trend is happened over the last decade. Again, by trading financially settled power, it allows market participants outside of NERC region to take economic exposure to the price of powers. It's still a nascent market in a sense that it is very, very volatile. It's kind of a big boys' market. We have specifically not allowed a lot of algorithmic traders in there. We have specifically not allowed smaller entities in there out of concern that you really need to understand the dynamics of power market, because they are so volatile. And at the core is this fact that if there is a localized brownout or blackout, the local utility will pay almost any amount of money for short-term power to cover that consequence, because it is not acceptable in our society to go without power even for a minute. So it becomes incredibly volatile to the upside, and as such, we sort of bring people in with a lot of education in a bit of a metered way. I think that's one of our fastest growing products, and it's still quite nascent, and we haven't really seen Europe and Asia adapt to trading power. It's still quite localized, quite physical and quite dominated by regional utilities outside the U.S. So I think there is potential globally for the growth of power that will happen over the next decade or more."

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. The first quarter of 2010 was ICE's best quarter ever in terms of revenue, volume, operating income and net income.

The first quarter of 2010 was ICE's best quarter ever in terms of revenue, volume, operating income and net income. Due to our global positioning and unique business mix, we continue to benefit from a number of long-term secular trend. And last Friday, we announced the acquisition of the Climate Exchange, further diversifying our business on a product, geographic and customer basis, while ensuring that the leading emissions market will now be a permanent part of ICE's growth story.
I'd like to begin our discussion on Slide 4, which shows our track record of earnings growth consistency. The revenue in operating income growth we've delivered in each year since 2005 was enabled by our strategic vision and global business model. We've grown revenue by nearly 60% and operating cash by over 7% annually since 2005. And in the first quarter this year, we grew revenues 22%, delivered the highest net margins in our industry and achieved 50% growth in operating cash flow. Our performance continue to distinguish ICE from our peers and demonstrates the value we are creating for shareholders.
Not only have we positioned ourselves to benefit from a number of near- and long-term opportunities, but we've also built a business that is proven able to withstand changes in the business cycle. The result has been industry-leading financial return even as we invest to expand our diverse portfolio of assets. Now let's turn to our first quarter 2010 result on Slide 5.
The first quarter of 2010 represented our sixth consecutive quarter of record quarterly revenue. Our consolidated revenues grew 22% to $282 million over the first quarter of 2009. Net income grew 26% to a record $101 million, and our tax rate for the first quarter was 34%. Diluted earnings per share rose 25% to $1.36.
Moving to Slide 6, I'll detail the components of our revenues and expenses. Starting on the left side of the chart, first quarter transaction and clearing revenues rose 23% to $251 million. This includes $123 million from our Futures segment, $86 million from our OTC Energy business and $43 million from OTC Credit execution and clearing. Market data and other revenue totaled $31 million. 
Shifting to the right side of Slide 6, first quarter operating expenses increased 12% year-to-year compared to adjusted 1Q '09 expenses. Disciplined investment and healthy revenue growth has produced steady increases in our operating margin. Our first quarter operating margin improved at 58% compared to an adjusted 55% in the first quarter of 2009. And our non-brokerage operating margin improved to 67%. We are driving operating efficiency as revenues grow, which translates into improved margin and solid cash generation even as we invest in new businesses. Let's now turn to Slide 7, where I'll detail the first performance of our global Futures business. 
Total Futures revenues were $123 million, up 25% over 1Q '09. Average daily volume was 1.3 million contracts, which was up 28% over last year's first quarter. This record performance was enabled by the continued expansion of our European energy market, as well as the recovery of our agricultural commodity market. As a reminder, last year's first quarter was a record quarter for ICE. Our objective is not to grow every other year, but to consistently deliver growth on top of growth every year.  Continuing that trend, yesterday, we reported a 41% increase in April 2010 average daily volume for ICE's Futures market, including record volumes for ICE Futures Europe. Year-to-date to April, our aggregate Futures average daily volume is up 32%.
Next, on Slide 8, I'll walk through the performance of our OTC business for the first quarter. Total OTC transaction revenue rose 22% to $128 million, our seventh consecutive record quarter. This was largely driven by our OTC Energy market with average daily commissions of $1.4 million, up 27% from 1Q '09. Our OTC oil and power revenues continue to come in at record levels due to strong demand for clearing. This demand for cleared product, coupled with the growing contribution of new products introduced over the past five quarters, has helped us establish an increasingly diverse platform. The first quarter was our strongest quarter in natural gas since 2008. Lower volatility during the quarter was overridden by improved credit condition and a steady return of hedgers to the market. 
Natural gas is a key product for us, and we expect that it will grow over the long term as that market continues to globalize and a number of users for natural gas increase. That being said, in 2007, 73% of our OTC Energy transaction revenues were driven by natural gas. In the first quarter of this year, it comprised 60% of those revenue. 
You can see that the new product roll out over the past 18 months has increased our product diversification. Each of our major OTC Energy market, gas, power and oil, is turning in consistent growth. And in April, our OTC Energy business extended its solid performance with average daily commissions of $1.4 million.
Turning to our CDS business, revenues totaled $43 million during the first quarter, up 13% compared to revenues of $38 million in 1Q '09. This includes $31 million from Creditex and $12 million from ICE's global CDS Clearing business. Creditex's electronic transaction services accounted for 43% of our first quarter Creditex revenue where electronic trade processing continues to yield attractive margin. While growth in the brokerage CDS markets we serve remains muted, we continue to invest in innovative electronic capabilities and drive improved efficiencies, both of which contribute to relatively solid operating margin even in periods of lower revenue. These investments, coupled with our leadership position in U.S. and European index and single-name products, position us well for the eventual improvement of CDS market.
With regard to CDS clearing activity, recent volume has been driven by the launch of single-name CDS contracts, where our customers are moving their existing open interest into our clearing house. Our 2010 guidance anticipated that dynamic, noting the expectation for a gradual ramp in revenues throughout the year, as we expand our product offering, add new customers and work our way through the back-loading of existing trades. 
While bank, which has the natural exposure to CDS, have led the way with clearing, we've also worked closely with our Advisory Committee, made up of representatives from buy-side firms to develop the leading buy-side solution. We expect to launch our European buy-side offering, as well as clearing a sovereign CDS in the near term, subject to regulatory approval.
The CDS market continues to face structural reform, similar to what we saw in the energy market in 2002. Again though, despite being in the early stages of this investment and the challenging market environment, our CDS Clearing business is already contributing to the bottom line. Importantly, this investment positions us not only as the leader in the CDS market, but also strengthened our ability to serve the much broader OTC market as it continues to evolve.
I'm going to wrap up my comments on Slide 9 with an overview of our acquisition of the Climate Exchange, which we announced last week. Due to the U.K. takeover rules, we're precluded for saying much more than what we announced previously. We believe this combination is attractive, both financially and operationally. We offered £7.50 per share or roughly £395 million in total. The transaction will be all cash, including $220 million drawn from our lines of credit and the rest from available cash. 
Notably, even after this transaction, our cash balance will remain above $200 million. We will have over $200 million of available capacity in our lines of credit, and our leverage will remain low. Our valuation focus on the Climate Exchange is well established, market-leading European emissions business and a synergy that we believe exist with the combination of our two firms. We took into account the uncertainty regarding the implementation of the U.S. cap-and-trade program in making the acquisition and considered growth in global emission market as upside opportunity. 
We are confident that the deal will have a negligible impact to earnings for the remainder of this year, a modestly positive impact to 2011, and most importantly, provide another attractive long-term source of growth with attractive financial returns by our shareholders. We look forward to being able to provide more information once the transaction closes this summer. 
I encourage you to refer to this morning's press release for further details on our quarterly performance, as well as a couple of updated guidance points for the balance of 2010. We filed our 10-Q this morning, as well as the new shelf registration to replace the existing shelf, which expires this year. I'll be glad to address your questions during the Q&A. Jeff, over to you.

I'd like to first complete our discussion of the Climate Exchange acquisition, and then I'll update you on our global business by providing some context for the tremendous results that Scott just presented to you. 
As many of you know, ICE and the Climate Exchange have long been partners. The successful business that Richard Sandor and his team built is the result of a decade of dedicated research, investment and execution on a global scale. This intensive effort has resulted in their being a leader in what is a very competitive space. We began working with the Climate Exchange in 2003 and supported the emergent of this nascent market. We're pleased that we'll be able to continue working with Dr. Sandor, following the close of the transaction. 
Over the past several years, emissions markets have proven to be among the fastest growing, and we believe they continue to hold significant potential over the longer term. For those not familiar with the Climate Exchange's business, it's a leader in the operation of the traded emissions markets. These markets include the European Climate Exchange, the Chicago Climate Exchange and the Chicago Climate Futures Exchange. So the team has established a broad geographic reach and deep market penetration. 
As Scott mentioned, and it's worth highlighting, our acquisition does not represent commentary on climate change policy or the probability of legislation surrounding climate issues. But I'd like to recognize that because of the European Union's emission schemes, which has been implemented in a thoughtful-phased and market-based manner, Europe has established a healthy environment in which these markets have grown and thrived. As the result, European customers, including carbon-intensive industrials, can put a price on carbon relative to other choices as they seek alternative energy solutions in a market-based environment. The addition of emissions markets further diversified our product set and add both an important industrial commercial base in Europe and longer-term exposure to Asia, while it offers us optionality around U.S. market developments. 
This transaction is representative of the deals on which we like to focus, those that provide exposure to global markets with growth potential and those that offer attractive returns on investment. We're committed to executing on opportunities to integrate our companies while we continue to grow the market, and we look forward to reporting back to you on our progress in this regard as soon as possible.
I'd now like to turn back to the discussion of the business that's delivered the results that we presented here today. I'll begin by repeating a question that we've been asked every quarter since our initial public offering in 2005. And that question is, ""Can ICE continue to grow?"" We've shown that the answer to be a consistent yes, and we've taken a deliberate, strategic approach to ensure that we deliver. 
This morning, I'll briefly review a few of our growth drivers and our strategy. If you'll follow me by turning to Slide 10, we've listed some of the basic drivers that we believe define the broad opportunities in the derivatives space. These drivers are long term and secular in nature, and they are the building blocks of an evolving market structure, shaping everything from an addressable market side to the regulatory framework in which markets operate.
First is the sustained role that commodities and derivatives play in global markets. This trend has continued for over a decade, and it's based on two key factors. One is the rising demand for commodities by a steadily growing middle class, and the other is rising demand for tools to hedge or gain exposure to this very phenomenon. Emerging economies cover about half of the world's population, where living standard and the resultant demand for goods are steadily rising. We're seeing this in our commodity markets, but this trend is manifesting itself in a number of ways. 
Anecdotally, in a recent economist article on sugar, it was noted that the increasing wealth in developing countries has raised demand for small luxuries, such as processed foods. As a result, the USDA estimates that worldwide sugar consumption is rising, including a $3 billion pound increase in sugar demand this year alone. Higher living standards translate into greater demand for commodities.
As we've seen, cyclical disruptions in any economy can occur. However, ICE's consistent performance and resiliency through the business cycle resulted from our positioning at the intersection of larger secular trends. The recovery of Western economy should further this upward momentum and provide a tailwind to capital market activities, including our derivatives markets. This year-to-date, a modest increase in confidence and economic recovery has improved market liquidity and driven gains in our commodity volumes.
I want to move on to another multi-year trend that we've spoken about many times, which is the shift towards greater price transparency and clearing. This move shows few signs of abating. The most obvious near-term example is the global financial reform is calling for an increase in market transparency and an increase for the use of clearing. In addition to providing opportunities for our business, we believe the adoption of financial reform will bring important certainty to our markets and to our customers. 
I'd like to point out that we've demonstrated that this transition towards clearing and automation can and have taken place well in advance of legislation. However, we're well positioned to support an expedited market transition due to the technology and clearing assets we own. This leads to a discussion of the tools that we've developed to position ICE at the intersection of secular trends and within this dynamic policy environment.
We believe that these assets are unique to ICE, and a few of these are listed on Slide 10. To our knowledge, no other exchange possesses such a broad range of market infrastructure assets. This include the automation of key over-the-counter processes for both the buy side and the sell side, front and back office connectivity, trade automation and clearing and trade repository capabilities. Most of the new legislative proposals require some or all of these tools to reduce systemic risk. Moreover, the development of these tools provides us with the unique set of assets for leverage as we address new markets. 
The most recent example of our success is in clearing CDS, an initiative of which we are all extremely proud. We continue to invest in building out our OTC Clearing platform, and we have related initiatives underway. We're continuously adding new products, adding new buy-side customers and enhancing our model. As a result, ICE leads the industry on virtually every metric. We've cleared $8 trillion across more than 200 index and single-name contracts that we list in the U.S. and Europe. ICE is supporting evolution in these markets by bringing our solution to existing market structures and then working with market participants to ensure the overall industry benefits from change.
Turning now to Slide 11, I'll touch on our success as an industry consolidator and as an innovator. We employ a rigorous framework for evaluating transactions and delivering on their potential. If you think about the transactions we've completed and the infrastructure we've developed in the past several years, it's difficult for us to identify any one asset that hasn't contributed to the strategic position that ICE has achieved by investing ahead of the curve. Over a decade ago and before the recognition of clearing and electronic trading, we saw an opportunity to transform the energy swaps markets. ICE continues to invest the necessary resources to build our infrastructure to serve these and other swaps markets, which are several times the size of the exchange-traded markets. Our track record in the over-the-counter markets has continued now with our seventh consecutive record revenue quarter.
Turning to Slide 12, you can see our solid diversification across customers, products and geographies as a result of our investments in markets globally. This diversification shows how we've positioned ICE at the center of long-term trends that we've been discussing today. With clearing houses in multiple jurisdictions, serving futures and over-the-counter asset classes, ICE has quickly become one of the new leaders in the provision of risk management and market structure services in innovation, technology and an understanding of our customer requirements.
I'll wrap up on Slide 13 by highlighting how we've positioned the company to capture positive secular trends. The first of these is to ensure that we maintain healthy exposure to areas of market expansion to drive earnings growth. In some cases, this maybe geography or product exposure, as we discussed on last quarter's earnings call with, for example, our oil products being driven by strong demand for energy commodities in Asia. ICE has also demonstrated that its strategy of extending our leadership in helping to organize and standardize global over-the-counter markets. We're leveraging our decade of experience in building out infrastructure to serve OTC markets, and we've demonstrated the growth potential where clearing, transparency, automation and increased regulation has been added. 
Over the past eight years, we took the over-the-counter energy markets from being 2% of contracts cleared to 97% cleared. At the same time, revenues grew six fold, markets recovered and many new products were introduced. The payoff has been larger, safer markets where more trading, and more risk management opportunities exist today than many thought possible just a decade ago.
Technology has been a core asset of ours since our inception. We began with a concept that modern technology, coupled to the Internet, could transform system performance, efficiency and distribution. And today, that's playing out. ICE maintains its multi- year lead in being one of the fastest, most reliable and feature-rich trading platforms. Its flexibility in being delivered over the web enables our markets to be distributed to customers in new geographies quickly and cost efficiently, without the expense that hard-line networks require of our customers.
Conversely for algorithmic customers who co-locate, we've established one of the leading co-location programs, and our technology team works closely with them to ensure that our services are responsive. At less than three milliseconds, our round-trip futures execution times are now twice as fast as our major competitor. This leadership has been driven by our work in translating customer requirements into technology requirements. And finally, our intense focus on technology has enabled us to deliver risk management solutions quickly and effectively. 
In the space of just two years, ICE has leveraged this capability by building two clearing houses, one in the U.S. and one in Europe, both of which have become leaders in their respective markets despite the existence of older and larger competitors. ICE is a growth- and results-focused company. We have a commitment to delivering the products and services that our customers require to manage their businesses, and we have a commitment to shareholders to grow our returns.
We aim to generate double-digit top and bottom line growth over the long run by executing on the items that I've discussed here today: First, growing and developing our existing business while we address new market opportunities; second, we focused on generating operating and capital efficiencies by maintaining expense discipline and generating investment returns that are above our cost of capital; and third, we focus on a culture of integrity, customer service and innovation. If we do these things well, we believe we will continue to outperform. 
Let me say that on behalf of all of my colleagues, I'd like to thank our customers for trusting us with their business last quarter. And again, I want to thank the entire ICE team for their hard work in meeting the objectives that we laid out this quarter. 
I'll turn it now back to April, our operator, to moderate the Q&A session.

And in that regard, I think we're viewing the process in the United States right now for U.S. financial reform to be very dynamic, and we would expect that there will be a lot of amendments that will be dealt with on the floor over the next few weeks and a lot of changes made of the legislation. So we're not necessarily looking at the current drafts in the Senate or the bill that came out of the House as really being the final say on what will happen. That's why, I think, Howard, we made more higher level statements in our prepared remarks that, broadly speaking, the trend is to use more clearing to provide more transparency, potentially pre-trade and then post-trade through trade repositories. And as you know, we have trading platforms in both futures and over-the-counter markets. We have clearing houses in various jurisdiction that serve both futures and over-the-counter markets, and we have the leading energy trade repository in the form of our eConfirm system. So all of that, I think, broadly bodes well. We just shipped a little bit to Europe. The process of adopting financial reform is slightly different. The European Union has been circulating concepts and drafts to build the consensus between the member states with an expectation of trying to pass something by the end of the year. There, we're quite pleased with what we've seen so far. They've started by a look at clearing infrastructure, and they've concluded broadly the same thing that we've concluded, which is that it would be a mistake to interlink derivatives clearing houses. That will be not much different than interlinking a bunch of banks with derivatives on their balance sheet. So those of us that are in the clearing and market structure business have been successful at educating people to make that point. I also think that the Europe is taking a slightly more measured approach than in the U.S., and part of that is just because the process is one of consensus building behind the scene. So I do expect that the European legislation has ultimately passed and U.S. legislation may look slightly different, and that may affect business and where it resides. So we obviously are in a good position since we have a global footprint.

And starting with natural gas, where ICE has been very involved in now about 10 years in the United States, I think we've gotten pretty heavily penetrated. Remember that these are over-the-counter products and they're governed by the CFTC through a regulation of our platform that requires you have at least $100 million in assets or $10 million in net worth to participate. So there is almost no penetration in any kind of retail or even small business desktop, and that's by regulation. These contracts may evolve more into futures like contracts, in which case there would be a tremendous amount of additional penetration possibility in terms of sheer numbers as we move into smaller entities. In electric power, in the U.S., that is really a merchants market. It's a utility market. We don't really have algorithmic traders in there yet. We certainly don't have retail or even small business. It's a young market because the U.S. power markets are just deregulating and still in a multi-decade process of that. In the oil markets, the penetration is very, very small. The oil markets have not, in the past, really focused much on credit because they involve large sovereign countries and large global energy firms and global banks. And so credit up until this recent crisis had not been an issue. You're seeing that the techniques of using clearing as credit amelioration is now coming into vogue in that market, and we're very, very early. And then if I look at Europe and Asia, on the regional products there, gas and power and coal and other related things, it's very, very young. So a long-winded way of saying we tried to say in our prepared remarks that we positioned ourselves at what we believe is the early stage of a very long term and very global trend for growth in using energy commodities as hedging tools.

I think, really, it is the stepping back in looking at the less granular aspects of where we've positioned the company that I think is hard for people to understand sometimes. And that is that, unlike a lot of other exchanges around the world that are centered around equities or interest rates or financial products that tend to be local to that country or region, we built a business that's tried to pick the products that we think are the most global. Energy is an obvious one. It's traded in dollars. In every country, it's denominated in dollars primarily for oil 24 hours a day. So it has become a truly global franchise. And I believe that agriculture, particularly the kind of ags that we have, which are coffee, cocoa, cotton, the things that are not necessarily U.S.-centric or growth drivers. And I believe that some of the over-the-counter markets, particular credit, I think there will be -- because of inter-connectivity of the world, people are going to have credit exposure to corporations that are outside of their region. And I think credit is an asset class. That is a nascent asset class that will grow. And while the form of credit default swap that we're trading today may be materially different in the future, I do think that there's a fundamental reason for global credit to be traded. And that's really why we've outperformed. We're not as levered to the regional products as many of our peers.

The tick down of fourth quarter to 1Q really had more to do with the fourth quarter than anything else. As you guys know, we did our bonus true up at the end of last year and had a few other anomalies. From a first quarter standpoint, I think expense came in at levels that if you look at it at a run rate, that's probably not a bad way to look at it. I think there is efficiency opportunity around the CDS clearing initiative. And we had about $10 million in expense in the fourth quarter. We had around $9 million in the first quarter. That still has a fairly heavy professional services component to it as we continue through the start-up phase and the negotiation, finalizing the negotiation around some of our agreements. So I think there's opportunity for improvement there. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we clearly think there are opportunities for synergies in the Climate Exchange, and we'll give you much more guidance and more detailed guidance on that once we get that deal closed. But look, I think the thing that's impressive about the quarter is our margins at 58% are now back to virtually in line with the other big competitor we've got in this space, and that's an all-in margin. Our margin, excluding that Brokerage business, is at 67%. So we continue to focus very much on our expense and our margin, even as we do make some substantial investments in building businesses.

The commodity markets, which include our energy markets and other similar markets, like metals and physical delivered commodities, the marketplace 10 years ago recognized that there was no true buy side or sell side. It was a many-to-many market even when it was on the telephone. And as a result, our energy markets in the over-the-counter space look a lot like futures markets. And you can see when we publish the breakdown of those markets of who is actually pushing the button and accessing the screen and it's heavy, heavy concentration by the commercial users that are executing on their own behalf. That's different than financial over-the-counter markets where there's a true buy side and sell side. And it's partly why when we decided to go into CDS and try to tackle clearing for over-the-counter financial products, we decided to do that in a separate clearing house, because I really believe that the infrastructure around that clearing house is going to evolve. It may ultimately look like futures, but right now, it doesn't. So one of the things that's going and the reason that Scott alluded the fact there's heavy professional service fees right now is there is a transition from the sell side, which acted as a prime broker, to some model where they're going to be providing clearing services. And the question is, is it going to be a futures-style clearing service where basically customers post collateral in the form of cash, and are mark-to-market in cash everyday? Or is there going to be some hybrid where customers post other kinds of assets to their prime brokers who then will basically lend against those and convert those to cash so that the clearing house can always be holding in cash? And what you're seeing right now is that transition, and I think the premise of your question alluded to your picking up on some of that. There are some broker dealers that would prefer to move quickly to a futures-style model. There are some broker dealers that would prefer to stay a more prime brokerage model. And I think if you were to really penetrate that, it depends on what assets and client bases and history those individual companies have. So as a result of that, I think we're going to end up with a hybrid, and that's partly why we've been doing well in CDS clearing is that we've respected that model and we've been evolving around it and having to work with regulators to do a lot of messaging on how we transition from what is currently on the books to where we think ultimately regulators want to take this.

So we think that, well, regulators may put that into the statue, it's already happened in that regard. In energy, we take trades from brokers and other people as does our competitor. Many, many people have tried to launch electronic platforms including our main competitor and some of the large brokers. Because the over-the-counter energy market and commodity market are so broad and so interrelated and so diverse with no one group of customers that dominate the business, no one has been able to do that just because of the network effect. So unlike equities, which a lot of people think about when we talk about open clearing, which where most order flow goes through a handful of brokers and a small number then of algorithmic traders that are playing in that market. You don't have that phenomenon in Energy. So we really have an open clearing house again and we've been growing. I think the main thrust is that it's been important for us to get into the Clearing business and control the technology, the risk management, and the processes in there.

Because there was market volatility, somebody was a winner and loser under a long-term agreement. So there's a trend towards moving to shorter-term agreements with more market-based pricing structures. And that's why we've launched the contract. It's still a heavily brokered kind of contract. It's not a two-way bid offer market yet, and I suspect it will be that for a while, while the market itself changes. But we want that market to grow up immediately using clearing.

You pretty quickly rolled into single-names. Now that the market is pushing us to clear sovereign CDS, as you can imagine, to net down those positions and show the true exposure to regulators. So even in CDS, the market keeps taking us in the new areas where we really didn't even anticipate six or eight months ago. And the kinds of things that the market is asking us to do just in the credit space continues to broaden. You can even take my earlier comments, which is the clearing house itself is being involved in a market structure on how the prime Brokerage business will work, how collateral will be held, how money will be earned on collateral and other things. So there's an extension of banking functionality and other parts around the clearing house. That's a great thing about getting into these emerging markets. They take you somewhere. I use the analogy all the time that you kind of jump into a stream and the current will take you somewhere. But it's important to get into the stream, and that's where we are. Beyond that, I'd rather not speculate.

Anything outside of that, we would view as upside opportunity and opportunity to deliver even more value to our shareholders. What I can tell you, because it's publicly available, is OI and volumes in the first quarter of this year grew well in the European business. And then April, volumes were actually about 60% to 70% higher than the run rate of volumes in the first quarter. And all of this is in advance of emission credits, which today are freely provided going out to the bid process in the future. So again, the valuation focus on the European business, it focused on the synergies that we can deliver. Current indications on actual result as announced by the Climate Exchange for the European business have been solid and then April improved significantly.

The reason it's growing slower than revenue is because that's how we manage the business.

And again, just to fuel back the covers a little bit further, the decline you saw year-over-year in the Creditex revenues was a 100% related to fewer credit events, less compression and less of the DNA offerings that we have last year. And again, if you go back to a year ago, we're coming out of the credit prices, we're having default, we get paid to do that. The compression is largely now irrelevant because of clearing, but that decline is solely due to that. If you then fuel back another step further, our U.S. index and single-name business is combined, we're up about 25% year-over-year. Our index and single-name in Europe was down a little bit. But overall, index and single-name, which is the area where we're focused, was up 8% on a year-over-year basis. So we are investing. What we're not doing is we're not going out and just hiring bodies to deliver revenue. We're focused on generating revenue at expense ratios that are closer to 60%, not the 70%. You see it in some of our competitors. We're focused on revenues that deliver double-digit operating margins as opposed to single-digit margins. So we are making the investment that we need to grow, as Jeff alluded to earlier, in the more liquid products where we see the opportunity for more future growth in demand, but we're doing that investment, and I would characterize it as a different manner in the Broker business.

To give you a sense, I think their complex has about, in total, has about 850,000 contracts in open interests. That's about the same amount of Brent oil that we have. So it has grown quickly in Europe and has a very large footprint. And we've been a partner with them, and one of the reasons that we've made a good partner is that ICE is really one of the dominant venues for trading electric power, and some of the industries most affected by carbon climate trading is the electric power industry. We have those people already in our clearing house. We have money on deposit by these people, and we're in a good position now that we control clearing to use technology to give offset against the carbon versus electric energy, coal and other related materials. In the U.S., we are the dominant player in electric power. We probably have at least a 90% market share, I would think, in electric power trading. Recall that where I came out of the electric power industry and as Chuck Vice. And when we started the company really focused on that. So it's long been at our core. And so I would anticipate that we haven't -- we already have the major industrials trading voluntary relationships with those people. We are the dominant place for clearing the regional greenhouse gas initiatives that go on in various parts of the U.S. So we're very well positioned if there is U.S. regulation for some kind of cap-and-trade, but beyond that, it's a natural fit for the current product suite that we have.

But it definitely gets us another tool to use depending upon how regulation unfolds.

First of all, the power industry is in a long-term deregulation phase. And what is helping drive the growth of trading is public utility commission that hold their local utility accountable for increasing fuel than other expenses and don't let them pass 100% through to the rate payers. That one fact then causes utilities and others need to hedge, drives them into the gas and coal markets, but also into the power market. And broadly speaking, we're seeing a movement that we were somewhat involved with of moving away from trading physical power to trading financially settled power, and that trend is happened over the last decade. Again, by trading financially settled power, it allows market participants outside of NERC region to take economic exposure to the price of powers. It's still a nascent market in a sense that it is very, very volatile. It's kind of a big boys' market. We have specifically not allowed a lot of algorithmic traders in there. We have specifically not allowed smaller entities in there out of concern that you really need to understand the dynamics of power market, because they are so volatile. And at the core is this fact that if there is a localized brownout or blackout, the local utility will pay almost any amount of money for short-term power to cover that consequence, because it is not acceptable in our society to go without power even for a minute. So it becomes incredibly volatile to the upside, and as such, we sort of bring people in with a lot of education in a bit of a metered way. I think that's one of our fastest growing products, and it's still quite nascent, and we haven't really seen Europe and Asia adapt to trading power. It's still quite localized, quite physical and quite dominated by regional utilities outside the U.S. So I think there is potential globally for the growth of power that will happen over the next decade or more.

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. The first quarter of 2010 was ICE's best quarter ever in terms of revenue, volume, operating income and net income.

The first quarter of 2010 was ICE's best quarter ever in terms of revenue, volume, operating income and net income. Due to our global positioning and unique business mix, we continue to benefit from a number of long-term secular trends. And last Friday, we announced the acquisition of the Climate Exchange, further diversifying our business on a product, geographic and customer basis, while ensuring that the leading emissions market will now be a permanent part of ICE's growth story.
I'd like to begin our discussion on Slide 4, which shows our track record of earnings growth consistency. The revenue in operating income growth we've delivered in each year since 2005 was enabled by our strategic vision and global business model. We've grown revenue by nearly 60% and operating cash by over 7% annually since 2005. And in the first quarter this year, we grew revenues 22%, delivered the highest net margins in our industry and achieved 50% growth in operating cash flow. Our performance continues to distinguish ICE from our peers and demonstrates the value we are creating for shareholders.
Not only have we positioned ourselves to benefit from a number of near- and long-term opportunities, but we've also built a business that is proven able to withstand changes in the business cycle. The result has been industry-leading financial returns even as we invest to expand our diverse portfolio of assets. 
Now let's turn to our first quarter 2010 result on Slide 5. The first quarter of 2010 represented our sixth consecutive quarter of record quarterly revenues. Our consolidated revenues grew 22% to $282 million over first quarter 2009. Net income grew 26% to a record $101 million, and our tax rate for the first quarter was 34%. Diluted earnings per share rose 25% to $1.36.
Moving to Slide 6, I'll detail the components of our revenues and expenses. Starting on the left side of the chart, first quarter transaction and clearing revenues rose 23% to $251 million. This includes $123 million from our Futures segment, $86 million from our OTC Energy business and $43 million from OTC Credit execution and clearing. Market data and other revenue totaled $31 million. 
Shifting to the right side of Slide 6. First quarter operating expenses increased 12% year-to-year compared to adjusted 1Q '09 expenses. Disciplined investment and healthy revenue growth has produced steady increases in our operating margins. Our first quarter operating margin improved at 58% compared to an adjusted 55% in the first quarter of 2009. And our non-brokerage operating margins improved to 67%. We are driving operating efficiency as revenues grow, which translates into improved margins and solid cash generation even as we invest in new businesses. 
Let's now turn to Slide 7, where I'll detail the first quarter performance of our global Futures business. Total Futures revenues were $123 million, up 25% over 1Q '09. Average daily volume was 1.3 million contracts, which was up 28% over last year's first quarter. This record performance was enabled by the continued expansion of our European energy market, as well as the recovery of our agricultural commodity market. 
As a reminder, last year's first quarter was a record quarter for ICE. Our objective is not to grow every other year but to consistently deliver growth on top of growth every year. Continuing that trend, yesterday, we reported a 41% increase in April 2010 average daily volume for ICE's Futures markets, including record volumes for ICE Futures Europe. Year-to-date through April, our aggregate Futures average daily volume is up 32%.
Next, on Slide 8, I'll walk through the performance of our OTC business for the first quarter. Total OTC transaction revenues rose 22% to $128 million, our seventh consecutive record quarter. This was largely driven by our OTC Energy market with average daily commissions of $1.4 million, up 27% from 1Q '09. Our OTC oil and power revenues continue to come in at record levels due to strong demand for clearing. This demand for cleared product, coupled with the growing contribution of new products introduced over the past five quarters, has helped us establish an increasingly diverse platform. The first quarter was our strongest quarter in natural gas since 2008. Lower volatility during the quarter was overridden by improved credit conditions and the steady return of hedgers to the market. 
Natural gas is a key product for us, and we expect that it will grow over the long term as that market continues to globalize and a number of users for natural gas increase. That being said, in 2007, 73% of our OTC Energy transaction revenues were driven by natural gas. In the first quarter of this year, it comprised 60% of those revenue. 
You can see that the new product roll out over the past 18 months has increased our product diversification. Each of our major OTC Energy market, gas, power and oil, is turning in consistent growth. And in April, our OTC Energy business extended its solid performance with average daily commissions of $1.4 million.
Turning to our CDS business, revenues totaled $43 million during the first quarter, up 13% compared to revenues of $38 million in 1Q '09. This includes $31 million from Creditex and $12 million from ICE's global CDS Clearing business. Creditex's electronic transaction services accounted for 43% of our first quarter Creditex revenue where electronic trade processing continues to yield attractive margin. While growth in the brokerage CDS markets we serve remains muted, we continue to invest in innovative electronic capabilities and drive improved efficiencies, both of which contribute to relatively solid operating margin even in periods of lower revenue. These investments, coupled with our leadership position in U.S. and European index and single-name products, position us well for the eventual improvement of CDS market.
With regard to CDS clearing activity, recent volume has been driven by the launch of single-name CDS contracts, where our customers are moving their existing open interest into our clearinghouse. Our 2010 guidance anticipated that dynamic, noting the expectation for a gradual ramp in revenues throughout the year, as we expand our product offering, add new customers and work our way through the back loading of existing trades. 
While bank, which has the natural exposure to CDS, have led the way with clearing, we've also worked closely with our Advisory Committee, made up of representatives from buy-side firms to develop the leading buy-side solution. We expect to launch our European buy-side offering, as well as clearing a sovereign CDS in the near term, subject to regulatory approval.
The CDS market continues to face structural reform, similar to what we saw in the energy market in 2002. Again though, despite being in the early stages of this investment and the challenging market environment, our CDS Clearing business is already contributing to the bottom line. Importantly, this investment positions us not only as the leader in the CDS market, but also strengthened our ability to serve the much broader OTC market as it continues to evolve.
I'm going to wrap up my comments on Slide 9 with an overview of our acquisition of the Climate Exchange, which we announced last week. Due to the U.K. takeover rules, we're precluded for saying much more than what we announced previously. We believe this combination is attractive, both financially and operationally. We offered £7.50 per share or roughly £395 million in total. The transaction will be all cash, including $220 million drawn from our lines of credit and the rest from available cash. 
Notably, even after this transaction, our cash balance will remain above $200 million. We will have over $200 million of available capacity in our lines of credit, and our leverage will remain low. Our valuation focus on the Climate Exchange is well established, market-leading European emissions business and a synergy that we believe exist with the combination of our two firms. We took into account the uncertainty regarding the implementation of the U.S. cap-and-trade program in making the acquisition and considered growth in global emission market as upside opportunity. 
We are confident that the deal will have a negligible impact to earnings for the remainder of this year, a modestly positive impact to 2011, and most importantly, provide another attractive long-term source of growth with attractive financial returns by our shareholders. We look forward to being able to provide more information once the transaction closes this summer. 
I encourage you to refer to this morning's press release for further details on our quarterly performance, as well as a couple of updated guidance points for the balance of 2010. We filed our 10-Q this morning, as well as the new shelf registration to replace the existing shelf, which expires this year. I'll be glad to address your questions during the Q&A. Jeff, over to you."

I'd like to first complete our discussion of the Climate Exchange acquisition, and then I'll update you on our global business by providing some context for the tremendous results that Scott just presented to you. 
As many of you know, ICE and the Climate Exchange have long been partners. The successful business that Richard Sandor and his team built is the result of a decade of dedicated research, investment and execution on a global scale. This intensive effort has resulted in their being a leader in what is a very competitive space. We began working with the Climate Exchange in 2003 and supported the emergent of this nascent market. We're pleased that we'll be able to continue working with Dr. Sandor, following the close of the transaction. 
Over the past several years, emissions markets have proven to be among the fastest growing, and we believe they continue to hold significant potential over the longer term. For those not familiar with the Climate Exchange's business, it's a leader in the operation of the traded emissions markets. These markets include the European Climate Exchange, the Chicago Climate Exchange and the Chicago Climate Futures Exchange. So the team has established a broad geographic reach and deep market penetration. 
As Scott mentioned, and it's worth highlighting, our acquisition does not represent commentary on climate change policy or the probability of legislation surrounding climate issues. But I'd like to recognize that because of the European Union's emission schemes, which has been implemented in a thoughtful-phased and market-based manner, Europe has established a healthy environment in which these markets have grown and thrived. As the result, European customers, including carbon-intensive industrials, can put a price on carbon relative to other choices as they seek alternative energy solutions in a market-based environment. The addition of emissions markets further diversified our product set and add both an important industrial commercial base in Europe and longer-term exposure to Asia, while it offers us optionality around U.S. market developments. 
This transaction is representative of the deals on which we like to focus, those that provide exposure to global markets with growth potential and those that offer attractive returns on investment. We're committed to executing on opportunities to integrate our companies while we continue to grow the market, and we look forward to reporting back to you on our progress in this regard as soon as possible.
I'd now like to turn back to the discussion of the business that's delivered the results that we presented here today. I'll begin by repeating a question that we've been asked every quarter since our initial public offering in 2005. And that question is, ""Can ICE continue to grow?"" We've shown that the answer to be a consistent yes, and we've taken a deliberate, strategic approach to ensure that we deliver. 
This morning, I'll briefly review a few of our growth drivers and our strategy. If you'll follow me by turning to Slide 10, we've listed some of the basic drivers that we believe define the broad opportunities in the derivatives space. These drivers are long term and secular in nature, and they are the building blocks of an evolving market structure, shaping everything from an addressable market side to the regulatory framework in which markets operate.
First is the sustained role that commodities and derivatives play in global markets. This trend has continued for over a decade, and it's based on two key factors. One is the rising demand for commodities by a steadily growing middle class, and the other is rising demand for tools to hedge or gain exposure to this very phenomenon. Emerging economies cover about half of the world's population, where living standard and the resultant demand for goods are steadily rising. We're seeing this in our commodity markets, but this trend is manifesting itself in a number of ways. 
Anecdotally, in a recent economist article on sugar, it was noted that the increasing wealth in developing countries has raised demand for small luxuries, such as processed foods. As a result, the USDA estimates that worldwide sugar consumption is rising, including a $3 billion pound increase in sugar demand this year alone. Higher living standards translate into greater demand for commodities.
As we've seen, cyclical disruptions in any economy can occur. However, ICE's consistent performance and resiliency through the business cycle resulted from our positioning at the intersection of larger secular trends. The recovery of Western economy should further this upward momentum and provide a tailwind to capital market activities, including our derivatives markets. This year-to-date, a modest increase in confidence and economic recovery has improved market liquidity and driven gains in our commodity volumes.
I want to move on to another multi-year trend that we've spoken about many times, which is the shift towards greater price transparency and clearing. This move shows few signs of abating. The most obvious near-term example is the global financial reform is calling for an increase in market transparency and an increase for the use of clearing. In addition to providing opportunities for our business, we believe the adoption of financial reform will bring important certainty to our markets and to our customers. 
I'd like to point out that we've demonstrated that this transition towards clearing and automation can and have taken place well in advance of legislation. However, we're well positioned to support an expedited market transition due to the technology and clearing assets we own. This leads to a discussion of the tools that we've developed to position ICE at the intersection of secular trends and within this dynamic policy environment.
We believe that these assets are unique to ICE, and a few of these are listed on Slide 10. To our knowledge, no other exchange possesses such a broad range of market infrastructure assets. This include the automation of key over-the-counter processes for both the buy side and the sell side, front and back office connectivity, trade automation and clearing and trade repository capabilities. Most of the new legislative proposals require some or all of these tools to reduce systemic risk. Moreover, the development of these tools provides us with the unique set of assets for leverage as we address new markets. 
The most recent example of our success is in clearing CDS, an initiative of which we are all extremely proud. We continue to invest in building out our OTC Clearing platform, and we have related initiatives underway. We're continuously adding new products, adding new buy-side customers and enhancing our model. As a result, ICE leads the industry on virtually every metric. We've cleared $8 trillion across more than 200 index and single-name contracts that we list in the U.S. and Europe. ICE is supporting evolution in these markets by bringing our solution to existing market structures and then working with market participants to ensure the overall industry benefits from change.
Turning now to Slide 11, I'll touch on our success as an industry consolidator and as an innovator. We employ a rigorous framework for evaluating transactions and delivering on their potential. If you think about the transactions we've completed and the infrastructure we've developed in the past several years, it's difficult for us to identify any one asset that hasn't contributed to the strategic position that ICE has achieved by investing ahead of the curve. Over a decade ago and before the recognition of clearing and electronic trading, we saw an opportunity to transform the energy swaps markets. ICE continues to invest the necessary resources to build our infrastructure to serve these and other swaps markets, which are several times the size of the exchange-traded markets. Our track record in the over-the-counter markets has continued now with our seventh consecutive record revenue quarter.
Turning to Slide 12, you can see our solid diversification across customers, products and geographies as a result of our investments in markets globally. This diversification shows how we've positioned ICE at the center of long-term trends that we've been discussing today. With clearing houses in multiple jurisdictions, serving futures and over-the-counter asset classes, ICE has quickly become one of the new leaders in the provision of risk management and market structure services in innovation, technology and an understanding of our customer requirements.
I'll wrap up on Slide 13 by highlighting how we've positioned the company to capture positive secular trends. The first of these is to ensure that we maintain healthy exposure to areas of market expansion to drive earnings growth. In some cases, this maybe geography or product exposure, as we discussed on last quarter's earnings call with, for example, our oil products being driven by strong demand for energy commodities in Asia. ICE has also demonstrated that its strategy of extending our leadership in helping to organize and standardize global over-the-counter markets. We're leveraging our decade of experience in building out infrastructure to serve OTC markets, and we've demonstrated the growth potential where clearing, transparency, automation and increased regulation has been added. 
Over the past eight years, we took the over-the-counter energy markets from being 2% of contracts cleared to 97% cleared. At the same time, revenues grew six fold, markets recovered and many new products were introduced. The payoff has been larger, safer markets where more trading, and more risk management opportunities exist today than many thought possible just a decade ago.
Technology has been a core asset of ours since our inception. We began with a concept that modern technology, coupled to the Internet, could transform system performance, efficiency and distribution. And today, that's playing out. ICE maintains its multi- year lead in being one of the fastest, most reliable and feature-rich trading platforms. Its flexibility in being delivered over the web enables our markets to be distributed to customers in new geographies quickly and cost efficiently, without the expense that hard-line networks require of our customers.
Conversely, for algorithmic customers who co-locate, we've established one of the leading co-location programs, and our technology team works closely with them to ensure that our services are responsive. At less than three milliseconds, our round-trip futures execution times are now twice as fast as our major competitor. This leadership has been driven by our work in translating customer requirements into technology requirements. And finally, our intense focus on technology has enabled us to deliver risk management solutions quickly and effectively. 
In the space of just two years, ICE has leveraged this capability by building two clearinghouses, one in the U.S. and one in Europe, both of which have become leaders in their respective markets despite the existence of older and larger competitors. ICE is a growth- and results-focused company. We have a commitment to delivering the products and services that our customers require to manage their businesses, and we have a commitment to shareholders to grow our returns.
We aim to generate double-digit top and bottom line growth over the long run by executing on the items that I've discussed here today: First, growing and developing our existing business while we address new market opportunities; second, we focused on generating operating and capital efficiencies by maintaining expense discipline and generating investment returns that are above our cost of capital; and third, we focus on a culture of integrity, customer service and innovation. If we do these things well, we believe we will continue to outperform. 
Let me say that on behalf of all of my colleagues, I'd like to thank our customers for trusting us with their business last quarter. And again, I want to thank the entire ICE team for their hard work in meeting the objectives that we laid out this quarter. 
I'll turn it now back to April, our operator, to moderate the Q&A session."

And in that regard, I think we're viewing the process in the United States right now for U.S. financial reform to be very dynamic, and we would expect that there will be a lot of amendments that will be dealt with on the floor over the next few weeks and a lot of changes made to the legislation. So we're not necessarily looking at the current drafts in the Senate or the bill that came out of the House as really being the final say on what will happen. That's why, I think, Howard, we made more higher-level statements in our prepared remarks that, broadly speaking, the trend is to use more clearing to provide more transparency, potentially pre-trade and then post-trade through trade repositories. And as you know, we have trading platforms in both futures and over-the-counter markets. We have clearing houses in various jurisdiction that serve both futures and over-the-counter markets, and we have the leading energy trade repository in the form of our eConfirm system. So all of that, I think, broadly bodes well. We just shipped a little bit to Europe. The process of adopting financial reform is slightly different. The European Union has been circulating concepts and drafts to build the consensus between the member states with an expectation of trying to pass something by the end of the year. There, we're quite pleased with what we've seen so far. They've started by a look at clearing infrastructure, and they've concluded broadly the same thing that we've concluded, which is that it would be a mistake to interlink derivatives clearing houses. That will be not much different than interlinking a bunch of banks with derivatives on their balance sheets. So those of us that are in the clearing and market structure business have been successful at educating people to make that point. I also think that Europe is taking a slightly more measured approach than in the U.S., and part of that is just because the process is one of consensus building behind the scenes. So I do expect that the European legislation, that’s ultimately passed and U.S. legislation may look slightly different, and that may affect business and where it resides. So we obviously are in a good position since we'd have a global footprint."

And starting with natural gas, where ICE has been very involved in now about 10 years in the United States, I think we've gotten pretty heavily penetrated. Remember that these are over-the-counter products and they're governed by the CFTC through the regulation of our platform that requires you have at least $100 million in assets or $10 million in net worth to participate. So there is almost no penetration in any kind of retail or even small business desktop and that's by regulation. These contracts may evolve more into futures-like contracts, in which case there would be a tremendous amount of additional penetration possibility in terms of sheer numbers as we moved into smaller entities. In electric power, in the U.S., that is really a merchants market. It's a utility market. We don't really have algorithmic traders in there yet. We certainly don't have retail or even small business. It's a young market because the U.S. power markets are just deregulating and still in a multi-decade process of that. In the oil markets, the penetration is very, very small. The oil markets have not, in the past, really focused much on credit because they involve large sovereign countries and large global energy firms and global banks. And so credit up until this recent crisis had not been an issue. You're seeing that the techniques of using clearing as credit amelioration is now coming into vogue in that market, and we're very, very early. And then if I look at Europe and Asia, on the regional products there, gas and power and coal and other related things, it's very, very young. So a long-winded way of saying we tried to say in our prepared remarks that we positioned ourselves at what we believe is the early stage of a very long term and very global trend for growth in using energy commodities as hedging tools."

And we continue to see strong demand as we have now for many, many years in requesting new user IDs and passwords. But that's about the best we can do. I think, really, it is the stepping back in looking at the less granular aspects of where we've positioned the company that I think is hard for people to understand sometimes. And that is that, unlike a lot of other exchanges around the world that are centered around equities or interest rates or financial products that tend to be local to that country or region, we built a business that's tried to pick the products that we think are the most global. Energy is an obvious one. It's traded in dollars. In every country, it's denominated in dollars primarily for oil 24 hours a day. So it has become a truly global franchise. And I believe that agriculture, particularly the kind of ags that we have, which are coffee, cocoa, cotton, the things that are not necessarily U.S.-centric or growth drivers. And I believe that some of the over-the-counter markets, particular credit, I think there will be -- because of inter-connectivity of the world, people are going to have credit exposure to corporations that are outside of their region. And I think credit is an asset class. That is a nascent asset class that will grow. And while the form of credit default swap that we're trading today may be materially different in the future, I do think that there's a fundamental reason for global credit to be traded. And that's really why we've outperformed. We're not as levered to the regional products as many of our peers."

From a first quarter standpoint, I think expense came in at levels that if you look at it at a run rate, that's probably not a bad way to look at it. I think there is efficiency opportunity around the CDS clearing initiative. And we had about $10 million in expense in the fourth quarter. We had around $9 million in the first quarter. That still has a fairly heavy professional services component to it as we continue through the start-up phase and the negotiation, finalizing the negotiation around some of our agreements. So I think there's opportunity for improvement there. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we clearly think there are opportunities for synergies in the Climate Exchange, and we'll give you much more guidance and more detailed guidance on that once we get that deal closed.

The commodity markets, which include our energy markets and other similar markets, like metals and physical delivered commodities, the marketplace 10 years ago recognized that there was no true buy side or sell side. It was a many-to-many market even when it was on the telephone. And as a result, our energy markets in the over-the-counter space look a lot like futures markets. And you can see when we publish the breakdown of those markets of who is actually pushing the button and accessing the screen and it's heavy, heavy concentration by the commercial users that are executing on their own behalf. That's different than financial over-the-counter markets where there's a true buy side and sell side. And it's partly why when we decided to go into CDS and try to tackle clearing for over-the-counter financial products, we decided to do that in a separate clearinghouse, because I really believe that the infrastructure around that clearinghouse is going to evolve. It may ultimately look like futures, but right now, it doesn't. So one of the things that's going and the reason that Scott alluded the fact there's heavy professional service fees right now is there is a transition from the sell side, which acted as a prime broker, to some model where they're going to be providing clearing services. And the question is, is it going to be a futures-style clearing service where basically customers post collateral in the form of cash, and are mark-to-market in cash everyday? Or is there going to be some hybrid where customers post other kinds of assets to their prime brokers who then will basically lend against those and convert those to cash so that the clearing house can always be holding in cash? And what you're seeing right now is that transition, and I think the premise of your question alluded to your picking up on some of that. There are some broker dealers that would prefer to move quickly to a futures-style model. There are some broker dealers that would prefer to stay a more prime brokerage model. And I think if you were to really penetrate that, it depends on what assets and client bases and history those individual companies have. So as a result of that, I think we're going to end up with a hybrid, and that's partly why we've been doing well in CDS clearing is that we've respected that model and we've been evolving around it and having to work with regulators to do a lot of messaging on how we transition from what is currently on the books to where we think ultimately regulators want to take this."

And increasingly, regulators have recognized that we have a database here that has most of the energy business that's done around the world, including done by our competitors in one database.

It really does have connectivity to multiple platforms right now because of the way we've hooked the trade work close together. So we think that while regulators may put that into the statue, it's already happened in that regard. In energy, we take trades from brokers and other people, as does our competitor. Many, many people have tried to launch electronic platforms including our main competitor and some of the large brokers. Because the over-the-counter energy markets and commodity markets are so broad and so interrelated and so diverse with no one group of customers that dominate the business, no one has been able to do that just because of the network effect. So unlike equities, which a lot of people think about when we talk about open clearing, where most order flow goes through a handful of brokers and a small number then of algorithmic traders that are playing in that market. You don't have that phenomenon in Energy. So we really have an open clearinghouse again and we've been growing. I think the main thrust is that it's been important for us to get into the Clearing business and control the technology, the risk management, and the processes in there. I think we will strongly benefit by more trades coming into clearing."

We're planning for the long term, which is index and corporate credit, corporate credit and the industries that are made up of corporate credit, becoming an asset class and going electronic. And it is amazing how quickly in my mind that is transitioning, and it's amazing how well the Creditex brokerage team has evolved around that hybrid structure and allowed their own pocketbooks to benefit as well as the company's pocketbooks in raising the margins. So I don't necessarily -- and we're not advocating in the U.S. that things should be forced on to electronic platforms. We've been very open in Congress and with our main regulators, the CFTC and the FTC, that we think it's a natural outcome anyway, and we think that ICE can benefit regardless of that regulation, and our customers don't really want it.

So even in CDS, the market keeps taking us in the new areas where we really didn't even anticipate six or eight months ago. And the kinds of things that the market is asking us to do just in the credit space continues to broaden. You can even take my earlier comments, which is the clearing house itself is being involved in a market structure on how the prime Brokerage business will work, how collateral will be held, how money will be earned on collateral and other things. So there's an extension of banking functionality and other parts around the clearinghouse. That's a great thing about getting into these emerging markets. They take you somewhere. I use the analogy all the time that you kind of jump into a stream and the current will take you somewhere. But it's important to get into the stream, and that's where we are.

And then April, volumes were actually about 60% to 70% higher than the run rate of volumes in the first quarter.

And again, if you go back to a year ago, we're coming out of the credit prices, we're having default, we get paid to do that. The compression is largely now irrelevant because of clearing, but that decline is solely due to that. If you then fuel back another step further, our U.S. index and single-name business is combined, we're up about 25% year-over-year. Our index and single-name in Europe was down a little bit. But overall, index and single-name, which is the area where we're focused, was up 8% on a year-over-year basis. So we are investing. What we're not doing is we're not going out and just hiring bodies to deliver revenue. We're focused on generating revenue at expense ratios that are closer to 60%, not the 70%.

I think markets are anticipating the results, and that's why you're seeing $8 trillion worth of CDS already being cleared. The major dealers have made a commitment that over 90% of new trades they put on, they're going to put it into the clearinghouse in CDS. You see huge initiatives going on to get interest rate swaps into clearing, and so the neat thing about market, and particularly we're well positioned being relatively small and flexible and dynamic, if these things are going to be in place, I think, before regulators really do. I mean, there was an earlier question about the Chicago Climate Exchange, which is a voluntary carbon market, which has unbelievable pedigree in terms of the companies that are participating in that. They're doing that voluntarily, because they want to build domain knowledge, they want to build infrastructure, they want a price carbon before Congress does so that they can get a sense on what it will do to their businesses. So it's amazing to watch markets, and so I think that's why we're building things now and there's a lot going on to position ourselves, because I do believe that this is going to happen quite quickly."

There are in Europe, there are many competitors, and Climate Exchange has emerged as the clear leader. To give you a sense, I think their complex has about, in total, has about 850,000 contracts in open interests. That's about the same amount of Brent oil that we have. So it has grown quickly in Europe and has a very large footprint. And we've been a partner with them, and one of the reasons that we've made a good partner is that ICE is really one of the dominant venues for trading electric power, and some of the industries most affected by carbon climate trading is the electric power industry. We have those people already in our clearinghouse. We have money on deposit by these people, and we're in a good position now that we control clearing to use technology to give offset against the carbon versus electric energy, coal and other related materials. In the U.S., we are the dominant player in electric power. We probably have at least a 90% market share, I would think, in electric power trading. Recall that where I came out of the electric power industry and as Chuck Vice. And when we started the company really focused on that. So it's long been at our core. And so I would anticipate that we haven't -- we already have the major industrials trading voluntary relationships with those people. We are the dominant place for clearing the regional greenhouse gas initiatives that go on in various parts of the U.S. So we're very well positioned if there is U.S. regulation for some kind of cap-and-trade, but beyond that, it's a natural fit for the current product suite that we have."

First of all, the power industry is in a long-term deregulation phase. And what is helping drive the growth of trading is public utility commission that hold their local utility accountable for increasing fuel than other expenses and don't let them pass 100% through to the rate payers. That one fact then causes utilities and others need to hedge, drives them into the gas and coal markets, but also into the power market. And broadly speaking, we're seeing a movement that we were somewhat involved with of moving away from trading physical power to trading financially settled power, and that trend is happened over the last decade. Again, by trading financially settled power, it allows market participants outside of NERC region to take economic exposure to the price of powers. It's still a nascent market in a sense that it is very, very volatile. It's kind of a big boys' market. We have specifically not allowed a lot of algorithmic traders in there. We have specifically not allowed smaller entities in there out of concern that you really need to understand the dynamics of power market, because they are so volatile. And at the core is this fact that if there is a localized brownout or blackout, the local utility will pay almost any amount of money for short-term power to cover that consequence, because it is not acceptable in our society to go without power even for a minute. So it becomes incredibly volatile to the upside, and as such, we sort of bring people in with a lot of education in a bit of a metered way. I think that's one of our fastest growing products, and it's still quite nascent, and we haven't really seen Europe and Asia adapt to trading power. It's still quite localized, quite physical and quite dominated by regional utilities outside the U.S. So I think there is potential globally for the growth of power that will happen over the next decade or more."

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. During the second quarter, we delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of record revenue and our best quarter ever for operating income and adjusted earnings per share. We're executing",1829,"Thanks, Kelly. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. During the second quarter, we delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of record revenue and our best quarter ever for operating income and adjusted earnings per share. We're executing on a number of strategic initiatives and we see ample opportunity for continued growth.
I'll start on Slide 4 this morning with some highlights from the first half of this year. We'll focus on our non-GAAP or adjusted operating results as these are more indicative of our business performance. As you can see, ICE continues to deliver consistent top and bottom line growth. In the first half of 2010, we grew revenues 20% and adjusted expenses only 6%, resulting in adjusted net income attributable to ICE growing 32% and operating cash flows up 42%. 
This performance is the result of our focus on meeting the needs and demands of our customers and our disciplined approach to investment. Our business model of global reach, product diversity and extensive clearing infrastructure differentiate our opportunity set and distinguish ICE from our competitors. We provide solutions today, and offer key building blocks for the solutions required tomorrow to help our customers navigate the evolution of regulation and market.
Moving now to Slide 5, I'll review our second quarter results. ICE's consolidated revenues grew 18% to a record $296 million over last year's second quarter. Adjusted net income attributable to ICE grew 35% to a record $113 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 34% to a record $1.51. We've highlighted a few of the drivers of our performance on the right side of this slide. Our Global Energy business remains strong, and growth in our financial futures markets continues to improve. And importantly, the extensive work we've done on integrating acquisitions over the past three years is enabling operating margin expansion even as we continue to grow. 
If you'll turn to Slide 6, I'll cover our revenue and expense detail. Second quarter transaction and clearing revenues rose 19% to $265 million. This includes $130 million from our Futures segment and $135 million from our OTC segment. I also want to point out that our Data business remains a solid contributor with record revenues of $27 million in the second quarter. This is driven by the entry of new participants in our market and the resulting demand for our data. 
Shifting to the right of the slide, second quarter adjusted operating expenses increased just 1% versus 2Q '09. Adjusted operating margin improved to 61% compared to 54% in the second quarter of 2009. Our non-brokerage operating margins improved to 67%. 
It's worth noting that we continue to drive increases in our operating efficiency at Creditex despite the soft credit markets. For example, Creditex compensation as a percent of revenue actually improved in 2Q versus 1Q despite a sequential decline in revenue. Our strategy of retaining the top brokers with mutually beneficial agreement, while weeding out underperformers continues to pay off. In terms of customer surveys and market share, our Creditex team continues to rank highly and is recognized for their expertise, electronic capabilities and service.
In terms of compensation expense, we believe our pay-for-performance culture is one of the keys to our success. First, it is an investment in our ability to execute and innovate. Second, it ties each employee's compensation to the long-term success of our company. These incentives largely come in the form of multi-year equity compensation rather than a one-time cash payout. This provides continuity, stability in highly-specialized staff and importantly, an employee population whose interests are fully aligned with our shareholders. While our average compensation per employee is higher than our competitors, our employees also deliver more revenue, more profit and more cash per person. Or said more simply, our team delivered industry-leading returns on the investments we make in them. 
Now let's review each of our business segments starting with the performance of our Global Futures business on Slide 7. Consolidated Futures' revenues were up 23% to $130 million over last year's second quarter. Average daily volume was 1.4 million contracts, which was up 36% year-to-year. We believe the current global economic uncertainty has increased the level of hedging and risk management by a wide range of industries globally. During the second quarter, and despite relatively lower volatility, sustained demand from Asia coupled with economic uncertainty drove continued volume growth in crude and refined oil products. We also saw a continued improvement from our financial futures market, with record volumes in our Russell and U.S. Dollar Index Futures. Ag Futures we're relatively flat following sugar's sharp price decline in the first quarter of this year. And yesterday, we reported a 13% increase in July 2010 average daily volume for ICE's Futures' market. Year-to-date through July, average daily Futures' volumes is up 29%.
I'll walk through the second quarter performance in our OTC business, our eighth consecutive quarter of record revenues on Slide 8. Consolidated OTC transaction revenues rose 15% in the second quarter to $135 million. Average daily commissions in our Energy business rose 26% to $1.4 million. Despite relatively low price volatility, each product class in our OTC Energy market, gas, power and oil grew year-to-year. With the successful introduction of new cleared oil products over the past 18 months, we have continued to diversify our OTC business. Oil revenues once again came in at record levels, with meaningful growth in all of our new cleared products. And finally, in our OTC Energy business, July average daily commissions were $1.4 million, up significantly from last year and roughly consistent with our strong year-to-date performance.
In our CDS business, second quarter revenue totaled $43 million, down from $45 million last year. This includes $27 million from Creditex and $16 million from ICE's Global CDS Clearing business. Creditex's electronic transaction services accounted for 45% of our second quarter Creditex revenue. Activity in the CDS index and Single-name business remain soft given the uncertain regulatory environment, and despite the relatively stronger performance in niche and a more volatile, sovereign and emerging market products. We believe Creditex and our talented brokerage teams are well-positioned for an eventual return of liquidity to the Creditex market. And as I noted earlier, we remain vigilant on expenses and efficiencies in this business even as we work to maintain our leadership position and invest to deliver further innovation and automation to our customers.
Turning to the CDS Clearing business, we had a solid sequential increase in Clearing revenues in the second quarter. As we indicated previously, our 2010 guidance anticipated a gradual ramp in revenues throughout the year as we expand our clearing capabilities, add new members and customers and await the recovery of the credit market. We remain confident in the guidance we provided at the start of this year, and we continue to be pleased with our progress in a very challenging, competitive environment. 
ICE's work has led to a sound global solution even the face of great regulatory and economic uncertainty. We charted the course without a road map and we did so by being nimble and responsive. We are uniquely positioned to continue to lead by building on our broad platform of services for the credit market. Today, we're clearing over 230 CDS product and offer the most widely adopted service in the U.S. and Europe. We expect to launch our European buy-side offering, as well as clearing of sovereign CDS in the coming months, and we'll be adding a number of operational enhancements that we worked with the industry to achieve. 
While we remain in the early stages of the longer-term OTC Clearing opportunity, ICE has delivered its promise. We have the leading over-the-counter clearing solution in the U.S. today, and our CDS Clearing business is contributing to profit and cash. Just two years ago, each major exchange and clearinghouse globally was in a race to enter this business. The strides we've made in tremendously complex asset classes speak to the strength of ICE's clearing team, the confidence of our customers and our robust technology infrastructure. We constantly evaluate additional clearing opportunities that may exist and remain excited by the excellent opportunity in CDS today.
Let's move to Slide 9. This chart demonstrates the diversity of our business. The balance between our OTC and Futures revenues reflects our ability to serve the needs of both market structures, particularly amid a dynamic regulatory environment. Our balanced geographic and product profile has helped us to avoid the ups and downs of any single economy or market. And importantly, we continue to see strong participation by commercial customers in our market. This solid commercial base attracts other market participants and enables volume growth regardless of economic condition, which was particularly well demonstrated by our consistent growth throughout the recent global downturn.
On Slide 10, I'll provide some color around our recent Climate Exchange transaction which closed on July 8. We believe this combination is attractive both financially and operationally. The European Emissions business has been and remains robust with 26% growth year-to-date through July. And we see several future growth drivers for the European Emissions business, including Phase 3 of the European Emissions Trading Scheme, the addition of new industry groups and the introduction of optioning beginning in 2011. I also want to highlight a couple of the key guidance points on our Climate Exchange acquisition here, and then encourage you to refer to our earnings release for additional information. We've also provided pro forma financial information on our website.
We expect an immaterial impact to earnings related to CLE in the balance of 2010 and in 2011. We anticipate annualized expense synergies in the range $13 million to $14 million, which is approximately a 60% reduction of CLE's first half 2010 run rate. These synergies come from leveraging our existing infrastructure for emissions market as a result of our long-standing partnership with Climate Exchange. As has been true with all of our prior acquisitions, we will deliver the committed synergies even as we focus on growing our Emissions business. 
I'll close on Slide 11 by discussing the strength of our financial model. We have consistently generated returns well in excess of our cost of capital and our competition. We have produced 55% annual operating cash flow growth over the past five years, and this trend continued during the first half of 2010. We have $300 million in available cash, low leverage and significant available debt capacity. We believe the current environment is light with opportunity for continued investment and growth for those companies with a strategic vision and ability to execute. We are confident that we have the financial means and the demonstrated investment discipline to continue to put our capital to work to generate value and strong returns for our investors.  We filed our 10-Q this morning, and I encourage you to refer to this morning's press release for further details on our performance and additional 2010 guidance. 
Jeff, over to you."

But subject to that caveat, I want to take this opportunity to talk to our shareholders about how we see certain aspects of the bill at this stage. We'll continue to update you throughout its implementation process. 
The passage of the bill mark the start of the U.S. regulatory rule-making process that is largely expected to occur over the next 12 months. The CFTC, the SEC and other regulatory agencies have been charged with writing over to 240 rule-makings and conducting dozens of studies. Nothing we can say here can anticipate any of the finer points of those rule-makings at this stage, but it appears that most of the rules will be implemented between 2011 and 2012. My colleagues are already working with our customers to anticipate and deliver on the provisions and opportunities ahead of the implementation date. 
Within the derivatives title, which covers the swaps market, the clearing requirement will be a central part of the law, requiring financial companies to clear standardized swaps. ICE's global clearing infrastructure is a central component of our strategy for addressing new opportunities. We have a solid head start in enabling many anticipated transitions. And we have a demonstrated ability to solve for the complexities of the over-the-counter markets. In the last decade, we took our over-the-counter energy swaps markets from 2% cleared to 97% cleared. Today, we are rapidly moving ahead in the credit default swaps markets. In both these cases, we've managed through the complexities and uncertainties of the times to deliver customer solutions that have been widely adopted and have spawned new opportunities for us and for our customers.
With regard to the exchange trading requirements for standardized contracts, we've seen this transition occurring for several years even in advance of regulation. First, in our energy markets and more recently, in the credit default swap markets. Trade automation tends to be a natural consequence of standardization. And together, we believe these fundamentals create a much larger addressable market. Our energy markets are the clearest example of this expansion taking place. 
On a related note, you'll hear the phrase Swaps Execution Facility, or as many of us are calling it, SEF, which is a designation that refers to a venue that allows multiple participants to interact with multiple participants in a given swaps market. We anticipate that ICE, Creditex and other execution venues will register for that designation. Along with the SEF registration, these venues must comply with core principles. These important principles are high standards to ensure market integrity. ICE is, today, well-positioned to meet these, having been an early leader in trade automation and market transparency. Our technology was designed to serve the needs of the over-the-counter market via an electronic platform with extensive risk management tools. Since the passage of the 2008 Farm Bill, the CFTC has had regulatory authority over ICE's OTC Energy markets, and we have already implemented many aspects of what we believe will be similar to the SEF requirements.
Finally, the swaps push out may require some banking firms to move parts of their swaps operations to non-bank affiliates. Today, however, many of these operations already exists outside of the federally-insured banking entities. And to the extent that additional trading opportunities will eventually be created, we've seen funds and other proprietary firms raising capital to take advantage of market opportunities. As Scott mentioned, participation in our markets continues to rise.
Turning now to CDS clearing. One of the major provisions of the bill becomes effective 360 days from the July enactment, where ICE Trust will be deemed a Derivatives Clearing Organization with that status under the CFTC, and a clearing agency status under the SEC. The CFTC and the SEC will become the front-line regulators of our CDS clearing operations. We will be actively working with our members on this transition and we do not anticipate any issues with compliance. We've designed our models with flexibility to complete the transition, and we will retain access to the Federal Reserve or secure overnight handling of our clearing deposits. As Scott mentioned, there was no road map when we built and delivered the leading CDS clearing solution, so the bill now provides us with regulatory certainty that we need to continue to bring in more buy-side business. 
Importantly, ICE's model has both operational and regulatory advantages in terms of certainty and functionality. We're already actively clearing single-name CDS pursuant to an arrangement that we have in place with the SEC under the existing rules. And we will continue to expand these services over the next year, without having to sit idle while the new rules are being developed. Moreover, ICE's CDS clearing solution is global. We offer clearing for over 230 contracts and have $1 trillion in notional open interest, with nearly $11 trillion in gross notional having been cleared. Judging by the continued growth in these numbers each week, we started with the best and most legally certain model and next year, we'll make the transition to our ultimate new regulators.
One last note here is the inclusion of a post trade reporting provision for swaps. This reporting requirement applies to cleared and non-cleared OTC transactions. In the commodity markets today, we operate a service that's known as ICE eConfirm, that we created with global commodity market participants years ago. We see this technology playing a role in helping the industry to comply with post-trade reporting using efficient and a secure technology. This is a luster [ph] of the opportunities, large and small, that may emerge in the coming years. While we don't discount the risks associated with change, we believe the overriding demand for commodities and risk management will continue to play out over the coming decade. And as you would expect, we'll be very proactive on the opportunities that come with change. Importantly, the strength in emerging market economies, together with the eventual economic recovery in the West, all remain attractive secular growth opportunities for ICE over the long term. 
So you can see, my comments are consistent with what we've said in the past. We believe the legislation acknowledges the central role of risk management that ICE has developed over the past decade. It focuses on strengthening the system through increased transparency, capital requirements and clearing. And on balance, as a leading provider of solutions for over-the-counter markets, we're very well-positioned to continue to lead and grow given the opportunities that we see today. 
While many in the markets feared regulatory change, for example, the addition of position limits, our performance has been exceptionally strong. After establishing position limits in our key natural gas swap at markets in January of this year, we've set consecutive quarterly record revenues. I think this demonstrates that the overriding factors in our performance are indeed the commercial demand for our global markets.
I'll close my prepared remarks on Slide 13 with a discussion of our consistency and delivering on our strategy. We continue to leverage and expand on our expertise and infrastructure to serve new markets. In the second quarter, we marked the 10th anniversary of the company. Obviously, much has changed since our founding in year 2000. We've grown our business organically and through M&A, we've become more global and more diverse. We've enabled the transformation from trading floors into electronic markets, and we were early in identifying the important role of clearing. In that process, we acquired century-old businesses, including four futures exchanges and three clearinghouses, while building two new clearinghouses. Today, we remain unique as an exchange with extensive infrastructure to serve both futures and OTC markets from both the buy side and the sell side, the front office and the back office, across execution, clearing and processing. We also anticipated and adapted to regulatory change, bringing transparency and new reporting new tools where none previously existed. 
Finally, our lean, fixed-cost operating model continue to produce strong operating leverage. In the five years since our IPO, we've increased our adjusted operating margins to 61%, up from 48%. And 10 years after our founding, our strategic principles haven't changed. We remain a growth company driving growth globally.
These accomplishments are a tribute to the strong employee team we've assembled at ICE to drive results. Managing a high-growth company while navigating through economic, competitive and regulatory climate of recent years has not come easy. However, our senior leadership team, together with our dedicated and customer-focused colleagues, have consistently delivered in our objectives. And we continue to look forward towards innovation to drive consistent best-in-class results over the long run. 
So on behalf of my colleagues, I again, would like to thank our customers who are treating us with their business. And I'd like to thank my ICE team for their work in delivering ICE's best quarter in our history. 
We'll now turn it back to the operator who will moderate our Q&A session."

I think one thing that I was trying to highlight in my comments is that, I think when people look at exchanges, and ICE inclusive, and think about the changes that are going on in the U.S. and European OTC markets, we really are the company that has a big footprint in those markets and has tools for those markets, and derive half of our revenues from those markets historically. So we do see a lot of opportunity across asset classes."

I think a lot of the -- let me deal with the bank customers first, because they're the ones that have the most impact, I think, under the bill. Many of them are not waiting for all these rule-makings, and are very quietly and quickly looking at how to organize their businesses. A lot of our major Wall Street participants have put teams together to really go through the legislation in detail and to figure out what changes they may need to make to their businesses, and they're doing that very quickly. And that's a holistic view, too. It's not just the trading of derivatives, but it's also the clearing of derivatives, the reporting and how these businesses are going to be capitalized going forward. So I think that shift will happen very quickly and well ahead of rule-making in my mind. The other thing you probably saw last week, Goldman Sachs came out and announced their new OTC clearing FCM initiative. I think what you'll be seeing is people that have prime brokerage and commodity lending and derivatives lending operations that really existed in the bilateral world, figuring out how to marry that or how to modify those to couple them with FCMs and what looks like a more futures type model to ultimately create some hybrids that will sit in between. And again, the FCM model, I think, will likely not change. Many FCMs were low capitalized businesses that had parent company guarantees. People are looking at whether or not the regulated bank entity can continue to guarantee the FCMs, whether the FCM should be separately capitalized, what the rules may be in that regard. So I think you're going to see some interesting changes happening, all of which I'm quite excited about and take as a positive, because we're developing tools and working with people and modifying our footprint as that happened. I think one of the great side benefits of CDS clearing, and I think one of the reasons we talk a lot about it is that, it's evolving. The footprint of how we do this is changing and it has been changing, and as our customers' needs have been changing and the markets' have been changing. So we're really evolving with them and I think it positions as well. We're not just a return in the growth of credit as the market comes out of a credit crisis, but across all the over-the-counter markets."

And that business has been impacted by just the downturn in the credit markets. What you've seen is the business that's going on right now, a lot of it has been around sovereign CDS as Europe has tried to work through its debt problems. And some niche markets that are basically, people restructuring legacy positions that exist on their books, exiting them or putting risk management around them so that they can basically roll off at the end of their term. That business is not that interesting or strategic to us. We are working on clearing it. We think it will be a good business to clear. But the bread-and-butter, I really believe, will ultimately be corporate credit risk management, and that's going to probably be levered to the recovery of lending. We have a lot of debt coming due. I think there's an overhang of people that are going to have to be refinancing going forward. I think that's going to drive the beginning in recovery of those markets. So I don't think we have to wait necessarily for the West to recover out of the current economic downturn. We really need lending to come back.

And more single-name activity in the second quarter than first is what helped drive the revenue up on a sequential basis. It's also clearly helping that we've continued to add new members and revenues from those new members as favoring their positions and certainly, help on a sequential basis as well, which again was consistent with what we said earlier this year, that we would expect a gradual increase quarter-to-quarter. And I think that's what we're seeing. In terms of the buy-side uptake, we are now nearly $2 billion of cleared business from the buy side. We've continued to see small progress each week from the buy side community. I'd tell you, the feedback that we're getting is mixed. Some of the buy side see -- I think everyone sees that clearing is inevitable and helpful to the market generally. But I think there's a mixed view in terms of the rate in pace. Some expected their going to move well in advance of final rules. Some want to wait and see how those final rules play out. So I feel good about our positioning with the buy side of the business we've gotten so far, the fact that we have a very active buy side community on our Advisory Committee.

So we feel good about, holistically about our footprint. Where trading ultimately resides and how it moves is going to be highly determined by what the CFTC concludes that a set is. And if you read the exact language in the bill, it is not clear exactly how the model will work, and there's definitely going to have to be some interpretation by the CFTC. And so the CFTC, on the one extreme, could really try to drive trading into a futures-type model where you would expect to see a two-way bid offer, real-time, free-trade price transparency, or they could have slightly different standards that allowed multiple platforms, including interdealer platforms, even existing dealer-to-client platform could theoretically be there. So it's very hard to prejudge where that rule-making will come out. I would tell you this, I expect that when the rule-making comes out, the responses are going to be like being hit by a firehose. There are so many people that are looking at this as an opportunity, existing service providers, exchanges, entrepreneurs who view this as a great new opportunity and so on and so forth. And so many different business models across the various over-the-counter asset classes and pockets of trading, that I think there's going to be a vigorous debate and discussion around this. And so it's very, very hard to prejudge, because I have the bias that I think there's a lot in the OTC market today. And CFTC's going to have to kind of wait through that."

I do though now expect those efficiencies will remain our prior guidance with $60 million to $62 million a comp. Actually, think we've probably would have trended to the lower end or below that.

In the U.S., while we have a very public debate in front of Congress and sort of realtime reporting by the press on what's going on. In Europe, it's much more of a quiet process. A lot of -- we have had dozens and dozens of meetings with various staff people working on legislation. And I think that what is coming out, and I think some of the drafts, so I'm not necessarily foreshadowing what you may not already know. But we're going to see that the central banks, and directly in our case, the Bank of England, will have a much stronger hand in overseeing clearing operations and the capital that goes along with clearing and protecting the economic system of the central counterparties. And you're going to have a new sort of Pan-European regulator that is going to really be looking at the execution piece. And so right now, for example, in Europe, we're regulated by the FSA who oversees book clearing and trading, so we expect to see sort of a slightly different footprint. With that said, sort of the broad goals, I think, that are coming out of Europe are similar to what are happening in the U.S., but they're a little less prescriptive at least as they exist today. They want a bias, obviously, towards more clearing and they want to bias towards more transparency in trading. I think one good thing that came out of the discussion is that the regulators are seeing the problem, or potential problem, of allowing clearinghouses to be linked up. The interconnection of clearinghouses could be no different than interconnection of major banks. So that issue now has come off the table, which is, I think, a good thing for us and frankly, a position that we strongly agree with. And so what's left probably to be determined really is what they're OTC trading requirements really look like and what asset classes are going to be pushed more towards exchanges. There's definitely a movement towards building trade repositories there where all trades will eventually go, so that all governments can have access to those. And I see somewhat of a mellowing of the internal strikes that exist in Europe where there were debates about whether things should be located on a continent, or can they remain in London and so on and so forth. And really, the creation of this Pan-European regulator should cover all the members of the EU and allow information to be shared between governments, regardless of where clearinghouses or warehouses or trade execution facilities are located. So I see that as a positive thing for us as well."

And part of it, just looking at how we positioned ourselves relative to our peers, most exchanges in the world are equity or options and equity derivatives exchanges and interest rate exchanges and/or a combinations of those. That's really what's most exchanges are in the world, and those tend to be the local interest rates and the local equity markets. And so most exchanges are relatively levered to the true economic recovery or velocity of their domicile. And while all of the exchanges around the world today are global and that they have screen distributions, the reality is that their products are regional. And I think you know and probably give guidance to your customers about when to try to get in and out of those stocks looking at the underlying economic recovery of the local environment. ICE is really different in that we are truly global. And although our Energy business is centered largely in London, it's really there because of the East-West prime zone change. And what we're seeing is a dramatic movement of business that is coming out of the BRIC countries. And our customer base moving into those BRIC countries, in order to build new businesses, to provide hedging tools and what have you. And the velocity in our business and the volatility that's coming in our business is largely being driven by tension between a Western economy that is slow to recover and a BRIC economy that's fast to recover and people trying to figure out what that means for supply and demand. And so you have this natural volatility. So the color I would give you is that, we're really levered to this global recovery and we're also levered to the vagaries of the timing differences between various economy as they recover and that's creating volatility that just keeps our volumes high. I would point out to you that we said in our statements, that we have literally record open interest in July. So not only in our energy footprint, so not only have we had a great first half of the year, we're entering the second half on top of really strong open interest, which we think will continue those trends."

So that's 360 days after passage under the CFTC, and then it automatically becomes a clearing agency under the SEC. So there's nothing that we have to do, we automatically become regulated. Those two regulators, we have close relationship with them and they've been actively involved with us, as we've been building up this model, which is why I mentioned that we don't anticipate any problems in transitioning. But what I think the unique new piece is that the SEC is going to have to do rule making and figure out what is an FCM under SEC regulation. And is it the same as the CFTC? Are they going to work together and settle on something that might be slightly new? We just don't know. What we do see is our customers that have large OTC footprints in the prime brokerage area moving to bring their futures clearing operation and their OTC prime brokerage operation together. You saw JPMorgan reorganized those recently and put them under one person. You saw Goldman last week announced that they were basically creating this hybrid. So I think our customers are anticipating how to try to handle their customer business and position themselves. And I'm sure then as we go through this rule making, they'll be talking to the FCC and the CFTC about how they think they can manage customer business. It's in the best interest of the CFTC, and the FCC are really trying to get more business into clearing. And while there are buy side exemptions, I think Chairman Gensler [Gary Gensler] has been very powerful on the fact that he really wants to try to build a footprint that attracts the buy side into clearing. And so I think they'll be paying attention to how the lending and collateral management capabilities can be reorganized in some of these businesses."

I think, Ken, if you look at the chart we put out, we showed how really the European business is the business that has been widely adopted and is growing quickly, and it's the business that we wanted to own and it's the real value that we saw in that acquisition. The current U.S. business in the Climate Exchange is a loss-making business as it exists today. And we are going to study it and talk to the market about how they view that business now and what they think we should do with it. Those companies pay dues right now and obviously, a delay in cap and trade is going to mean the dues and the amounts may go up. Let me just describe briefly, in the U.S., there is a voluntary cap and trade business that was organized by Doc Sandor. It's been widely used and it is voluntary. And while we obviously focus on the trade piece, these companies have voluntarily agreed to cap and to walk down their carbon footprint. And it remains to be seen now in an uncertain U.S. regulatory environment whether companies are going to want to continue to walk down their carbon footprint, whether or not they're going to get credit for it by Congress and now that the EPA oversees carbon, whether or not the EPA is going to give them credit for the work that they're voluntarily doing. So that's one question we have to ask the marketplace. The second piece is that we trade NOx and SOx emissions, and that has been challenged by some legal challenges that have affected the way that the EPA is looking at NOx and SOx trading, it's a bit destabilized right now. Again, we have to survey the market and ask them how do they feel about the footprint that we acquired there and do they want that to survive? So the last piece that we're also focusing on is that the Climate Exchange is a 25% owner of a carbon exchange that's being built in China. And it's one of the few, if not the only non-Chinese owner of an exchange in China, and that is a joint venture that exists with the Chinese oil company. So we are very, very excited about that particular footprint because it gives us a way to dialogue directly with the oil company there. It gives us a footprint that we can work on in China. I've been very loathe to have our employees flying around China, trying to scare up business because of the expense and really, the improbable hit rate that we would likely to have in that expense. But this gives us something that we can lever off of an anchor. I don't know how successful that will ultimately be but I do know that, that is an important relationship that I think can pay dividends in many other businesses that we have over the long term. But that is an exciting area that is a non-European business."

And so as you know, it's hard for shareholders to really get comfortable with revenues synergies, so we haven't really advertised it too much. But the reality is, in our mind, the people that are really most impacted by the carbon caps are the utility and energy businesses. And those are our traditional customers, and we have been working to get more and more offsets and other risk management tools to the utility footprint, so that they can both trade power and natural gas on ICE and then also buy their carbon. And so that is a very, very powerful coupling. And while we had it before in our partnership with CLE, by bringing in the marketing people and the product development people into our ownership now and in control, we'll be able to work much closer.

And then the second piece is that this bill that I spent a lot of time talking about in my prepared remarks is really regulation of the over-the-counter market. It doesn't really change much for futures. And there is certainly a lot of knowledge and legal certainty in the trading of futures. And so in my mind, it provides an additional bias for people to say, ""Heck, maybe instead of trying to do all of this stuff and comply and reorganize businesses and move capital around and so on and so forth, maybe if we had some of the benchmarks listed as futures, it would make our life easy."" So I think what you're picking up on, is people that are really getting into the nuances of this legislation and trying to say, maybe there are certain aspects that should not remain in the over-the-counter markets. And there will be a tension there, so I don't know that it necessarily will move things into futures. But there's definitely much more openness to look at how futures and the over-the-counter markets play together. We long ago saw that OTC and futures play together. I mean the very first things I did after starting ICE was acquire a futures exchange and list OTC and futures that were related on one screen, and that help drive our early growth. And you've seen other asset classes where never the two shall meet, but you'll not see those people and those asset classes saying, ""Well, wait a minute here, maybe we should get these markets closely linked together because in reality they are and regulators are pushing them in that way anyway."""

And I think there's a lot of goodwill to try to do that and it does seem now like, Europe is looking at the Dodd-Frank Bill and is trying to figure out what it likes about that, what it doesn't like. It's going to do things that will not be identical but the goal will be similar. So I really do see that coupled with the fact that the U.S. is starting to participate more in the Basel discussions. U.S. has been an observer in those discussions. But I recently saw, where Chairman Frank [Barney Frank] is taking those seriously. And so you can see some moves towards harmonizing the capital requirements, again driving things into clearing. I do believe that as we put more regulation around, particularly credit markets, that it's going to actually increase the amount of trading because it's going to bring confidence to the buy side. You have a lot of people that manage and run institutional money that are very, very fuzzy about where they will place customer money. They want up to be in transparent liquid market that they can easily mark-to-market. And so I think that the institutional buy side will participate much more in the credit business as it becomes more regulated. That will be true, sort of loan-only type money that will bring more market makers and non-traditional players into the market, and so you can just see how it could lever up. But the underpinning is going to be a global regulatory footprint. We do clear in Europe and in the U.S., and the models that we have there are similar. There are some slight vagaries and as we move into this new world of what OTC futures commission merchants look like. There are some vagaries right now between the two models, but I think we're anticipating that a lot of those gaps will narrow as both regulators on both sides sort of look to each other to see what each other is doing."

Because in addition to dealers, there's a thing called a major swaps participant that will be different than the end user who will be qualified for an end-user exemption. So are we going to find that many of the large traditional money managers are considered major swaps participants? Are they going to be considered the buy side? And there's a lot of chatter in the industry going on around that. A lot of uncertainty about who will get roped into what requirements. And I think until we really see that rule making come out and get some sense of where we're going, it's hard to know. I think a good example to go to look at is what's going on in our Energy Clearing business, where there's no regulation and everybody who clears there has been doing it voluntarily. And what you find is that, while it cost money to clear in the sense that you have to post margin and you get mark-to-market, and those are the kinds of things that you hear the buy side concerned about in other asset classes. The reality is that net down your position. And as we've shown in CDS, we've taken $11 trillion in notional down to $1 trillion. So it's collapsing at more than 10:1. And so yes, you have to post margin on the net amount, but the net amount can be for many people dramatically reduced from their notional. And it's that phenomenon that brings the buy side in and they are willing to post capital because it's capital against a much smaller number than if they have to have a prime brokerage relationship and post margin money against the gross notional. So I still think regardless of how the swaps exemptions work out and how the major swaps participants are regulated that the trend there is very, very powerful."

I think we mentioned again that our Creditex revenues are 45% electronic. That more and more you're seeing people that have resisted electronic trading, starting to embrace elements of it because it's helping them to flatten out their books and manage risk better and the things that you would expect. We continue to invest heavily in the technology around Creditex and really, our thought of and want to continue to be thought of as the technology leader in that space. And so as a result of that, we are a force to be dealt with and a threat to people that aren't necessarily on board with us, and so we're always taking quite seriously there because people know they can see the investment that we're making, they can see the moves we're making, they can see how we realigned our broker incentives. And all of which is trending towards a world, where there's going to be more transparency. And so I feel pretty good about our footprint. There are other people that have the same aspirations and I think as I mentioned earlier, that I think people will come out of the woodwork with sass. But it's going to be very, very hard to challenge a lot of what we've done. We've now moved the Creditex system into our really world-class data centers. Put them on low latency networks, got them on high-value servers. We are making an investment in not a point-and-click system that a small group of market participants would use. But we're really building our systems out, in the anticipation that volumes are going to grow on them.

The Gasoil contract continues to perform very well. It is a global benchmark or the middle de-split, the diesel fuel that's popular in Europe. If you look at the overall growth on a year-over-year basis, WTI is a contract, which tends to be the more financially oriented speculative contract, where you actually see a decline year-over-year and you've  seen a fairly precipitous slowdown in the past few months.

So it seems like the early days in the oil business. Second thing that's happening that is benefiting us is that the market is starting to clear coal, the market is starting to clear some of the other basis points, delivery points for European natural gas. And so we see the kind of thing that we take for granted here in the U.S. for clearing and trading, really migrating to Europe in a bigger way and driving a lot of growth for us. And we have obviously a great footprint in Europe, so we've been a big net winner of that. I think when you couple our European climate on top of that, again, I think it just gives us again, a reason that we will have desktop space with our trading platform and a reason for our sales people to be in talking to traders and risk managers and all of that will continue I think to our benefit.

During the Q2 we delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of record revenue and our best quarter ever for operating income and adjusted earnings per share.

I’ll start on slide 4 this morning with some highlights from the first half of this year.  We’ll focus on our non-GAAP or adjusted operating results, as these are more indicative of our business performance.  As you can see, ICE continues to deliver consistent top and bottom line growth.  In the first half of 2010 we grew revenues 20% and adjusted expenses only 6%, resulting in adjusted net income attributable to ICE growing 32%, and operating cash flows up 42%.
This performance is a result of our focus on meeting the needs and demands of our customers and our disciplined approach to investments.  Our business model’s global reach, product diversity, and extensive clearing infrastructure differentiate our opportunity set and distinguish ICE from our competitors.  We provide solutions today and offer key building blocks for the solutions required tomorrow to help our customers navigate the evolution of regulations and markets.
Moving now to slide 5, I’ll review our Q2 results.  ICE’s consolidated revenues grew 18% to a record $296 million over last year’s Q2.  Adjusted net income attributable to ICE grew 35% to a record $113 million.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 34% to a record $1.51.  We’ve highlighted a few of the drivers of our performance on the right side of this slide.  Our global energy business remains strong, and growth in our financial futures markets continues to improve.  And importantly, the extensive work we’ve done on integrating acquisitions over the past three years is enabling operating margin expansion even as we continue to grow.
If you’ll turn to slide 6, I’ll cover our revenue and expense detail.  Q2 transaction and clearing revenues rose 19% to $265 million.  This includes $130 million from our Futures segment and $135 million from our OTC segment.  I also want to point out that our data business remains a solid contributor, with record revenues of $27 million in the Q2.  This is driven by the entry of new participants in our market and the resulting demand for our data.
Shifting to the right side of the slide, Q2 adjusted operating expenses increased just 1% versus Q2 ’09.  Adjusted operating margin improved to 61% compared to 54% in the Q2 of 2009.  Our non-brokerage operating margins improved to 67%.  
It’s worth noting that we continue to drive increases in our operating efficiency at Creditex despite the soft credit market.  For example, Creditex compensation as a percent of revenue actually improved in Q2 versus Q1 despite a sequential decline in revenues.  Our strategy of retaining the top brokers with mutually beneficial agreements while weeding out underperformers continues to pay off.  In terms of customer surveys and market share our Creditex team continues to rank highly and is recognized for their expertise, electronic capabilities, and service.  
In terms of compensation expense, we believe our paper performance culture is one of the keys to our success.  First, it is an investment in our ability to execute and innovate.  Second, it ties each employee’s compensation to the long-term success of our company.  These incentives largely come in a form of multi-year equity compensation rather than a one-time cash payout.  This provides continuity, stability and a highly specialized staff, and importantly, an employee population whose interests are fully aligned with our shareholders’.  While our average compensation per employee is higher than our competitors’, our employees also deliver more revenue, more profit, and more cash per person; or said more simply, our team delivers industry-leading returns on the investments we make in them.
Now let’s review each of our business segments, starting with the performance of our Global Futures Business on slide 7.  Consolidated Futures revenues were up 23% to $130 million over last year’s Q2.  Average daily volume was 1.4 million contracts, which was up 36% year-to-year.  We believe the current global economic uncertainty has increased the level of hedging in risk management by a wide range of industries globally.  During the Q2 and despite relatively lower volatility, sustained demand from Asia coupled with economic uncertainty drove continued volume growth in crude and refined oil products.  
We also saw continued improvement from our Financial Futures market, with record volumes in our Russell and US Dollar index futures.  Ag. futures were relatively flat following sugar’s sharp price decline in the Q1 of this year.  And yesterday, we reported a 13% increase in July 2010 average daily volume for ICE’s futures market.  Year-to-date through July average daily futures volumes is up 29%. 
I’ll walk through the Q2 performance in our OTC business, our eighth consecutive quarter of record revenues, on slide 8.  Consolidated OTC transaction revenues rose 15% in the Q2 to $135 million.  Average daily commissions in our Energy business rose 26% to $1.4 million.  Despite relatively low price volatility, each product class in our OTC Energy markets - gas, power, and oil - grew year-to-year.  With the successful introduction of new cleared oil products over the past 18 months we have continued to diversify our OTC business.  Oil revenues once again came in at record levels, with meaningful growth in all of our nuclear products.  And finally, in our OTC Energy business, July average daily commissions were $1.4 million, up significantly from last year and roughly consistent with our strong year-to-date performance.
In our CDS business, Q2 revenues totaled $43 million, down from $45 million last year.  This includes $27 million from Creditex and $16 million from ICE’s global CDS clearing business.  Creditex’s electronic transaction services accounted for 45% of our Q2 Creditex revenue.  Activity in the CDS Index and Single Name business remain soft, given the uncertain regulatory environment, and despite the relatively stronger performance in niche and more volatile sovereign and emerging market products.
We believe Creditex and our talented brokerage teams are well positioned for an eventual return of liquidity to the Creditex markets.  And as I note earlier we remain vigilant on expenses and efficiencies in this business, even as we work to maintain our leadership position and invest to deliver further innovation and automation to our customers. 
Turning to the CDS clearing business we have a solid sequential increase in clearing revenues in the Q2.  As we indicated previously, our 2010 guidance anticipated a gradual ramp in revenues throughout the year as we expand our clearing capabilities, add new members and customers, and await the recovery of the credit market.  We remain confident in the guidance we provided at the start of this year and we continue to be pleased with our progress in a very challenging and competitive environment.  ICE’s work has led to a sound global solution, even in the face of great regulatory and economic uncertainty.  We charted the course without a roadmap and we did so by being nimble and responsive.  We are uniquely positioned to continue to lead by building on our strong platform of services for the credit markets.
Today, we’re clearing over 230 CDS products and offer the most widely-adopted service in the US and Europe.  We expect to launch our European buy-side offering as well as clearing of sovereign CDS in the coming months, and we’ll be adding a number of operational enhancements that we worked with the industry to achieve.  While we remain in the early stages of the longer-term OTC clearing opportunity, ICE has delivered as promised.  We have the leading over-the-counter clearing solution in the US today and our CDS clearing business is contributing to profit and cash.
  Just two years ago each major exchange and clearinghouse globally was in a race to enter this business.  The strives we’ve made in tremendously complex asset classes speak to the strength of ICE’s clearing team, the confidence of our customers, and our robust technology infrastructure.  We constantly evaluate additional clearing opportunities that may exist and remain excited by the excellent opportunity in CDS today.
Let’s move to slide 9.  This chart demonstrates the diversity of our business.  The balance between our OTC and Futures revenues reflects our ability to serve the needs of both market structures, particularly amid a dynamic regulatory environment.  Our balanced geographic and product profiles has helped us to avoid the ups and downs of any single economy or market.  And importantly, we continue to see strong participation from commercial customers in our market.  This solid commercial base attracts other market participants and enables volume growth regardless of economic conditions, which was particularly well demonstrated by our consistent growth throughout the recent global downturn.
On slide 10 I’ll provide some color around our recent Climate Exchange transactions, which closed on July 8th.  We believe this combination is attractive both financially and operationally.  The European emissions business has been and remains robust, with 26% growth year-to-date through July; and we see several future growth drivers for the European emissions business including phase 3 of the European Emissions Trading Scheme, the addition of new industry groups, and the introduction of auctioning beginning in 2011.  
I also want to highlight a couple of the key guidance points in our Climate Exchange acquisition here and then encourage you to refer to our earnings release for additional information.  We’ve also provided pro forma financial information on our website.  We expect an immaterial impact to earnings related to CLE in the balance of 2010 and in 2011. We anticipate annualized expense synergies in the range of $13 million to $14 million, which is approximately a 60% reduction of CLE’s first half 2010 run rate.  These synergies come from leveraging our existing infrastructure for emissions market as a result of our long-standing partnership with Climate Exchange.  As has been true with all of our prior acquisitions, we will deliver the committed synergies even as we focus on growing our emissions business.
I’ll close on slide 11 by discussing the strength of our financial model.  We have consistently generated returns well in excess of our cost of capital and our competition.  We have produced 55% annual operating cash flow growth over the past five years, and this trend continued during the first half of 2010.  We have $300 million in available cash, low leverage, and significant available debt capacity.  We believe the current environment is ripe with opportunity for continued investment and growth for those companies with strategic vision and the ability to execute.  We are confident that we have the financial means and the demonstrated investment discipline to continue to put our capital to work to generate value and strong returns with our investors.
We filed our 10Q this morning and I encourage you to refer to this morning’s press release for further details on our performance and additional 2010 guidance.  Jeff, over to you.

1081952,106309045,72238,"IntercontinentalExchange, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-04-2010",2010-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good morning to those of you on the call.  Scott provided a comprehensive overview of our financial performance so I’ll take a few minutes to provide a brief overview of regulatory reform, beginning on slide 12.  The Dodd-Frank Wal",1594,"Thank you, Scott, and good morning to those of you on the call.  Scott provided a comprehensive overview of our financial performance so I’ll take a few minutes to provide a brief overview of regulatory reform, beginning on slide 12.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law last month, and it’s clearly a sweeping piece of legislation.  Its impacts will likely be felt by US consumers and businesses alike in the years to come.  While a portion of the bill’s broad mandates include increased clearing and transparent trade execution in large portions of the US OTC derivatives markets, its impacts, both positive and negative, won’t be known until its implementation is completed.  
So subject to that caveat I want to take this opportunity to talk to our shareholders about how we see certain aspects of the bill at this stage.  We’ll continue to update you throughout its implementation process.  The passage of the bill marks a start of the US regulatory rule-making process that is largely expected to occur over the next 12 months.  The CFTC, the SEC and other regulatory agencies have been charged with writing over 240 rule-makings and conducting dozens of studies.  
Nothing we can say here can anticipate any of the finer points of those rule-makings at this stage, but it appears that most of the rules will be implemented between 2011 and 2012.  My colleagues are already working with our customers to anticipate and deliver on the provisions and opportunities ahead of the implementation dates.
Within the derivatives title, which covers the swaps market, the clearing requirement will be a central part of the law, requiring financial companies to clear standardized swaps.  ICE’s global clearing infrastructure is a central component of our strategy for addressing new opportunities.  We have a solid head start in enabling many anticipated transitions, and we have a demonstrated ability to solve for the complexities of the over-the-counter markets.
In the last decade we took our over-the-counter energy swaps market from 2% cleared to 97% cleared.  Today, we are rapidly moving ahead in the credit default swaps market.  In both these cases we’ve managed through the complexities and uncertainties of the times to deliver customer solutions that have been widely adopted and have spawned new opportunities for us and our customers.  
With regard to the exchange trading requirements for standardized contracts, we’ve seen this transition occurring for several years even in advance of regulation, first in our energy markets and more recently in the credit default swam markets. Trade automation tends to be a natural consequence of standardization, and together we believe these fundamentals create a much larger addressable market.  Our Energy markets are the clearest example of this expansion taking place.
On a related note, you’ll hear the phrase “swaps execution facility,” or as many of us are calling it, SWEF, which is a designation that refers to a venue that allows multiple participants to interact with multiple participants in a given swaps market.  We anticipate that ICE, Creditex, and other execution venues will register for that designation.  Along with the SWEF registration, these venues must comply with core principles.  
These important principles are high standards to ensure market integrity.  ICE is today well positioned to meet these, having been an early leader in trade automation and market transparency.  Our technology was designed to serve the needs of the over-the-counter market via an electronic platform with extensive risk management tools.  Since the passage of the 2008 Farm Bill, the CFTC has had regulatory authority over ICE’s OTC Energy markets, and we have already implemented many aspects of what we believe will be similar to the SWEF requirements.
Finally, the swaps push out may require some banking firms to move parts of their swaps operations to non-bank affiliates.  Today, however, many of these operations already exist outside of the federally insured banking entities, and to the extent that additional trading opportunities will eventually be created, we’ve seen funds and other proprietary firms raising capital to take advantage of market opportunities.  As Scott mentioned, participation in our markets continues to rise. 
Turning now to CDS clearing, one of the major provisions of the bill becomes effective 360 days of the July enactment, where ICE Trust will be deemed a derivatives clearing organization with that status under the CFTC, and a clearing agency status under the SEC.  The CFTC and the SEC will become the frontline regulators of our CDS clearing operations.  We will be actively working with our members on this transition, and we do not anticipate any issues with compliance.  We’ve designed our model with flexibility to complete the transition, and we will retain access to the Federal Reserve for secure, overnight handling of our clearing deposits.
As Scott mentioned, there was no roadmap when we built and delivered the leading CDS clearing solution, though the bill now provides us with regulatory certainty that we need to continue to bring in more buy-side business.  Importantly, ICE’s model has both operational and regulatory advantages in terms of certainty and functionality.  We’re already actively clearing single-name CDS pursuant to an arrangement that we have in place with the SEC under the existing rules, and we will continue to expand these services over the next year without having to sit idle while the new rules are being developed.
Moreover, ICE’s CDS clearing solution is global.  We offer clearing for over 230 contracts and have $1 trillion in notional open interest with nearly $11 trillion in gross notional having been cleared.  Judging by the continued growth in these numbers each week, we started with the best and most legally certain model and next year we’ll make the transition to our ultimate new regulators. 
One last note here is the inclusion of a post-trade reporting provision for swaps.  This reporting requirement applies to cleared and non-cleared OTC transactions.  In the commodity markets today we operate a service that’s known as ICE eConfirm that we created with global commodity market participants years ago.  We see this technology playing a role in helping the industry to comply with post-trade reporting, using its efficient and secure technology.  
This is illustrative of the opportunities, large and small, that may emerge in the coming years.  While we don’t discount the risks associated with change, we believe the overriding demand for commodities and risk management will continue to play out over the coming decade, and, as you would expect, we’ll be very proactive on the opportunities that come with change.  Importantly, the strength in emerging market economies together with eventual economic recovery in the West all remain attractive secular growth opportunities for ICE over the long term.
So you can see my comments are consistent with what we’ve said in the past.  We believe the legislation acknowledges the central role of risk management that ICE has developed over the past decade.  It focuses on strengthening the system through increased transparency, capital requirements, and clearing.   And on balance as a leading provider of solutions for over-the-counter markets we’re very well positioned to continue to lead and grow given the opportunities that we see today.
While many in the market feared regulatory change - for example, the addition of position limits - our performance has been exceptionally strong.  After establishing position limits in our key natural gas swap markets in January of this year we’ve set consecutive quarterly record revenues.  I think this demonstrates that the overriding factors in our performance are indeed the commercial demand for our global markets.
I’ll close my prepared remarks on slide 13 with a discussion of our consistency in delivering on our strategy.  We’ve continued to leverage and expand on our expertise in infrastructure to serve new markets.  In the Q2 we marked the 10th anniversary of the company.  Obviously much has changed since our founding in year 2000.  We’ve grown our business organically and through M&A.  We’ve become more global and more diverse.  We’ve enabled the transformation from trading floors into electronic markets, and we were early in identifying the important role of clearing.  In that process we acquired century-old businesses, including four futures exchanges and three clearinghouses, while building two new clearinghouses.
Today we remain unique as an exchange with extensive infrastructure to serve both Futures and OTC markets, from both the buy side and the sell side, the front office and the back office, across execution, clearing, and processing.  We also anticipated and adapted to regulatory change, bringing transparency and new reporting tools where none previously existed.  Finally, our lean, fixed cost operating model continues to produce strong operating leverage.  In the five years since our IPO we’ve increased our adjusted operating margins to 61%, up from 48%. And ten years after our founding, our strategic principles haven’t changed.  We remain a growth company, driving growth globally.
These accomplishments are a tribute to the strong employee team we’ve assembled at ICE to drive results.  Managing a high growth company while navigating through the economic, competitive, and regulatory climate of recent years has not been easy.  However, our senior leadership team, together with our dedicated and customer-focused colleagues have consistently delivered on our objectives and we continue to look forward towards innovation to drive consistent best-in-class results over the long run.
So on behalf of my colleagues I again would like to thank our customers for treating us with their business.  And I’d like to thank my ICE team for their work in delivering ICE’s best quarter in our history.
We’ll now turn it back to the operator who will moderate our Q&A session.

So with that caveat I think a lot of the, let me deal with the bank customers first because they’re the ones that have the most impact I think under the bill.  Many of them are not waiting for all these rule-makings and are very quietly and quickly looking at how to organize their businesses.  A lot of our major Wall Street participants have put teams together to really go through the legislation in detail and to figure out what changes they may need to make to their businesses and they’re doing that very quickly.
And that’s a holistic view, too - it’s not just the trading of derivatives but it’s also the clearing of derivatives, the reporting and how these businesses are going to be capitalized going forward.  So I think that shift will happen very quickly and well ahead of rule-making in my mind.
The other thing you probably saw last week, Goldman Sachs came out and announced their new OTC clearing FCM initiative.  I think what you’ll be seeing is people that have prime brokerage and commodity lending and derivatives lending operations that really existed in a bilateral world, figuring out how to marry that or how to modify those to couple them with FCMs in what looks more like a futures type model; to ultimately create some hybrid that will sit in between.  And again, the FCM model I think will likely not change.  Many FCMs were low-capitalized businesses that had parent company guarantees.  People are looking at whether or not the regulated bank entity can continue to guarantee the FCM, whether FCM should be separately capitalized, what the rules may be in that regard. 
So I think you’re going to see some interesting changes happening, all of which I’m quite excited about and take as a positive because we’re developing tools and working with people, and modifying our footprint as that’s happening.  I think one of the great side benefits of CDS clearing, and I think one of the reasons we talk a lot about it is it’s evolving.  The footprint of how we do this is changing and it has been changing as our customers’ needs have been changing and the market’s needs have been changing.  So we’re really evolving with them and it, I think, positions us well for not just a return in the growth of credit, as the market comes out of a credit crisis, but across all the over-the-counter markets.

And that business has been impacted by just the downturn in the credit markets.  What we’ve seen is the business that’s going on right now, a lot of it has been around sovereign CDS as Europe has tried to work through its debt problem; and some niche markets that are basically people restructuring legacy positions that exist on their books, exiting them or putting risk management around them so that they can basically roll off at the end of their term.
That business is not that interesting or strategic to us.  We are working on clearing it; we think it will be a good business to clear.  But the bread and butter I really believe will ultimately be corporate credit risk management, and that’s going to probably be levered to the recovery of lending.  We have a lot of debt coming due, you know, I think there’s an overhang of people that are going to have to be refinancing going forward.  I think that’s going to drive the beginning recovery of those markets.  So I don’t think we have to wait necessarily for the West to recover out of the current economic downturn.

Is that just a function of the fee caps of dealers, why there’s somewhat of a disconnect there?

And more single name in the Q2 than first is what’s helped drive the revenue up on a sequential basis. It’s also clearly helping that we’ve continued to add new members and revenues from those new members as they bring their positions in certainly helps on a sequential basis as well, which again was consistent with what we said earlier this year, that we would expect a gradual increase quarter-to-quarter.  And think that’s what we’re seeing.
In terms of the buy side up tick, we are now at nearly $2 billion of cleared business from the buy side.  We’ve continued to see small progress each week from the buy side community. I’ll tell you, the feedback that we’re getting is mixed.  Some of the buy side sees…  I think everyone sees that clearing is inevitable and helpful to the market generally, but I think there’s a mixed view in terms of the rate and pace.  Some expect that they’re going to move well in advance of final rules; some want to wait and see how those final rules play out.  
So I feel good about our positioning with the buy side, the business we’ve gotten so far, the fact that we have a very active buy side community on our Advisory Committee.  And I would expect you will start to see some of that business accelerate through the second half of the year but then certainly as we get into 2011 as the rules become more clear.

Is it just, is it more volume, is it cutting the contract sizes over time to bring more participants in so you can get a real sort of matching dynamic going on an exchange?

And we continue to drive attachment as Scott mentioned with more and more buy side coming in through clearing and then moving straight through processing and other things.  So we feel good about, holistically about our footprint.
Where trading ultimately resides and how it moves is going to be highly determined by what the CFTC concludes that a SWEF is, and if you read the exact language in the bill it is not clear exactly how the model will work.  And there’s definitely going to have to be some interpretation by the CFTC.  And so the CFTC on the one extreme could really try to drive trading into a futures type model where you would expect to see a two-way bid offer, real time, pre-trade price transparency; or they could have slightly different standards that allowed multiple platforms including inter-dealer platforms, even existing dealer-to-client platforms could theoretically be there.
So it’s very hard to prejudge where that rule-making would come out.  I will tell you that I expect that when the rule-making comes out the responses are going to be like being hit with a fire hose.  There are so many people that are looking at his as an opportunity - existing service providers, exchanges, entrepreneurs who view this as a great new opportunity and so on and so forth.  And so many different business models across the various over-the-counter asset classes and pockets of trading that I think there’s going to be a vigorous debate and discussion around this.  
And so it’s very, very hard to prejudge because I have the bias that I think there’s a lot in the OTC market today and the CFTC’s going to have to kind of wade through that.

And what I don’t have great visibility to at that point is the overall results from our Creditex business.  And as you can imagine the compensation in that line is a bit sensitive to the revenue and the nature of the agreements we have, guarantees we hit, etc.  As I mentioned in my remarks, because of some of the actions of Grant Biggar and his team have taken to help make that business more efficient, we actually saw an improvement in our comp ratio in Q2 despite the fact that revenues were down Q1 to Q2, and I frankly didn’t see that coming.
I do though now expect those efficiencies will remain.  Our prior guidance was 60 to 62 of comp; I actually think we probably would have trended to the lower end or below that.   Even with the addition of the Climate Exchange business I wouldn’t expect us to be much beyond the $62 million to $63 million a quarter range.  So with the increase in the bonus for our terrific performance this year and the addition of Climate Exchange we’ve been able to manage efficiencies and keep our comp expense I think in a very reasonable range.

In the US while we have a very public debate in front of Congress and sort of real time reporting by the press on what’s going on, in Europe it’s much more of a quiet process.  A lot of, we have had dozens and dozens of meetings with various staff people working on legislation and I think that, you know, what is coming out, and it’s in some of the drafts so I’m not necessarily foreshadowing what you may not already know.  But we are going to see that the central banks and directly in our case, the Bank of England, will have a much stronger hand in overseeing clearing operations and the capital that goes along with clearing and protecting the economic systems of the central counterparties.  
And you’re going to have a new sort of pan-European regulator that is going to really be looking at the execution piece.  So our, right now for example in Europe we’re regulated by the FSA who oversees both clearing and trading.  So we expect to see sort of a slightly different footprint.
With that said, the, sort of the broad goals I think that are coming out of Europe are similar to what’s happening in the US but they’re a little less prescriptive, at least as they exist today.  They want a bias obviously more towards clearing and they want a bias towards more transparency in trading.  I think one good thing that came out of the discussions is that regulators are seeing the problem or potential problem of allowing clearinghouses to be linked up; the interconnection of clearinghouses could be no different than the interconnection of major banks.  So that issue now has come off the table, which is I think a good thing for us and frankly a position that we strongly agree with.
And so what’s left probably to be determined really is what their OTC trading requirements really look like and what asset classes are going to be pushed more towards exchanges.  There’s definitely a movement towards building trade repositories there where all trades that all governments can have access to those.  And I see somewhat of a mellowing of the internal strife that existed in Europe where there were debates about whether things should be located on the continent or can they remain in London, and so on and so forth.  And really the creation of this pan-European regulator should cover all of the members of the EU and allow information to be shared between governments, regardless of where clearinghouses or warehouses or trade execution facilities are located.  So I see that as a positive thing for us as well.

Most exchanges in the world are equity options and equity derivatives exchanges and interest rate exchanges, or a combination of those.  That’s really what most exchanges are in the world, and those tends to be the local interest rates and the local equity markets.  And so most exchanges are relatively levered to the true economic recovery or velocity of their domicile.
And while all of the exchanges around the world today are global in that they have screen distribution, the reality is that their products are regional.  And I think that you know and have probably given guidance to your customers about when to try to get in and out of those stocks, looking at the economic recovery of the local environment.
ICE is really different in that we are truly global and although our Energy business is centered largely in London, it’s really there because of the east/west time zone change.  And what we’re seeing is a dramatic movement of business that is coming out of the BRIC countries; and our customer base moving into those BRIC countries in order to build new businesses, to provide hedging tools and what have you.
And the velocity in our business and the volatility that’s coming in our business is largely being driven by the tension between a western economy that is slow to recover and a BRIC economy that is faster to recover, and people trying to figure out what that means for supply and demand.  And so you have this natural volatility.  And so the color I would give you is that it’s really, you’re really levered to this global economy and we’re also levered to the vagaries of the timing differences between various economies as they recover, and that’s creating volatility that just keeps our volumes high.
I would point out to you that we said in our statemtn that we have literally record open interest in July, so not only, and in our Energy footprint.  So not only have we had a great first half of the year; we’re entering the second half on top of really strong open interest, which we think will continue those trends.

In Creditex alone, one of our customers just benchmarked us and found that we are their #1 or #2 broker in everything that they do, and our error rate is incredibly low which is really because we’ve tried to push that team into much more automation and use these tools, like ICE Link and other things, to take errors out of the system.
That takes costs out of the system for our customers; ultimately they then give us more business.

Those two regulators, we have a close relationship with them and so they’ve been actively involved with us as we’ve been building out this model, which is why I mentioned that we don’t anticipate any problems in transitioning.
But what I think the unique new piece is is that the SEC is going to have to do rule-making and figure out what it’s, what is an FCM under SEC regulations?  And is it the same as the CFTC?  Are they going to work together and settle on something that might be slightly new?  We just don’t know. 
What we do see is our customers that have large OTC footprints in the primer brokerage area moving to bring you know, their futures clearing operation and their OTC prime brokerage operation together.  You saw JP Morgan reorganize those recently and put them under one person.  You saw Goldman last week announce that they were basically creating this hybrid.  So I think our customers are anticipating how to try to handle their customer business and position themselves, and I’m sure then as we go through this rule-making they’ll be talking to the SEC and the CFTC about how they think they can manage customer business.
It’s in the best interests of, the CFTC and the SEC are really trying to get more business into clearing and while there are buy side exemptions, I think Chairman Gensler has been very powerful on the fact that he really wants to try to build a footprint that attracts the buy side into clearing.

I think Ken, if you look at the chart we put out we showed how really the European business is the business that has been widely adopted and is growing quickly, and it’s the business we wanted to own and it’s the real value that we saw in that",510,"Sure.  I think Ken, if you look at the chart we put out we showed how really the European business is the business that has been widely adopted and is growing quickly, and it’s the business we wanted to own and it’s the real value that we saw in that acquisition.  The current US business in the Climate Exchange is a loss-making business as it exists today, and we are going to study it and talk to the market about how they view that business now and what they think we should do with it.  Those companies pay dues right now and obviously a delay in cap and trade is going to mean the dues and the amounts may go up.
Let me just describe briefly: in the US there is a voluntary cap and trade business that was organized by Doc Sandor.  It’s been widely used and it is voluntary.  And while we obviously focus on the trade piece these companies have voluntarily agreed to caps and to walk down their carbon footprint.  And it remains to be seen now in an uncertain US regulatory environment whether companies are going to want to continue to walk down their carbon footprint, whether or not they’re going to get credit for it by Congress; now that the EPA oversees carbon, whether or not the EPA is going to give them credit for the work that they’re voluntarily doing.  So that’s one question that we have to ask the marketplace.  
The second piece is that we trade NOX and SOX emissions, NOX and SOX emissions, and that has been challenged by some legal challenges that have affected the way that the EPA is looking at NOX and SOX trading.  It’s a bit destabilized right now. Again, we have to survey the market and ask them how do they feel about the footprint that we acquired there and do they want that to survive?
So the last piece that we’re also focusing on is that the Climate Exchange is a 25% owner of a carbon exchange that’s being built in China, and that is one of the few if not the only non-Chinese owner of an exchange in China.  And that is a joint venture that exists with the Chinese Oil Company.  So we are very, very excited about that particular footprint because it gives us a way to dialog directly with the Oil Company there; it gives us a footprint that we can work on in China.  I’ve been very loathed to have our employees flying around China trying to scare up business because of the expense and really the improbable hit rate that we were likely to have in that expense.  But this gives us something that we can lever off of, an anchor.
I don’t know how successful that will ultimately be but I do know that that is an important relationship that I think can pay dividends in many other businesses that we have over the long term.  So that is an exciting area that is a non-European business.

One is that Europe is facing in their carbon approach and so there are some additional phases that are yet to come in that we think will drive growth.  But I think the biggest synergy that we have, it’s really a revenue synergy and so as you know, it’s hard for shareholders to really get comfortable with a revenue synergy so we haven’t really advertised it too much.  
But the reality is in our mind the people that are really most impacted by the carbon caps are the utility and energy businesses, and those are our traditional customers.  And we have been working to give more and more offsets and other risk management tools to the utility footprint so that they can both trade power and natural gas on ICE and also you know, buy their carbon.  And so that is a very, very powerful coupling.  And while we had it before in our partnership with CLE, by bringing in the marketing people and the product development people into our ownership now and control we’ll be able to work much closer.
One of the first things we did after making this acquisition is move those people into our offices and immediately get them working with our existing people because we really do think we can drive higher revenue growth.

I mean in particular in the credit area where you seem to have somewhat of a frontrunner position, and we’ve talked to some dealers here and historically there’s been a lot of push back with Eur. ex. for example.  But it seems like dealers are gradually warming up to the idea that “Hey, a listed product might actually make sense given that the economics of the OTC markets have been coming down.”  So any ideas or anything you’re working on that you can share with us already?

And then the second piece is that this bill that I spent a lot of time talking about in my prepared remarks is really regulation of the over-the-counter markets.  It doesn’t really change much for futures, and there is certainly a lot of knowledge and legal certainty in the trading of futures.
  And so in my mind it provides and additional bias for people to say “Heck, maybe instead of trying to do all this stuff and comply and reorganize businesses and move capital around, and so on and so forth, maybe if we had some of the benchmarks listed as futures it would make our life easy.”  So I think what you’re picking up on is people who are really getting into the nuances of this legislation and trying to say maybe there are certain aspects that should not remain in the over-the-counter markets. 
And there’ll be a tension there so I don’t know that it necessarily will move things into futures, but there’s definitely much more openness to look at how futures and the over-the-counter markets play together.  We long ago saw that OTC and futures play together.  I mean one of the very first things I did after starting ICE was acquire a futures exchange and list OTC and futures that were related on one screen, and that helped drive our early growth.  And you’ve seen other asset classes where never the two shall meet, but you now see people in those asset classes saying “Wait a minute here, maybe we should get these markets closely linked together because in reality they are and regulators are pushing them that way anyway.”

I think there’s a lot of goodwill to try to do that and it does seem now like Europe is looking at the Dodd-Frank Bill and is trying to figure out what it likes about that, what it doesn’t like.  You know, it’s going to do things that will not be identical but the goal will be similar.  So I really do see that coupled with the fact that the US is starting to participate more in the BOSL (sp) discussions.  The US has been an observer in those discussions but I recently saw where Chairman Frank is taking those seriously.  And so you can see moves towards harmonizing the capital requirements, again driving things into clearing.
I do believe that as we put more regulation around particularly credit markets that it’s going to actually increase the amount of trading because it’s going to bring confidence to the buy side. You have a lot of people that manage and run institutional money that are very, very fussy about where they will place customer money.  They want it to be in transparent liquid markets that they can easily mark to market and so I think that the institutional buy side will participate much more in the credit business as it becomes more regulated.  That will be true you know, sort of long, lonely type money that will bring more market makers and nontraditional players into the market, and so you can just see how it could lever up.  But the underpinning is going to be a global regulatory footprint.
You know, we do clear in Europe and in the US and the models that we have there are similar.  There are some slight vagaries and as we move into this new world of what OTC futures commissions merchants look like there are some vagaries right now between the two models.  But I think we’re anticipating that a lot of those gaps will narrow as both, regulators on both sides sort of look to each other to see what each other is doing.

So you know, are we going to find that many of the large, traditional money managers are going to be considered major swaps participants or are they going to be considered the buy side?  And we have to, there’s a lot of chatter in the industry going on around that, a lot of uncertainty about you know, who will get roped into what requirements.  And I think until we really see that rule-making come out and get some sense of where we’re going it’s hard to know.
I think a good example though to look at is what’s gone on in our energy clearing business where there’s no regulation and everybody who clears there has been doing it voluntarily.  And what you find is that while it costs money to clear in the sense that you have to post margin and you get marked to market, and those are the kinds of things you hear the buy side concerned about in other asset classes - the reality is it nets down your potion.  And as we’ve shown in CDS, we’ve taken $11 trillion in notional down to $1 trillion.  So it’s collapsing at more than 10:1.
And so yes you have to post margin on the net amount, but the net amount can be for many people dramatically reduced from their notional.  And it’s that phenomena that brings the buy side in and they are willing to post capital because it’s capital against a much smaller number than if they have to have a prime brokerage relationship and post margin money against the post-notional.  But I still think regardless of how the swaps exemptions work out and how the major swaps participants are regulated that the trend there is very, very powerful.

We mentioned again that our Creditex revenues were 45% electronic.

And the oil business is a big business - it’s all the various delivery points for all the various products that come out of a barrel of oil.  So there’s a massive derivatives industry out there that has you know, base of trades and related product trades.  That is becoming standardized, more standardized so that we can clear it and it’s coming into clearing.  So it seems like the early days in the oil business.
The second thing that’s happening that is benefiting us is that the market is starting to clear coal, the market is starting to clear some of the other basis points, delivery points for European natural gas.  And so we see the kind of thing that we take for granted here in the US for clearing and trading really migrating to Europe in a bigger way and driving a lot of growth for us.  And we have obviously a great footprint in Europe so we’ve been a big net winner in that.
I think when you couple our European climate on top of that, again, I think it just gives us again a reason that we will have desktop space with our trading platform and a reason for our salespeople to be in talking to traders and to risk managers.  And all of that will continue I think to a new higher benefit.

So we feel very good about the returns we’re generating.  If you look from where we were a year ago to the day that return is starting to increase.

If you look at the US ag business, if you look at the energy business…  The financial products again, you have seen a bit of a down tick but on significant volume growth.  And so the overall volume growth has certainly outpaced the rate decline such that revenues have grown double digits on a year-over-year basis.

We're pleased to have delivered another solid quarter and to provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Our continued strong performance is driven by our global reach, product diversification and investment discipline. Together with an innovative customer-focused culture, we continue to develop solutions relied upon by our industry and with a dynamic financial services and risk management backdrop.
I'll start this morning on Slide 4, where I'll recap the first nine months of 2010. Please note that the numbers discussed this morning refer to our adjusted operating results, which we believe are more reflective of the performance of our business. In the first nine months of this year, revenues increased 17%, and adjusted expenses rose just 6%. This operating leverage enabled a 28% increase in adjusted net income attributable to ICE. Our operating cash flow also grew significantly through the first nine months, up 25% year-over-year. ICE's revenue growth reflects the rising demand for commodities, particularly from emerging economies and the clearing and risk management services we offer our customers. These are fundamental elements of the business model we have constructed to enable us to consistently generate strong returns for our shareholders.
Let's move to Slide 5 and discuss our third quarter results. Consolidated revenues grew 12% to $287 million over last year's third quarter. Consolidated net income attributable to ICE was $96 million. On an adjusted basis, net income attributable to ICE grew 21% versus 3Q '09. Diluted earnings per share grew 20% to $1.42. Our positioning in the global commodity markets continues to generate strong volume and revenue expansion. And our investments in CDS clearing are now contributing to our bottom line, even in advance of regulatory implementation. We are live with a profitable business.
Importantly, our disciplined approach to expenses once again, enabled us to grow the bottom line activity faster than the top line even as we integrated our latest acquisition and continue to invest in our key strategic initiatives. While I do not usually spend a lot of time talking about our tax rate, I'm sure you note that it was 32% in 3Q, and it's been at or below the end of our guidance range all year. Some of the improvement relates to cleanup of prior acquisitions in efforts to improve the efficiency of our tax structure. 
The more fundamental driver though is the continued strong growth of our business outside the U.S. We were in global operations and serve global customers in local jurisdictions. We have screens distributed in over 70 countries. We offer trading of commodities and clearing services that are globally relevant. In short, we have built perhaps the most global derivative exchange. And one important benefit of this model is as we continue to invest and grow and these lower tax jurisdictions, we are able to generate higher net margins and better overall returns.
We expect this trend will continue. Therefore, we believe that we will sustain a tax rate between 32% and 35% for the foreseeable future, a significant improvement from our prior guidance, which reflects our global business. It may seem like a minor point, but improving our tax rate over the long run is yet another means of enhancing shareholder return.
Turning now to Slide 6. I'll walk through the components of our revenues and expenses. Third quarter transaction and clearing revenues increased 12% to $256 million. Our OTC segment contributed $132 million, and our Futures segment contributes $125 million. Our Market Data business achieved record revenues of $28 million for the quarter. 
On the expense side, third quarter operating expenses of $136 million included transaction and severance charges related to our acquisition of the Climate Exchange or CLE. On an adjusted basis, operating expenses of $123 million increased 6% versus 3Q '09. All of the increase was contributed by the integration of CLE in 3Q. 
Adjusted operating margin improved to 57% compared to 55% in the third quarter of 2009. Non-brokerage operating margins were 63%. With regard to Creditex, we continue to deliver improved operating efficiencies even as we maintain our leadership position in our key products. We saw this benefit again in the third quarter, which enabled us to reduce our compensation expense line and provide improved guidance for the balance of the year.
Turning on Slide 7. I'll walk through our key business segments. In our Global Futures business, consolidated transaction including revenues grew 20% year-to-year to $125 million. Average daily volume for Q3 also grew 20% to 1.3 million contracts. For ICE Futures Europe, numerous articles continue to highlight an increasing commercial preference for Brent Crude as the global benchmark for light sweet crude oil. Also, our gas oil contract, which is European heating oil, is rapidly becoming a global benchmark for the refined oil market. Each of these contracts have seen not only strong volume growth but also strong growth and open interest. This has contributed to an overall 25% year-to-year increase in OI at ICE Futures Europe through October. 
In our European emissions futures market, where we completed the acquisition of the Climate Exchange in July, volume increased a healthy 15%. We're pleased with the leadership that the ECX products have in a very nascent or competitive European environmental market. In terms of our guidance on the CLE transactions, now that we have a final deal and the purchase accounting, we're maintaining our 2010 guidance and are pleased to note that we expect the transactions to be modestly accretive in 2011.
With regard to our agriculture market, we saw an 8% increase in volumes year-to-year in the third quarter and hedges returned due to continued growth in demand for commodities, rising volatility and increased crop production. September ag volumes were among the strongest in more than two years. One of the many recent Wall Street Journal articles on commodities pointed out that the recovery in the U.S. commodity sector is being seen in advance of that of the broader economy and largely due to exports to emerging economies such as China and Brazil. And we've seen healthy open interest in these markets, up 15% in October compared to September. 
I also want to highlight the healthy performance in our financial futures market, with 11% growth in our Russell Index contracts in the quarter despite the decline in U.S. cash equity market volume. Also, volume in our U.S. Dollar Index contract nearly tripled from the prior third quarter on strong FX volume trends globally. Given all of this, our futures exchanges achieved record ADV for the month of September, totaling 1.5 million contracts, an increase of 27% year-to-year. While we report on our October volume tomorrow, our preliminary October volumes are up about 24%, open interest is up at each exchange and we continue to lead our sector in terms of volume growth.
Moving now to Slide 8. I'll review our OTC business. Third quarter performance was driven by record OTC Energy volume. Transaction and clearing revenues for the segment increased 5% to $132 million for the quarter. Average daily commissions increased 9% to $1.4 million per day. While volatility in natural gas was about a third of last year's level and well below 2Q levels, nat gas revenue was up 18%. This lack of volatility, however, did impact our Power business, causing revenues to decline versus 3Q '09. We continue to see a solid base of business in North America, and we continue to add new users to our OTC market. 
Notably, our global Oil Swaps business continues to exhibit strong growth enabled by the addition of clearing. While oil revenues comprise a relatively small share of our total OTC Energy commissions relative to gas and power, that number is nearly doubled in just two years. We believe there is room for significant growth based on the activity we see in the global oil markets today. In October, average daily commissions are, once again, expected to be around $1.4 million. 
Turning now to our Credit Derivatives business. Revenues were $42 million versus $43 million in last year's 3Q. The decline came from CDS execution, which continues to operate in a spot market. However, 57% of Creditex revenues of $25 million were driven by electronic transaction services. The growth in Creditex's electronic revenues, which is up from 45% in the second quarter this year, highlights a couple of points. 
First, Creditex trading platform and post-trade automation, we're well positioned as the rules around financial reform take shape. Second, despite a decline in the credit derivatives activity following the financial crisis, we've stabilized margins as a result of automation while maintaining our market share due to a high level of service from our hybrid model. While it's difficult to predict when the CDS markets will improve, we're active in the discussions around revolving credit derivatives landscape and working with customers to strengthen our position for an eventual market recovery. 
Moving to the discussion of ICE's Global CDS Clearing business. Third quarter revenues increased 31% to $18 million compared to $13 million in the prior third quarter. To date, we've cleared over $13 trillion in CDS . Today, we cleared nearly 260 CDS products in the U.S. and Europe, and we're working with the industry to add new products and enhancements. As an example, we are operationally ready to launch our European buy-side offerings and clearing of sovereign CDS pending regulatory approval. Consistent with the full year guidance we provided earlier this year, we expect CDS clearing revenues in the range of $14 million to $16 million during the fourth quarter. We're pleased with the progress our clearing houses have made in a challenging and competitive environment and expect to build on our global solution to drive further efficiencies and seize the opportunities we see in clearing.
I'll wrap up my section on Slide 9 by discussing some important measures of our ability to generate both near-term and long-term value for our shareholders. We'd like to highlight these metrics not only because they're good but because they indicate that we entered new businesses with an eye toward growth and shareholder return. We maintain our competitive position by investing in initiatives that will enable us to reinvest in expanding our services. Our turns on invested capital remain around 17%, which is very strong on an absolute and relevant basis within and outside our sector. 
We've profitably expanded into new OTC and futures market and invested in new clearing solutions. While each investment features unique return profile, they all contribute to establishing our competitiveness, diversity and opportunity set. In addition to the consistent net income growth we've shown here, we've also consistently grown operating cash flow since our formation a decade ago. We remain opportunistic and thoughtful about uses of cash. 
During the third quarter, we completed two acquisitions, including the acquisition of CLE and today's announcement regarding trade capture OTC. We invested in technology and clearing, and we repurchased $90 million of ICE stock. This is indicative of the flexibility we have to approach our cash position opportunistically based on return. We ended the third quarter with $541 million in available cash, no leverage and good access to the debt market. There were a couple of updated guidance points in the earnings release, and we filed our 10-Q this morning. I encourage you to refer to these items for further details on our performance and our business. 
And, of course, I'll be happy to answer any questions during Q&A. Jeff, over to you."

I want to take a few minutes this morning to offer some perspective on our progress on the operational side of complying with regulatory reform. Then, I'll update you on our positioning relative to the secular growth trends that we are levered to over the near and long term. I spoke with you last quarter about some key aspects of financial reform legislation and how we are positioned within a unique market in clearing infrastructure.
The rulemaking is still underway in the U.S. and will continue over the coming months, and the European legislation is pending. While we don't have all the details, it's clear that these rules will call for increased regulation and transparency of all market venue, and as a result, will require substantial regulatory and reporting infrastructure. I'd like to preview today our strong operational position as a result of the multi-year initiatives that we've undertaken to meet the increased standards for transparency and compliance. These are capabilities to keep in mind as you hear other companies talk about the formation of Swap Execution Facilities, also coined as SEFs, in the coming months.
As we've mentioned in past calls, ICE prides itself on having developed one of the most flexible and modern technology infrastructures. While we like to talk about the fact that today, we have the fastest trade execution times in the futures industry, what we rely on most as an operator of market is our ability to maintain regulatory compliance to ensure confidence in our markets. Our exchanges are self-regulatory organizations and subject to multiple regulators, so we have a very high standard for compliance today. Accordingly, we leverage our strength in technology to meet these requirements. 
About three years ago, we began making extensive investments in leading compliance tools for our futures and for our over-the-counter markets. The first of these tools is a hardware system that sits alongside the database of our trading engine for both futures and OTC. This processing and analytics technology allows us to query our database in parallel as trading is happening. Our monitoring platform now does days worth of work in minutes. As a result, we have trade date plus one or T+1 compliance across our markets. T+1 compliance is the backbone of best practices for compliance and regulatory reporting. We then developed a system known as ICE Cap that sits on top of these systems to generate highly customized reports that complement our market monitor. We share these reports with regulators on a regular basis, and we've received a lot of positive feedback on our capabilities and the transparency we provide, particularly in the over-the-counter energy markets where these reports are being provided for the first time.
On top of this, we layer a couple of other key systems that are worth noting. Through our market surveillance application, we generate large trader reporting on a daily basis. While U.S. futures exchanges conduct this reporting, ICE Futures Europe reports its U.S.-linked contract as the only non-U.S. exchange that's providing a large trader reports to the CFTC for their commitments of trader report. In our over-the-counter energy markets, we're the only swap execution venue today regularly contributing to the CFTC large trader reporting system. 
We worked extensively with regulators and our customers in swaps market to implement this level of transparency. Today, over 90% of the contract volume traded on ICE's energy swaps markets are covered by significant price discovery contract requirement or SPDCs, which is essentially futures style regulation. This includes the imposition of position limits where ICE's swap marketplace is the only venue providing intraday reporting for the enforcement of position limits. As a result, ICE has been deemed to be in full compliance with the core principles for SPDCs required by the CFTC, and which we ultimately expect to be similar to SEF requirements. To our knowledge, no other swaps execution venue today meets these core principles.
Another key system we have invested in is a critical component of market supervision. This is a surveillance tool that provides immediate access to the database of bids, offers and trades to allow rapid evaluation of market activity around each trade and price level. For example, the detection of activity around a price spike or monitoring the accumulation of trades. This system is particularly helpful in monitoring the activity of high-frequency trading, given its immediacy and precision. 
On the point of realtime monitoring, ICE has developed a number of innovations to support risk management on behalf of our customers. Our energy clearing house has, for more than a year, margined its intraday positions in realtime, marking positions to market at five-minute intervals and now calling for capital as necessary. This provides greater market security as prices move throughout the day.
While some of the discussion around financial reform has shifted from protecting against systemic risk to promoting competition, we note that the existing global central counterparty clearing system works very well during the financial crisis. We believe regulators will be mindful of the operation of clearing houses during times of stress and carefully evaluate the trade-offs in permitting risk standards and practices that are not as stringent. Regulatory capabilities, risk management standards and technology investments are critical factors in operating a secure market in clearing infrastructure. And we believe these fundamentals will not be overlooked by regulators in striking a balance between competition and the reduction of systemic risk.
Similarly, increased systemic oversight is coming, and we've experienced this firsthand with our global OTC Clearing infrastructure for credit derivatives. Today, we operate ICE Trust, our CDS clearing house pursuant to regulation by the Federal Reserve. Together, the Fed, the SEC and the New York State Banking Department have put tremendously high standards in place for ICE Trust, which believe will become the norm for systemically important clearing houses. Both ICE Trust and ICE, the parent company, undergo Fed and SEC audits to confer compliance with rules and procedures. 
Similarly, earlier this year, the Bank of England designated ICE Clear Europe along with other clearing houses as systemically important institutions. While the regulatory process can be demanding, we are already doing what we believe the law will ultimately require others to be subject to as well. 
In terms of staffing to meet the demands of increased regulatory requirements for trading and clearing, we've added very senior experience market supervision and compliance experts to our teams in Chicago, New York, London and Atlanta. We also operate helpdesk that are well known in the industry for quickly troubleshooting and resolving issues. Together, these compliance, surveillance and support teams work closely with customers and with nine regulatory agencies that oversee ICE's global operations today. 
As I mentioned, ICE Futures Europe has oversight by two regulators, both the FSA and the CFTC, and that has been in place for a couple of years. So as financial reform calls for more layers of regulation, this is an environment in which we are already accustomed to operating. 
There are several other areas within financial reform where we believe we have a model for best practices related to the design of our markets. The first is with regard to high-frequency trading and the controls we have in place. As you saw around the May 6 market event, our futures exchanges were able to navigate as a result of the order types we accept as well as the lack of market fragmentation. For example, in our markets orders submitted outside of reasonability limits are accepted but not made tradable unless the market moves to bring them in within our limits. 
The price reasonability limits and other protection such as a maximum order size limit prevents the distortion of pricing and help ensure the integrity of markets, particularly in times of stress. On the concept of direct market access, the ICE platform offers the same connectivity alternatives and trading methodology to all customers. This is consistent with our approach to providing a level of playing field for all customers without preferential treatment at the connectivity or trading level. 
We also offer the same matching methodology to all of our market participants. In other words, we don't offer high-frequency traders or market makers a biased special algorithm, while offering individual traders less sophisticated versions of our matching technology. Related to our transparency and technology initiatives, this morning, ICE announced the launch of ICE Mobile, building upon our announced acquisition of trade capture OTC. This application, which is now available in the Apple App Store, was previously known as Tap and Trade. This is the first realtime mobile app for commodity market participants, upon which we will be building trading functionality as well. This service is representative of our unique ways in which we are leveraging technology to meet our customers' evolving needs for connectivity. 
To wrap up on this point, I think you could see that we've invested millions of dollars in technology, systems and compliance staff over the past several years. And today, we provide a great feel of transparency into the over-the-counter markets. As a result, our current expense run rate already reflects this infrastructure that should enable us to quickly be in compliance with financial reform requirements for our clearing houses and our execution markets. While we expect the rules in the U.S. and Europe to be implemented later in 2011 and into 2012, we're using these experiences today in working with customers to support their operations in the transition. 
I'll close my prepared remarks with a couple slides on ICE's positioning in the global derivatives market, which we believe is a key driver of our growth. On Slide 10, the diversity of our business shown here has resulted in ICE having exposure across five product categories. The balance between revenues from our OTC and futures markets provides the broad platform to provide clearing and execution in a range of markets. Strong participation by commercial customers in our markets is driven by the industrial relevance of our products such as Brent Crude, Gasoil and cotton, and it supports volume growth in a range of economic conditions. 
Liquidity in our markets is also supported by the important participation of liquidity providers such as funds, proprietary trading firms and algorithmic traders. And finally, the volumes we're seeing today are being driven by the strong demand for commodity and an increased demand for risk management in all regions of the world. With energy and agricultural commodity prices being globally reference benchmarks, ICE's products lead us in the new geographies and the new customers. 
As an example, Brent is used by as much as 70% of the global physical oil pricing across continents, and it's growing. Today crudes for Europe, Asia, Russia, the Middle East and Asia all price in relation to Brent. This is largely due to the ability to reflect global crude prices, but it's also Brent's physical flows being significantly larger than the size of physical flows of U.S. crude. 
One last fundamental I'll highlight is on Slide 11. The positive trends in open interest across all of our markets position us very well. Despite what continues to be a challenging time from a global economic perspective, the strong demand for commodities has resulted in consistency in our results. We have a global footprint as a result of our product set. And while I think you'll continue to see ICE become more global, it will likely be through these commodity products and expanding the role of our clearing houses in the risk management activities of companies located around the world. With exposure to emerging market economies and the eventual economic recovery in Western countries, we see attractive, secular growth opportunities over the long term. 
I'd like to thank our customers for their continued business, and I want to recognize the ICE team for enabling us to remain a leader in technology, growth and innovation.  I'll now ask our operator, Kathie, to moderate our Q&A session."

I was with my father-in-law over the weekend who's a farmer, and he's being told by the U.S. Department of Agriculture that there's probably -- their outlook is for a 30-year bull market in agricultural commodities, given the demands that the emerging economies food supplies are going to put on the global agri-business. And Scott and I just got back from China and met with the two largest oil companies in China. There are three in China in total, and we met with the two largest who are dealing with the fact that the Chinese government is changing the formula for pricing gasoline or they were using a moving average of 22 days where they would look at oil prices over a 22-day period and then based on that movement, decide whether or not to change the price of consumer gasoline. The government is going to make consumer gasoline more responsive to market conditions and is moving the window to a 10-day moving average. The anticipation is that with the growth in demand of transportation, they really want to expose their economy to more of the true price shocks. So that means more hedging requirements for the oil companies, which was the nature of the meetings that we were having over there. So anecdotally, we continue to see very strong global trends for energy and agriculture and have been fortunate that we position the company at the heart of that."

And so, any increase in capital requirements or being able to write customized swaps is going to ultimately be passed to the end user. So I tend to think that, that group that is having the conversations that is being heard, and that regulators are ultimately going to strike a balance that would have the market allow dealers and others to write customized, tailored OTC swaps, bilateral non-cleared customized swaps to end users but then turn right around and lay the bulk of that risk off in transparent liquid markets that are cleared, and I think that's where regulators are heading to. We obviously benefit by being the transparent regulated market with clearing. And so, I think it's long-term bullish for where we've positioned the company."

Now some of those firms are brother or sister with one another because of global organization, and that's just in the energy footprint that we have. So all of those companies are going to need to figure out how to deal with compliance, how to deal with SEFs. Frankly, many of them, their business model has been made illegal by Dodd-Frank. And so, contrast that with ICE and the over-the-counter markets have started the company and continued with the idea that we want to be transparent and standardized contracts, clear them and more recently, provide compliance over them. So we have a lot of systems that we may be able to provide to the marketplace at a moment in time that the marketplace may be faced with these investments. We'll have to see how the SEF rules play out. But the point here is that we see dozens and dozens of people talking about the need that they may have to go creates SEFs, and we've seen comments by regulators that they expect potentially a flurry of these things.

We've got a buy-side committee, where a lot of large buy-side firms have come in and said we want to work with you to help you refine and develop a system to make sure that it meets our needs and requirements as we move forward.

And what's going on there, I believe, is that most end-user customers do not become members of the clearing house. They approach clearing through an FCM. And these FCMs see the opportunity to create basically one-stop shopping for the end users and make them agnostic as to what clearing house ultimately gives you. And in fact, the prime broker clearer will actually make money by marshaling collateral around between clearing houses on behalf of customers. And so, I think by the time we get to full implementation of requirements for end-user clearing, you're going to see the structure in place.

And so, it was roughly $7 million in change of expense in the quarter, which you would expect to see come down in the fourth quarter because as we announced, it significantly reduced the population. We had about 66 people when we bought the company, and I think we'll be closer to 25 by the end of the year and then we'll reduce further into the first quarter. So $7 million unchanged and on its way down in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of next year. And then, the revenue, the incremental revenue, because remember, we are already getting up a lot of economics around the volume, incremental revenue in the quarter was around $7 million or $8 million as well.

And what's been amazing is that, while on the one hand, there's been a credit contraction, on the other side of that, we have really worked hard, Scott Hill oversees that business along with an on the ground senior management team at Creditex, we have been rapidly restructuring that business along that business plan starting years ago. And that means moving more of the business electronic. I think 57% of last quarter was electronic volume. Restructuring, compensation with people, so that they are no longer telephonic voice brokers but are brokers that are working around electronic platform. And as you've seen, even though the top line's going down, we've been doing very well. So we are prepared for a very large operating margin expansion in that business as it goes electronic.

Not again, necessarily direct correlation but I mentioned in my remarks that we've improved our tax rate as we look forward. And that's because we are seeing growth in customers outside the U.S. doing business in our London-based clearing house, our London-based exchange. So that's an indicator. I look at it anyway that said as our tax rate comes down, it's coming down because we're doing more business in a lower tax jurisdiction.

I think, Ken, Climate Exchange had a couple of businesses. They were geographically oriented. And so I think as you know from doing your modeling, the real value of that business is what's going on in Europe. And Europe is about ready to go to a new phase in climate change -- where they're going to require that more end-user customers, like airlines, start to buy carbon oxide. So we see regulatory trends, particularly in Europe, particularly favoring that footprint, which is where we have a dominant share. In the U.S., we've mentioned that the businesses here are really loss-making businesses. There's a very uncertain U.S. regulatory appetite for cap and trade. And we've announced recently that the voluntary market that was created had an expiration date of the end of this year in it. And the bulk of the users have said to us that they really don't want to continue to trade voluntarily in the absence of any credit for their work by the current administration. So we're downsizing that market so that it's simply a registry. And we'll continue to support those customers in doing what they want to do. But the trend is the other way the United States. We have footprints in Canada, China and Australia that came with that. Each of those is heading in a different direction. And amazingly, the area where there is a tremendous discussion and movement towards more carbon trading is coming out of China. And although it is not being driven by Kyoto-type or Copenhagen-type conversations, it's really being driven by the government wanting to allocate energy resources and deal with local pollution issues. And carbon there will be a good way of doing at that. So they're talking to the mayors of the major industrial cities about trying to put caps over their energy and usage in carbon footprint. And I think that interim dialogue bodes well for increased trading. We have, in the United States, while the federal government is uncertain of what's going to happen, there do tend to be growth in regional initiatives. And sort of strong I would say demand for continued use of renewables. And so we have regional gas listings and also renewable energy credits, and we're the top venue for that in the United States. And so we do see that business continuing. And that's kind of a landscape. But long term, we're bullish on this. And I think really if you step back on a macro level and say, here's the Chinese in an emerging, rapidly emerging economy wanting to put potentially some carbon limits self-imposed. That's really I think indicative of short of global thinking on energy."

I think again, in a macro level, the marketplace seems to want multiple providers in every asset class, but not so many as to become capital inefficient. And oddly, we started ICE with a pretty clear objective and we were not trying to make a statement. But over time, I think regulators and the marketplace have looked to the competition between ICE and NYMEX in both clearing execution and other services, and likes that footprint, likes it that we're highly competitive, that we keep each other in check and that we've had to innovate a lot to stay leaders in that space. So I think the market wants multiple providers. And I think some of what you see going on in the background is that. It's obvious that if you have a futures clearing infrastructure that you could potentially add on OTC and potentially get, with the right regulatory approvals, give some kind of margin offset. The market would also and I think people talk about that or write about that, but the market's also trying to go the other way, which is to create pools of OTC liquidity and pool I believe from look-alike contracts that way, so that it gets sort of the ICE-NYMEX dynamic going on. So what that suggests to me is that there are opportunities to be either the primary or the secondary clearing house in every asset class. And you have to decide whether you have the futures footprint to draw it one way or whether you can establish a pool of OTC liquidity to draw futures the other way. And I think you can probably go through asset class by asset class and start to identify where likely footprints will emerge."

So that we could roll out platforms widely or we could keep them very narrow, depending upon what the law contemplates and where we may be able to maximize our revenue."

And the U.S. Dollar Index had its heart at simply you think the dollar is getting stronger or weaker versus the rest of the world. And most FX, as you know, is traded in currency pairs. So for a person to hedge or speculate around the strengthening of a dollar, you've got to ask yourself compared to what, which means if you want to trade dollar-yen, you better have some intimate knowledge of what's going on in Japan and figure out the relative merits. The Dollar Index allows you to have a gut instinct over the dollar strengthening or weakening. And so, it appeals to retail traders. It appeals to corporates that want a simple way of hedging their exposure. And that's the way we're marketing. We benefit from the fact that the press also views it in that regard. Rick Santelli talks about it every morning when he's on the floor. And he's usually talked about before the market opens. It's an easy way to get your arms around that concept of strengthening or weakening of U.S. dollar. And so, we put more marketing muscle into selling it that way, and it's really picked up, and it's a nice contract for us, and it does give us exposure to the FX base, the FX traders, the algorithmic traders that can decompose the index. So there've been some positives spillover impacts for us as well."

Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. We’re pleased to have delivered another solid quarter and to provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Our continued strong performance is driven by our global reach, product d",1921,"Thanks, Kelly. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. We’re pleased to have delivered another solid quarter and to provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Our continued strong performance is driven by our global reach, product diversification and investment discipline, together with an innovative customer focused culture we continue to develop solutions relied upon by other industry under the dynamic financial services and risk management backdrop.
I’ll start this morning on slide four, where I’ll recap the first nine months of 2010. Please note that the numbers discussed this morning refer to our adjusted operating results, which we believe are more reflective of the performance of our business.
In the first nine months of this year, revenues increased 17% and adjusted expenses rose just 6%. This operating leverage enabled a 28% increase in adjusted net income attributable to ICE. Our operating cash flow also grew significantly through the first nine months, up 25% year-over-year.
ICE’s revenue growth reflects the rising demand for commodities, particularly from emerging economies and the clearing and risk management services we offer our customers. These are fundamental elements of the business model we have constructed to enable us to consistently generate strong returns for our shareholders.
Let’s move to slide five and discuss our third quarter results. Consolidated revenues grew 12% to $287 million over last year’s third quarter. Consolidated net income attributable to ICE was $96 million. On an adjusted basis, net income attributable to ICE grew 21% versus 3Q ‘09, diluted earnings per share grew 20% to $1.42.
Our positioning in the global commodity market continues to generate strong volume and revenue expansion. And our investments in CDS clearing are now contributing to our bottom line even in advance of regulatory implementation. We are live with a profitable business.
Importantly, our disciplined approach to expenses once again enabled us to grow the bottom line faster than the topline even as we integrated our latest acquisition and continue to invest in our key strategic initiatives.
While I do not usually spend a lot of time talking about our tax rate, I’m sure you note that it was 32% in 3Q and has been up or below the low end of our guidance range all year. Some of the improvement relates to cleanup of prior acquisitions in efforts to improve the efficiency of our tax structure. The more fundamental driver though is the continued strong growth of our business outside the U.S.
We run global operations and serve global customers in local jurisdiction. We have screen distributed in over 70 countries. We offer trading of commodities and clearing service that are globally relevant. In short, we have built perhaps the most global derivatives exchange and one important benefit of this model is that we continue to invest and grow in these lower tax jurisdictions. We are able to generate higher net margins and better overall returns.
We expect this trend will continue. Therefore, we believe that we will sustain a tax rate between 32% and 35% for the foreseeable future, a significant improvement from our prior guidance, which reflects our global business. It may seem like a minor point but improving our tax rate over the long run is yet another means of enhancing shareholder return.
Turning now to slide six, I’ll walk through the components of our revenue and expenses. Third quarter transaction and clearing revenues increased 12% to $256 million. Our OTC segment contributed $132 million and our futures segment contributed $125 million. Our market data business achieved record revenues of $28 million for the quarter.
On the expense side, third quarter operating expenses of $136 million included transaction and severance charges related to our acquisition of the Climate Exchange or CLE. On an adjusted basis operating expenses of $123 million increased 6% versus 3Q ‘09. All of the increase was contributed by the integration of CLE in 3Q. Adjusted operating margin improved at 57%, compared to 55% in the third quarter of 2009. Non-brokerage operating margins were 63%.
With regard to Creditex, we continue to deliver improved operating efficiencies even as we maintain our leadership position in our key products. We saw this benefit again in the third quarter, which enabled us to reduce our compensation expense line and provide improved guidance for the balance of the year.
Starting on slide seven, I’ll walk through our key business segments. In our global Futures business, consolidated transaction and clearing revenues grew 20% year-to-year to $125 million. Average daily volume for Q3 also grew 20% to $1.3 million contracts.
ICE Futures Europe, numerous article continued to highlight an increasing commercial preference for Brent Crude as the global benchmark for Light Sweet Crude Oil. Also our Gas Oil contract which is European Heating Oil is rapidly becoming a global benchmark to the refined oil market. Each of these contracts has seen not only strong volume growth but also strong growth in open interest. This has contributed to an overall 25% year-to-year increase NOI ICE Futures Europe through October.
In our European Emissions Futures market, where we completed the acquisition of the Climate Exchange in July, volume increased a healthy 15%. We are pleased with the leadership that the ECX products tab in the very nascent but competitive European environmental market.
In terms of our guidance on the CLE transaction, now that we have a final deal on the purchase accounting, we’re maintaining our 2010 guidance and are pleased to note that we expect the transaction to be modestly accretive in 2011.
With regard to our agricultural markets, we saw an 8% increase in volumes year-to-year in the third quarter that hedges return due to continued growth and demand for commodity, rising volatility and increased crop production. September ag volumes were among the strongest in more than two years.
One of the many recent Wall Street Journal articles on commodities pointed out that the recovery in the U.S. commodity sector is being seen in advance of that of the broader economy and largely due to the exports to emerging economy, such as China and Brazil, and we’ve seen healthy open interest in these markets up 15% in October, compared to September.
I also want to highlight the healthy performance in our Financial Futures market, with 11% growth in our Russell Index contracts in the quarter, despite the decline in U.S. cash equity market volumes. Also, volume in our U.S. Dollar Index contract nearly tripled from the prior third quarter on strong FX volume trend globally.
Given all of this, our Futures exchanges achieved record AVB for the month of September totaling 1.5 million contracts, an increase of 27% year-to-year. While we report on our October volumes tomorrow, our preliminary October volumes are up about 24%, Open Interest is up at each exchange and we the continue to lead our sector in terms of volume growth.
Moving now to slide eight, I’ll review our OTC business. Third quarter performance was driven by record OTC energy volume. Transaction and clearing revenues for the segment increased 5% to $132 million for the quarter. Average daily commissions increased 9% to $1.4 million per day, while volatility in natural gas was about a third of last year’s levels and well below 2Q levels, nat gas revenue was up 18%.
This lack of volatility, however, did impact our power business, causing revenues to decline versus 3Q ‘09. We continue to see a solid base of business in North America and we continue to add new users to our OTC market.
Notably, our global oil swaps business continues to exhibit strong growth enabled by the addition of clearing. While oil revenues comprise a relatively small share of our total OTC energy commissions relative to gas and power that number has nearly doubled in just two years. We believe there is room for significant growth based on the activity we see in the global oil markets today. In October, average daily commissions are once again expected to be around $1.4 million.
Turning now to our credit derivatives business, revenues were $42 million versus $43 million in last year’s 3Q. The decline came from CDS execution which continues to operate in a soft market. However, 57% of Creditex revenues of $25 million were driven by electronic transaction services. The growth in Creditex’s electronic revenues, which is up from 45% in the second quarter of this year highlights a couple of points.
First, with the Creditex trading platform and post trade automation, we’re well positioned if the rules around financial reform take shape. Second, despite a decline in the credit derivatives activity following the financial crisis, we’ve stabilized margins as a result of automation while maintaining our market share due to a high level of service from our hybrid model.
While it’s difficult to predict when the CDS markets will improve, we’re active in the discussions around the evolving credit derivatives landscape and working with customers to strengthen our position for an eventual market recover.
Moving to the discussion of ICE’s global CDS clearing business, third quarter revenues increased 31% to $18 million, compared to $13 million in the prior third quarter. To date, we’ve cleared over $13 trillion in CDS.
Today, we clear nearly 260 CDS products in the U.S. and Europe, and we’re working with the industry to add new products and enhancements. As an example, we are operationally ready to launch our European buy-side offering and clearance of sovereign CDS in a regulatory approval. Consistent with the full year guidance we’ve provided earlier this year, we expect CDS clearing revenues in the range of $14 to $16 million during the fourth quarter.
We’re pleased with the progress our clearing houses have made in a challenging and competitive environment and expect to build on our global solution to drive further efficiencies and seize the opportunities we see in clearing.
I’ll wrap up my section on slide nine by discussing some important measures of our ability to generate both near-term and long-term value for our shareholders. We like to highlight these metrics not only because they’re good but because they indicate that we enter new businesses with an eye toward growth and shareholder return.
We maintain our competitive position by investing in initiatives that will enable us to reinvest in expanding our services. Our returns on invested capital remain around 17%, which is very strong on an absolute and relative basis within and outside our sector. We’ve profitably expanded into new OTC and futures markets and invested in new clearing solutions. While each investment features unique return profile, they all contribute to establishing our competitiveness, diversity and opportunity set.
In addition to the consistent net income growth we’ve shown here, we’ve also consistently grown operating cash flows since our formation a decade ago. We remain opportunistic and thoughtful about uses of cash.
During the third quarter, we completed two acquisitions including the acquisition of CLE and today’s announcement regarding TradeCapture OTC. We invested in technology and clearing and we repurchased $90 million of ICE stock. This is indicative of the flexibility we have to approach our cash decisions opportunistically based on return.
We ended the third quarter with $541 million in available cash, no leverage and good access to the debt market. There are a couple of updated guidance points in the earnings release and we filed our 10-Q this morning. I encourage you to refer to these items for further details on our performance and our business and of course, I’ll be happy to answer any questions during Q&A.
Jeff, over to you.

I want to take a few minutes this morning to offer some perspective on our progress on the operational side of complying with regulatory reform. Then I’ll update you on our positioning relative to the secular growth t",1997,"Thank you, Scott, and good morning. I want to take a few minutes this morning to offer some perspective on our progress on the operational side of complying with regulatory reform. Then I’ll update you on our positioning relative to the secular growth trends that we are levered over the near and long-term.
I spoke with you last quarter about some key aspects of financial reform legislation and how we are positioned within a unique market and clearing infrastructure. The rule making is still underway in the U.S. and will continue over coming months and the European legislation is pending.
While we don’t have all the details, it’s clear that these rules will call for increased regulation and transparency of all market venues and as a result, will require substantial regulatory and reporting infrastructure.
I’d like to preview today our strong operation position as a result of the multiyear initiatives that we’ve undertaken to meet the increased standards for transparency and compliance. These are capabilities to keep in mind as you hear other companies talk about the formation of Swap Execution Facility, also coined as SEFs in the coming months.
As we’ve mentioned in past calls ICE price itself on having developed one of the most flexible and modern technology infrastructures. While we like to talk about the fact that today we have the fastest trade execution times in the futures industry, what we rely on most as an operator of market is our ability to maintain regulatory compliance, to ensure confidence in our markets.
Our exchanges are self-regulatory organization and subject to multiple regulators, so we have a very high standard for compliance today. Accordingly, we leverage our strength and technology to meet these requirements.
About three years ago, we began making expensive investments in leading compliance tools for our futures and for our over-the-counter markets. The first of these tools is a hardware system that fits along side the database of our trading engine for both futures and OTC. This processing and analytics technology allows us to query our database in parallel as trading is happening.
Our monitoring platform now does days worth of work in minutes. As a result, we have trade date plus 1 or T plus 1 compliance across our markets. T plus 1 compliance is the backbone of best practices for compliance and regulatory reporting. We then developed a system known as ICECAP that sits on top of these systems to generate highly customized reports to complement our market monitoring.
We share these reports with regulators on a regular basis and we received a lot of positive feedback on our capabilities and the transparency we provide, particularly in the over-the-the counter energy markets where these reports are being provided for the first time.
On top of this, we layer a couple of other key systems that are worth noting. Through our market surveillance application, we generate large trader reporting on a daily basis. While U.S. futures exchanges conduct this reporting, ICE Futures Europe reports its U.S. Link contracts as the only non-U.S. exchange that’s providing large trader reports to the CFTC for their commitment of trader report.
In our over-the-counter energy markets we’re the only swaps execution venue today regularly contributing to the CFTC large trader reporting system. We worked extensively with regulators and our customers in swaps market to implement this level of transparency.
Today, over 90% of the contract volumes traded on ICE’s energy swap market are covered by Significant Price Discovery Contract requirement or SPDC, which is essentially futures style regulation.
This includes the imposition of position limits where ICE’s swaps marketplace is the only venue providing inter-day reporting for the enforcement of position limits. As a result, ICE has been deemed to be in full compliance with the core principles for SPDC, required by the CFTC and which we ultimately expect to be similar to SEF requirements. To our knowledge, no other swaps execution venue today meets these core principles.
Another key system we’ve invested in is a critical component of market supervision. This is a surveillance tool that provides immediate access to the database of bids, offers and trades to allow rapid evaluation of market activity around each trade and price level.
For the example, the detection of activity around a price spike or monitoring the accumulation of trade, this system is particularly helpful in monitoring the activity of high frequency trading, given its immediacy and precision.
On the point of real-time monitoring, ICE has developed a number of innovations to support risk management on behalf of our customers. Our energy clearing house has for more than a year margined its inter-day positions in real-time, marking positions to market at five minute intervals and now calling for capital as necessary. This provides greater market security as prices move throughout the day.
While some of the discussion around financial reform has shifted from protecting against systemic risk to promoting competition, we note that the existing global central counterparty clearing system worked very well during the financial crisis. We believe regulators will be mindful the operation of clearing houses during times of stress and carefully evaluate the tradeoffs in permitting risk, standards and practices that are not as stringent.
Regulatory capabilities, risk management standards and technology investments are critical factors in operating a secure market and clearing infrastructure and we believe these fundamentals will not be overlooked by regulators in striking a balance between competition and the reduction of systemic risks.
Similarly, increased systemic oversight is coming and we’ve experienced this firsthand with our global OTC clearing infrastructure for credit derivatives. Today, we operate ICE Trust our CDS clearing house pursuant to regulation by the Federal Reserve.
Together, the Fed, the SEC and the New York State Banking Department have put tremendously high standards in place for ICE Trust, which we believe will become the norm for systemically important clearing houses. Both ICE Trust and ICE the parent company undergo Fed and SEC audits to confirm compliance with rules and procedures.
Similarly, earlier this year the Bank of England designated ICE Clear Europe along with other clearing houses as systemically important institutions. While the regulatory process can be demanding, we are already doing what we believe the law will ultimately require others to be subject to as well.
In terms of staffing to meet the demands of increased regulatory requirements for trading and clearing, we’ve added very senior experienced market supervision and compliance experts through our teams in Chicago, New York, London and Atlanta. We also operate help desks that are well-known in the industry, particularly trouble shooting and resolving issues.
Together, these compliance, surveillance and support teams work closely with customers and with nine regulatory agencies that oversee ICE’s global operations today. As I mentioned, ICE Futures Europe has oversight by two regulators, both the FSA and the CFTC and that has been in place for a couple years. So as financial reform calls for more layers of regulation, this is an environment in which we are already accustomed to operating.
There are several other areas within financial reform where we believe we have a model for best practices, related to the design of our markets. The first is with regard to high frequency trading and the controls we have in place.
As you saw around the May 6th market event, our Futures exchanges were able to navigate as a result of the order types we accept as well as the lack of market fragmentation. For example, in our markets orders submitted outside of reasonability limits are accepted but not made tradable unless the market moves to bring them within our limits.
The price visibility limits and other protections such as a maximum order size limit prevent the distortion of pricing and help ensure the integrity of markets particularly in times of stress. On the concept of direct market access the ICE platform offers the same connectivity alternatives and trading methodology to all customers.
This is consistent with our approach to providing a level playing field for all customers without preferential treatment at the connectivity or trading level. We also offer the same matching methodology to all of our market participants. In other words, we don’t offer high frequency traders or market makers a biased special algorithm while offering individual traders less sophisticated versions of our matching technology.
Related to our transparency and technology initiatives, this morning ICE announced the launch of ICE mobile, building upon our announced acquisition of TradeCapture OTC. This application, which is now available in the Apple App Store, which previously known as Cap & Trade, this is the first real-time mobile app for commodity market participants, upon which we will be building trading functionality, as well. This service is representative of our unique ways in which we are leveraging technology to meet our customers evolving needs for connectivity.
To wrap up on this point, I think you could see that we’ve invested millions of dollars in technology, systems and compliance staff over the past several years and today we provide a great deal of transparency into the over-the-counter markets.
As a result, our current expense run rate already reflects this infrastructure that should enable us to quickly be in compliance with financial reform requirements for our clearing houses and our execution markets.
While we expect the rules in the U.S. and Europe to be implemented later in 2011 and into 2012, we’re using these experiences today in working with customers to support their operations in the transition.
I’ll close my prepared remark with a couple of slides on ICE’s positioning in the global derivatives markets, which we believe is a key driver of our growth.
On slide 10, the diversity of our business shown here has resulted in ICE having exposure across five product categories. The balance between revenues from our OTC and futures markets provides a broad platform to provide clearing and execution in a range of markets.
Strong participation by commercial customers in our markets is driven by the industrial relevance of our products such as Brent Crude, Gas Oil and cotton and it supports volume growth in a range of economic conditions.
Liquidity in our markets is also supported by the important participation of liquidity providers such as funds, proprietary trading firms and algorithmic traders. And finally, the volumes we’re seeing today are being driven by the strong demand for commodities and an increased demand for risk management in all regions of the world.
With energy and agricultural commodity prices being globally referenced benchmarks, ICE’s products lead us into new geographies and into new customers. As an example, Brent has used by as much as 70% of the global physical oil pricing across continents and it’s growing.
Today, crudes for Europe, Asia, Russia, the Middle East and Asia all price in relations to Brent. This is largely due to the ability to reflect global crude prices but it’s also Brent’s physical flow has being significantly larger than the size of physical flows of U.S. crude.
One last fundamental I’ll highlight is on slide 11. The positive trends in open interest across all of our markets position us very well. Despite what continues to be a challenging time from a global economic perspective, the strong demand for commodities has resulted in consistency in our results.
We have a global footprint as a result of our product set and while I think you’ll continue to see ICE become more global, it will likely be through these commodity products and expanding the role of our clearing houses in the risk management activities of companies located around the world. With exposure to emerging market economies and the eventual economic recovery in western countries, we see attractive, secular growth opportunities over the long-term.
I’d like to thank our customers for their continued business and I want to recognize the ICE team for enabling us to remain a leader in technology, growth and innovation.
I’ll now ask our operator, Cathy, to moderate our Q&A session.

I was with my father-in-law over the weekend who is a farmer and he’s being told by the U.S. Department of Agriculture that there’s probably, their outlook is for a 30-year bull market in agricultural commodities, given the demands that the emerging economies food supply are going to put on the global agri business.
And Scott and I were just got back from China and met with the two largest oil companies in China. There are three in China in total and we met with the two largest, who are dealing with the fact that the Chinese government is changing the formula for pricing gasoline. They were using a moving average of 22 days, where they would look at oil prices over 22-day period and then based on that movement decide whether or not to change the price of consumer gasoline.
The government is going to make consumer gasoline more response to market conditions and is moving the window to a 10-day moving average. Anticipation is that, with the growth in demand of transportation, they really want to expose their economy to more of the true price shocks. So that means more hedging requirements for the oil companies, which was the nature of the meetings that we were having over there. So anecdotally, we continue to see very strong global trends for energy and agriculture and have been fortunate that we positioned the company at the heart of that.

And so any increase in capital requirements for being able to write customized swaps is going to ultimately be passed on to the end user.
So I tend to think that it’s that group that is having the conversation that is being heard and that regulators are ultimately going to strike a balance that would have the market allow dealers and others to write customized, tailored OTC swaps, bilateral non-cleared customized swaps to end users but then turn right around and lay the bulk of that risk off in transparent liquid markets that are cleared. And I think that’s where regulators are heading to. We obviously benefit by being the transparent regulated markets with clearing. And so I think it’s long-term bullish for where we position the company.

How do you -- you’ve been setting records and September was a record but at some point, when the local economies do improve, I’m not sure whether that’s now or when that is. But how would you view your growth when that -- when you actually do see improvements and say the equities or interest rate, the specifics in the local economy is improving?

I think it’s a good question because we believe we’re ultimately levered for that as well. I mean, if we get in a better growth environment, which should help the equities markets and again demand borrowing, which will create demand for interest rate rising, then you’re going to expect that the overall economy is rising, which means more global demand for commodities. So we saw during, sort of, the boom period over the last decade of interest rates and equities that we were growing very quickly, maybe even best-in-class and I think we’re exactly levered to that as well.

You can see that the buy side has started to clear, we’re at over $3 billion cleared, not a huge amount compared to $13 trillion but clearly buy side activity. And then the other thing, we talked about -- we don’t just talk to them on a side basis, they’re actually a formal part of our governance structure. We’ve got a buy side committee where the larger -- a lot of the large buy side firms have come in and said we want to work with you to help you refine and develop a system that makes sure that it meets our needs and requirements as we move forward.
So I read the report that you put out. And I think some of the commentary about them moving to clearing mid-to-later part of next year is probably right. But I think, we clearly demonstrated that we’ve got the leading CDS clearing platform. And I think the fact that they’re working with us as a part of our governance structure and are already testing with some clearing volumes today demonstrates that they see us as the leader and are going to come our way.

They approach clearing through an FCM.
And these FCMs see the opportunity to create basically one-stop shopping for the end users and make them agnostic as to what clearing house ultimately gets used. And in fact, the prime broker clearer will actually make money by marshalling collateral around between clearing houses on behalf of customers. And so I think by the time, we get to full implementation of requirements for end user clearing, you’re going to see this structure in place that’s going to allow multiple clearing houses to flourish and make end users agnostic.

Again, I don’t know a specific correlation but there’s no question that they do move together.

I think, Ken, Climate Exchange had a couple of businesses, they were geographically oriented and so I think as you know from doing your modeling, the real value of that business is what’s going on in Europe. And Europe is about ready to go to a new phase in climate change that -- where they’re going to require that more end user customers like airlines, start to buy carbon offsets.
So we see regulatory trends, particularly in Europe, particularly favoring that footprint which is where we have a dominant share. In the U.S. -- we’ve mentioned that the businesses here are really loss-making businesses. There’s a very uncertain U.S. regulatory appetite for cap and trade and we’ve announced recently that the voluntary market that was created had an expiration date of the end of this year in it and the bulk of the users have said to us that they really don’t want to continue to trade voluntarily in the absence of any credit for their work by the current administration.
So we’re down-sizing that market so that it’s simply a registry and we’ll continue to support those customers in doing what they want to do. But the trend is the other way in the United States. We have footprints in Canada, China and Australia that came with that. Each of those is heading in a different direction and amazingly, the area where there is a tremendous discussion and movement towards more carbon trading is coming out of China. And although it is not being driven by (inaudible) or Copenhagen type conversations, it’s really being driven by the government wanting to allocate energy resources and deal with local pollution issues and carbon will be a good way of doing that.
So they’re talking to the mayors of the major industrial cities about trying to put caps over their energy and usage and carbon footprint and I think that internal dialogue bodes well for increased trading. We have in the United States, while the Federal Government is -- it’s uncertain what’s going to happen, there do tend to be growth in regional initiatives and sort of strong I would say demand for the continued use of renewables and so we have regional gas listing and also renewable energy credits and we’re with the top venue for that in the United States.
And so we do see that business continuing and that’s kind of the landscape. But long-term, we’re bullish on this and I think really if you step back on a macro level and say here’s the Chinese in an emerging -- rapidly emerging economy wanting to put potentially some carbon limits, self-imposed. That’s really I think indicative of sort of global thinking on energy.

I think, again, at a macro level, the marketplace seems to want multiple providers at every asset class. But not so many as to become capital inefficient and oddly, we started ICE with a pretty clear objective and we were not trying to make a statement, but over time I think regulators and the marketplace has looked to the competition between ICE and NYMEX. And in both clearing execution and other services and likes that footprint, likes that we’re highly competitive, that we keep each other in check and that we’ve had to innovate a lot to stay leaders in that space.
So I think the market wants multiple providers and I think some of what you see going on in the background is that. It’s obvious that if you have a futures clearing infrastructure, that you could potentially add on OTC and potentially, with the right regulatory approvals give some kind of margin offset. The market would also -- and I think people talk about that and write about that. But the market’s also trying to go the other way, which is to create pools of OTC liquidity and pull, I believe some look-alike contracts that way so that it gets sort of the ICE, NYMEX dynamic going on.
So what that suggests to me is that there’s opportunities to be either the primary or the secondary clearing house in every asset class and you have to decide whether you have the Futures footprint to draw it one way or whether you can establish a pool of OTC liquidity to draw Futures the other way. And I think you could probably go through asset class by asset class of and start to identify where likely footprints will emerge.

We obviously have futures and then we have ICE’s energy, the swap execution platform which is many to many, highly regulated. We have a lot of physical type markets. We have the plus windows which are an auction methodology.
And we have the inter-dealer platform at Creditex and we also have the dealer to client platform at Creditex that was called QX. And so we pretty much have all of those. We’ve been investing in all of those to streamline those, to put it on industrial grade hardware, the right connectivity, the right kind of compliance and oversight around those. And we announced today that we have an iPhone app. We moved trade capture OTC over the last four months or so into our data center. That is launching today. It is absolutely real-time. You can hold your iPhone next to your futures screen or the OTC screen and you see the identical bid offer stacks.
So that is an industrial grade application that we think will further preference trading towards our footprint. So we don’t exactly know what a SEF definition is going to be and we certainly don’t know how Europe is going to deal with a similar kind of construct that they’re contemplating. But we have pretty much everything we need based on how it rolls out and the nice thing as you alluded to that Creditex gave us an opportunity to really understand the broker space, understand the work flow, understand how pays and collects work there, billing and what have you, what a broker needs on their screen and we have been investing in that this entire time, so that we could roll out platforms widely or we could keep them very narrow, depending upon what the law contemplates and where we may be able to maximize our revenue.

We have a royalty revenue share component that’s embedded in a security that these guys hold that give them -- that the original holders of the clearing corporation hold as part of that acquisition. And we have advisory committees, both the buy side and the risk management group, so two advisory committees that advise the Board and the Board has the ultimate say in those things.
The board is constituted as a majority of independents as defined by the NYSE independence standards for public companies. There is some talk about maybe having different independent standards around SEFs and clearing houses and what have you. So we’re not exactly sure how that will play out, but our thinking is an NYSE independent director is a pretty high standard.
So we don’t see really any potential changes needed to our footprint. If there were, I’m sure we would -- if things change, we’ve got very good relationship with our users and have been accomplishing the goals that users set out, particularly with respect to ICE trust, which was to get a footprint in place to start to get risk off the books and that’s been happening.

And the U.S. dollar index at its heart is simply -- you think the dollar’s getting stronger or weaker versus the rest of the world. And most FX as you know is traded in currency pairs. So for a person to hedge or speculate around the strengthening of the dollar you’ve got to ask yourself, compared to what, which means if you want to trade dollar, yen, you better have some intimate knowledge of what’s going on in Japan and figure out the relative merit.
The dollar index just allows you to have a gut instinct over, is the dollar strengthening or weakening? And so it appeals to retail traders. It appeals to corporates that want a simple way of hedging their exposure and that’s the way we’re marketing it. We benefit from the fact that the press also views it in that regard. And Kelly talk about it every morning when he’s on the floor and it’s usually talked about before the market opens. It’s an easy way to get your arms around that concept of strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar.
And so we put more marketing muscle into selling it that way and it’s really picked up and it’s a nice contract for us and it does give us exposure to the FX space, to FX traders, to algorithmic traders that can decompose the index. So there have been some positive spillover impacts for us as well.

We're pleased to have delivered another solid quarter and to provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Our continued strong performance is driven by our global reach, product diversification and investment discipline. Together with an innovative customer-focused culture, we continue to develop solutions relied upon by our industry and with a dynamic financial services and risk management backdrop.
I'll start this morning on Slide 4, where I'll recap the first nine months of 2010. Please note that the numbers discussed this morning refer to our adjusted operating results, which we believe are more reflective of the performance of our business. In the first nine months of this year, revenues increased 17%, and adjusted expenses rose just 6%. This operating leverage enabled a 28% increase in adjusted net income attributable to ICE. Our operating cash flow also grew significantly through the first nine months, up 25% year-over-year. ICE's revenue growth reflects the rising demand for commodities, particularly from emerging economies and the clearing and risk management services we offer our customers. These are fundamental elements of the business model we have constructed to enable us to consistently generate strong returns for our shareholders.
Let's move to Slide 5 and discuss our third quarter results. Consolidated revenues grew 12% to $287 million over last year's third quarter. Consolidated net income attributable to ICE was $96 million. On an adjusted basis, net income attributable to ICE grew 21% versus 3Q '09. Diluted earnings per share grew 20% to $1.42. Our positioning in the global commodity markets continues to generate strong volume and revenue expansion. And our investments in CDS clearing are now contributing to our bottom line, even in advance of regulatory implementation. We are live with a profitable business.
Importantly, our disciplined approach to expenses once again, enabled us to grow the bottom line faster than the top line even as we integrated our latest acquisition and continue to invest in a key strategic initiative. While I do not usually spend a lot of time talking about our tax rate, I'm sure you note that it was 32% in 3Q, and has been at or below the low end of our guidance range all year. Some of the improvement relates to cleanup of prior acquisitions in efforts to improve the efficiency of our tax structure. 
The more fundamental driver though is the continued strong growth of our business outside the U.S. We run global operations and serve global customers in local jurisdictions. We have screens distributed in over 70 countries. We offer trading of commodities and clearing services that are globally relevant. In short, we have built perhaps the most global derivatives exchange. And one important benefit of this model is that as we continue to invest and grow and these lower tax jurisdictions, we are able to generate higher net margins and better overall returns.
We expect this trend will continue. Therefore, we believe that we will sustain a tax rate between 32% and 35% for the foreseeable future, a significant improvement from our prior guidance, which reflects our global business. It may seem like a minor point, but improving our tax rate over the long run is yet another means of enhancing shareholder return.
Turning now to Slide 6. I'll walk through the components of our revenues and expenses. Third quarter transaction and clearing revenues increased 12% to $256 million. Our OTC segment contributed $132 million, and our Futures segment contributes $125 million. Our Market Data business achieved record revenues of $28 million for the quarter. 
On the expense side, third quarter operating expenses of $136 million included transaction and severance charges related to our acquisition of the Climate Exchange or CLE. On an adjusted basis, operating expenses of $123 million increased 6% versus 3Q '09. All of the increase was contributed by the integration of CLE in 3Q. 
Adjusted operating margin improved to 57% compared to 55% in the third quarter of 2009. Non-brokerage operating margins were 63%. With regard to Creditex, we continue to deliver improved operating efficiencies even as we maintain our leadership position in our key products. We saw this benefit again in the third quarter, which enabled us to reduce our compensation expense line and provide improved guidance for the balance of the year.
Starting on Slide 7. I'll walk through our key business segments. In our Global Futures business, consolidated transaction and cleariing  revenues grew 20% year-to-year to $125 million. Average daily volume for Q3 also grew 20% to 1.3 million contracts. For ICE Futures Europe, numerous articles continue to highlight an increasing commercial preference for Brent Crude as the global benchmark for light sweet crude oil. Also, our gas oil contract, which is European heating oil, is rapidly becoming a global benchmark for the refined oil market. Each of these contracts has seen not only strong volume growth but also strong growth and open interest. This has contributed to an overall 25% year-to-year increase in OI at ICE Futures Europe through October. 
In our European emissions futures market, where we completed the acquisition of the Climate Exchange in July, volume increased a healthy 15%. We're pleased with the leadership that the ECX products have in a very nascent or competitive European environmental market. In terms of our guidance on the CLE transactions, now that we have a final view on the purchase accounting, we're maintaining our 2010 guidance and are pleased to note that we expect the transactions to be modestly accretive in 2011.
With regard to our agriculture market, we saw an 8% increase in volumes year-to-year in the third quarter as hedgers returned due to continued growth in demand for commodities, rising volatility and increased crop production. September ag volumes were among the strongest in more than two years. One of the many recent Wall Street Journal articles on commodities pointed out that the recovery in the U.S. commodity sector is being seen in advance of that of the broader economy and largely due to exports to emerging economies such as China and Brazil. And we've seen healthy open interest in these markets, up 15% in October compared to September. 
I also want to highlight the healthy performance in our financial futures market, with 11% growth in our Russell Index contracts in the quarter despite the decline in U.S. cash equity market volume. Also, volume in our U.S. Dollar Index contract nearly tripled from the prior third quarter on strong FX volume trends globally. Given all of this, our futures exchanges achieved record ADV for the month of September, totaling 1.5 million contracts, an increase of 27% year-to-year. While we report on our October volume tomorrow, our preliminary October volumes are up about 24%, open interest is up at each exchange and we continue to lead our sector in terms of volume growth.
Moving now to Slide 8. I'll review our OTC business. Third quarter performance was driven by record OTC Energy volume. Transaction and clearing revenues for the segment increased 5% to $132 million for the quarter. Average daily commissions increased 9% to $1.4 million per day. While volatility in natural gas was about a third of last year's level and well below 2Q levels, nat gas revenue was up 18%. This lack of volatility, however, did impact our Power business, causing revenues to decline versus 3Q '09. We continue to see a solid base of business in North America, and we continue to add new users to our OTC market. 
Notably, our global Oil Swaps business continues to exhibit strong growth enabled by the addition of clearing. While oil revenues comprise a relatively small share of our total OTC Energy commissions relative to gas and power, that number has nearly doubled in just two years. We believe there is room for significant growth based on the activity we see in the global oil markets today. In October, average daily commissions are, once again, expected to be around $1.4 million. 
Turning now to our Credit Derivatives business. Revenues were $42 million versus $43 million in last year's 3Q. The decline came from CDS execution, which continues to operate in a soft market. However, 57% of Creditex revenues of $25 million were driven by electronic transaction services. The growth in Creditex's electronic revenues, which is up from 45% in the second quarter of this year, highlights a couple of points. 
First, Creditex trading platform and post-trade automation, we're well positioned as the rules around financial reform take shape. Second, despite a decline in the credit derivatives activity following the financial crisis, we've stabilized margins as a result of automation while maintaining our market share due to a high level of service from our hybrid model. While it's difficult to predict when the CDS markets will improve, we're active in the discussions around the evolving credit derivatives landscape and working with customers to strengthen our position for an eventual market recovery. 
Moving to the discussion of ICE's Global CDS Clearing business. Third quarter revenues increased 31% to $18 million compared to $13 million in the prior third quarter. To date, we've cleared over $13 trillion in CDS. Today, we cleared nearly 260 CDS products in the U.S. and Europe, and we're working with the industry to add new products and enhancements. As an example, we are operationally ready to launch our European buy-side offerings and clearing of sovereign CDS pending regulatory approval. Consistent with the full year guidance we provided earlier this year, we expect CDS clearing revenues in the range of $14 million to $16 million during the fourth quarter. We're pleased with the progress our clearing houses have made in a challenging and competitive environment and expect to build on our global solution to drive further efficiencies and seize the opportunities we see in clearing.
I'll wrap up my section on Slide 9 by discussing some important measures of our ability to generate both near-term and long-term value for our shareholders. We'd like to highlight these metrics not only because they're good but because they indicate that we enter new businesses with an eye toward growth and shareholder return. We maintain our competitive position by investing in initiatives that will enable us to reinvest in expanding our services. Our returns on invested capital remain around 17%, which is very strong on an absolute and relevant basis within and outside our sector. 
We've profitably expanded into new OTC and futures market and invested in new clearing solutions. While each investment features a unique return profile, they all contribute to establishing our competitiveness, diversity and opportunity set. In addition to the consistent net income growth we've shown here, we've also consistently grown operating cash flow since our formation a decade ago. We remain opportunistic and thoughtful about uses of cash. 
During the third quarter, we completed two acquisitions, including the acquisition of CLE and today's announcement regarding trade capture OTC. We invested in technology and clearing, and we repurchased $90 million of ICE stock. This is indicative of the flexibility we have to approach our cash decisions opportunistically based on return. We ended the third quarter with $541 million in available cash, no leverage and good access to the debt market. There are a couple of updated guidance points in the earnings release, and we filed our 10-Q this morning. I encourage you to refer to these items for further details on our performance and our business. And, of course, I'll be happy to answer any questions during Q&A. Jeff, over to you."
1081952,111542866,84076,"IntercontinentalExchange, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov-01-2010",2010-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good morning. I want to take a few minutes this morning to offer some perspective on our progress on the operational side of complying with regulatory reform. Then, I'll update you on our positioning relative to the secular growth tr",1995,"Thank you, Scott, and good morning. I want to take a few minutes this morning to offer some perspective on our progress on the operational side of complying with regulatory reform. Then, I'll update you on our positioning relative to the secular growth trends that we are levered to over the near and long term. I spoke with you last quarter about some key aspects of financial reform legislation and how we are positioned within a unique market and clearing infrastructure.
The rulemaking is still underway in the U.S. and will continue over coming months, and the European legislation is pending. While we don't have all the details, it's clear that these rules will call for increased regulation and transparency of all market venue, and as a result, will require substantial regulatory and reporting infrastructure. I'd like to preview today our strong operational position as a result of the multi-year initiatives that we've undertaken to meet the increased standards for transparency and compliance. These are capabilities to keep in mind as you hear other companies talk about the formation of Swap Execution Facilities, also coined as SEFs, in the coming months.
As we've mentioned in past calls, ICE prides itself on having developed one of the most flexible and modern technology infrastructures. While we like to talk about the fact that today, we have the fastest trade execution times in the futures industry, what we rely on most as an operator of markets is our ability to maintain regulatory compliance to ensure confidence in our markets. Our exchanges are self-regulatory organizations and subject to multiple regulators, so we have a very high standard for compliance today. Accordingly, we leverage our strength in technology to meet these requirements. 
About three years ago, we began making extensive investments in leading compliance tools for our futures and for our over-the-counter markets. The first of these tools is a hardware system that sits alongside the database of our trading engine for both futures and OTC. This processing and analytics technology allows us to query our database in parallel as trading is happening. Our monitoring platform now does days worth of work in minutes. As a result, we have trade date plus one or T+1 compliance across our markets. T+1 compliance is the backbone of best practices for compliance and regulatory reporting. We then developed a system known as ICE Cap that sits on top of these systems to generate highly customized reports that complement our market monitor. We share these reports with regulators on a regular basis, and we've received a lot of positive feedback on our capabilities and the transparency we provide, particularly in the over-the-counter energy markets where these reports are being provided for the first time.
On top of this, we layer a couple of other key systems that are worth noting. Through our market surveillance application, we generate large trader reporting on a daily basis. While U.S. futures exchanges conduct this reporting, ICE Futures Europe reports its U.S.-linked contract as the only non-U.S. exchange that's providing large trader reports to the CFTC for their commitments of trader report. In our over-the-counter energy markets, we're the only swaps execution venue today regularly contributing to the CFTC large trader reporting system. 
We worked extensively with regulators and our customers in swaps market to implement this level of transparency. Today, over 90% of the contract volume traded on ICE's energy swaps markets are covered by significant price discovery contract requirement or SPDCs, which is essentially futures style regulation. This includes the imposition of position limits where ICE's swaps marketplace is the only venue providing intraday reporting for the enforcement of position limits. As a result, ICE has been deemed to be in full compliance with the core principles for SPDCs required by the CFTC, and which we ultimately expect to be similar to SEF requirements. To our knowledge, no other swaps execution venue today meets these core principles.
Another key system we have invested in is a critical component of market supervision. This is a surveillance tool that provides immediate access to the database of bids, offers and trades to allow rapid evaluation of market activity around each trade and price level. For example, the detection of activity around a price spike or monitoring the accumulation of trades. This system is particularly helpful in monitoring the activity of high-frequency trading, given its immediacy and precision. 
On the point of realtime monitoring, ICE has developed a number of innovations to support risk management on behalf of our customers. Our energy clearing house has, for more than a year, margined its intraday positions in realtime, marking positions to market at five-minute intervals and now calling for capital as necessary. This provides greater market security as prices move throughout the day.
While some of the discussion around financial reform has shifted from protecting against systemic risk to promoting competition, we note that the existing global central counterparty clearing system is working very well during the financial crisis. We believe regulators will be mindful of the operation of clearing houses during times of stress and carefully evaluate the trade-offs in permitting risk standards and practices that are not as stringent. Regulatory capabilities, risk management standards and technology investments are critical factors in operating a secure market and clearing infrastructure. And we believe these fundamentals will not be overlooked by regulators in striking a balance between competition and the reduction of systemic risk.
Similarly, increased systemic oversight is coming, and we've experienced this firsthand with our global OTC Clearing infrastructure for credit derivatives. Today, we operate ICE Trust, our CDS clearing house pursuant to regulation by the Federal Reserve. Together, the Fed, the SEC and the New York State Banking Department have put tremendously high standards in place for ICE Trust, which we believe will become the norm for systemically important clearing houses. Both ICE Trust and ICE, the parent company, undergo Fed and SEC audits to confer compliance with rules and procedures. 
Similarly, earlier this year, the Bank of England designated ICE Clear Europe along with other clearing houses as systemically important institutions. While the regulatory process can be demanding, we are already doing what we believe the law will ultimately require others to be subject to as well. 
In terms of staffing to meet the demands of increased regulatory requirements for trading and clearing, we've added very senior experience market supervision and compliance experts to our teams in Chicago, New York, London and Atlanta. We also operate help desks that are well known in the industry for quickly troubleshooting and resolving issues. Together, these compliance, surveillance and support teams work closely with customers and with nine regulatory agencies that oversee ICE's global operations today. 
As I mentioned, ICE Futures Europe has oversight by two regulators, both the FSA and the CFTC, and that has been in place for a couple of years. So as financial reform calls for more layers of regulation, this is an environment in which we are already accustomed to operating. 
There are several other areas within financial reform where we believe we have a model for best practices related to the design of our markets. The first is with regard to high-frequency trading and the controls we have in place. As you saw around the May 6 market event, our futures exchanges were able to navigate as a result of the order types we accept as well as the lack of market fragmentation. For example, in our markets orders submitted outside of reasonability limits are accepted but not made tradable unless the market moves to bring them in within our limits. 
The price reasonability limits and other protection such as a maximum order size limit prevent the distortion of pricing and help ensure the integrity of markets, particularly in times of stress. On the concept of direct market access, the ICE platform offers the same connectivity alternatives and trading methodology to all customers. This is consistent with our approach to providing a level of playing field for all customers without preferential treatment at the connectivity or trading level. 
We also offer the same matching methodology to all of our market participants. In other words, we don't offer high-frequency traders or market makers a biased special algorithm, while offering individual traders less sophisticated versions of our matching technology. Related to our transparency and technology initiatives, this morning, ICE announced the launch of ICE Mobile, building upon our announced acquisition of trade capture OTC. This application, which is now available in the Apple App Store, was previously known as Tap and Trade. This is the first realtime mobile app for commodity market participants, upon which we will be building trading functionality as well. This service is representative of our unique ways in which we are leveraging technology to meet our customers' evolving needs for connectivity. 
To wrap up on this point, I think you could see that we've invested millions of dollars in technology, systems and compliance staff over the past several years. And today, we provide a great deal of transparency into the over-the-counter markets. As a result, our current expense run rate already reflects this infrastructure that should enable us to quickly be in compliance with financial reform requirements for our clearing houses and our execution markets. While we expect the rules in the U.S. and Europe to be implemented later in 2011 and into 2012, we're using these experiences today in working with customers to support their operations in the transition. 
I'll close my prepared remarks with a couple of slides on ICE's positioning in the global derivatives market, which we believe is a key driver of our growth. On Slide 10, the diversity of our business shown here has resulted in ICE having exposure across five product categories. The balance between revenues from our OTC and futures markets provides the broad platform to provide clearing and execution in a range of markets. Strong participation by commercial customers in our markets is driven by the industrial relevance of our products such as Brent Crude, Gasoil and cotton, and it supports volume growth in a range of economic conditions. 
Liquidity in our markets is also supported by the important participation of liquidity providers such as funds, proprietary trading firms and algorithmic traders. And finally, the volumes we're seeing today are being driven by the strong demand for commodity and an increased demand for risk management in all regions of the world. With energy and agricultural commodity prices being globally reference benchmarks, ICE's products lead us in the new geographies and the new customers. 
As an example, Brent is used by as much as 70% of the global physical oil pricing across continents, and it's growing. Today crudes for Europe, Asia, Russia, the Middle East and Asia all price in relation to Brent. This is largely due to the ability to reflect global crude prices, but it's also Brent's physical flows being significantly larger than the size of physical flows of U.S. crude. 
One last fundamental I'll highlight is on Slide 11. The positive trends in open interest across all of our markets position us very well. Despite what continues to be a challenging time from a global economic perspective, the strong demand for commodities has resulted in consistency in our results. We have a global footprint as a result of our product set. And while I think you'll continue to see ICE become more global, it will likely be through these commodity products and expanding the role of our clearing houses in the risk management activities of companies located around the world. With exposure to emerging market economies and the eventual economic recovery in Western countries, we see attractive, secular growth opportunities over the long term. 
I'd like to thank our customers for their continued business, and I want to recognize the ICE team for enabling us to remain a leader in technology, growth and innovation. I'll now ask our operator, Kathie, to moderate our Q&A session."

I was with my father-in-law over the weekend who's a farmer, and he's being told by the U.S. Department of Agriculture that there's probably -- their outlook is for a 30-year bull market in agricultural commodities, given the demands that the emerging economies food supplies are going to put on the global agri-business. And Scott and I just got back from China and met with the two largest oil companies in China. There are three in China in total, and we met with the two largest who are dealing with the fact that the Chinese government is changing the formula for pricing gasoline or they were using a moving average of 22 days where they would look at oil prices over a 22-day period and then based on that movement, decide whether or not to change the price of consumer gasoline. The government is going to make consumer gasoline more responsive to market conditions and is moving the window to a 10-day moving average. The anticipation is that with the growth in demand of transportation, they really want to expose their economy to more of the true price shocks. So that means more hedging requirements for the oil companies, which was the nature of the meetings that we were having over there. So anecdotally, we continue to see very strong global trends for energy and agriculture and have been fortunate that we position the company at the heart of that."

And so, any increase in capital requirements for being able to write customized swaps is going to ultimately be passed to the end user. So I tend to think that, that group that is having the conversations that is being heard, and that regulators are ultimately going to strike a balance that would have the market allow dealers and others to write customized, tailored OTC swaps, bilateral non-cleared customized swaps to end users but then turn right around and lay the bulk of that risk off in transparent liquid markets that are cleared, and I think that's where regulators are heading to. We obviously benefit by being the transparent regulated market with clearing. And so, I think it's long-term bullish for where we've positioned the company."

Now some of those firms are brother or sister with one another because of global organization, and that's just in the energy footprint that we have. So all of those companies are going to need to figure out how to deal with compliance, how to deal with SEFs. Frankly, many of them, their business model has been made illegal by Dodd-Frank. And so, contrast that with ICE and the over-the-counter markets have started the company and continued with the idea that we want to be transparent and standardize contracts, clear them and more recently, provide compliance over them. So we have a lot of systems that we may be able to provide the marketplace at a moment in time that the marketplace may be faced with these investments. We'll have to see how the SEF rules play out. But the point here is that we see dozens and dozens of people talking about the need that they may have to go create SEFs, and we've seen comments by regulators that they expect potentially a flurry of these things.

They're actually a formal part of our governance structure. We've got a buy-side committee, where a lot of large buy-side firms have come in and said we want to work with you to help you refine and develop a system to make sure that it meets our needs and requirements as we move forward. So I read the report that you put on, and I think some of the commentary about them moving the clearing mid to later part of next year, is probably right.

And what's going on there, I believe, is that most end-user customers do not become members of the clearing house. They approach clearing through an FCM. And these FCMs see the opportunity to create basically one-stop shopping for the end users and make them agnostic as to what clearing house ultimately gives you. And in fact, the prime broker clearer will actually make money by marshaling collateral around between clearing houses on behalf of customers. And so, I think by the time we get to full implementation of requirements for end-user clearing, you're going to see the structure in place.

And so, it was roughly $7 million in change of expense in the quarter, which you would expect to see come down in the fourth quarter because as we announced, it significantly reduced the population. We had about 66 people when we bought the company, and I think we'll be closer to 25 by the end of the year and then we'll reduce further into the first quarter. So $7 million in change and on its way down in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of next year. And then, the revenue, the incremental revenue, because remember, we were already getting up a lot of economics around the volume, the incremental revenue in the quarter was around $7 million or $8 million as well.

And that means moving more of the business electronic. I think 57% of last quarter was electronic volume. Restructuring, compensation with people, so that they are no longer telephonic voice brokers but are brokers that are working around an electronic platform. And as you've seen, even though the top line's gone down, we've been doing very well. So we are prepared for a very large operating margin expansion in that business as it goes electronic.

Not again, necessarila y direct correlation but I mentioned in my remarks that we've improved our tax rate as we look forward. And that's because we are seeing growth in customers outside the U.S. doing business in our London-based clearing house, our London-based exchange.

I think, Ken, Climate Exchange had a couple of businesses. They were geographically oriented. And so I think as you know from doing your modeling, the real value of that business is what's going on in Europe. And Europe is about ready to go to a new phase in climate change -- where they're going to require that more end-user customers, like airlines, start to buy carbon oxide. So we see regulatory trends, particularly in Europe, particularly favoring that footprint, which is where we have a dominant share. In the U.S., we've mentioned that the businesses here are really loss-making businesses. There's a very uncertain U.S. regulatory appetite for cap and trade. And we've announced recently that the voluntary market that was created had an expiration date of the end of this year in it. And the bulk of the users have said to us that they really don't want to continue to trade voluntarily in the absence of any credit for their work by the current administration. So we're downsizing that market so that it's simply a registry. And we'll continue to support those customers in doing what they want to do. But the trend is the other way in the United States. We have footprints in Canada, China and Australia that came with that. Each of those is heading in a different direction. And amazingly, the area where there is a tremendous discussion and movement towards more carbon trading is coming out of China. And although it is not being driven by Kyoto-type or Copenhagen-type conversations, it's really being driven by the government wanting to allocate energy resources and deal with local pollution issues. And carbon will be a good way of doing at that. So they're talking to the mayors of the major industrial cities about trying to put caps over their energy and usage in carbon footprint. And I think that interim dialogunalbodes well for increased trading. We have, in the United States, while the federal government is uncertain what's going to happen, there do tend to be growth in regional initiatives. And sort of strong I would say demand for the continued use of renewables. And so we have regional gas listings and also renewable energy credits, and we're the top venue for that in the United States. And so we do see that business continuing. And that's kind of a landscape. But long term, we're bullish on this. And I think really if you step back on a macro level and say, here's the Chinese in an emerging, rapidly emerging economy wanting to put potentially some carbon limits self-imposed. That's really I think indicative of sort of global thinking on energy."

I think again, in a macro level, the marketplace seems to want multiple providers in every asset class, but not so many as to become capital inefficient. And oddly, we started ICE with a pretty clear objective and we were not trying to make a statement. But over time, I think regulators and the marketplace have looked to the competition between ICE and NYMEX in both clearing execution and other services, and likes that footprint, likes it that we're highly competitive, that we keep each other in check and that we've had to innovate a lot to stay leaders in that space. So I think the market wants multiple providers. And I think some of what you see going on in the background is that. It's obvious that if you have a futures clearing infrastructure that you could potentially add on OTC and potentially get, with the right regulatory approvals, give some kind of margin offset. The market would also and I think people talk about that or write about that, but the market's also trying to go the other way, which is to create pools of OTC liquidity and pool I believe from look-alike contracts that way, so that it gets sort of the ICE-NYMEX dynamic going on. So what that suggests to me is that there are opportunities to be either the primary or the secondary clearing house in every asset class. And you have to decide whether you have the futures footprint to draw it one way or whether you can establish a pool of OTC liquidity to draw futures the other way. And I think you can probably go through asset class by asset class and start to identify where likely footprints will emerge."

We have the Platts Windows, which are an auction methodology. And we have the interdealer platform at Creditex, and we also have the dealer-to-client platform at Creditex that was called Q-WIXX. And so, we pretty much have all of those. We've been investing in all of those to streamline those, put it on industrial grade hardware, in the right connectivity, the right kind of compliance and oversight around those. And now, we announced today that we have an iPhone app. We've moved trade capture OTC over the last four months or so into our data center. That is launching today. It is absolutely realtime. You can hold your iPhone next to your futures screen or the OTC screen, and you see the identical bid offer stacks. So that is an industrial grade application that we think will further preference trading towards our footprint. So we don't exactly know what a SEF definition's going to be and we certainly don't know how Europe is going to deal with a similar kind of construct that they're contemplating. But we have pretty much everything we need based on how it rolls out. And you alluded to, the Creditex give us an opportunity to really understand the brokers base, understand the workflow, understand how pays and collects work there, billing and what have you, what a broker needs on their screen.

And the U.S. Dollar Index at its heart at simply you think the dollar is getting stronger or weaker versus the rest of the world. And most FX, as you know, is traded in currency pairs. So for a person to hedge or speculate around the strengthening of a dollar, you've got to ask yourself compared to what, which means if you want to trade dollar-yen, you better have some intimate knowledge of what's going on in Japan and figure out the relative merits. The Dollar Index just allows you to have a gut instinct over is the dollar strengthening or weakening. And so, it appeals to retail traders. It appeals to corporates that want a simple way of hedging their exposure. And that's the way we're marketing it. We benefit from the fact that the press also views it in that regard. Rick Santelli talks about it every morning when he's on the floor. And it's usually talked about before the market opens. It's an easy way to get your arms around that concept of strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar. And so, we put more marketing muscle into selling it that way, and it's really picked up, and it's a nice contract for us, and it does give us exposure to the FX base, the FX traders, the algorithmic traders that can decompose the index.

We're pleased to have delivered another solid quarter and to provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Our continued strong performance is driven by our global reach, product diversification and investment discipline. Together with an innovative customer-focused culture, we continue to develop solutions relied upon by our industry and with a dynamic financial services and risk management backdrop.
I'll start this morning on Slide 4, where I'll recap the first nine months of 2010. Please note that the numbers discussed this morning refer to our adjusted operating results, which we believe are more reflective of the performance of our business. In the first nine months of this year, revenues increased 17%, and adjusted expenses rose just 6%. This operating leverage enabled a 28% increase in adjusted net income attributable to ICE. Our operating cash flow also grew significantly through the first nine months, up 25% year-over-year. ICE's revenue growth reflects the rising demand for commodities, particularly from emerging economies and the clearing and risk management services we offer our customers. These are fundamental elements of the business model we have constructed to enable us to consistently generate strong returns for our shareholders.
Let's move to Slide 5 and discuss our third quarter results. Consolidated revenues grew 12% to $287 million over last year's third quarter. Consolidated net income attributable to ICE was $96 million. On an adjusted basis, net income attributable to ICE grew 21% versus 3Q '09. Diluted earnings per share grew 20% to $1.42. Our positioning in the global commodity markets continues to generate strong volume and revenue expansion. And our investments in CDS clearing are now contributing to our bottom line, even in advance of regulatory implementation. We are live with a profitable business.
Importantly, our disciplined approach to expenses once again, enabled us to grow the bottom line faster than the top line even as we integrated our latest acquisition and continue to invest in a key strategic initiative. While I do not usually spend a lot of time talking about our tax rate, I'm sure you note that it was 32% in 3Q, and has been at or below the low end of our guidance range all year. Some of the improvement relates to cleanup of prior acquisitions in efforts to improve the efficiency of our tax structure. 
The more fundamental driver though is the continued strong growth of our business outside the U.S. We run global operations and serve global customers in local jurisdictions. We have screens distributed in over 70 countries. We offer trading of commodities and clearing services that are globally relevant. In short, we have built perhaps the most global derivatives exchange. And one important benefit of this model is that as we continue to invest and grow and these lower tax jurisdictions, we are able to generate higher net margins and better overall returns.
We expect this trend will continue. Therefore, we believe that we will sustain a tax rate between 32% and 35% for the foreseeable future, a significant improvement from our prior guidance, which reflects our global business. It may seem like a minor point, but improving our tax rate over the long run is yet another means of enhancing shareholder return.
Turning now to Slide 6. I'll walk through the components of our revenues and expenses. Third quarter transaction and clearing revenues increased 12% to $256 million. Our OTC segment contributed $132 million, and our Futures segment contributes $125 million. Our Market Data business achieved record revenues of $28 million for the quarter. 
On the expense side, third quarter operating expenses of $136 million included transaction and severance charges related to our acquisition of the Climate Exchange or CLE. On an adjusted basis, operating expenses of $123 million increased 6% versus 3Q '09. All of the increase was contributed by the integration of CLE in 3Q. 
Adjusted operating margin improved to 57% compared to 55% in the third quarter of 2009. Non-brokerage operating margins were 63%. With regard to Creditex, we continue to deliver improved operating efficiencies even as we maintain our leadership position in our key products. We saw this benefit again in the third quarter, which enabled us to reduce our compensation expense line and provide improved guidance for the balance of the year.
Starting on Slide 7. I'll walk through our key business segments. In our Global Futures business, consolidated transaction and clearing  revenues grew 20% year-to-year to $125 million. Average daily volume for Q3 also grew 20% to 1.3 million contracts. For ICE Futures Europe, numerous articles continue to highlight an increasing commercial preference for Brent Crude as the global benchmark for light sweet crude oil. Also, our gas oil contract, which is European heating oil, is rapidly becoming a global benchmark for the refined oil market. Each of these contracts has seen not only strong volume growth but also strong growth and open interest. This has contributed to an overall 25% year-to-year increase in OI at ICE Futures Europe through October. 
In our European emissions futures market, where we completed the acquisition of the Climate Exchange in July, volume increased a healthy 15%. We're pleased with the leadership that the ECX products have in a very nascent or competitive European environmental market. In terms of our guidance on the CLE transactions, now that we have a final view on the purchase accounting, we're maintaining our 2010 guidance and are pleased to note that we expect the transactions to be modestly accretive in 2011.
With regard to our agriculture market, we saw an 8% increase in volumes year-to-year in the third quarter as hedgers returned due to continued growth in demand for commodities, rising volatility and increased crop production. September ag volumes were among the strongest in more than two years. One of the many recent Wall Street Journal articles on commodities pointed out that the recovery in the U.S. commodity sector is being seen in advance of that of the broader economy and largely due to exports to emerging economies such as China and Brazil. And we've seen healthy open interest in these markets, up 15% in October compared to September. 
I also want to highlight the healthy performance in our financial futures market, with 11% growth in our Russell Index contracts in the quarter despite the decline in U.S. cash equity market volume. Also, volume in our U.S. Dollar Index contract nearly tripled from the prior third quarter on strong FX volume trends globally. Given all of this, our futures exchanges achieved record ADV for the month of September, totaling 1.5 million contracts, an increase of 27% year-to-year. While we report on our October volume tomorrow, our preliminary October volumes are up about 24%, open interest is up at each exchange and we continue to lead our sector in terms of volume growth.
Moving now to Slide 8. I'll review our OTC business. Third quarter performance was driven by record OTC Energy volume. Transaction and clearing revenues for the segment increased 5% to $132 million for the quarter. Average daily commissions increased 9% to $1.4 million per day. While volatility in natural gas was about a third of last year's level and well below 2Q levels, nat gas revenue was up 18%. This lack of volatility, however, did impact our Power business, causing revenues to decline versus 3Q '09. We continue to see a solid base of business in North America, and we continue to add new users to our OTC market. 
Notably, our global Oil Swaps business continues to exhibit strong growth enabled by the addition of clearing. While oil revenues comprise a relatively small share of our total OTC Energy commissions relative to gas and power, that number has nearly doubled in just two years. We believe there is room for significant growth based on the activity we see in the global oil markets today. In October, average daily commissions are, once again, expected to be around $1.4 million. 
Turning now to our Credit Derivatives business. Revenues were $42 million versus $43 million in last year's 3Q. The decline came from CDS execution, which continues to operate in a soft market. However, 57% of Creditex revenues of $25 million were driven by electronic transaction services. The growth in Creditex's electronic revenues, which is up from 45% in the second quarter of this year, highlights a couple of points. 
First, Creditex trading platform and post-trade automation, we're well positioned as the rules around financial reform take shape. Second, despite a decline in the credit derivatives activity following the financial crisis, we've stabilized margins as a result of automation while maintaining our market share due to a high level of service from our hybrid model. While it's difficult to predict when the CDS markets will improve, we're active in the discussions around the evolving credit derivatives landscape and working with customers to strengthen our position for an eventual market recovery. 
Moving to the discussion of ICE's Global CDS Clearing business. Third quarter revenues increased 31% to $18 million compared to $13 million in the prior third quarter. To date, we've cleared over $13 trillion in CDS. Today, we cleared nearly 260 CDS products in the U.S. and Europe, and we're working with the industry to add new products and enhancements. As an example, we are operationally ready to launch our European buy-side offerings and clearing of sovereign CDS pending regulatory approval. Consistent with the full year guidance we provided earlier this year, we expect CDS clearing revenues in the range of $14 million to $16 million during the fourth quarter. We're pleased with the progress our clearing houses have made in a challenging and competitive environment and expect to build on our global solution to drive further efficiencies and seize the opportunities we see in clearing.
I'll wrap up my section on Slide 9 by discussing some important measures of our ability to generate both near-term and long-term value for our shareholders. We'd like to highlight these metrics not only because they're good but because they indicate that we enter new businesses with an eye toward growth and shareholder return. We maintain our competitive position by investing in initiatives that will enable us to reinvest in expanding our services. Our returns on invested capital remain around 17%, which is very strong on an absolute and relevant basis within and outside our sector. 
We've profitably expanded into new OTC and futures market and invested in new clearing solutions. While each investment features a unique return profile, they all contribute to establishing our competitiveness, diversity and opportunity set. In addition to the consistent net income growth we've shown here, we've also consistently grown operating cash flow since our formation a decade ago. We remain opportunistic and thoughtful about uses of cash. 
During the third quarter, we completed two acquisitions, including the acquisition of CLE and today's announcement regarding trade capture OTC. We invested in technology and clearing, and we repurchased $90 million of ICE stock. This is indicative of the flexibility we have to approach our cash decisions opportunistically based on return. We ended the third quarter with $541 million in available cash, no leverage and good access to the debt market. There are a couple of updated guidance points in the earnings release, and we filed our 10-Q this morning. I encourage you to refer to these items for further details on our performance and our business. And, of course, I'll be happy to answer any questions during Q&A. Jeff, over to you."
1081952,111542866,84197,"IntercontinentalExchange, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov-01-2010",2010-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good morning.

I want to take a few minutes this morning to offer some perspective on our progress on the operational side of complying with regulatory reform. Then, I'll update you on our positioning relative to the secular growth trends that we are levered to over the near and long term. I spoke with you last quarter about some key aspects of financial reform legislation and how we are positioned within a unique market and clearing infrastructure.
The rulemaking is still underway in the U.S. and will continue over coming months, and the European legislation is pending. While we don't have all the details, it's clear that these rules will call for increased regulation and transparency of all market venue, and as a result, will require substantial regulatory and reporting infrastructure. I'd like to preview today our strong operational position as a result of the multi-year initiatives that we've undertaken to meet the increased standards for transparency and compliance. These are capabilities to keep in mind as you hear other companies talk about the formation of Swap Execution Facilities, also coined as SEFs, in the coming months.
As we've mentioned in past calls, ICE prides itself on having developed one of the most flexible and modern technology infrastructures. While we like to talk about the fact that today, we have the fastest trade execution times in the futures industry, what we rely on most as an operator of markets is our ability to maintain regulatory compliance to ensure confidence in our markets. Our exchanges are self-regulatory organizations and subject to multiple regulators, so we have a very high standard for compliance today. Accordingly, we leverage our strength in technology to meet these requirements. 
About three years ago, we began making extensive investments in leading compliance tools for our futures and for our over-the-counter markets. The first of these tools is a hardware system that sits alongside the database of our trading engine for both futures and OTC. This processing and analytics technology allows us to query our database in parallel as trading is happening. Our monitoring platform now does days worth of work in minutes. As a result, we have trade date plus one or T+1 compliance across our markets. T+1 compliance is the backbone of best practices for compliance and regulatory reporting. We then developed a system known as ICE Cap that sits on top of these systems to generate highly customized reports that complement our market monitor. We share these reports with regulators on a regular basis, and we've received a lot of positive feedback on our capabilities and the transparency we provide, particularly in the over-the-counter energy markets where these reports are being provided for the first time.
On top of this, we layer a couple of other key systems that are worth noting. Through our market surveillance application, we generate large trader reporting on a daily basis. While U.S. futures exchanges conduct this reporting, ICE Futures Europe reports its U.S.-linked contract as the only non-U.S. exchange that's providing large trader reports to the CFTC for their commitments of trader report. In our over-the-counter energy markets, we're the only swaps execution venue today regularly contributing to the CFTC large trader reporting system. 
We worked extensively with regulators and our customers in swaps market to implement this level of transparency. Today, over 90% of the contract volume traded on ICE's energy swaps markets are covered by significant price discovery contract requirement or SPDCs, which is essentially futures style regulation. This includes the imposition of position limits where ICE's swaps marketplace is the only venue providing intraday reporting for the enforcement of position limits. As a result, ICE has been deemed to be in full compliance with the core principles for SPDCs required by the CFTC, and which we ultimately expect to be similar to SEF requirements. To our knowledge, no other swaps execution venue today meets these core principles.
Another key system we have invested in is a critical component of market supervision. This is a surveillance tool that provides immediate access to the database of bids, offers and trades to allow rapid evaluation of market activity around each trade and price level. For example, the detection of activity around a price spike or monitoring the accumulation of trades. This system is particularly helpful in monitoring the activity of high-frequency trading, given its immediacy and precision. 
On the point of realtime monitoring, ICE has developed a number of innovations to support risk management on behalf of our customers. Our energy clearing house has, for more than a year, margined its intraday positions in realtime, marking positions to market at five-minute intervals and now calling for capital as necessary. This provides greater market security as prices move throughout the day.
While some of the discussion around financial reform has shifted from protecting against systemic risk to promoting competition, we note that the existing global central counterparty clearing system is working very well during the financial crisis. We believe regulators will be mindful of the operation of clearing houses during times of stress and carefully evaluate the trade-offs in permitting risk standards and practices that are not as stringent. Regulatory capabilities, risk management standards and technology investments are critical factors in operating a secure market and clearing infrastructure. And we believe these fundamentals will not be overlooked by regulators in striking a balance between competition and the reduction of systemic risk.
Similarly, increased systemic oversight is coming, and we've experienced this firsthand with our global OTC Clearing infrastructure for credit derivatives. Today, we operate ICE Trust, our CDS clearing house pursuant to regulation by the Federal Reserve. Together, the Fed, the SEC and the New York State Banking Department have put tremendously high standards in place for ICE Trust, which we believe will become the norm for systemically important clearing houses. Both ICE Trust and ICE, the parent company, undergo Fed and SEC audits to confer compliance with rules and procedures. 
Similarly, earlier this year, the Bank of England designated ICE Clear Europe along with other clearing houses as systemically important institutions. While the regulatory process can be demanding, we are already doing what we believe the law will ultimately require others to be subject to as well. 
In terms of staffing to meet the demands of increased regulatory requirements for trading and clearing, we've added very senior experience market supervision and compliance experts to our teams in Chicago, New York, London and Atlanta. We also operate help desks that are well known in the industry for quickly troubleshooting and resolving issues. Together, these compliance, surveillance and support teams work closely with customers and with nine regulatory agencies that oversee ICE's global operations today. 
As I mentioned, ICE Futures Europe has oversight by two regulators, both the FSA and the CFTC, and that has been in place for a couple of years. So as financial reform calls for more layers of regulation, this is an environment in which we are already accustomed to operating. 
There are several other areas within financial reform where we believe we have a model for best practices related to the design of our markets. The first is with regard to high-frequency trading and the controls we have in place. As you saw around the May 6 market event, our futures exchanges were able to navigate as a result of the order types we accept as well as the lack of market fragmentation. For example, in our markets orders submitted outside of reasonability limits are accepted but not made tradable unless the market moves to bring them in within our limits. 
The price reasonability limits and other protection such as a maximum order size limit prevent the distortion of pricing and help ensure the integrity of markets, particularly in times of stress. On the concept of direct market access, the ICE platform offers the same connectivity alternatives and trading methodology to all customers. This is consistent with our approach to providing a level of playing field for all customers without preferential treatment at the connectivity or trading level. 
We also offer the same matching methodology to all of our market participants. In other words, we don't offer high-frequency traders or market makers a biased special algorithm, while offering individual traders less sophisticated versions of our matching technology. Related to our transparency and technology initiatives, this morning, ICE announced the launch of ICE Mobile, building upon our announced acquisition of trade capture OTC. This application, which is now available in the Apple App Store, was previously known as Tap and Trade. This is the first realtime mobile app for commodity market participants, upon which we will be building trading functionality as well. This service is representative of our unique ways in which we are leveraging technology to meet our customers' evolving needs for connectivity. 
To wrap up on this point, I think you could see that we've invested millions of dollars in technology, systems and compliance staff over the past several years. And today, we provide a great deal of transparency into the over-the-counter markets. As a result, our current expense run rate already reflects this infrastructure that should enable us to quickly be in compliance with financial reform requirements for our clearing houses and our execution markets. While we expect the rules in the U.S. and Europe to be implemented later in 2011 and into 2012, we're using these experiences today in working with customers to support their operations in the transition. 
I'll close my prepared remarks with a couple of slides on ICE's positioning in the global derivatives market, which we believe is a key driver of our growth. On Slide 10, the diversity of our business shown here has resulted in ICE having exposure across five product categories. The balance between revenues from our OTC and futures markets provides the broad platform to provide clearing and execution in a range of markets. Strong participation by commercial customers in our markets is driven by the industrial relevance of our products such as Brent Crude, Gasoil and cotton, and it supports volume growth in a range of economic conditions. 
Liquidity in our markets is also supported by the important participation of liquidity providers such as funds, proprietary trading firms and algorithmic traders. And finally, the volumes we're seeing today are being driven by the strong demand for commodity and an increased demand for risk management in all regions of the world. With energy and agricultural commodity prices being globally reference benchmarks, ICE's products lead us in the new geographies and the new customers. 
As an example, Brent is used by as much as 70% of the global physical oil pricing across continents, and it's growing. Today crudes for Europe, Asia, Russia, the Middle East and Asia all price in relation to Brent. This is largely due to the ability to reflect global crude prices, but it's also Brent's physical flows being significantly larger than the size of physical flows of U.S. crude. 
One last fundamental I'll highlight is on Slide 11. The positive trends in open interest across all of our markets position us very well. Despite what continues to be a challenging time from a global economic perspective, the strong demand for commodities has resulted in consistency in our results. We have a global footprint as a result of our product set. And while I think you'll continue to see ICE become more global, it will likely be through these commodity products and expanding the role of our clearing houses in the risk management activities of companies located around the world. With exposure to emerging market economies and the eventual economic recovery in Western countries, we see attractive, secular growth opportunities over the long term. 
I'd like to thank our customers for their continued business, and I want to recognize the ICE team for enabling us to remain a leader in technology, growth and innovation. I'll now ask our operator, Kathie, to moderate our Q&A session."

I was with my father-in-law over the weekend who's a farmer, and he's being told by the U.S. Department of Agriculture that there's probably -- their outlook is for a 30-year bull market in agricultural commodities, given the demands that the emerging economies food supplies are going to put on the global agri-business. And Scott and I just got back from China and met with the two largest oil companies in China. There are three in China in total, and we met with the two largest who are dealing with the fact that the Chinese government is changing the formula for pricing gasoline or they were using a moving average of 22 days where they would look at oil prices over a 22-day period and then based on that movement, decide whether or not to change the price of consumer gasoline. The government is going to make consumer gasoline more responsive to market conditions and is moving the window to a 10-day moving average. The anticipation is that with the growth in demand of transportation, they really want to expose their economy to more of the true price shocks. So that means more hedging requirements for the oil companies, which was the nature of the meetings that we were having over there. So anecdotally, we continue to see very strong global trends for energy and agriculture and have been fortunate that we position the company at the heart of that."

And so, any increase in capital requirements for being able to write customized swaps is going to ultimately be passed to the end user. So I tend to think that, that group that is having the conversations that is being heard, and that regulators are ultimately going to strike a balance that would have the market allow dealers and others to write customized, tailored OTC swaps, bilateral non-cleared customized swaps to end users but then turn right around and lay the bulk of that risk off in transparent liquid markets that are cleared, and I think that's where regulators are heading to. We obviously benefit by being the transparent regulated market with clearing. And so, I think it's long-term bullish for where we've positioned the company."

So we have a lot of systems that we may be able to provide the marketplace at a moment in time that the marketplace may be faced with these investments. We'll have to see how the SEF rules play out.

So the buy-side speech is now not just a speech, it's a demonstrable business that we actually run day-to-day. You can see that the buy side has started to clear. We're at over $3 billion cleared, not a huge amount compared to $13 trillion, but clearly, buy side activity. And then, the other thing we've talked about, we don't just talk to them on a side basis. They're actually a formal part of our governance structure. We've got a buy-side committee, where a lot of large buy-side firms have come in and said we want to work with you to help you refine and develop a system to make sure that it meets our needs and requirements as we move forward. So I read the report that you put on, and I think some of the commentary about them moving the clearing mid to later part of next year, is probably right. But I think we've clearly demonstrated that we've got the leading CDS clearing platform. And I think the fact that they're working with us is a part of our governance structure, and are already testing with some clearing volumes today demonstrates that they see us as the leader and are going to come our way."

And what's going on there, I believe, is that most end-user customers do not become members of the clearing house. They approach clearing through an FCM. And these FCMs see the opportunity to create basically one-stop shopping for the end users and make them agnostic as to what clearing house ultimately gives you. And in fact, the prime broker clearer will actually make money by marshaling collateral around between clearing houses on behalf of customers. And so, I think by the time we get to full implementation of requirements for end-user clearing, you're going to see the structure in place. It's going to allow multiple clearing houses to flourish and make end users agnostic."

And so as a result of having our clearing house there, we are the local provider, and the new products that we're rolling out for clearing, particularly in the oil business, tend to increasingly be these new base of swaps, in other words, new delivery points for the delivery of oil and largely, those tend to be moving East.

I think, Ken, Climate Exchange had a couple of businesses. They were geographically oriented. And so I think as you know from doing your modeling, the real value of that business is what's going on in Europe. And Europe is about ready to go to a new phase in climate change -- where they're going to require that more end-user customers, like airlines, start to buy carbon oxide. So we see regulatory trends, particularly in Europe, particularly favoring that footprint, which is where we have a dominant share. In the U.S., we've mentioned that the businesses here are really loss-making businesses. There's a very uncertain U.S. regulatory appetite for cap and trade. And we've announced recently that the voluntary market that was created had an expiration date of the end of this year in it. And the bulk of the users have said to us that they really don't want to continue to trade voluntarily in the absence of any credit for their work by the current administration. So we're downsizing that market so that it's simply a registry. And we'll continue to support those customers in doing what they want to do. But the trend is the other way in the United States. We have footprints in Canada, China and Australia that came with that. Each of those is heading in a different direction. And amazingly, the area where there is a tremendous discussion and movement towards more carbon trading is coming out of China. And although it is not being driven by Kyoto-type or Copenhagen-type conversations, it's really being driven by the government wanting to allocate energy resources and deal with local pollution issues. And carbon will be a good way of doing at that. So they're talking to the mayors of the major industrial cities about trying to put caps over their energy and usage in carbon footprint. And I think that interim dialogical bodes well for increased trading. We have, in the United States, while the federal government is uncertain what's going to happen, there do tend to be growth in regional initiatives. And sort of strong I would say demand for the continued use of renewables. And so we have regional gas listings and also renewable energy credits, and we're the top venue for that in the United States. And so we do see that business continuing. And that's kind of a landscape. But long term, we're bullish on this. And I think really if you step back on a macro level and say, here's the Chinese in an emerging, rapidly emerging economy wanting to put potentially some carbon limits self-imposed. That's really I think indicative of sort of global thinking on energy."

I think again, in a macro level, the marketplace seems to want multiple providers in every asset class, but not so many as to become capital inefficient. And oddly, we started ICE with a pretty clear objective and we were not trying to make a statement. But over time, I think regulators and the marketplace have looked to the competition between ICE and NYMEX in both clearing execution and other services, and likes that footprint, likes it that we're highly competitive, that we keep each other in check and that we've had to innovate a lot to stay leaders in that space. So I think the market wants multiple providers. And I think some of what you see going on in the background is that. It's obvious that if you have a futures clearing infrastructure that you could potentially add on OTC and potentially get, with the right regulatory approvals, give some kind of margin offset. The market would also and I think people talk about that or write about that, but the market's also trying to go the other way, which is to create pools of OTC liquidity and pool I believe from look-alike contracts that way, so that it gets sort of the ICE-NYMEX dynamic going on. So what that suggests to me is that there are opportunities to be either the primary or the secondary clearing house in every asset class. And you have to decide whether you have the futures footprint to draw it one way or whether you can establish a pool of OTC liquidity to draw futures the other way. And I think you can probably go through asset class by asset class and start to identify where likely footprints will emerge."

And then, we have ICE's Energy, the SPDC swap execution platform, which is many to many, highly regulated. We have a lot of physical type markets. We have the Platts Windows, which are an auction methodology. And we have the interdealer platform at Creditex, and we also have the dealer-to-client platform at Creditex that was called Q-WIXX. And so, we pretty much have all of those. We've been investing in all of those to streamline those, put it on industrial grade hardware, in the right connectivity, the right kind of compliance and oversight around those. And now, we announced today that we have an iPhone app. We've moved trade capture OTC over the last four months or so into our data center. That is launching today. It is absolutely realtime. You can hold your iPhone next to your futures screen or the OTC screen, and you see the identical bid offer stacks. So that is an industrial grade application that we think will further preference trading towards our footprint. So we don't exactly know what a SEF definition's going to be and we certainly don't know how Europe is going to deal with a similar kind of construct that they're contemplating. But we have pretty much everything we need based on how it rolls out. And you alluded to, the Creditex give us an opportunity to really understand the brokers base, understand the workflow, understand how pays and collects work there, billing and what have you, what a broker needs on their screen.

The Dollar Index just allows you to have a gut instinct over is the dollar strengthening or weakening. And so, it appeals to retail traders. It appeals to corporates that want a simple way of hedging their exposure. And that's the way we're marketing it. We benefit from the fact that the press also views it in that regard.
