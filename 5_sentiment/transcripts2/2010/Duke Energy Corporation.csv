My name is Stephen De May, I'm Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations for the company. We're glad you could be with us today and we look forward to an ongoing dialogue with the messages you'll hear today. Todays discussions is being webcast. It will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information on this slide, as well as additional information contained in our SEC filing, concerning factors that could cause future results to differ from these forward-looking information. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website and in today's materials. Now let me describe today's format. In a moment, I'll turn the program over to Jim Rogers, our Chairman, President and CEO, who will open the meeting by reviewing our 2009 accomplishments and providing the strategic framework for this morning's presentation. Following Jim, several of our Senior Executives whom I will introduce shortly, will walk through the different parts of our business. We'll take a couple of questions after each section, but we reserve time at the end of the meeting for the entire team to take your questions. Since today's meeting is being webcast, please wait for the microphone to be presented before asking a question.I'd like to start of today's discussion with an overview of Duke Energy's business mix and corporate structure, which will provide helpful context for the presentation that follow. Looking first to Slide 5, you can see Duke Energy's current portfolio broken out by each of the three business segments. You'll note that three quarters of our business mix is associated with the regulated utility in Franchised Electric and Gas, our largest business segment. FE&G operates 27,000 megawatts of generation and just transmits, distributes and sells electricity in five states. It also transports and sells natural gas in Southwestern Ohio and Northern Kentucky. Our Commercial Power segment operates 7,600 megawatts of non-regulated generation in the Midwest. That segment also has wind asset in various parts of the country and recently announced its first solar project. Finally, our International Energy segment operates 4,000 megawatts of generation facilities in Latin America and also some equity investments in National Methanol Company located in Saudi Arabia.During today's presentation, you will hear references to both the business segment I just described as well as our operating company. This slide visually depicts the relationship between these entities. As you can see, our business segment are portrayed by the organizational chart and our primary legal or operating companies are portrayed by the gray boxes to the left of the organization chart. Our primary operating companies include Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Ohio, which is the parent of Duke Energy Kentucky. These entities, along with the Duke Energy Holding Company shown at the top, are also SEC registrants. One of the most helpful aspects of this graphic is that it shows how Duke Ohio uniquely incorporates businesses from both our FE&G and Commercial Power segments. Now it is my pleasure to present today's speakers, all of whom are Group Executives of Duke Energy and report directly to Jim Rogers. After Jim's opening remarks, you'll hear first from Jim Turner. Jim is President and the Chief Operating Officer of the FE&G segment. His responsibilities are summarized on this slide as they are for each of our speakers. Next up will be Dhiaa Jamil. Dhiaa is Chief Generation Officer and Chief Nuclear Officer for Duke Energy, encompassing the entire regulated generation fleet. After Dhiaa, you will hear from Keith Trent. Keith is President of Duke Energy's Commercial businesses, which includes the Commercial Power and International Energy segments I described a moment ago.Our final presentation this morning comes from Lynn Good. As Duke Energy's Chief Financial Officer, Lynn's oversight spans the traditional Finance-related functions. Finally, I would also like to introduce Marc Manly, sitting here in the front. Marc is Group Executive and Chief Legal Officer for Duke Energy. He will join the others for the general Q&A session at the back end of the meeting. Thank you again for joining us this morning and now I'd like to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Rogers. Jim?"

This global cooling is beginning to be a problem, particularly for our politicians in Washington. We really appreciate your interest in our company and for your investment in Duke Energy. We're going to work very hard today to follow the script. In fact, they told me a I've already deviated from the script. This will be my last deviation. That we have worked very hard and I want you to hang on every word that we say because every word has been edited and re-edited about eight times. But we think it will be far more effective in getting the message to you in a clear way by following the script, and then leaving plenty of time for Q&A at the end of our presentation.Before I provide an overview of today's session, let me briefly summarize our year end results. As you can see when the glasses go on, I am very close to the script. As you saw in our earnings release on Friday, we announced adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2009 of $1.22 compared to $1.21 for '08. Those results exceeded our 2009 employee incentive target of $1.20 on adjusted diluted earnings per share basis. I am proud of our performance in the face of a tough economy, our employees made this happen last year. I appreciate their commitment, dedication and hard work and a one word to them, thanks.Also it's a difficult and challenging year for our customers, our entire industry and for us. Our retail load was down approximately 4% in '09 compared to '08. The greatest decline just over 14% was in our Industrial sector, as we saw manufacturing operations react to the recession by reducing production. We dealt with the economic challenge by continuing to focus on that what we control, managing our costs and optimizing our operations. During 2009, we effectively managed our costs by exceeding our $150 million target for O&M reductions and we did this while maintaining our operational excellence as you will see later from Jim and Dhiaa.During the year, our customer satisfaction levels remained significantly higher than the national average and our nuclear and fossil generation fleets have one of their best years ever. Turning to 2010, today we're announcing an earnings outlook of $1.25 to $1.30 EPS on an adjusted diluted basis. The midpoint of this outlook represents a 4% to 5% increase from our 2009 results. In past years, we have provided a point that represented our employee incentive target. With today's presentation, we will begin to provide an earnings guidance range. This conforms with your used to seeing from our industry peers. We expect to see growth in our Regulated businesses as we realize that base rate increases that were recently approved in the Carolinas, Ohio and Kentucky. The economic environment, our customers experienced last year, made it difficult for us to ask for these rate increases. However, the settlements we achieved allowed us again to earn a return on and recovery of our capital investments in a timely and constructive way. Looking at the economy, we expect the recovery in 2010 to be anemic. We are projecting 2010 loan growth on a weather-normalized basis to be essentially flat with 2009. And we expect power prices and competitive markets where we operate to remain low and in the zip code of the prices we saw in 2009. These expectations lead us to our 2010 earnings outlook. In her presentation, Lynn will give you the details and assumptions for this outlook, as well as our long-term growth objectives.Now I would like to give you a more detailed perspective on 2009 and how it has set us up for 2010 and beyond. Last year, we delivered on what we said we would do. As I noted earlier, we reached negotiated settlements in North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio and Kentucky. We made significant progress on our two largest capital projects, Cliffside in North Carolina and Edwardsport in Indiana. These two projects are the linchpins of our fleet modernization strategy, as they will enable us to retire nearly 1,200 megawatts of older, less efficient coal units. Our modernization strategy is further advanced by the construction of our two new gas-fired plants, Buck and Dan River in North Carolina. We're getting traction on our Smart Grid and energy efficiency initiatives, including major deployment of smart meters in Ohio. Jim will update you on our major modernization and new initiatives in each of our five regulated jurisdictions.We continue to manage through the recession. And we call it a recession because the anemic recovery feels like a recession. We mitigated the margin pressure from increased competition in Ohio from falling commodity prices with the rapid deployment of Duke Energy Retail Sales. Keith will take you through our retail strategy in Ohio, as well as the strategy for the remainder of our diverse Commercial Power business and International Operation, which exceeded their 2009 adjusted segment EBIT target by a combined $70 million.As we focus on managing our costs in '09, we also began repositioning our company for 2010 and beyond. Our goal is to continue to take incremental and sustainable O&M costs out of our business in '10. We have already taken such steps this year with our voluntary severance program for employees and with  the announcement of further consolidation of our corporate functions. However, I can assure you we will not sacrifice our track record of operational excellence and high-customer satisfaction to achieve our cost reduction objectives. We understand, we understand it deeply, that excellence in operations and high-customer satisfaction levels drive our regulatory and financial results, as well as the cost of our product.As we were in '09, we will continue to be focused on balancing our affordable, reliable and environmental goals. We are convinced in our business, sustainable performance is in getting that balance right. And the truth of the matter is, it's more art than science. We continue to protect the strength of our balance sheet with our modernization strategy, capital is our lifeblood and we must maintain superior access to the Capital Markets.We issued $3.75 billion of fixed rate debt of 5.2% during '09. In the last two years, we've raised more than $7 billion of fixed rate debt, attractive rates and terms, and we issued $600 million in equity through our DRIP plans. Our total shareholder return was up 22% for the year in '09, that compares favorably with the Philadelphia Utility Index, made up primarily of our peers, which was up only 10%. For the past three years, we have posted a positive shareholder return of around 4% while the Utility Index actually dropped almost 5%. Even though and I think this is a remarkable fact, our adjusted earnings have been essentially flat over the last three years, we grew our dividend an average of approximately 4% each year during this recessionary period, probably a tougher economic time, that our country has experienced since the depression. We also maintained the 5% to 6% dividend yield last year. With 2009 in the rearview mirror, let me summarize our focusing goals for 2010 and beyond.This slide illustrates our strategies from modernizing our regulated infrastructure and for maximizing diverse earnings from our Commercial businesses. This focus will help us maintain our financial strength in a future that is more certain than we have ever faced before. If we can anticipate and shape inevitable changes in future state and federal policies, we believe we will differentiate ourselves from others in our sector. Let me give you all example. In our Regulated and Commercial operations, we expect an array of tighter and more stringent environmental regulations from the U.S. EPA. As a result, coal generators will face difficult decisions on whether to spend incremental capital to retrofit or just shut down existing coal units. Additionally, Congress continues to debate Greenhouse Gas Legislation. If Congress fails to act, in all likelihood they won't this year maybe next year. But in every event, we expect the U.S. EPA to attempt to regulate carbon emissions beginning sometime in the next several years. Despite the uncertainty of these new regulations, we expect to retire 3,200 megawatts of older, fossil generation in our domestic regulated fleet by 2020, as well as almost an additional 900 megawatts in our domestic commercial generation fleet.To meet this challenge, we're the only company in the U.S. currently building two base load coal units, Cliffside and Edwardsport, with 825 and 630 megawatts, respectively. These plants will be some of the cleanest and most efficient in the U.S. As I noted, we are also adding two new 620-megawatt gas plants, Buck and Dan River. We're doing this when the cost of capital is low, and it can only increase in the future in our judgment. This buildout will allow us to smooth out and reduce future rate increases on our customers. In my view, this will prove to be a major differentiator for our company. It will be an example of creating a win-win for our customers, as well as our investors.We believe that closing the gap between allowed and earned rates of return is critical, particularly in this period of high-capital spending. We will continue to manage our costs and exercise discipline on our capital allocation process, and I really want to underscore those two points. We will continue to seek timely and constructive regulatory and legislative outcomes directed at approving our earned returns. But the reality is, we must close the gap between our allowed and earned returns. This is in my judgment, job won for our regulatory team. I recognize that this will not be an overnight success. Changing the regulatory paradigm takes time in all of our five jurisdictions. We have a sense of urgency, but we've also balanced it with the patience required to get the job done and I'm confident that we will. In our Commercial businesses, we won a diversified mix of generation, ranging from about 3,600 megawatts of gases in the Midwest, 4,000 megawatts of hydro and gas in Latin America and almost 750 megawatts of wind across the U.S., as well as approximately 4,000 megawatts of primarily  coal assets in Ohio, an important set of assets serving our load in Ohio. As we move to a future where power generation is going to be required to have an even smaller emissions footprint, we believe our lower carbon commercial generation will continue to increase in value. And as you know, we are pursuing growth in renewable generation, which we believe will also position us well for this future where there's lower carbon, or SOx, or NOx or mercury, there are going to be tighter regulation on emissions from power plants in the future and our judgment that is inevitable. Our challenges in our Commercial business in Ohio, I suspect you might have a question or two about that.And in our response to its competitive environments. Additionally, we must be disciplined in our capital allocation decisions for these businesses to ensure that we are earning the appropriate risk adjusted returns on our growth projects. For the Commercial team, this, in my judgment, is job won. Our Commercial businesses have been and continued to be meaningful contributors to our earnings and growth opportunities. The businesses provide us with options for growth, which we can dial up or we can dial it down, depending on the quality of the investment opportunities. This flexibility will be a great value in the years ahead for both our investors and our customers. Our diverse portfolio of Regulated and Commercial business provide us with options for capital rotation, including joint ventures, sales and the repatriation of cash from our foreign operations as opportunities arise. We will continue to evaluate all of these options and make decisions that we believe will best position Duke Energy for the future.Overall, this slide illustrates what sets us apart from our peers. We have a strong portfolio of Regulated and Commercial businesses. We are growing these businesses by investing capital efficiently, to modernize our infrastructure and to earn competitive returns. We have the constructive regulatory environmental and public policy skills to execute on our investments in capital recovery strategies. And importantly, we have the management agility to operate in what I believe will be unprecedented uncertain times. But also we're clear, and I hope if there's any message you take out of today's presentation, is that we are clear on what must get done and what our priorities are going forward. I believe all of these attributes will lead to future earnings and dividend growth.Let me conclude the strategic context by taking a moment and kind of outlining what our presenters would drill down into today. Jim will discuss our modernization strategy, particularly given recent demand trends, which may have raised questions about our assumptions. He will also provides you with an outlook for future rate making activity and he would describe how we would earn closer to our allowed rates of returns. Dhiaa will describe our Regulated Power Generation operations and steps we have taken to prepare for a uncertain future, most likely involving more stringent environmental regulations that I've talked about earlier. Keith will begin a discussion of our Commercial businesses that over the next year will give you even greater visibility into the earnings and growth potentials of these segments. He will outline our strategy for delivering earnings growth and strong cash flows and solid returns from these businesses. And Lynn, will provide you with the actions that support our ability to achieve our long-term growth and financial objectives.I said a moment ago, and I want to emphasize now, we want you to leave today with an even clearer understanding of how we plan to grow our business by achieving our mission of providing energy that is affordable, reliable and clean. And equally important, by redefining the boundaries of our existing business models. With that, let me turn it over to Jim to take you through our Franchised Electric and Gas operations. Jim?"

Apparently, my colleagues have started to wager on whether I get this done in 30 minutes, my allotted time. So if you want to get it on the action, send Stephen De May an e-mail but you'll have to do it within 15 minutes when the window closes.As Jim mentioned today, today's Franchised Electric and Gas presentation is going to be in two parts. I'll give you an overview of the strategic priorities of our Regulated businesses, including the fleet and grid modernization strategy and our regulatory initiatives. Then, Dhiaa will describe the strong operational performance of our generation fleet and how we're planning to meet ongoing environmental challenges. Dhiaa has also going to briefly update you on the progress of our two nuclear plants that we're looking at constructing.Today's discussion is necessarily forward-looking. But I want to pause a moment to add my thanks to our employees for their strong performance in 2009. In our Regulated businesses, we had one of the best years ever from an operation standpoint, from the availability of our generation fleet to the reliability of our power delivery system and we did this while holding operating and maintenance expense flat versus 2008. We achieved the best ever results on safety, continuing a three-year trend that is moving us closer and closer to the reality of a zero entry culture. And we delivered solid regulatory outcomes in an economic environment and a regulatory climate that proved to be less than hospitable to the utility rate increases. So I begin my remarks this morning with thanks to the men and women who make their Executive Team very proud to stand before you this morning and talk about the company. I'd also like to give you a direct line of sight now and of the things we're doing to position our company and our Regulated business in this very dynamic environment for utilities. Let me first highlight the four components of the value proposition for our Regulated business. The first component is the successful deployment of capital to modernize our generation fleet and our power delivery system. These efforts are fundamental to our enhanced mission and help explain why our capital needs, even in a challenging economy, have remained relatively robust. You will see from Dhiaa's profile of our generating fleet, why plant retirements are not just load growth, make fleet modernization critical to our future. The second element of our value proposition is constructive regulatory outcomes. This, of course, is where the rubber meets the road for Regulated businesses. Said another way, our fleet and grid modernization efforts are only as good as our ability to recover the investments in an adequate and timely manner. As you will see, we've identified regulatory lag as a key issue that will occupy our focus and attention going forward. Jim, did you say it was job too or a job won?"

The bottom line here is the strong operational performance is important for our customers, but it also helps underpin our active regulatory agenda. The fourth component of our strategic value proposition, revenue growth and diversification, encompasses the way we are working to grow revenue other than by pushing kilowatt hours to existing retail meters, including energy efficiency products and services, wholesale origination and our economic development efforts.So turning now to the first component of our strategic value proposition. As Jim said and as you know, we are in the midst of a significant capital building program to modernize our generation fleet and power delivery grid. Some of you have asked why our capital needs for new generation resources remain robust even as our load growth has fallen off in a recessionary economy. Of course, we build power plants to meet the long-term needs of our customers. And although the recessionary economy has impacted our near-term load projections, we nevertheless expect and we need to plan for growth in our peak demands to continue over the long-term. More importantly, as this chart shows, the new generating units are necessary not simply to meet projected load growth, but to replace the significant number of megawatts we will be retiring both in the Carolinas and the Midwest over the next decade. In both the Carolinas and the Midwest, our need for new capacity is driven by a combination of growth and peak demand, and the replacement of older, less efficient power plants. It's been over 20 years since we completed our last major build base for new power plants, with our most recent base load plants in the Carolinas coming online in 1986, and the most recent plant in Indiana coming online in 1982. In the Carolinas chart, you can see we plan to add a diverse mix of resources to our portfolio during the next five years with the largest single contributor being our Cliffside advanced coal-fired generation project at 825 megawatts. Now I'll have more to say about the status of the Cliffside construction in a moment. But I should note that late last year, the North Carolina Utilities Commission reinforced the need for this resource in two significant ways. First, the Commission rejected an environmental group's challenge that the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the plant should be revoked in light of the recessionary economy and softening of demand. Second, the Commission's order on our North Carolina rate case approved the addition of CWIP for Cliffside in our rate base. These two orders serve a strong confirmation of our Cliffside modernization strategy for the Carolinas.The other resource addition in the Carolinas are the combined-cycle gas plants we're building at our existing Buck and Dan River stations, respectively. Together, these plants will add approximately 1,240 megawatts of capacity to our system. I'll discuss the status of the construction of the projects in detail in a moment.  Finally, in the Carolinas, we plan to add about 365 megawatts through a diverse mix of renewable capacity, primarily PPAs, for compliance with North Carolina's renewable portfolio standard. As part of our renewable strategy, we received approval to invest $50 million in a first-of-its-kind, rooftop solar program in North Carolina. Again, our modernization efforts are not just about adding resources. We expect to retire over 2,000 megawatts of coal and old fleet CTs in the Carolinas through 2020. We're showing retirements through 2020 on this graph because this captures all retirements resulting from commitments linked directly to the Cliffside modernization project, as well as additional retirements currently being modeled in our integrated resource plant.Turning to Indiana, you can see that the addition of the 630-megawatt Edwardsport IGCC plant accounts for the vast majority of resource additions during this time period. With our Indiana modernization plan, we have over 500 megawatts of coal-fired generation that likely will be retired or mothballed between now and 2020, with an additional 600 megawatts of unscrubbed coal, under evaluation for possible retirement. Before we leave this slide, I should note that our integrated resource plans also include robust expectations for energy efficiency as well, part of our broader adjective to achieve a resource mix that enables us to meet the needs of our customers with affordable, reliable and increasingly clean electricity.So while we're on the status of our new plants, let me update you on the status of our construction. As I mentioned, our new clean coal plant in Edwardsport Indiana is a 630-megawatt integrated gasification and combined cycle facility that will come online in 2012. Edwardsport will be, in my opinion, the cleanest coal plant in the world. It will emit less sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and particulates than the old powerplant it replaces, while providing 10x more power than the existing plant. The IGCC technology also provides an opportunity for us to explore pre-combustion carbon capture, as well as potential storage for sequestration of the CO2 we capture. We're approximately 50% complete with the construction of the base plant and we've incurred about $1.3 billion in costs, including AFUDC through December 2009. Now during 2009, we received a number of constructive regulatory rulings on Edwardsport, including approval in January 2009 of an updated construction estimate of $2.35 billion and approval of multiple updates to our IGCC CWIP rider.  In November 2009, we notified the IURC that design modifications and scope growth will increase the project estimate by approximately $150 million, plus an appropriate level of contingency above the $2.35 billion, previously approved by the IURC. Last month, the IURC approved our request to address this cost estimate revision through a separate sub-docket. We continue to refine the cost estimate and will file a testimony in April 2010. The IURC will conduct a hearing on this matter in August. We'll put forward a strong case, demonstrating the reasons for, and the reasonableness of the requested increase in the estimate. And of course, we will continue to work hard with our vendors to find ways to mitigate the cost pressures and bring this plant in at the lowest possible cost for our customers.  I should also note that we continue to address carbon capture and storage related to the Edwardsport plant in separate sub-dockets. Turning now to our Cliffside coal plant under construction in North Carolina, the project is over 55% complete and we continue to be within our budget and expect the plant to come online in 2012. I mentioned earlier the favorable North Carolina regulatory outcomes during 2009, related to Cliffside. I should mention that the South Carolina Commission also authorized CWIP recovery in our rate case there.Turning now to our Buck and Dan River gas-fired projects in North Carolina. Each project represents 620 megawatts of combined cycle capacity. Both plants have already received the necessary CPCNs and their permits. In 2009, we broke ground on the Buck construction and we began site preparation work at Dan River. We're on track for the Buck and Dan River projects to come online in 2011 and 2012, respectively.Now let me briefly direct your attention to the right side of this chart as well, which represents the other prong of our modernization strategy, what we call grid modernization. There's certainly a lot of talk and even hype about smart grid these days. I want to take a moment to de-hype and hopefully demystify the concept. For Duke Energy, smart grid is an opportunity to harness digital technology to enable two-way communication with our customers and advance the number of tangible enhancements to our service delivery, improve outage detection and service restoration, deployment of self-healing circuits that can instantaneously reroute power to minimize outage footprints and reduce O&M costs related to tasks, such as meter reading and service connects and disconnects. Overtime, a smarter grid will enable our customers to better optimize their energy use through energy management systems, smart appliances and time-of-use rates. And we've been planning to invest up to $1 billion on smart grid over the next five years. Through December 2009, we've invested approximately $90 million of that in limited scale deployments of smart grid across our service areas. Our initial focus for our full-scale deployment is on Ohio, where we expect to install 140,000 smart meters in 2010 growing to a five-year total of 1 million smart meters, both gas and electric, and associated communications technology. Our smart grid investments in Ohio, representing about $450 million over five years will be authorized in a timely fashion as a result of the annual tracker that was authorized in our Electric Security Plan.In Indiana, our plans to invest a comparable amount over five years ran into a speed bump in late 2009, when the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission issued an order, denying our smart grid deployment plan. We've been working with the settling parties in our smart grid case to address the IURC's concerns and we anticipate coming back to the Commission with a scaled-down version of our plan in the near future. Obviously, this will reduce the $1 billion for smart grid shown on this graph. Finally, we're evaluating the best way to leverage the $200 million we were awarded in federal stimulus funds for our Midwest smart grid deployment to reduce the cost of deployment for customers.This slide serves as a snapshot of the strength of the regulatory environment in which we operate. On the left side, we've listed key accomplishments during 2009. I've touched on a couple of these outcomes already but I want to reinforce that we advanced the ball on a number of fronts during the past year. Again, a year in which regulatory initiatives were not always greeted with open arms and a warm embrace. I'm pleased with the favorable rate case outcomes that will add nearly $460 million in revenue upon full implementation. But I'm especially pleased with these outcomes, tough regulatory climate and all, with the product of settlement agreements with all or nearly all of the parties to these proceedings. In my opinion, this reinforces the constructive nature of the jurisdictions in which we operate.  But the past is not necessarily prologue, and even though our jurisdictions generally rank well as constructive places to do business, we know we've got work to do, particularly in a time of significant capital deployment, to continue closing the gap between the time we invest our capital and the time it takes to recover that investment. In a moment, I'll discuss how we're planning to do that. First, not that this audience needs any reminder, let me provide some context for addressing why regulatory lag is so important to us. This graph shows that we expect to grow, rate-based, by about $8 billion between 2009 and 2014. This growth is driven primarily by the fleet and grid expansion plans I discussed earlier, as well as the sizable annual capital investments necessary to maintain our power plants and our power delivery systems and CapEx necessary to add new customers to our system. Overtime, our anticipated rate-based growth will create a significant earnings platform, but we know this platform is most attractive to you when it actually is generating earnings, and even cash.The next slide will show the work we have in front of us to close the regulatory gap. This slide compares our current authorized returns on equity in each of our states to the expected earned ROEs in 2010. Let me make a couple of clarifying points about this chart. The ROE specified for Ohio, as you saw from Steven's earlier slide, this morning, is through the electric and gas transmission and distribution part of the business. The ROE earned by the power-generation part of the business in Ohio is not included here. Those earnings are reflected in the commercial business results under Keith. Keith will discuss Ohio with you in detail a little later. The shortened ranges in the chart reflect the anticipated earned ROEs based on our forecast for 2010. Let me also note that the forecasted achieved return for Kentucky includes the vertically integrated electric utility and the Gas Distribution business. As you know, we recently received a favorable order on our gas rate case which we settled last year for $13 million. This represented about 75% of what we filed for. Clearly, though the result in our gas rate case was positive, we have more work to do to address regulatory lag in Kentucky. As you'll see in a moment, we are expecting to file an electric base rate case in Kentucky later this year, with rates effective in 2011.Now, regulatory lag is not a new phenomenon in our industry. But we are determined to minimize its impact as the next two slides will discuss. One way to address regulatory lag is through the regular filing of rate cases. This chart reflects the anticipated rate case activity we believe will be needed to help improve the timely recovery of capital investments and operating expenses between now and 2014. The empty boxes reflect anticipated future revenue changes. For obvious reasons, the timing of future rate cases is not set in stone, but this should give you some sense for what to expect in the coming years. Obviously, it's a busy regulatory calendar. For 2010 in particular, we plan to file the electric rate case in Kentucky I just mentioned and we are evaluating a rate case filing in Indiana as well.The rate case activity anticipated during this period will be a key lever to mitigate the regulatory lag associated with rapid infrastructure growth. But we are acutely aware that the revenue produced even from frequent rate cases doesn't always keep up with the pace of expenditures. That's why we've worked to create mechanisms that result in a more timely recovery of our cost. Edwardsport in Indiana and smart grid in Ohio, come immediately to mind. We're working to give ourselves more of these kinds of levers in all of our jurisdictions. I'll note that in the recently-completed North Carolina rate case, we negotiated the settlement of a rider. We're collecting essentially the extra financing costs, extra carrying costs associated with our increased fuel inventory, which built up during the recessionary economy.So this slide gives you some insight into the regulatory and legislative activities we're evaluating and looking to pursue in each jurisdiction in addition to the rates cases discussed on the previous chart. You'll note that the Carolinas, historically, have made limited use of rate rider recovery mechanisms due to statutory limitation and regulatory norms. So we expect to work with policy makers and stakeholders during 2010 to create potential legislation for 2011 that will give us and our regulators more tools to address lag. Such tools may include formula rates, forward-looking test years, decoupling and other rider mechanisms. As we've said before, in North Carolina, we need specific statutory changes to enable CWIP cash recovery outside of a rate case to advance our proposed new Lee Nuclear plant that Dhiaa will discuss with you in a moment. I should note that South Carolina has already enacted a law that enables such CWIP recovery for new nuclear outside of a rate case. Of course, when we are talking about the need for legislative changes, there are no guarantees of success. But you do have our commitment that we will be working in every jurisdiction to reduce the earnings attrition attributable to regulatory lag.By the way, these mechanisms benefit consumers as well, by reducing our financing cost and smoothing out the effective rate increases over time. Of course, rate cases and rider mechanisms are not the only ways to address earnings attrition. Aggressive cost management is another tool for minimizing lag and you'll see in a moment this is another area that has our focus. As for the balance of our regulatory and legislative agenda, you can see that rates cases will not be the only thing occupying our attention. With approval of our modified save-a-watt plan or energy efficiency in four of our five states, Indiana's order was issued just last week, we will work to continue to revolve the manner in which we make energy efficiency, both demand management and energy conservation, important components of our long-term resource plan. In particular, we remain committed to ensuring that the recovery of energy efficiency investments is on a leveled playing field with the recovery of our investments in generation resources, so that energy efficiency creates value for both customers and shareholders.For the busy regulatory agenda, we are more committed than ever to delivering on the third prong of our strategic value proposition, operational excellence. We know that satisfied customers do not guarantee the success of our regulatory and legislative agenda, but we also know that dissatisfied customers and regulators can make that agenda a lot more difficult. This slide captures a few key elements of our scorecard that our relevant to regulators and customers, rates, reliability and customer satisfaction. Our rate competitiveness is driven in large part by resource decisions made decades ago, which explains why we feel so strongly about the fleet modernization decisions we are making today to position us for the future. We know we will face upward pressure on rates, as we modernize our system. But we remain committed to preserving the affordability of our product in the regions that we serve.One of the key tools we have for keeping our rates competitive and mitigating regulatory lag is cost management. Some of you have commented on the fact that our EPS has been flattish since 2007, attributable in large part to the severe economic downturn that began in 2008. We've worked to do our part by keeping our operating and maintenance cost flat for three years, essentially absorbing inflation during this period. I should note that our cost-management efforts have been generally ubiquitous throughout the segment and have not depended upon large one-time items. As we move into 2010, we continue to be focused on achieving sustainable cost reductions that will serve as one key enabler for our Regulated business to preserve margins as we navigate through the lingering effects of the recession.Although we do expect that 2010 O&M cost will be higher than 2009 for the Regulated business, the anticipated increase will be driven primarily by costs that have deferral or recovery mechanisms associated it with them and does our bottom line neutral to the company.Now I've grouped together, subtle [ph] seemingly disparate items, energy efficiency, wholesale origination and economic development, under the fourth and final component of our strategic value proposition. So let me explain what I believe to be the common denominator here. With the upward pressure on retail rates I described earlier, we're focused on delivering sources of revenue growth that do not depend on pushing kilowatt hours through existing retail meters. Energy efficiency, where we're compensated for reduced sales, wholesale origination, where we mitigate retail rates by spreading the fixed cost of our business over a larger regional footprint and economic development, where we spread the fixed cost of our business over a larger retail footprint, are three tools for accomplishing this growth and diversification.I should note that we had a significant success in wholesale origination in 2009 when we signed up a large co-op in South Carolina to a long-term deal that will grow to approximately 1,000 megawatts of new load by 2019. We also continue to enjoy success even in the sluggish economy and attracting new load to our retail service territories through our focus in award-winning economic development efforts.So let me close by saying we know have a lot on our plate, but we also believe we have the right focus and more importantly the right people to deliver on our strategic value proposition. Now I'll be happy to take a couple of clarifying questions right now. And as a Jim and Steven both said, there's going to be plenty of time for questions for all of us at the end. So with that..."

These are not like our long lead-time items such as the big power plants, where we accumulate AFUDC. These items close to rate base very quickly and therefore impact our depreciation expense very quickly. And it's hard to keep up with even through regular rate case filings. The other thing is rate cases look backwards. When you set your retail rates, you look backwards in time for a test-year level of expenses. So expenses that go forward from the rate case obviously will then impact your regulatory lag as well. So what we're looking at are a number of tools. And again, we'll be working through the legislative process in North Carolina and we're working in other states to try to close that gap, as much as we can, even through forward-looking test years or formula rates. Ultimately, we may look at something like decoupling, so if your sales go down, for example, if your sales go down from what you said in the test year, that's going to impact regulatory lag. There are a number of drivers. We're focused on all of the drivers and putting the right tools in place to hit them all."

I'm pleased to be here with you this morning to talk about the regulated generating fleet. Let me start by highlighting the position itself. Last year, our company made several changes in leadership responsibilities to help clarify accountability, streamline decision-making and strengthen relationships internally and externally. As part of these changes, the Chief Generation Officer position was created with the accountability for the regulated generating fleet. This change allows us to more effectively leverage capabilities across our fleet and improve operation and reduce costs of the operation.This morning, I will outline three focus areas for regulated generation, which I will expand on more in my slides. These include fleet operational excellence, environment compliance and new nuclear. Next slide shows an overview. This map shows South Carolina and Midwest service area with all of our regulated generating stations. We're fortunate in that we have a diverse portfolio utilizing nuclear, coal, natural gas, hydro resources with a higher percentage of our generation of course coming from coal. The table shows you the fleet, breakdown by region, as well as installed capacity by fuel type and our 2009 actual generation. You can see that in the Midwest, our customers are primarily served by our coal stations. In the Carolinas however, nuclear energy consistently account for more than 50% of our generation. For the entire regulated fleet in 2009, coal provided 59% of our actual generation, followed by nuclear at 39%. We believe maintaining diversity in our fuel supply helps minimize reliance on one particular fuel source and reduces a potential impact of price volatility for our customers and also reduces the risk for our investors.As previously noted, one of our focus areas is maintaining operational excellence. I'll report here this morning with pride, the performance of our fleet in 2009. These graphs show you the 2009 nuclear and fossil performance. For a reliability perspective, 2009 was truly a banner year for us. Our nuclear capacity factor was more than 94%. This is the 10th consecutive year that we've exceeded 90% in capacity factor. It's also the second highest capacity factor for the fleet in our history. Similarly, the fossil fleet operated with an exceptionally high reliability factor last year. Instead of capacity factor, we used commercial availability as the reliability measure for fossil, given how we dispatch our fossil fleet. Last year, our fossil commercial availability was more than 90%, a 6% improvement over 2008. An industry average for commercial availability is not available because different people do the commercial availability differently. The exceptional reliability results for both nuclear and fossil spaces are built on a solid foundation of excellence in operation, and also, excellence in maintenance. We operate our stations as long-term assets and our employees clearly understand that well-planned and executed outages, reliable maintenance and superior operations would help us achieve sustainable results. We're proud of our fleet performance and we're building on our success to continue providing reliable, cost-effective product to our customers.Strong plant performance is just one part of operational excellence. The other key component of course is cost management. These graphs year show you the cost aspects of the business. On the left side, it displays the nuclear total operating costs. This includes fuel, O&M and administrative and general expenses. In 2009, our nuclear total operating cost was $19.33 per megawatt hour, comparable to our 2008 operating cost, which by the way, was the lowest of all U.S. nuclear fleets. We now have preliminary industry data that shows 2009 cost will, once again, will be the lowest among all fleets. In nuclear, there are a number of factors that collectively assist us in maintaining low-cost operation, including low force loss rate , superior reliability focus on outages, and effective cost management programs and event preperformance. In fossil generation, the dominant benchmark cost measure is total production cost, which includes O&M and fuel, but not A&G [ph]. For 2009, fossil production cost was at $31.8 per megawatt hour. As a reference, other leading fossil units cost average about $40 per megawatt hour in 2008. Our ability to consistently maintain lower production costs than the industry is attributable to the high heat rates of our stations and also on our continuing focus on cost control, which allowed us to stay on the target in major budget items last year.While we placed considerable emphasis on cost control across our generating fleet, it has not been at the expense of safety and operating excellence, as the reliability slide clearly showed earlier. Our generating units are important resources for our customers, and our employees are working with a goal of continuing to improve performance cost effectively. As Jim already mentioned, we are currently building program to modernize our generating fleets. We're making prudent decisions relating to modernization to ensure we can continue serving our customers for many years to come with diverse resources. You can see on this graph the in-service base for our generating fleet, which clearly shows our fleet is aging. We have plans in place to retire all coal units placed to service in the 1940s or earlier and more than 30% of the plants put in service in the 1950s. In fact, base of the current license life of our nuclear stations, all of our stations could be retired by 2015. However, as you know, it may be possible to renew our nuclear station's license, once again, in the future. Developing and implementing carefully designed phased approach for upgrading our -- or retiring generating units, as well as replacing the outputs of those units, will benefit our customers over the long run. Our plants have aged well, but the time has come to modernize the fleets.Along with our focus on providing new, cleaner generation is our continuing effort to reduce our environmental footprint. We've been working for more than a decade to reduce emission through installation of environmental controls. Approximately 75% of our fleet has scrubbers or SCRs. This includes all of Duke Energy plant, not just the regulated fleet. The graph on the slide shows the reductions we have made in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in pounds per megawatt hour with the addition of those environment controls. Sulfur dioxide has been reduced by 71% and nitrogen oxide by 56% over the last four years. We've made significant investments, approximately $5 billion, in addressing environmental issues associated with our fleet and we are recovering to the raise [ph] all of our costs to make these important upgrades. As I stated earlier, the results shows significant reductions in overall emission intensity. It's also worth noting that once we complete our current modernization work and associated unit retirement plans that Jim spoke about, almost 90% of our fleet will have emission control equipment. While we're focused on the addition of environment controls to our fossil fleet over the past years, primarily related to NOx and SOx, of course, we've been working to address pending new and changing environmental regulations. Let me just to spend a few minutes discussing some of these. For coal combustion byproduct, which includes coal ash, we expect regulations to be final by the first quarter of next year. In the near term, we're preparing for the impacts associated with the designated of coal ash. While we do not know exactly what the final coal ash regulation will include, we anticipate they will require installation of additional systems and will also increase costs for handling the disposing of ash.For air pollutants, there are several key regulations that will affect our operation. The Clean Air Transport Rule Phase I (sic) [Clean Air Interstate Rule Phase I] is currently in effect and limits actually the tons of NOx and SOx emission. Final replacement rule is expected in 2011. The replacement rule may require retirements of and scrubber installation on units that do not currently have these controls. In addition, a maximum achievable control technology, MACT, finally is also expected next year. The rule may require equipment to control and to continuously monitor mercury and other hazardous air pollutant emissions. We also expect title regulations for ozone, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter. The last item I want to mention under upcoming regulation is carbon. As Jim's opening remark make it clear, we are in a new environment when it comes to electricity generation. We're all aware of the national and international focus on carbon reduction. If carbon will be regulated, Duke Energy supports passes of federal legislation mandating economy-wide regulation of greenhouse gas emissions for all U.S. sources. We know that after installation, EPA will work to regulate carbon emissions. The timeframe for legislation is currently unknown. However, EPA could, in fact, start regulating as early as next year.While the exact impact and effect on pending regulations are unknown, we're planning for different scenarios and the potential impact on our stations. This may include additional installation of air emission control equipment, additional or accelerated unit retirement beyond what we are currently planning and additional costs. We've analyzed various models regarding the expected cost of these regulations. As mentioned earlier, we have already spent about $5 billion on environmental controls over the past decades. Our modeling suggests future investment could be in the same range based in over a very long period of time and likely to begin after 2012.As we address near-term environmental regulations' effect on our fossil stations, our long-term plans include the addition of new nuclear generation through operating the outlook of existing units and the planning for new ones. In 2007, we submitted a license application to the NRC for two AP1000 units in Cherokee County, South Carolina. We're aggressively pursuing the license for the stations to keep this in new nuclear options open for our customers in the 2021 timeframe. We're taking a very deliberate and methodical approach to ensure that were doing the right things in making decisions based on the what is the best interest of our customers and our investors.Also in nuclear development, we've announced formation of an alliance in last June to explore new nuclear options in the Midwest. We're developing pants to evaluate potential sites for new nuclear in the Midwest, including DOE's Porthsmouth site. In 2009, we submitted a request to DOE for funding of the initial phase of this project, which is initially focused on performing environmental studies for a generic early site permit. We believe, moving forward, that these new nuclear project is a prudent action. However, there are still some key considerations where additional work is needed to advance these projects.There are three considerations we're focusing on in support of the new nuclear generation projects. These include: Receiving a license from NRC [Department of Natural Resources and Conservation], helping create supportive state regulatory framework and developing regional partnerships. As already mentioned, we submitted our license application for Lee Nuclear in 2007 and have been working on the development act including completing side of prep work, developing detailed cost estimate, which was validated by a third-party, addressing requests for additional information from NRC, receiving approval to seek recovery project development costs, signing a used disposal contract and submitting a loan guarantee application, which, by the way, we're keeping up to date. Based on our current information, we anticipate receiving our license in the 2013 timeframe. The timeline on the bottom of the slide graphically depicts our current project milestones and schedule. As discussed earlier, recovery of initial financing cost during construction are quick. It's critical for our new nuclear project. Our North and South Carolina, both state have statutes in places that provide the means for construction finance and cost recovery. However, the recovery mechanism is different in both states. In South Carolina, we can seek financial cost recovery through separate annual adjustments. In North Carolina, it has to be sought through a general rate increase. As you know, our customer base is a split 70/30 between the two states. And therefore, it's very important to have consistent legislation in place for both states for us to move forward with the lead plant. To ensure reliable cash flow during construction and maintain a strong, reliable balance sheet, we need ability to recover financing costs as they are incurred outside of a general rate case.Complementary to our cost recovery efforts, we are also working to develop regional partnerships. We have partners for our Catawba nuclear station and have long history of working with multiple owners and long projects with Lee Nuclear Station. We're exploring various partnership options, which will provide opportunities to share construction, project management on operational risks. Additionally, this provides the prospects of adding capacity in smaller increments over time to better maximum growth and planned retirements and lessen the cost recovery convections and cash flow impact. The bottom line for us on the nuclear is that while it's our preference is to have a regional partners, having the right regulatory framework is a must.In summary, as a corporation, we measure success in many ways. In regulating generation, we have multitude of measures we track day-to-day, month-to-month and year-to-year to allow us to capitalize on good practices and make improvements based on lessons learned. We're focused on sustaining excellence in our operation and believe we are well-positioned to achieve superior results going forward. We have made changes to address environmental issues and have additional improvement planned. We're prepared for the future with a robust modernization plan, including the addition of new nuclear, which we believe is an important resource for our future. Thank you for your time. And I believe I have time for a few questions."

We believe Westinghouse is very effectively working with NRC to address this issue. There's some testing that is taking place. The NRC is monitoring the testing. The testing is coming to a conclusion this month. A report would be submitted by Westinghouse to the NRC. That's anticipated to be in March.

My goal this morning is to shine some more light on Dukes' commercial businesses and to show you a set of businesses that provide diverse earnings and opportunities for the company. I knew before, but as I was c",2801,"Thank you, Steven. And good morning, again. My goal this morning is to shine some more light on Dukes' commercial businesses and to show you a set of businesses that provide diverse earnings and opportunities for the company. I knew before, but as I was circulating around at the break, it became even clearer to me that many of you have a lot of questions about Ohio. And so, I'll spend the most of my time this morning on Ohio and the Midwest generation business, but I'll also cover our other regulated or unregulated businesses. The commercial businesses fall in three distinct brackets. When taken together, these businesses provide geographic technology and fuel diversity for the company. Midwest generation is a mature business that has provided strong historical cash flows and earnings. As Jim Rogers mentioned earlier, our Ohio fleet that is currently dedicated under Duke Energy, Ohio's electric security plan, consists of around 4,000 megawatts of generation, the vast majority of which is coal-fired. Our Midwest gas generation, which is centered primarily in PJM, consists of approximately 3,600 megawatts of gas-fired generation. Now it's clear that this business faced its near-term headwinds, but it will continue to produce strong cash flows and solid returns for us.  We don't anticipate investing additional growth CapEx in this business over the next several years. But we do intend to manage our O&M and our maintenance CapEx very prudently. The second leg of the three businesses is our Renewables business, which we launched in 2007, with an initial focus on wind. We now have almost 750 megawatts of wind operating, with more coming online very soon. And over the past two years, we've launched our Solar Photovoltaic business, our Biomass business and also our Commercial Transmission business. The near-term growth in the Renewables business is going to be driven by favorable state and federal public policies. And we'll manage our risk very carefully in these businesses through a development model that is based on long-term contracts. Duke Energy International, our third leg, is predominantly hydroelectric generation in Brazil and a combination of hydro and fossil generation in Peru. Duke Energy International provides stable earnings, good growth and good earnings diversity for Duke. In fact, we saw the value of this diversity last year in the recessionary climate that we all went through, where the recessionary impact were milder in Latin America than here in the United States. Taken together, the commercial businesses provide a diversified source of earnings in cash for Duke, which has contributed substantially to our earnings growth over time. In fact, in 2009, we saw the benefit of this diversity. While everyone felt the impact of the economy in 2009, our commercial businesses actually exceeded our internal adjusted EBIT target by almost $70 million. Suffice as to say that I'm very pleased proud of the commercial businesses team. They came through for us in a very big way in 2009. And I'm confident that they're prepared to take on the challenges that we're going to face in the future.Now I'd like to discuss each of our businesses in more detail. As I mentioned earlier, our Midwest portfolio is composed of coal and natural gas, 4,000 megawatts of this generation is currently dedicated  to DEO's customers under the ESP. And the vast majority of that fleet is low-cost based load coal plant, more than 75% of which was scrubbed. This fleet generates revenues through sales under the ESP and also through wholesale sales. Our Midwest gas-fired generation is predominantly composed of modern, highly-efficient, combined cycle units that sell capacity and energy into the PJM market. As gas prices sell and some market participants dispatched their coal plants based on higher historic costs, the generation output from our gas fleet increased by roughly 200% in 2009 over 2008. In fact, as is shown in this graphic, we set, for the entire Midwest generation, a record in 2009 for the number of gigawatt hours that we sold, and that's despite tough economy and lower demand generally. Now I should point out here that the energy margins from our cash generation were fairly thin due in part to some unexpected O&M expenses. But nevertheless, the fact that we produced a record number of gigawatt hours in 2009 tells us that our diversified coal and gas fleet is well-positioned in the market.The event in 2009 clearly puts a spotlight on competition in Ohio. But the fact is, and the reality is, that Ohio has had a competitive market since 2009. The effect of the competitive market were magnified in 2009 when the energy demand collapsed and power prices fell dramatically. This created a gap between the ESP price and the market price. And that downward move happened very, very fast. As you can see from this chart on the top right, when our ESP price was being developed and negotiated, we were in the range of the market, but within a few short months wholesale prices dropped by some $20 per megawatt hour. This is the gap that created economic incentive for some of our customers to switch beginning in the second quarter of 2009 and accelerating over the last half of the year. Switching has resulted in reduced retail sales under the ESP. In fact, switching has left more generation to be sold in the wholesale market, which we did, but obviously at lower margins. By the end of 2009, approximately 40% of DEO's load had switched but through actions that I'll described in a moment, we reduced the net impact of that switching to 15%.We responded quickly and effectively to the competitive pressures that we saw on Ohio. First, Duke Energy retail sales, which is our certified retail supplier in Ohio quickly launched a two-prong strategy. We initially focused on capturing Duke Energy Ohio's switching load, and our efforts were successful. We captured approximately 60% of the switch load. This equates to a net switching impact of about 15% and an earnings-per-share impact of approximately $0.02 in 2009. So that was our defensive strategy. We also launched an offensive strategy, in which we're selectively attracting customers outside of Duke Energy Ohio service territory. There's retail initiatives, produced revenue streams that are not linked to our own generation. Instead, that margin, the DERS margin was and is hedged in the market. In addition to the DERS strategy in 2009, Duke Energy Ohio, successfully acquired load through the FirstEnergy auction. We won five tranches or approximately 5% of First Energy's load for a period of two years. And that margin also is hedged in the market. As you can see on this slide, the combined effect of our competitive response more than offset the number of switched megawatt hours,  but again, at lower margins. And I should point out that this chart does not include our wholesale sales. That's a pretty remarkable achievement in my book, to be able to make up a number of megawatt hours to switch away from us through our competitive response. Summing up, 2009 was clearly a year of challenges and the most significant of which was clearly customer switching. But to positive things came through for us. First, we have solid assets, and that is evidenced by the fact that in that tough year, we were able to sell a record number of gigawatt hours. Second, we have a strong team. The DERS team and its response to switching shows that this team can and will compete in this market effectively. As we look forward to 2010, we expect additional switching in Ohio of about 5% on average, bringing the annualized total to around 45%. And we will feel a full year's effect of the customers that switched during 2009. Partially offsetting these two drivers, we will generate margins through DERS sales to Duke Energy Ohio and other customers, additional wholesale sales and some price uplift under our ESP. Taking all of these drivers into effect, the net Ohio competition effect will result in an incremental $004. to $0.07 earnings sharing decrease as compared to 2009. In addition, in 2009, we harvested margins with the sale of coal and emission allowances. And while that type of margin is part of our ongoing business, we see reduced margin opportunities from these types of sales in 2010. We of course will optimize our commodity portfolio as those opportunities arise. Given these challenges, we are more focused than ever on driving down operational costs, increasing our operational efficiency and ensuring that we prudently spend maintenance CapEx. For example, we see and believe that there is room to reduce our non-fuel O&M expenses and to utilize our labor, much more efficiently. And the DERS team will continue to play an important role for us in generating market in 2010, capturing additional load, that switching  in Ohio as well as generating sales outside of our service territory.I know that there is interest in what a post-2011 world looks like. The rapid downward movement in power prices last year is a clear evidence of the difficulty in forecasting future events. But here's what we can tell you at this point. First, it is likely that we will enter into a new ESP. An ESP structure can provide benefit, such as recovery of fuel, renewables, economic development, and certain environmental metal costs. It can also provide a vehicle for the non-by-passable recovery of costs associated with new generation. In terms of margin, you should expect that any future ESP price will be market-based. But it will include premiums for matching generation to load shape, pricing customers of switching options and premiums for credit and other risks. And remember also, that our last ESP was a three-year term, and our pricing proposal that we developed for that ESP used an average of the three-year projected market price. Under any framework, we have several options to maximize margin from generation, these include: Dedicating all or part of our generation our Duke Energy Ohio customers; matching our generation to retail load, created by an auction or other load-serving industry, committing our generation to certain retail customers or classes of customers. And of course, selling generation into the wholesale market. And post-2011, we also see that DERS will continue to play role generating sales within and outside Duke Energy Ohio's service territory.Rounding out our view for post-2011 world, we believe that capacity prices in PJM auctions for the period covering made 2013 and beyond, will rise above the $16.50 per megawatt a day that cleared in the last option. So that's the story of the Midwest generation. Turning to the Renewables fronts, we continue to see significant growth opportunities that are driven by public policy. We launched our Renewables business through our Wind investments. More recently, we've entered into the biomass joint venture with AREVA. And last month, we announced our first solar project, the Blue Wing 16-megawatt project photovoltaic development that will be located near San Antonio, Texas. We view the Renewables generation businesses as a natural extension of our other commercial businesses. But our strategy here is very clear. We won't invest significant capital until we have entered into and obtained long-term PPAs with investment grade customers. This model produces renewable generation assets that our project financeable. In addition, we have full ability to take advantage of ITC, PTC, accelerated and bonus appreciation tax benefits. Combining these factors, our Renewables business produces very solid financial results. We recover approximately 35% to 40% of our investment in year one when we used ITC. Our cash and cash returns ranged from 20% to 30% over the five years of projects. And these projects produce attractive risks adjusted IRRs.As I mentioned, we made our first investment in the Renewables area in wind. So let me talk a little bit about our track record there. We launched that business in 2007. Since then, we've invested more than $1 billion in wind assets. Our 2009 wind assets produced approximately $300 million in cash through tax benefits and operations. We're successfully executing our development program an construction plans, bringing projects on early and under budget. On the operating side, we have a relatively young fleet, but already, our fleet availability has exceeded the industry average and continues to improve. In 2009, we added 364 megawatts to our fleet, and we're on track to bringing another 250-megawatt online in this year. As we previously shared with you, our plan is to grow this business at a 250-megawatt per year pace.  Stepping back, it's worth noting that two and a half years ago, we had zero focus on domestic renewables. And today, we built a business that's a top 10 Wind business in the country. And as I previously mentioned, we're now building an integrated and diversified clean energy platform through the addition of our Biomass, Solar and Transmission business. Moving now to Duke Energy International, international business provides earnings diversity through a clean energy platform. We have 4,000 megawatts of generation, over 75% of which is hydroelectric. Over half of our international assets are located in Brazil. So let me spend just a few moments on those assets. Our strategy in Brazil is to create a highly-contracted portfolio through medium term contracts that range just over five years in length. Now the chart on the top right shows you that we've been successful in executing that strategy. But one point I want to make clear here, Brazilian regulations create protections from drought. And they do that in two ways, first, we're only allowed to enter into contract up to 50% of the nameplate capacity for our hydro facility. So when you see statistics like 98%, that means 98% of the 50% nameplate capacity. That regulation builds in a good amount of cushion for us to protect us against drought. Also, in the event of a severe drought, the Brazilian regulations provides for the sharing of the results and financial results by spreading those impacts across the entire system. That's probably more than you want to know. But the key point here is that we have a solid contracting strategy, that has good at risk protection.One other point, you can see on the lower chart on the lower right that the bulk of our Brazilian revenues come from our contracts as opposed to the spot market. Finally, our Brazilian debt is denominated in local currency, substantially hedging the changes in the real/dollar exchange rate.Taken together, our international assets have produced sustained earnings growth. Since 2006, we've grown adjusted segment EBIT for DER from $313 million to over $400 million, and we're projecting $485 million this year. Brazil and Peru, where the bulk of our assets are located, have stable and good economy, good electricity demand growth and stable and well-established regulatory regimes. In fact, while all economies were impacted by the recession, Brazil and Peru did not suffer as much as we did here, and those economies are bouncing back faster and stronger than here in the United States. We have one international business that's outside of Latin America, that's our interest in our National Methanol Company. Historically, that business has produced very strong cash and very strong returns. NMC's revenues have correlated with crude oil prices, so we do see more commodity exposure in that business. But with Latin America's stable growth and with its fuel mix, we have effectively mitigated that commodity of exposure. One other point on NMC, that joint venture is set to expire in mid-2012. But we're working to extend that joint venture. And m cautiously optimistic that we're going to be successful in doing so. Overall, the international businesses provide us a strong earnings platform, and we're committed to investing in these businesses.Given the relatively short amount of time that I've had today, I know that I haven't answered all of your questions on the international business. So to provide a deeper understanding of those businesses, we plan to host a webcast within the next few months, where we'll do a deep dive into the regulatory and pricing structures that affect those businesses. And we'll be sharing the date for that webcast here in the near future.To summarize, taken together, Duke Energy's commercial businesses have provided solid, stable earnings over a period of several years. We've got a strategy for managing the headwinds in the Midwest,  and I'm confident that we have a team that can successfully execute that strategy. Our growth capital is going into Renewables, that are backed by public policy and long-term contracts. And our Latin American operations provide us with geographic and earnings diversity and are highly-contracted and self-funding.  And consistent with what we've gone already today, I'll stop here. I'll answer a couple of questions and then we'll have time for more questions at the end."

But outside of our service territory, which as you know, is primarily focused around the Cincinnati area, we are currently evaluating areas outside of Ohio, and we may well look at those areas. But at this point, we're focused more inside Ohio but outside of our service territory. With respect to aggregation, we're clearly seeing increased activity in aggregation in our service territory for customers that are currently under the ESP. And we are monitoring that very, very closely. And for those communities where aggregation has been voted upon and certified, we are very active with those communities in working through DERS to compete for that load. And we see that aggregation activity is going to pick up in 2010, we've been monitoring it. Don't want to get into specific percentages of how much load we see switching in different categories. But I can tell you that more of the load is switched in commercial and industrial in 2009. I do think that you're going to see a pickup in switching in residential in '10. And our internal sort of a forecast for what '10 looks like increases, shows significant increase in residential switching. But it's an area that we're going to be monitoring, very, very carefully. And time will tell how that plays out. And we will give you updates quarterly as to how the switching looks. Your last question I think was on ESP pricing. I've learned that my crystal ball is no better than anybody else's crystal ball in terms of projecting pricing. And I'm sure if you go back 18 months ago, when we started about projecting pricing, we wouldn't be talking about the prices we have today. So I'm careful about that. But the best I can tell you is it will be market-based. In fact, the statute specifically provides that the ESP price must be in the aggregate, better than market. I did point out though that in the last ESP calculation that we did or pricing formula we did, it was an average pricing over the three-year period of the ESP. So you have to factor that in as well as all the premiums I've described. So that's about all I can tell you on pricing and the future of ESP."

And so what I'm going to do is just provide the color commentary that goes with those slides and those -- everyone has said we'll have lots of time for questions at the end. So what I'm going to cover today are the following topics: Our fourth quarter 2009 and year-end results; our outlook for '10 and the supporting assumptions; our long-term growth expectations; our financing plans for '10, including our assumptions around future CapEx; and our financial objectives. So let me start with a review of 2009. As Jim discussed, we're pleased with our 2009 results, which exceeded our employee incentive target and demonstrated our ability to manage through the challenges we faced and meet our commitments. In table on Slide 2, compares our 2009 performance against our plan for the year. As you can see, all of our business segments, except U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas, exceeded expectations. And although USFE&G fell short of expectations, the segment's performance in the face of declining retail sales volumes was commendable. Our Regulated businesses were hit hardest by the impact of the recession. Declining retail sales volumes, primarily in our Industrial load, had a significant impact on the segment's results when compared to 2008. As you've already heard from Jim and Dhiaa, USFE&G responded to the significant reduction in volumes by cutting costs and operating our generation fleet and power delivery system in an outstanding manner.We also took company-wide steps to mitigate the impact of reduced retail sales volumes and other challenges we faced in 2009. We increased our original targeted O&M reductions by $50 million to $150 million, and we surpassed that target. We exercised the flexibility of our capital spending plan and reduced planned CapEx by approximately $200 million. Additionally, in 2009, we responded to the competitive challenge that arose in Ohio as a result of the reduction in commodity prices that Keith just shared with you. Our competitive retail arm, Duke Energy Retail Sales, quickly reacted and effectively mitigated margin loss when competition throughout Ohio intensified. The appendix to this presentation provides you with more detailed explanations of the drivers impacting segment earnings for the quarter and for the year. And although I will not review those drivers with you today, I do want to spend a few minutes on retail sales volumes, a key area of focus and attention in 2009.On Slide 3, we have highlighted 2009 quarterly sales volume trends for each of our customer classes. On an overall basis, for 2009, our weather-normalized electric volumes were down approximately 4% when compared to 2008. The net margin impact to the volume decline was around $120 million year-over-year. This decline was principally driven by decreases in our Industrial sales volumes, which were down approximately 14% when compared to 2008. The downturn in our Industrial sales activity began in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continue to decline throughout the first part of 2009. We began to see signs of stabilization in Industrial activity during the latter part of 2009. In the third quarter, stimulus benefits gave a boost to Industrial activity. We continue to see signs of stabilization in the fourth quarter, consistent with the broader U.S. economy. As you know, fourth quarter GDP increased almost 6% from third quarter levels, and December marks the sixth straight monthly increase in the U.S. Industrial Production Index.In order to provide additional insight in developing our load forecast, we continue to have discussions with our large Industrial customers on their expectations for the future. I would describe the mood as cautiously optimistic for 2010, although a significant rebound is not expected in the near term. In general, we found the outlook to be more favorable than after the third quarter. During 2009, our Commercial sales volumes declined around 1% on a weather-normalized basis. This customer class has historically lagged downturns in the overall economy. We are continuing to monitor this customer class very closely and expect weakness in 2010, which I will discuss further in a moment. On the bright side, if there's been a bright side in 2009, we have seen resilience and in fact, growth in our Residential sales volumes. Residential volumes increased approximately 2% over 2008 levels. While this is lower than what we've experienced in previous years, we continued to experience customer growth, particularly in the Carolina.With that backdrop, let me move on to expectations for this year, 2010. And Slide 4 lists the key assumptions that we used in developing our outlook for 2010. First, our outlook includes the impact from the rate cases that were approved in 2009. Electric rate cases in both of the Carolinas, the electric distribution case in Ohio and the gas distribution case in Kentucky. We expect a slow recovery in 2010, and are forecasting overall weather-normalized load growth to be flat to 2009. As you know, there are a wide range of views about the economics of 2010, and what they will look like. We believe that with double-digit unemployment levels in many of our service territories and vulnerability of Industrial load in market segments like Textile, it is prudent to plan the year, assuming that 2010 will look like 2009. Specific to our customer classes, we are expecting the combination of Residential and Commercial loads to be roughly flat to 2009, with more downward pressure in our Commercial segment. In our industrial sales, we anticipate a continued decline in Textiles in the Carolinas, offset by a slight improvement in non-Textile Industrial sales in both the Carolinas and the Midwest. As we move through the year, we will continue to closely monitor these trends so that we can share with you what we expect over the balance of the year and beyond. As you heard from all of our speakers today, management of our cost continues to be a keen area of focus for 2010. We are planning to hold O&M that is not recoverable through tracking mechanisms flat to 2009. This means that we expect to sustain the O&M cost reductions that we achieved in 2009 and absorb rising labor costs, the impact of inflation, as well as increases in our pension costs, all the while maintaining our commitments to reliability and customer service. As you saw in Keith's presentation, we anticipate an average customer switching rate in Ohio of approximately 45% in 2010, which represents an incremental 5% over the levels at the end of 2009. When netted for customer load acquired by Duke Energy Retail Sales, we expect the net switching rate to be approximately 25% for 2010. Our 2010 outlook assumes that we will invest approximately $5.2 billion in capital expenditures. About 80% of those dollars will be invested in our Regulated businesses and over 30% represent investments in Cliffside, Edwardsport, Buck and Dan River. I will have more details on our capital spending later during this presentation. Other key financial assumptions for 2010 include: Interest expense of about $850 million, driven by increased debt balances and higher interest rates; AFUDC debt of approximately $150 million; AFUDC equity around $230 million, driven by our continued capital expenditure program; and an effective tax rate of approximately 31%.With that, let's move on to Slide 5 and review our 2010 outlook for adjusted segment EBIT. The chart on this slide shows our 2010 adjusted EBIT expectations for each of our business segments. Those expectations assume the mid-point of our adjusted EPS outlook range Jim previously discussed. As you can see, we expect total 2010 adjusted segment EBIT to increase 6% or approximately $200 million when compared with 2009. Our U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas adjusted segment EBIT is expected to increase a little over $300 million. And that increase is primarily driven by the rate case activity that I just mentioned. Our Commercial Power segment's 2010 results are expected to decline when compared to 2009. That decline is expected to be primarily driven by the earnings challenges facing the Midwest generation that Keith outlined earlier, customers switching in Ohio and reduced opportunities for emission allowance and coal sales. We expect an increase in DEI's 2010 adjusted segment EBIT results when compared to 2009. The increase will be primarily driven by improved contributions from our Brazil operations and National Methanol. In our other category, which primarily includes costs associated with a corporate governance, we expect 2010 adjusted net expense from continuing operations to increase over our 2009 results. Due to our continued focus on costs, we expect corporate governance will be flat to 2009, and corporate governance is included in this segment. However, for 2010, we do anticipate lower results from our captive insurance company, and we expect to make an additional contribution to the Duke Energy Foundation in 2010 in support of the communities in which we live and work during these difficult times. Next, I'll turn to our long-term earnings growth expectations beyond 2010.  As Jim noted in his opening, we expect our adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2010 to be within our $1.25 to $1.30 outlook. The mid-point of our 2010 outlook represents a 45% increase over 2009. Over the longer term, we expect to achieve an adjusted diluted earnings per share compound annual growth rate of  4% to 6% from a base of our 2009 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.22, a reduction from our pre-recession growth expectations of 5% to 7% that we announced in 2007. As we shared with you last year during our Analyst Day presentation in November of 2008, our ability to achieve projected long-term growth rate was in part dependent upon improved general economic conditions, resulting in a rebound and regulated retail sales. That rebound has not yet occurred. The depth of the economic downturn and the pace of recovery were not known at that time, and we have adjusted our growth expectations to reflect the realities of the current environment.The top chart on Slide 6 shows the change in our original retail sales forecast from late 2008 to our current forecast and illustrates the depth of what we have experienced today. In addition, commodity prices fell and have remained low, accelerating the competitive environment in Ohio and lowering off-system margins throughout our Regulated businesses. And finally, although less significant to achieving our pre-recession 5% to 7% growth rate, we were anticipating some level of ongoing contribution from Crescent Resources. As you know, Crescent filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June of 2009, as a result of the downturn experienced in the real estate markets. We do not project any future contributions from Crescent in our current business plans.As we look forward, we believe a 4% to 6% compound annual growth rate off of base of 2009 is achievable and underpinned by actions that include disciplined capital spending and mitigation of regulatory lag, control of our costs and focus on maintaining operational excellence and growth in our Commercial businesses at appropriate risk-adjusted returns. Next, I'll walk you through our projected 2010 cash flows. Assuming that our adjusted diluted earnings per share will be at the mid-point of our range of $1.25 to $1.30 for 2010, we expect total sources of cash to be about $4.1 billion. Total uses of cash are estimated to be $6.5 billion, which reflects CapEx for the year along with dividend payments of approximately $1.3 billion. The resulting cash shortfall, when combined with scheduled debt maturities and expected debt refinancing, drives the 2010 funding requirement of approximately $3.5 billion. We expect to meet this funding requirement through a combination of the following: New issuances of debt, $400 million of new equity raised through our DRIP and other internal plans, and the utilization of cash on hand. We believe this modest infusion of equity during 2010 is a prudent action to address the negative cash flow impact of the ongoing economic downturn and to ensure the health of the balance sheet.Because the timing and extent to the economic recovery is uncertain, we will assess the need for additional equity in 2011 as this year unfolds. Any such need in 2011 would also be met through our internal plans. We do not plan any public offerings of our stock. On the next few slides, I'll go into more detail regarding the primary use of the cash, capital expenditures and dividends. I will also review our planned debt issuances for 2010.Slide 8 provides detail on the $5.2 billion we expect to spend in 2010 and also shows the committed, ongoing and discretionary capital spending that we currently project for 2011 and 2012. By 2012, we are projecting that our major modernization projects Cliffside, Edwardsport, Buck and Dan River will be in service. As we look beyond 2012, we are beginning to plan for future environmental regulation and potentially, the start of construction of our nuclear plants in South Carolina. We will share perspective on those capital spending plans next year at this time. However, one way to think about our annual capital spending is that on average, we spend approximately $2.5 billion to $3 billion annually on recurring routine expenditures such as maintenance, nuclear fuel and customer additions. Effectively implementing our capital expenditure program is a key area of focus. As we migrate through the present economic environment, we will continue to find the appropriate balance between short-term economic pressures and longer-term investments to meet the needs of our customers and achieve growth in our business. One way that we achieve that balance is introducing some level of flexibility in our allocation and spending of capital.Let me focus on each of our CapEx categories. In 2010, about $3 billion of our capital is committed capital. This includes the dollars allocated for completing Cliffside in the Carolinas, Edwardsport in Indiana and the two combined cycle gas plant additions in the Carolinas, Buck and Dan River. As you saw in Jim's presentation, these major construction projects will be completed by 2012. Committed capital also includes renewable wind and solar projects that are being built under long-term contracts. Roughly $2 billion is for ongoing capital spending, such as customer additions and maintenance costs. The level of maintenance expenditures is consistent with our annual depreciation and helps us to continue to be able to operate our generation fleet and power delivery system in an efficient and reliable manner. We will spend the maintenance capital necessary to ensure the continued high performance of our overall system. However, in the short term, we have flexibility on the timing of this spend. And finally, in the area of discretionary growth capital, primarily in our Commercial businesses, we have the greatest flexibility on whether or not to deploy the capital. Our plan for 2010 includes $200 million for discretionary capital, which represents growth capital that has not yet been designated to specific projects.Additionally, we are giving some broad ranges for potential levels of discretionary spending in 2011 and 2012. The next two years will be significant periods of deploying capital on our regulated business as we complete the fleet and grid modernization projects. As we demonstrated in 2009, we have the flexibility to dial up or dial back our discretionary spending as the environment dictates.With that, I'll move on to another primary use of cash, our dividend payment. We recognize that the dividend is an important component of our shareholder value proposition, and we are committed to growing it. You can expect our dividend to grow at a lower rate than the growth in our adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our current plan reflects a 2% dividend increase in 2010 but, of course, any increase is ultimately a decision of our Board.Next on Slide 10, we provide details on our expected 2010 debt issuances. We estimate total consolidated debt issuances of approximately $2.3 billion. Around 50% of those debt issuances will be in our regulated businesses to support our modernization efforts. We intend to lever our regulated utilities to match the capital structure approved in our rate cases. Additionally, we expect to repay the approximately $400 million we currently have drawn under our Master Credit Facility. Further, we may strategically take advantage of market conditions in 2010 to pre-fund certain 2011 requirements, which could increase the amount of our actual financing levels during the year.Let's move to Slide 11. We enjoy strong investment grade credits rating, with either stable or positive outlook. These ratings support our continued access to the capital market even during volatile market conditions. Historically, our balance sheet strength has served us well, so it should not be a surprise that we remain committed to preserving it. We've also summarized our strong liquidity position as of December 31, 2009, and we will continue to maintain sufficient liquidity for our business mix and risk profile. I'll close with a summary of our financial objective. The underlying strategies that you've heard outlined today have not changed since our last Analyst Meeting in November of 2008. Yet, the economic environment has changed significantly, and we are addressing those challenges. Our financial objectives will be growing our earnings and dividends, allocating capital efficiently and earning competitive return, while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet. Our financial strategy supports Duke Energy's historic focus on providing affordable and reliable service to our customers, while growing our earnings and dividends for our shareholders. So with that, I'll stop and ask Jim and the rest of the senior team to come to the stage, and we'll be happy to answer your question."

So the plan is the plan based on just moving forward as Lynn just laid it out. Secondly, with respect to consolidations, I've had the good fortune to participate in the first wave of consolidation in the early '90s and then participate in the second wave. And I believe that the FirstEnergy announcement might be the start of a third wave, not clear. If you look at our industry, we trade with a very tight P/E band, and so the math is somewhat difficult in terms of combinations. But if you look out over the future and you see how fragmented our industry is and you look at the capital requirements that will come, whether it's from new environmental regulations, from the need to retire and replace existing plans or to invest in upgrading our grids from analog to digital are from the standpoint of spending more capital on an aging infrastructure. I think the capital requirements for our industry are going to be huge, and I think we come off a period where the real price of electricity for the last 50 years has been flat. I believe, and I've been very direct with all our regulators and I'm in the process of having what I call stated union meetings with each group of regulators, and I'm telling them that we see the real price of electricity rising over the next several decades. And so I believe that in that environment of greater capital requirements and rising prices that regulators will be more receptive. And as I look at our own success and our ability to raise capital with our balance sheet and it's a cost of capital for us. We issued probably more debt in the last two years than any other company in the industry and at lower rates. That translates into lower prices for consumers. So that's one of the arguments that can be made in support of consolidation. Obviously, to the extent you can reduce costs, you have to share those costs. I think that also will -- so I think consolidation will come. And I got the question a few moments ago, well, I've heard this stuff before in terms of consolidation back in '95. And the fact of the matter is, we saw consolidation in '95 predicated on a world where we were moving into a deregulated market in our industry, and that didn't happen. And so, people were able to sort of batten down the hatches, and say no and basically stay focused on their business. But I would dare say what's coming, the increase in the real price of electricity and the capital requirements as I'd outlined. That is more likely than not to happen. And if it does happen, I think it drives consolidation. Would you, Bill, like to amplify on that?"

Let me tell you my own view. With respect to the economy, and by the way you all are welcome to disagree, and they often do I might add. I have a point of view that is -- I'm an optimist. You can't be a leader of a company without being an optimist. But I'm also very much a pragmatist as I look forward. And as we look forward, we see the growth in demand over the next five years be very, very anemic. Historically, if you go back in time, and I go all the way back to that time, where for every 1% growth in GDP, there was a 1% growth in the demand of electricity. And actually, before my time, it was actually more than that. And It was almost 1.5% to 2% for every 1% of GDP, as we were providing universal access to the industrialization of America. But what has happened, and it started in the late '80s and early '90s, we saw the loss of manufacturing in the U.S. has start to peel off. And as a consequence of that, the growth in the demand for electricity has fallen to almost 50% of the growth in GDP, rather than one for one. It might be slightly lower than that, particularly given energy efficiency and how efficient our economy's become, et cetera. But if you think the growth in demand is very anemic, that says the growth in GDP is going to be very anemic. I would dare say that my projection -- you can buy Economist to say anything, and they all have different models, but the consensus few that's emerged from when I was at Davos and I listened to a wide range and read a lot, it occurs to me that the growth in GDP is somewhere between 1.5% to 2% over the next five years. So I have pretty pessimistic view. Even though I hope I'm wrong. But I will tell you one other thing, and this really goes to your question kind of in another way, virtually at the end of every recession we've had, going back to 1980, when it was a U and all the Vs that we've had along the way, every time we ended the recession, it was a rebound of the demand for electricity. We currently don't see a rebound for five years. So that says one or two things to you. Maybe the per diem has changed and at the end of recession there won't be rebounds to the future in electricity for a variety of different reasons, or alternatively [ph], it says we're into L-type. Although I heard somebody in a very cute way say the way to think about worldwide economy is love. And I go, what? And he goes, love, kind of in a Southern way. And the L stands for Europe, and what's going to happen there, the U stands for what's going to happen in the United States, and the V -- there's a little difference spelling love, but the V stands for what happens in China and India in terms of the rebound. And I suspect that is probably the reality that we face going forward. Lynn?"

And we're going to be doing this, I think, not in a vacuum. You're going to see other companies. I think Progress just announced -- The News and Observer in Raleigh seem to think it was something they never heard before. We've been talking about it for two years. But Progress announced their own fleet modernization strategy in the Carolinas, whether they were going to shut down old coal and old gas plants as they're starting to build and modernize. What we're embarked upon, I would say, I like to believe we got out in front of some others. But I fully expect you're going to see other companies heading in this exact same direction to modernize their generation fleet, particularly with all the environmental pressures that you heard Dhiaa outlined earlier. It's going to have an upward pressure. So, yes, rates are going up. We've prepared our regulators and consumers forward as much as we can from an education standpoint. And we think we are going to continue to be competitive, vis-à-vis every other player out there as they work through the same issues we're already working through."

And actually, it sort of prompts us to contemplate going back and saying, give us additional authorization to move forward. I personally believe that long-term, that photovoltaic rooftop solar will prompt concentrated solar because of its distributed nature. I also believe, and maybe it's because I'm on the Board of Applied Materials, that I believe solar panels will trump win in the long term, primarily because the distributive generation nature of it over the long term. With respect to our MOUs that we have entered into several with Chinese companies, it's primarily to exchange technology, and to share best practices. I mean, let's recognize and we should recognize that the Chinese are building a new coal plant where you went online every other week. They have 13 new nuclear plants under construction and on the drawing board. They are deploying smart grid in a way that  as they build these new cities, it's really critical that they adopt standards within their operability because at the end of the day, they lead the world in the production of solar panels and wind turbines and batteries. And they could build a supply-chain someday and leave the world with respect to the ability to build nuclear. So they are driven by economic development. And in a sense that we have to retire and replace every plant between 50, we're driven by the need to, in a sense, build new generation. And what I want to do, because in the U.S., we have no monopoly on good ideas and technological developments, but I think in our industry, incremental technological gains will come from the scaling of CCS, will come from building new plants and bringing them online every week. And I want to take advantage of those technological gains that will come when you're actually building something rather than talking about it."

I would say though, that modern gas-fired plants, if Shell gas proves to be real, and the price of gas tends to stabilize at the $4, $5, $6 range, I think those assets will only grow in value over time. I think to the extent, you're in a competitive market like PJM, and you have old coal plants that need to be retired. I think obviously, the value of those assets will diminish as environmental regulations are added. If you have much larger plants that have been retrofitted, I think those plants will either be deregulated. They would probably grow in value. Although there's an open question about the value if you find yourself in our carbon regime on coal plants. So again, I think it depends on could the gas prices going to be in the future, and to me, the driver of gas prices is shell, real or not. And that's a conversation you could have. I think the other thing that's really interesting to note that a lot of our coal suppliers are exploring their coal today to China, and that's going to put up upward pressure on the cost of coal in the future. And I think the other point that I would make is probably, maybe the most important point, is that in all deregulated markets, you don't see anybody proposing in a serious way to build nuclear. You don't see them proposing to build coal plants. And the only thing -- and quite frankly, I'm looking at Ohio, which is a deregulated state, they're not even proposing to build gas plants. And so at some point, there's going to be a need as we modernize our fleet to build. And actually, I believe that states that are deregulated are going to be at a disadvantage to get the jobs that come from the construction of new power plants, and get the tax base to fund schools and get the ongoing job to rebuild the middle class in their state, and are beginning to reconsider reregulating. And if they do consider that, I would recommend Virginia to them as the state has done a pretty good job of reregulating in a sensible way. So I think you're going to see, as we saw the deregulation trend, I think at some point, you're going to see this reregulation thing from state to state, depending on prices. That issue reaches ahead again."

I think there's a variety of approaches to close the gap. And Jim can amplify a little bit on this. But from my perspective, I think we need to totally rethink how we'll regulate it. And I don't think that means just the North Carolina and South Carolina. I think it means in every jurisdiction that we're in. I think that across the country, there's going to be a need to fundamentally rethink how the utility industry is regulated because of this real price of electricity rising. And the way that we were regulated when the mission was universal access when we had great growth in demand, with our economies booming in the 20th century. It worked in that world. In this world, we're going into in the 21st century. Well, we don't see the economic growth yet, where the issue is not universal access, where the issue is really retirement replacement, where the issue really is helping our communities become the most energy-efficient. I think there's some fundamental changes in the regulatory regime just needed to achieve those two objectives. I believe, and this is kind of my way of saying it, is that we're going to go to every state. Actually, Indiana comes closer to being a formula rate state. When you look at all the tractors, you look at the net operating income cap, the adjustment mechanisms, that whole legislative structure is really very close to a formula rate approach. It would probably be easier to morph into a formula rate in Indiana given the underlining legislative framework. But I believe this is something that needs to be done in every state. And so, while one of our objectives in the Carolinas, particularly North Carolina, is to attempt to have tracking equipped. I believe we have to have a much more aggressive legislative agenda, and there are things that Jim and I are talking about doing together and separately. Almost as if we're going to run campaigns and neither one of us are running for office because relative to our governors, we're overpaid. But we're going to be going to every key legislator in our states to build the case for the change in the regulatory paradigm. It has to be changed, and now is the time to really get it done. Jim?"

So for example, declining kilowatt-hours sales or a flattened kilowatt-hour sales to the big contributor of the regulatory lag, when you are in a world where sales are going like this, regulatory lag's a good thing. So what we're trying to figure out is, looking at Lynn's sales forecast over the next few years, though we believe that and if you do believe that, do you take steps to address it? Decoupling is probably one of the best ways to address a flattened or declining sales forecast. But if you believe that the curve is going to turn back up, you may not want to decouple in a particular jurisdiction. I still believe that the Carolinas in particular are going to see very good bold [ph] growth over the next period and I don't know if it's five years, three years, 10 years. But I think Carolinas will continue to see growth. We're looking out and seeing things like pluggable electric vehicles, which could have a very positive impact on load for electric utilities overtime. On the other hand, there's a huge focus on energy efficiency that's happening. So what you might normally see in a sales pickup over time from the economy may have downward pressure sitting on it from energy efficiency standards that the government is promulgating with appliances and lighting and the like. So we're going to try and I think the work we have to do among the team is to try to figure out how to scope the solution to the problem you're solving for. Now there are couple of solutions that I would say are no-brainers and sort of no regrets. Our capital rider for this transmission distribution, for example, would be a no-brainer. In all of our jurisdictions, particularly in Ohio, for our part of the business where that's what we do for the regulated business as T&D. A capital rider is a very good thing and it's sort of no regrets. We got a little of that with the Smart Grid order that we got in Ohio, so we're getting to recover those investments on a relatively realtime basis. We're going to be, I hope, we're going to be surgical and strategic across each of our jurisdictions looking at what we're trying to solve for and put the fix in place that we think makes the most sense. On the sales part, I think that's the hardest nut to crack in terms of what we are solving for because what fits out there in the future is sort of hard to predict at this point."

It goes to a couple of things. One is, we have an aging infrastructure. Two is, we're going to retire and replace our units because of more stringent regulation and the 60% of electricity in this country comes from coal. There's 100,000-megawatts and the 320,000-megawatts of coal in this country that are 40-ish to 70-ish years old. That with stricter regulations, we're probably retired and replaced and that would be in regulated jurisdictions as well as de-regulated jurisdictions. So I think that fact alone is going to mean there's going to be significant and more capital invested. I think if you look into Smart Grid, as we move from analog to Smart Grid, whether it's enabling two-way communications on the wires, distribution wires or whether it's smart meter and what that might enable in terms of plug-in hybrids are more advanced energy efficiency. I think all of -- when I look at the capital investment and retiring our country and modernizing our grid, which is a critical infrastructure in our country. And by the way, Jim has a number for North Carolina and I think it's a remarkable number. He really kind of struck me when he used it, and that is the average family in North Carolina spends $3 a day to run their refrigerator, their computer, their television and just their entire home, which is really a pretty small number. So my point is historically, our growth has been driven by growth in demand and building assets to meet demand in the future period when demand is going to be flat or less than GDP, it's going to be driven by these other factors. And the one thing that Jim didn't mention that I think is really important is open question. We had a steady decline in the loss of manufacturing in this country and I don't know what stops that from continuing because it's sort of went down in the 80s and plateaued in the 90s and then dropped again in the late 90s and it's dropped again as we go into '10. And I don't see the rebirth of manufacturing in the U.S. in a significant way. I can't point to an industry that would be a heavy energy users that would start up. So I think you're going to see, not only a change, so you're not going to see the growth and the demand for like electricity but I think the shape of our load in the future will be fundamentally different than the shape of our load in the past. It will be peakier as you look at residential load because it will have a larger percentage in the total load and that has implications for the type of generation that you build going forward."

And anything, I would say we're probably airing on the side of being more conservative in our approach, but that's very consistent with the world of no surprises. As I mentioned a few moments ago, I don't want to surprise you. I don't want to surprise our regulators, and I don't want our regulators to surprise us. And so having good credibility and openness with them is really critical. The other thing you have to walk out of here with is we're focused on the long-term and we've managed our way to a very tough recessionary period. We've been able to grow our dividend 4%, hold our earnings flat in a period that was very challenging. And so I think that I'm very proud of our ability to kind of motor through that period but recognizing we have a tougher period ahead. The last point I would make is looking at the management team, we just represent a few among many, but I will tell you we have a great clarity in terms of what we must do. But we also raise our head up and look at the horizon and try to anticipate what's happening and we gave you examples of anticipation today because while we are a capital intensive industry and it's hard to kind of turn the ship, we have about as much agility as you can imagine possible, given the type of company we are and the industry that we're in. But we think agility is really important. And for you all that realize how we pivoted back in the 90s when we were going, when we're headed to competition and pivoted away from that in a safe way. There's a lot of possible pivots in our future. But at the end of the day, we've always have the ability to see around the corner, make a good bet and make the turn in a timely way. I think this slide, the one that was on the charts, I want to slide up there at the very end because if you take any slide out of year and memorize it, or tattoo to it, if you're kind of into that, on your shoulder or your back or put it in your pocket, this is the slide that you ought to have because we are committed to delivering the 4% to 6% earnings growth. We're committed to dividend growth and we're committed to a strong balance sheet. And we think a strong balance sheet is probably more important now than ever because of the uncertainties before us. Capital's our lifeblood. We want access to capital and we've had it. They're one of the biggest financial meltdowns in the history of our country. And we want it in the future and we also want the ability to beat our competitors at excessing capital at lower prices, and we think we have the capability to do that as we've demonstrated during this difficult period. So thank you all very much for coming. We're going to honor our covenant to you and we appreciate your investment in us. Thank you very much."

267850,100602918,59377,"Duke Energy Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 04, 2010",2010-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Duke Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Stephen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest and investment in Duke Energy. We had a strong first quarter. As you saw in our news release this morning, we announced adjusted diluted earnin",528,"Thank you, Stephen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest and investment in Duke Energy. We had a strong first quarter. As you saw in our news release this morning, we announced adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.36 for the first quarter of '10 versus $0.28 for the first quarter of '09. Reported diluted EPS for the first quarter 2010 was $0.34 compared to $0.27 for the first quarter 2009. 
These solid results were primarily due to three factors: One, favorable weather; two, an increase in weather-normalized retail sales volumes; and three, the impact from the base rate increases approved in 2009 in North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio and Kentucky. When fully implemented, these four increases will increase base rates by over $450 million a year.
During the quarter, we experienced colder-than-normal weather across our service territories. Actually, in the Carolinas, February was one of the coldest on record and on January 11, we set a new winter peak for power demand. Relating to the economy, the signs of stabilization we began to see late last year, continued through the first quarter. Even though we continue to believe that the economic recovery will be gradual, this continued improvement gives us more confidence that the worst may be behind us. 
With these results, we are on track to achieve the 2010 adjusted diluted EPS outlook range of $1.25 to $1.30, the guidance we reported at our February analyst meeting. Achievement of this year's EPS range assumes normal weather, continued success with our cost control efforts and maintaining our strong operational performance. And remember, our third quarter is historically our most significant quarter of the year. 
In addition to the base rate increases I noted, I would like to highlight several of our key developments so far in 2010. First, we continue to make progress with our major construction projects. In our Regulated businesses, Cliffside is over 60% complete and Edwardsport is over 55% complete. Last month, we filed a cost update for the Edwardsport plant with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, which I will discuss later in more detail. Additionally, in our Commercial businesses, we are on target to bring over 250 megawatts of wind generation online in 2010. 
Second, we continued our cost control efforts, including implementing our voluntary employee separation and office consolidation plans. We are on track to achieve our target of maintaining our 2010 O&M costs, net of deferrals and cost recovery riders flat with 2009. 
Third, we remain focused on maintaining the strong operational performance of our generation fleet and grid. During the first quarter, we continued our strong operational performance such as our nuclear capacity factor, which ended the quarter at over 98%. 
Finally, in Duke Energy International, we extended the joint venture agreement for National Methanol Company, NMC, by 20 years until 2032. This joint venture, which was scheduled to expire in 2011, has historically generated 20% to 30% of International's earnings contribution. We are very pleased with being able to extend this earnings stream.
Let me now turn it over to Lynn, for a more detailed summary of the first quarter."
267850,100602918,59377,"Duke Energy Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 04, 2010",2010-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Duke Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. Let me begin with an overview of our financial performance.Slide 4 contains details on our adjusted segment EBIT results for the quarter compared to the prior year, as well",1691,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. Let me begin with an overview of our financial performance.
Slide 4 contains details on our adjusted segment EBIT results for the quarter compared to the prior year, as well as the significant earnings drivers quarter-over-quarter. As you can see in the table on this slide, our total adjusted segment EBIT increased over $200 million, when compared with the first quarter of last year. 
Both our U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas and International business segments showed improvement.  While Commercial Power's results were generally flat with the first quarter of 2009, a credit to the hard work of our Ohio team and a challenging market environment. 
The U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas segment increased adjusted segment EBIT by $187 million.  Roughly half of this increase was due to rate increases approved in 2009 and our Regulated businesses. These include: Electric rate cases in both of the Carolinas, the electric distribution case in Ohio and the gas distribution case in Kentucky. These rate increases reflect the recovery of investments in our systems to make them more reliable, efficient and clean. 
Favorable weather and increased sales volumes were the other significant drivers for the quarter. In the Carolinas, heating degree days were 22% above normal, while Charlotte experienced its coldest winter in over 40 years. While less extreme, weather was also favorable in the Midwest with heating degree days 11% above normal. I'll talk more about economic trends on or weather-normalized sales volumes in a few minutes.
In our Commercial Powers segment, lower native margins, mostly due to customers switching pressures in Ohio, were offset by increased contributions from our Midwest gas assets. These contributions resulted from higher PJM capacity auction revenue. Additionally, the coal generation fleet experienced lower O&M expenses, principally due to fewer outages. Our Duke Energy Retail Sales customer acquisition efforts continue to mitigate the impact of customer switching. 
Our International segment's adjusted EBIT increased $47 million over first quarter 2009, primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange rates primarily in Brazil and improved contributions from our investment in National Methanol, principally due to higher commodity prices. 
Two additional drivers lowered our overall results. The first was increased interest expense of $26 million due to higher debt balances. And the second was a charge of $17 million related to changes in the tax treatment of Medicare Part D subsidies resulting from the passage of health care legislation in March. 
For more detailed quarter-over-quarter drivers for each of our segments, please refer to the accompanying appendix.
On Slide 5, I will review sales volume trends by customer class in our Regulated business. As we entered 2010, we expected a slow economic recovery and forecasted overall weather-normalized load growth to be flat to 2009. We believe that with double-digit unemployment levels in many of our service territories and vulnerability of industrial load in market segments like textiles, it was prudent to plan the year, assuming that 2010 would look like 2009. 
As you can see on this slide however, our sales volumes for the first quarter of 2010 were higher than these original expectations. Overall, our weather-normalized electric volumes increased approximately 2.5% when compared to the same quarter in 2009. 
Due primarily to the strength in the Primary Metals and Textile sectors, our weather-normalized Industrial sales volumes increased by approximately 9%. The Primary Metals sector experienced an increase of over 30%, while the Textile sector experienced an increase of around 10%. 
Our Primary Metals customers tell us that they are running at production levels higher than anticipated at the start of the year, supported by strength in the automotive industry and a replenishment of inventories. 
Similarly, our Textile customers are experiencing production levels in early '10 significantly above first quarter 2009 production levels. 
While we are pleased with these production increases, we're cautious about sustained growth at these levels over the balance of the year. The appendix of this presentation contains additional details on quarterly Industrial volume trends. As we have done in the past, but we will continue to monitor industrial activities through our ongoing discussions with our customers.
Let's move on to our Commercial and Residential sales activity. Our weather-normalized Commercial sales volumes declined slightly during the first quarter of 2010, when compared to the first quarter of 2009. This decline is consistent with our expectations as trends in this customer class has historically lagged the overall economy. 
Our Residential sales volumes remain a bright spot. During the quarter, Residential weather-normalized sales volumes increased approximately 1.5% over first quarter 2009 levels. This growth is supported by increases in our customer base. During the recession and into 2010, customer growth has been primarily focused in the Carolinas and now, for the first time since the third quarter of 2008, we are seeing moderate customer growth in the Midwest. 
Overall, based on these first quarter 2010 trends, we are cautiously optimistic about the economy but continue to believe that recovery will be slow and moderate. Although we see signs of recovery, high unemployment levels persist in many of our service territories. We will continue to closely monitor trends in each customer class as the year progresses.
Next, I'll update you on competition in Ohio. You may recall that as economic pressures mounted into early 2009, energy demand collapsed and wholesale power prices fell dramatically. This created a gap between Duke Energy's established ESP price in Ohio and the prevailing market price, providing an economic incentive for customers to switch energy suppliers. As a result, we began to see an increase in switching primarily in our Commercial and Industrial customer classes. 
Our competitive retail arm, Duke Energy Retail Sales, quickly became active in the Ohio market and successfully acquired a large portion of Duke Energy Ohio's switched load. By the end of 2009, the growth switching rate was around 40%, while the net switching rate, net of customer load acquired by Duke Energy Retail Sales, was about 15%. The unfavorable financial impact for 2009 was approximately $0.02 per share. 
As we entered 2010, market prices remained low and we expected switching to continue. In establishing our earnings outlook for 2010, we estimated that the year-over-year EPS impact in the range of $0.04 to $0.07 and average gross switching at 45% for the year. 
Based on our experience in the first quarter, we now expect gross switching to average 50% to 55% and to be in the upper end of the $0.04 to $0.07 EPS range. Switching continues to occur primarily in our Commercial and Industrial classes. 
To date, Residential switching has been moderate. However, we are seeing increased competitor activity in the Residential sector in both government aggregation efforts and in the targeting of individual Residential customers. Duke Energy Retail Sales is active in the Residential aggregation market as well. 
We actively seek ways to maintain the highest level of profitability and the dynamic environment in Ohio. Our retail arm, Duke Energy Retail Sales, will continue to pursue customer acquisitions aggressively, whether it is through a defensive strategy of acquiring customers in our service territory, or an offensive strategy in which we are selectively attracting customers outside of our service territory.
Now let me move on to Slide 7, which summarizes our ongoing efforts and results from our cost control measures. During 2009, we mitigated the impact of the down economy with cost control efforts, while maintaining our focus on operational excellence. We are continuing these efforts into 2010. 
Our cost objective for 2010 is to hold O&M, net of deferrals and cost recovery writers flat to 2009. As a result, we must sustain the O&M cuts we achieved in 2009 as well as observe absorb the impact of inflation. 
You can see on the accompanying chart that during the first quarter, our O&M, net of deferrals and cost recovery writers, was slightly below the first quarter of last year. These results reflect the benefit of our ongoing cost control measures as well as lower storm costs compared to 2009 and the timing of other expenditures. To date, we are on track to achieve our cost objective for 2010.
Let me also spend a few minutes highlighting our voluntary separation and office consolidation plans. In the first quarter, we offered a voluntary separation plan to our employees. The window for this offering has closed, with approximately 900 employees selecting or electing to accept the offer. 
Additionally, we began the process to transfer and consolidate corporate functions to our headquarters in Charlotte, which will be completed over the next several years. Excluding approximately $15 million of pension-related costs, we expect to recognize total charges related to these programs of approximately $165 million. 
We are targeting savings that will result in a two to three-year payback period. During the first quarter, we recognized approximately $68 million in charges and expect to recognize most of the remaining costs in 2010. 
We remain committed to cost control measures but be assured that we will spend the dollars necessary to ensure the continued reliability and quality of our service to customers. In the appendix, you will find details of our quarterly performance compared to our annual expectations for a few key operational metrics. 
Our focus on cost control and operational excellence is not merely financially motivated. Given our active regulatory calendar, it is important that we control costs and efficiently operate our plants to lessen the impact of price increases on our customers. In other words, cost control and operational excellence are very important in furthering our mission to provide affordable, reliable and clean energy to our customers. 
In closing, we are on track to be within the $1.25 to $1.30 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range for 2010. We are encouraged by our strong start in 2010, principally driven by favorable weather and volume trend. However, it is premature to adjust our expectations for the entire year based on one quarter's performance. We have three quarters ahead of us, including the third quarter, which is historically our most significant one. 
With that, of I will turn it back over to Jim for closing remarks."
267850,100602918,59377,"Duke Energy Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 04, 2010",2010-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Duke Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Lynn. Over the next three years, we expect to invest between $14 billion to $15 billion to modernize our generation, transmission and distribution system, maintain our facilities and sustain the earnings and cash flow from our Commercial busine",1295,"Thank you, Lynn. Over the next three years, we expect to invest between $14 billion to $15 billion to modernize our generation, transmission and distribution system, maintain our facilities and sustain the earnings and cash flow from our Commercial businesses. Approximately 75% of these investments will be made in our Regulated businesses, giving us the ability to replace some of our older, less efficient plants with new, efficient and lower emitting units. 
This becomes even more important given our belief that every power plant we operate today will need to be replaced by 2050 as a result of normal aging and technological obsolescence, with the exception of our hydro units and of course, assuming no further nuclear relicensing. 
In keeping the appropriate long-term focus, I am reminded that the decisions we make today will still be impacting the company decades from now, as the power plants we are building will operate for 30, 40, or even 50 years or more. Let me now provide a summary of our major regulated construction projects. 
As I noted earlier, our Cliffside project is over 60% complete and on budget. Through March 31, we have spent approximately $1.3 billion of the approximately $2.4 billion project total, including financing cost. 
As you all may remember, we made a commitment to North Carolina air regulators that we will retire approximately 1,000 megawatts of older, less efficient, coal-fired generation through 2018 when Cliffside Unit 6 becomes operational in 2012. 
Also, the Cliffside modernization project involves the installation of a scrubber on our existing Unit 5, which will share a common stack with Unit 6. The Unit 5 scrubber is on time and on budget, and it is scheduled to become operational this fall. 
The Edwardsport project Indiana is over 55% complete, with final engineering over 90% complete. Through March 31, we have spent approximately $1.6 billion on the project, including financing cost. 
This project is expected to become operational in 2012 and will give us the ability to replace the existing 160 megawatts of 1940s era generation located at the site. It will also help offset the required shutdown last fall of three units totaling 265 megawatts at our Wabash River station in Indiana. This shutdown stemmed from last spring's ruling in our new source review case. 
As I noted earlier, in April, we informed the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission that the cost estimate of the Edwardsport project would increase to around $2.88 billion, about $530 million higher than the previous estimate. The main drivers for the increase are design evolution and scope growth arising from the uniqueness, complexity and scale of this plant. This is the first time a plant using this advanced cleaner coal technology has been built anywhere in the world at this scale. 
Unlike a plant design that has been constructed many times, this project is essentially custom design, so existing guidance is limited on the project scope and the amounts of materials needed. 
One of the larger items contributing to the cost increase is the need for a gray water treatment system at the plant, a cost of approximately $125 million. We are presenting to the commission a complete and detailed explanation of what is driving the higher estimated cost. 
Meanwhile, we are working hard with our vendors and contractors and all facets of the project to find ways to mitigate these increased costs. We filed our testimony supporting the increased cost estimate in mid-April, and the IURC will conduct a hearing on this issue in August. 
Finally, let me comment on our Buck and Dan River combined cycle gas-fired projects in North Carolina. We have broken ground on Buck and are making progress on our pre-construction efforts at Dan River. Both are on track and expected to come online in 2011 and 2012 respectively. These two projects are estimated to cost a total of approximately $1.4 billion including financing cost. 
Before I close, let me take a moment to give you our point of view on the status of the energy and climate change legislation in Washington. The conventional wisdom today in Washington is that there is a low probability that a bill will be passed this year. Congress faces several options at this juncture. 
First, they can start over in the next session of Congress and leave it to the EPA to act in 2011 if Congress fails to act by year end. Secondly, they can attempt to pass Senators Kerry and Lieberman's bill and as you all know, Senator Graham stepped away for a variety of reasons two weeks ago from the support of this bill. But this bill is currently being modeled by the EPA, and they should complete their work in five to six weeks. 
And as can be expected, numerous other senators are drafting a variety of related bills. Some are discussing the pursuit of a utility-only energy and carbon bill. It would be coupled with provisions that would reduce further the emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury. Certainly, this would give the utility industry a complete and clear roadmap as to its future admissions requirements. I suspect that this is a low-probability outcome in the coming months. 
Every week seems different.  With the oil spill last week, the probabilities and possibilities seem to change yet again. So my report to you is more to come as we move forward, addressing this issue in Washington.
Turning to Slide 9, this is a slide we will come back to throughout the year to demonstrate the progress we continue to make to fulfill the short and long-term commitments we made to you at our February Analyst Meeting. As you can see, with the first quarter behind us, we are on track for our short-term commitments; such as achieving the 2010 adjusted diluted EPS range of $1.25 to $1.30 and continuing our plans to finance the business. 
Although it is important to focus on our short-term objectives, our business makes it imperative that we stay focused on the longer-term. This is why we have been active in Washington, as well as at the state and local levels, fighting for fair and reasonable legislative outcomes for both our customers and investors. 
Our long-term commitments include the following: First, growing earnings and dividends. Our plans support achieving a 4% to 6% compounded annual growth rate and adjusted diluted EPS off a base of 2009 over the next few years. 
Additionally, we are targeting continued growth in the dividend, but at a rate slower than the growth in our adjusted diluted EPS. 2010 represents the 84th consecutive year that Duke Energy has paid a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock. 
Second, allocating capital efficiently and earning competitive returns. In our Regulated businesses, the mitigation of regulatory lag closing the gap between are allowed and earned returns is job one. In our Commercial business, job one is achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns. 
And finally, maintaining a strong balance sheet. This involves maintaining our liquidity and credit ratings, which supports our ability to execute on our business plans. Overall, our long-term focus on modernizing our fleet and grid makes Duke a solid value proposition for investors. 
Before we take your questions, I would also like to refer you to our 2009 and 2010 sustainability report, which we recently published. This report has extensive metrics on our operational and environmental performance over the last year. 
It also describes how we make decisions, balancing the need for affordable, reliable and increasingly clean energy. 2009 was the fourth consecutive year that Duke Energy was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North American Companies in the electric utility sector. You can access our sustainability report on our website at www.duke-energy.com.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's First Quarter 2010 Earnings Review. Leading our discussion today are Jim Rogers, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lynn Good, Group Executive and Chief Financial Officer. Those of you who are familiar with our earnings calls will notice that today's presentation will be more streamlined than in the past. Some of the detail we used to cover the main section has been moved to an appendix that includes expanded disclosures to help you analyze the company's performance. By focusing the call on the major drivers of our results, we are able to reserve more time for your valuable questions, which we will take after our prepared remarks. 
In addition to Jim and Lynn, Jim Turner, the head of our Franchised Electric and Gas businesses; and Keith Trent, the head of our Commercial businesses, will also be available to answer your questions. Before we begin, let me remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information in our 2009 10-K and other SEC filings concerning factors that could cause future results to differ from this forward-looking information. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website and in today's materials.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest and investment in Duke Energy. We had a strong first quarter. As you saw in our news release this morning, we announced adjusted diluted earnin",528,"Thank you, Stephen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest and investment in Duke Energy. We had a strong first quarter. As you saw in our news release this morning, we announced adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.36 for the first quarter of '10 versus $0.28 for the first quarter of '09. Reported diluted EPS for the first quarter 2010 was $0.34 compared to $0.27 for the first quarter 2009. 
These solid results were primarily due to three factors: One, favorable weather; two, an increase in weather-normalized retail sales volumes; and three, the impact from the base rate increases approved in 2009 in North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio and Kentucky. When fully implemented, these four increases will increase base rates by over $450 million a year.
During the quarter, we experienced colder-than-normal weather across our service territories. Actually, in the Carolinas, February was one of the coldest on record and on January 11, we set a new winter peak for power demand. Relating to the economy, the signs of stabilization we began to see late last year, continued through the first quarter. Even though we continue to believe that the economic recovery will be gradual, this continued improvement gives us more confidence that the worst may be behind us. 
With these results, we are on track to achieve the 2010 adjusted diluted EPS outlook range of $1.25 to $1.30, the guidance we reported at our February analyst meeting. Achievement of this year's EPS range assumes normal weather, continued success with our cost control efforts and maintaining our strong operational performance. And remember, our third quarter is historically our most significant quarter of the year. 
In addition to the base rate increases I noted, I would like to highlight several of our key developments so far in 2010. First, we continue to make progress with our major construction projects. In our Regulated businesses, Cliffside is over 60% complete and Edwardsport is over 55% complete. Last month, we filed a cost update for the Edwardsport plant with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, which I will discuss later in more detail. Additionally, in our Commercial businesses, we are on target to bring over 250 megawatts of wind generation online in 2010. 
Second, we continued our cost control efforts, including implementing our voluntary employee separation and office consolidation plans. We are on track to achieve our target of maintaining our 2010 O&M costs, net of deferrals and cost recovery riders flat with 2009. 
Third, we remain focused on maintaining the strong operational performance of our generation fleet and grid. During the first quarter, we continued our strong operational performance such as our nuclear capacity factor, which ended the quarter at over 98%. 
Finally, in Duke Energy International, we extended the joint venture agreement for National Methanol Company, NMC, by 20 years until 2032. This joint venture, which was scheduled to expire in 2011, has historically generated 20% to 30% of International's earnings contribution. We are very pleased with being able to extend this earnings stream.
Let me now turn it over to Lynn, for a more detailed summary of the first quarter.

And thank you for joining us today. Let me begin with an overview of our financial performance.Slide 4 contains details on our adjusted segment EBIT results for the quarter compared to the prior year, as well",1691,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. Let me begin with an overview of our financial performance.
Slide 4 contains details on our adjusted segment EBIT results for the quarter compared to the prior year, as well as the significant earnings drivers quarter-over-quarter. As you can see in the table on this slide, our total adjusted segment EBIT increased over $200 million, when compared with the first quarter of last year. 
Both our U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas and International business segments showed improvement.  While Commercial Power's results were generally flat with the first quarter of 2009, a credit to the hard work of our Ohio team and a challenging market environment. 
The U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas segment increased adjusted segment EBIT by $187 million.  Roughly half of this increase was due to rate increases approved in 2009 and our Regulated businesses. These include: Electric rate cases in both of the Carolinas, the electric distribution case in Ohio and the gas distribution case in Kentucky. These rate increases reflect the recovery of investments in our systems to make them more reliable, efficient and clean. 
Favorable weather and increased sales volumes were the other significant drivers for the quarter. In the Carolinas, heating degree days were 22% above normal, while Charlotte experienced its coldest winter in over 40 years. While less extreme, weather was also favorable in the Midwest with heating degree days 11% above normal. I'll talk more about economic trends on or weather-normalized sales volumes in a few minutes.
In our Commercial Powers segment, lower native margins, mostly due to customers switching pressures in Ohio, were offset by increased contributions from our Midwest gas assets. These contributions resulted from higher PJM capacity auction revenue. Additionally, the coal generation fleet experienced lower O&M expenses, principally due to fewer outages. Our Duke Energy Retail Sales customer acquisition efforts continue to mitigate the impact of customer switching. 
Our International segment's adjusted EBIT increased $47 million over first quarter 2009, primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange rates primarily in Brazil and improved contributions from our investment in National Methanol, principally due to higher commodity prices. 
Two additional drivers lowered our overall results. The first was increased interest expense of $26 million due to higher debt balances. And the second was a charge of $17 million related to changes in the tax treatment of Medicare Part D subsidies resulting from the passage of health care legislation in March. 
For more detailed quarter-over-quarter drivers for each of our segments, please refer to the accompanying appendix.
On Slide 5, I will review sales volume trends by customer class in our Regulated business. As we entered 2010, we expected a slow economic recovery and forecasted overall weather-normalized load growth to be flat to 2009. We believe that with double-digit unemployment levels in many of our service territories and vulnerability of industrial load in market segments like textiles, it was prudent to plan the year, assuming that 2010 would look like 2009. 
As you can see on this slide however, our sales volumes for the first quarter of 2010 were higher than these original expectations. Overall, our weather-normalized electric volumes increased approximately 2.5% when compared to the same quarter in 2009. 
Due primarily to the strength in the Primary Metals and Textile sectors, our weather-normalized Industrial sales volumes increased by approximately 9%. The Primary Metals sector experienced an increase of over 30%, while the Textile sector experienced an increase of around 10%. 
Our Primary Metals customers tell us that they are running at production levels higher than anticipated at the start of the year, supported by strength in the automotive industry and a replenishment of inventories. 
Similarly, our Textile customers are experiencing production levels in early '10 significantly above first quarter 2009 production levels. 
While we are pleased with these production increases, we're cautious about sustained growth at these levels over the balance of the year. The appendix of this presentation contains additional details on quarterly Industrial volume trends. As we have done in the past, but we will continue to monitor industrial activities through our ongoing discussions with our customers.
Let's move on to our Commercial and Residential sales activity. Our weather-normalized Commercial sales volumes declined slightly during the first quarter of 2010, when compared to the first quarter of 2009. This decline is consistent with our expectations as trends in this customer class has historically lagged the overall economy. 
Our Residential sales volumes remain a bright spot. During the quarter, Residential weather-normalized sales volumes increased approximately 1.5% over first quarter 2009 levels. This growth is supported by increases in our customer base. During the recession and into 2010, customer growth has been primarily focused in the Carolinas and now, for the first time since the third quarter of 2008, we are seeing moderate customer growth in the Midwest. 
Overall, based on these first quarter 2010 trends, we are cautiously optimistic about the economy but continue to believe that recovery will be slow and moderate. Although we see signs of recovery, high unemployment levels persist in many of our service territories. We will continue to closely monitor trends in each customer class as the year progresses.
Next, I'll update you on competition in Ohio. You may recall that as economic pressures mounted into early 2009, energy demand collapsed and wholesale power prices fell dramatically. This created a gap between Duke Energy's established ESP price in Ohio and the prevailing market price, providing an economic incentive for customers to switch energy suppliers. As a result, we began to see an increase in switching primarily in our Commercial and Industrial customer classes. 
Our competitive retail arm, Duke Energy Retail Sales, quickly became active in the Ohio market and successfully acquired a large portion of Duke Energy Ohio's switched load. By the end of 2009, the growth switching rate was around 40%, while the net switching rate, net of customer load acquired by Duke Energy Retail Sales, was about 15%. The unfavorable financial impact for 2009 was approximately $0.02 per share. 
As we entered 2010, market prices remained low and we expected switching to continue. In establishing our earnings outlook for 2010, we estimated that the year-over-year EPS impact in the range of $0.04 to $0.07 and average gross switching at 45% for the year. 
Based on our experience in the first quarter, we now expect gross switching to average 50% to 55% and to be in the upper end of the $0.04 to $0.07 EPS range. Switching continues to occur primarily in our Commercial and Industrial classes. 
To date, Residential switching has been moderate. However, we are seeing increased competitor activity in the Residential sector in both government aggregation efforts and in the targeting of individual Residential customers. Duke Energy Retail Sales is active in the Residential aggregation market as well. 
We actively seek ways to maintain the highest level of profitability and the dynamic environment in Ohio. Our retail arm, Duke Energy Retail Sales, will continue to pursue customer acquisitions aggressively, whether it is through a defensive strategy of acquiring customers in our service territory, or an offensive strategy in which we are selectively attracting customers outside of our service territory.
Now let me move on to Slide 7, which summarizes our ongoing efforts and results from our cost control measures. During 2009, we mitigated the impact of the down economy with cost control efforts, while maintaining our focus on operational excellence. We are continuing these efforts into 2010. 
Our cost objective for 2010 is to hold O&M, net of deferrals and cost recovery writers flat to 2009. As a result, we must sustain the O&M cuts we achieved in 2009 as well as observe absorb the impact of inflation. 
You can see on the accompanying chart that during the first quarter, our O&M, net of deferrals and cost recovery writers, was slightly below the first quarter of last year. These results reflect the benefit of our ongoing cost control measures as well as lower storm costs compared to 2009 and the timing of other expenditures. To date, we are on track to achieve our cost objective for 2010.
Let me also spend a few minutes highlighting our voluntary separation and office consolidation plans. In the first quarter, we offered a voluntary separation plan to our employees. The window for this offering has closed, with approximately 900 employees selecting or electing to accept the offer. 
Additionally, we began the process to transfer and consolidate corporate functions to our headquarters in Charlotte, which will be completed over the next several years. Excluding approximately $15 million of pension-related costs, we expect to recognize total charges related to these programs of approximately $165 million. 
We are targeting savings that will result in a two to three-year payback period. During the first quarter, we recognized approximately $68 million in charges and expect to recognize most of the remaining costs in 2010. 
We remain committed to cost control measures but be assured that we will spend the dollars necessary to ensure the continued reliability and quality of our service to customers. In the appendix, you will find details of our quarterly performance compared to our annual expectations for a few key operational metrics. 
Our focus on cost control and operational excellence is not merely financially motivated. Given our active regulatory calendar, it is important that we control costs and efficiently operate our plants to lessen the impact of price increases on our customers. In other words, cost control and operational excellence are very important in furthering our mission to provide affordable, reliable and clean energy to our customers. 
In closing, we are on track to be within the $1.25 to $1.30 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range for 2010. We are encouraged by our strong start in 2010, principally driven by favorable weather and volume trend. However, it is premature to adjust our expectations for the entire year based on one quarter's performance. We have three quarters ahead of us, including the third quarter, which is historically our most significant one. 
With that, of I will turn it back over to Jim for closing remarks.

267850,100602918,59381,"Duke Energy Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 04, 2010",2010-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Duke Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Lynn. Over the next three years, we expect to invest between $14 billion to $15 billion to modernize our generation, transmission and distribution system, maintain our facilities and sustain the earnings and cash flow from our Commercial busine",1295,"Thank you, Lynn. Over the next three years, we expect to invest between $14 billion to $15 billion to modernize our generation, transmission and distribution system, maintain our facilities and sustain the earnings and cash flow from our Commercial businesses. Approximately 75% of these investments will be made in our Regulated businesses, giving us the ability to replace some of our older, less efficient plants with new, efficient and lower emitting units. 
This becomes even more important given our belief that every power plant we operate today will need to be replaced by 2050 as a result of normal aging and technological obsolescence, with the exception of our hydro units and of course, assuming no further nuclear relicensing. 
In keeping the appropriate long-term focus, I am reminded that the decisions we make today will still be impacting the company decades from now, as the power plants we are building will operate for 30, 40, or even 50 years or more. Let me now provide a summary of our major regulated construction projects. 
As I noted earlier, our Cliffside project is over 60% complete and on budget. Through March 31, we have spent approximately $1.3 billion of the approximately $2.4 billion project total, including financing cost. 
As you all may remember, we made a commitment to North Carolina air regulators that we will retire approximately 1,000 megawatts of older, less efficient, coal-fired generation through 2018 when Cliffside Unit 6 becomes operational in 2012. 
Also, the Cliffside modernization project involves the installation of a scrubber on our existing Unit 5, which will share a common stack with Unit 6. The Unit 5 scrubber is on time and on budget, and it is scheduled to become operational this fall. 
The Edwardsport project Indiana is over 55% complete, with final engineering over 90% complete. Through March 31, we have spent approximately $1.6 billion on the project, including financing cost. 
This project is expected to become operational in 2012 and will give us the ability to replace the existing 160 megawatts of 1940s era generation located at the site. It will also help offset the required shutdown last fall of three units totaling 265 megawatts at our Wabash River station in Indiana. This shutdown stemmed from last spring's ruling in our new source review case. 
As I noted earlier, in April, we informed the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission that the cost estimate of the Edwardsport project would increase to around $2.88 billion, about $530 million higher than the previous estimate. The main drivers for the increase are design evolution and scope growth arising from the uniqueness, complexity and scale of this plant. This is the first time a plant using this advanced cleaner coal technology has been built anywhere in the world at this scale. 
Unlike a plant design that has been constructed many times, this project is essentially custom design, so existing guidance is limited on the project scope and the amounts of materials needed. 
One of the larger items contributing to the cost increase is the need for a gray water treatment system at the plant, a cost of approximately $125 million. We are presenting to the commission a complete and detailed explanation of what is driving the higher estimated cost. 
Meanwhile, we are working hard with our vendors and contractors and all facets of the project to find ways to mitigate these increased costs. We filed our testimony supporting the increased cost estimate in mid-April, and the IURC will conduct a hearing on this issue in August. 
Finally, let me comment on our Buck and Dan River combined cycle gas-fired projects in North Carolina. We have broken ground on Buck and are making progress on our pre-construction efforts at Dan River. Both are on track and expected to come online in 2011 and 2012 respectively. These two projects are estimated to cost a total of approximately $1.4 billion including financing cost. 
Before I close, let me take a moment to give you our point of view on the status of the energy and climate change legislation in Washington. The conventional wisdom today in Washington is that there is a low probability that a bill will be passed this year. Congress faces several options at this juncture. 
First, they can start over in the next session of Congress and leave it to the EPA to act in 2011 if Congress fails to act by year end. Secondly, they can attempt to pass Senators Kerry and Lieberman's bill and as you all know, Senator Graham stepped away for a variety of reasons two weeks ago from the support of this bill. But this bill is currently being modeled by the EPA, and they should complete their work in five to six weeks. 
And as can be expected, numerous other senators are drafting a variety of related bills. Some are discussing the pursuit of a utility-only energy and carbon bill. It would be coupled with provisions that would reduce further the emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury. Certainly, this would give the utility industry a complete and clear roadmap as to its future admissions requirements. I suspect that this is a low-probability outcome in the coming months. 
Every week seems different.  With the oil spill last week, the probabilities and possibilities seem to change yet again. So my report to you is more to come as we move forward, addressing this issue in Washington.
Turning to Slide 9, this is a slide we will come back to throughout the year to demonstrate the progress we continue to make to fulfill the short and long-term commitments we made to you at our February Analyst Meeting. As you can see, with the first quarter behind us, we are on track for our short-term commitments; such as achieving the 2010 adjusted diluted EPS range of $1.25 to $1.30 and continuing our plans to finance the business. 
Although it is important to focus on our short-term objectives, our business makes it imperative that we stay focused on the longer-term. This is why we have been active in Washington, as well as at the state and local levels, fighting for fair and reasonable legislative outcomes for both our customers and investors. 
Our long-term commitments include the following: First, growing earnings and dividends. Our plans support achieving a 4% to 6% compounded annual growth rate and adjusted diluted EPS off a base of 2009 over the next few years. 
Additionally, we are targeting continued growth in the dividend, but at a rate slower than the growth in our adjusted diluted EPS. 2010 represents the 84th consecutive year that Duke Energy has paid a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock. 
Second, allocating capital efficiently and earning competitive returns. In our Regulated businesses, the mitigation of regulatory lag closing the gap between are allowed and earned returns is job one. In our Commercial business, job one is achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns. 
And finally, maintaining a strong balance sheet. This involves maintaining our liquidity and credit ratings, which supports our ability to execute on our business plans. Overall, our long-term focus on modernizing our fleet and grid makes Duke a solid value proposition for investors. 
Before we take your questions, I would also like to refer you to our 2009 and 2010 sustainability report, which we recently published. This report has extensive metrics on our operational and environmental performance over the last year. 
It also describes how we make decisions, balancing the need for affordable, reliable and increasingly clean energy. 2009 was the fourth consecutive year that Duke Energy was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North American Companies in the electric utility sector. You can access our sustainability report on our website at www.duke-energy.com.

The one thing that I do feel good about at this point is the engineering is essentially complete. Most of the equipment has now been ordered and a lot of the design evolution and scope growth that drove this particular increase came as our vendor was finishing up the engineering work on the project. We really saw a lot of the scope growth and design changes happen that impacted the size of the project. And if you want to think about it this way, we're essentially building a plant that's half again as big as the original feed study that was done in early 2007 contemplated, but a lot of that now is locked in. Now the thing we're really focused on is managing the construction at the site, because that's really where all the work is left to be done, with all the engineering work pretty much behind us. So your question is a good one. The incremental rate impact we identified in the testimony is about 3% over where we thought the project was going to be. And what we did in our testimony is we also did a brief summary, integrated resource planning exercise, which showed that the plant continues to be a cost-effective option for us in Indiana even at the increased price. This project's enjoyed huge support huge support from Indiana so far. It's one of the largest construction projects in the state's history. It's obviously employing a lot of people in the state right now. I think it continues to enjoy political support in Indiana and will continue to enjoy political support even at the increased estimate.

The one thing I'd say and I'd reinforce what Jim said earlier which is the commission has had Black & Veatch on staff as an advisor since about mid-2008. They have been on site at Edwardsport literally every step of the way with this in project reviews, with our major vendors as we've gone through the construction process. So there are clearly no surprises in that sense with the project. Your question about the wastewater treatment system, I'll address specifically. When we originally had the project design come to us, we assumed we would be able to do deep well injection of the wastewater. We believe that both from a standpoint of the chemical components of the water, in the wastewater, as well as environmental regulations that seem to grant an exception, even if the water was considered hazardous, that he would be able to dispose of it in a deep well for an IGCC plant. Both of those assumptions ultimately proved not to be true but there's certainly assumptions everybody I think understood early on and we are -- now we're needing to design a first-of-a-kind wastewater treatment system. Again, the parties to the case, certainly Black & Veatch, is well aware of this design evolution and the need to address those kinds of things.

First, our objective is to share technology and share people. And as you know, they are scaling technology very fast, driven by their economic imperative as they have vast, millions of people moving from rural to urban areas. So we believe that they will scale things CCS like faster there than here, and so we'll know whether or not it's a viable option for us in the future. They're building 24 nuclear plants today. There's a lot of learnings that are going on there with respect to the building a nuclear. They are building a new coal plant every other week. And they lead the world in both solar panels and wind turbines. So there's a lot for us to learn because we think of ourselves, and we are, in the infrastructure business. And they are building out infrastructure faster than anybody in the world. So we see a great opportunity to learn, particularly with our generation as we are on a mission to retire and replace all our generation by 2050. Secondly, we are working with them with respect to co-investing in projects in both North and South America. We see opportunities for them to our partner us in existing assets, as well as new assets that we might either develop or acquire. And that's assets both in the U.S. as well as in South America.

Our bias has been to use the ESP mechanism and that continues to be our position. But the pricing of an ESP in 2012 at the renewal date will be impacted by what market prices are at that point. And so as we think about perhaps a three-year extension, '12, '13 and '14, you should be considering sort of an average market price out in that period as a proxy for the range that we would be targeting in our negotiations.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest and investment in Duke Energy. We had a strong first quarter.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest and investment in Duke Energy. We had a strong first quarter. As you saw in our news release this morning, we announced adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.36 for the first quarter of '10 versus $0.28 for the first quarter of '09. Reported diluted EPS for the first quarter 2010 was $0.34 compared to $0.27 for the first quarter 2009. 
These solid results were primarily due to three factors: One, favorable weather; two, an increase in weather-normalized retail sales volumes; and three, the impact from the base rate increases approved in 2009 in North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio and Kentucky. When fully implemented, these four increases will increase base rates by over $450 million a year.
During the quarter, we experienced colder-than-normal weather across our service territories. Actually, in the Carolinas, February was one of the coldest on record and on January 11, we set a new winter peak for power demand. Relating to the economy, the signs of stabilization we began to see late last year continued through the first quarter. Even though we continue to believe that the economic recovery will be gradual, this continued improvement gives us more confidence that the worst may be behind us. 
With these results, we are on track to achieve the 2010 adjusted diluted EPS outlook range of $1.25 to $1.30, the guidance we reported at our February analyst meeting. Achievement of this year's EPS range assumes normal weather, continued success with our cost control efforts and maintaining our strong operational performance. And remember, our third quarter is historically our most significant quarter of the year. 
In addition to the base rate increases I noted, I'd like to highlight several of our key developments so far in 2010. First, we continued to make progress with our major construction projects. In our Regulated businesses, Cliffside is over 60% complete and Edwardsport is over 55% complete. Last month, we filed a cost update for the Edwardsport plant with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, which I will discuss later in more detail. Additionally, in our Commercial businesses, we are on target to bring over 250 megawatts of wind generation online in 2010. 
Second, we continued our cost control efforts, including implementing our voluntary employee separation and office consolidation plans. We’re on track to achieve our target of maintaining our 2010 O&M costs, net of deferrals and cost recovery riders, flat with 2009. 
Third, we remained focused on maintaining the strong operational performance of our generation fleet and grid. During the first quarter, we continued our strong operational performance such as our nuclear capacity factor, which ended the quarter at over 98%. 
Finally, in Duke Energy International, we extended the joint venture agreement for National Methanol Company, NMC, by 20 years until 2032. This joint venture, which was scheduled to expire in 2011, has historically generated 20% to 30% of International's earnings contribution. We are very pleased with being able to extend this earnings stream.
Let me now turn it over to Lynn for a more detailed summary of the first quarter."

And thank you for joining us today. Let me begin with an overview of our financial performance.Slide 4 contains details on our adjusted segment EBIT results for the quarter compared to the prior year, as well",1691,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. Let me begin with an overview of our financial performance.
Slide 4 contains details on our adjusted segment EBIT results for the quarter compared to the prior year, as well as the significant earnings drivers quarter-over-quarter. As you can see in the table on this slide, our total adjusted segment EBIT increased over $200 million when compared with the first quarter of last year. 
Both our U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas and International business segments showed improvement. While Commercial Power's results were generally flat with the first quarter of 2009, a credit to the hard work of our Ohio team and a challenging market environment. 
The U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas segment increased adjusted segment EBIT by $187 million. Roughly half of this increase was due to rate increases approved in 2009 and our Regulated businesses. These include: electric rate cases in both of the Carolinas, the electric distribution case in Ohio and the gas distribution case in Kentucky. These rate increases reflect the recovery of investments in our systems to make them more reliable, efficient and clean. 
Favorable weather and increased sales volumes were the other significant drivers for the quarter. In the Carolinas, heating degree days were 22% above normal, while Charlotte experienced its coldest winter in over 40 years. While less extreme, weather was also favorable in the Midwest with heating degree days 11% above normal. I'll talk more about economic trends on our weather-normalized sales volumes in a few minutes.
In our Commercial Powers segment, lower native margins, mostly due to customer switching pressures in Ohio, were offset by increased contributions from our Midwest gas assets. These contributions resulted from higher PJM capacity auction revenue. Additionally, the coal generation fleet experienced lower O&M expenses, principally due to fewer outages. Our Duke Energy Retail Sales customer acquisition efforts continue to mitigate the impact of customer switching. 
Our International segment's adjusted EBIT increased $47 million over first quarter 2009, primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange rates primarily in Brazil and improved contributions from our investment in National Methanol, principally due to higher commodity prices. 
Two additional drivers lowered our overall results. The first was increased interest expense of $26 million due to higher debt balances. And the second was a charge of $17 million related to changes in the tax treatment of Medicare Part D subsidies resulting from the passage of health care legislation in March. 
For more detailed quarter-over-quarter drivers for each of our segments, please refer to the accompanying appendix.
On Slide 5, I will review sales volume trends by customer class in our Regulated business. As we entered 2010, we expected a slow economic recovery and forecasted overall weather-normalized load growth to be flat to 2009. We believe that with double-digit unemployment levels in many of our service territories and vulnerability of industrial load in market segments like textiles, it was prudent to plan the year, assuming that 2010 would look like 2009. 
As you can see on this slide however, our sales volumes for the first quarter of 2010 were higher than these original expectations. Overall, our weather-normalized electric volumes increased approximately 2.5% when compared to the same quarter in 2009. 
Due primarily to the strength in the Primary Metals and Textile sectors, our weather-normalized Industrial sales volumes increased by approximately 9%. The Primary Metals sector experienced an increase of over 30%, while the Textile sector experienced an increase of around 10%. 
Our Primary Metals customers tell us that they are running at production levels higher than anticipated at the start of the year, supported by strength in the automotive industry and a replenishment of inventories. 
Similarly, our Textile customers are experiencing production levels in early '10 significantly above first quarter 2009 production levels. 
While we are pleased with these production increases, we're cautious about sustained growth at these levels over the balance of the year. The appendix of this presentation contains additional details on quarterly Industrial volume trends. As we have done in the past, but we will continue to monitor industrial activities through our ongoing discussions with our customers.
Let's move on to our Commercial and Residential sales activity. Our weather-normalized Commercial sales volumes declined slightly during the first quarter of 2010, when compared to the first quarter of 2009. This decline is consistent with our expectations as trends in this customer class has historically lagged the overall economy. 
Our Residential sales volumes remain a bright spot. During the quarter, Residential weather-normalized sales volumes increased approximately 1.5% over first quarter 2009 levels. This growth is supported by increases in our customer base. During the recession and into 2010, customer growth has been primarily focused in the Carolinas and now, for the first time since the third quarter of 2008, we are seeing moderate customer growth in the Midwest. 
Overall, based on these first quarter 2010 trends, we are cautiously optimistic about the economy but continue to believe that recovery will be slow and moderate. Although we see signs of recovery, high unemployment levels persist in many of our service territories. We will continue to closely monitor trends in each customer class as the year progresses.
Next, I'll update you on competition in Ohio. You may recall that as economic pressures mounted into early 2009, energy demand collapsed and wholesale power prices fell dramatically. This created a gap between Duke Energy's established ESP price in Ohio and the prevailing market price, providing an economic incentive for customers to switch energy suppliers. As a result, we began to see an increase in switching primarily in our Commercial and Industrial customer classes. 
Our competitive retail arm, Duke Energy Retail Sales, quickly became active in the Ohio market and successfully acquired a large portion of Duke Energy Ohio's switched load. By the end of 2009, the growth switching rate was around 40%, while the net switching rate, net of customer load acquired by Duke Energy Retail Sales, was about 15%. The unfavorable financial impact for 2009 was approximately $0.02 per share. 
As we entered 2010, market prices remained low and we expected switching to continue. In establishing our earnings outlook for 2010, we estimated that the year-over-year EPS impact in the range of $0.04 to $0.07 and average gross switching at 45% for the year. 
Based on our experience in the first quarter, we now expect gross switching to average 50% to 55% and to be in the upper end of the $0.04 to $0.07 EPS range. Switching continues to occur primarily in our Commercial and Industrial classes. 
To date, Residential switching has been moderate. However, we are seeing increased competitor activity in the Residential sector in both government aggregation efforts and in the targeting of individual Residential customers. Duke Energy Retail Sales is active in the Residential aggregation market as well. 
We actively seek ways to maintain the highest level of profitability and the dynamic environment in Ohio. Our retail arm, Duke Energy Retail Sales, will continue to pursue customer acquisitions aggressively, whether it is through a defensive strategy of acquiring customers in our service territory, or an offensive strategy in which we are selectively attracting customers outside of our service territory.
Now let me move on to Slide 7, which summarizes our ongoing efforts and results from our cost control measures. During 2009, we mitigated the impact of the down economy with cost control efforts, while maintaining our focus on operational excellence. We are continuing these efforts into 2010. 
Our cost objective for 2010 is to hold O&M, net of deferrals and cost recovery writers flat to 2009. As a result, we must sustain the O&M cuts we achieved in 2009 as well as observe absorb the impact of inflation. 
You can see on the accompanying chart that during the first quarter, our O&M, net of deferrals and cost recovery writers, was slightly below the first quarter of last year. These results reflect the benefit of our ongoing cost control measures as well as lower storm costs compared to 2009 and the timing of other expenditures. To date, we are on track to achieve our cost objective for 2010.
Let me also spend a few minutes highlighting our voluntary separation and office consolidation plans. In the first quarter, we offered a voluntary separation plan to our employees. The window for this offering has closed, with approximately 900 employees selecting or electing to accept the offer. 
Additionally, we began the process to transfer and consolidate corporate functions to our headquarters in Charlotte, which will be completed over the next several years. Excluding approximately $15 million of pension-related costs, we expect to recognize total charges related to these programs of approximately $165 million. 
We are targeting savings that will result in a two to three-year payback period. During the first quarter, we recognized approximately $68 million in charges and expect to recognize most of the remaining costs in 2010. 
We remain committed to cost control measures but be assured that we will spend the dollars necessary to ensure the continued reliability and quality of our service to customers. In the appendix, you will find details of our quarterly performance compared to our annual expectations for a few key operational metrics. 
Our focus on cost control and operational excellence is not merely financially motivated. Given our active regulatory calendar, it is important that we control costs and efficiently operate our plants to lessen the impact of price increases on our customers. In other words, cost control and operational excellence are very important in furthering our mission to provide affordable, reliable and clean energy to our customers. 
In closing, we are on track to be within the $1.25 to $1.30 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range for 2010. We are encouraged by our strong start in 2010, principally driven by favorable weather and volume trend. However, it is premature to adjust our expectations for the entire year based on one quarter's performance. We have three quarters ahead of us, including the third quarter, which is historically our most significant one. 
With that, of I will turn it back over to Jim for closing remarks."
267850,100602918,60833,"Duke Energy Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 04, 2010",2010-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Duke Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Lynn. Over the next three years, we expect to invest between $14 billion to $15 billion to modernize our generation, transmission and distribution system, maintain our facilities and sustain the earnings and cash flow from our Commercial busine",1295,"Thank you, Lynn. Over the next three years, we expect to invest between $14 billion to $15 billion to modernize our generation, transmission and distribution system, maintain our facilities and sustain the earnings and cash flow from our Commercial businesses. Approximately 75% of these investments will be made in our Regulated businesses, giving us the ability to replace some of our older, less efficient plants with new, efficient and lower emitting units. 
This becomes even more important given our belief that every power plant we operate today will need to be replaced by 2050 as a result of normal aging and technological obsolescence, with the exception of our hydro units and of course, assuming no further nuclear relicensing. 
In keeping the appropriate long-term focus, I am reminded that the decisions we make today will still be impacting the company decades from now, as the power plants we are building will operate for 30, 40, or even 50 years or more. Let me now provide a summary of our major regulated construction projects. 
As I noted earlier, our Cliffside project is over 60% complete and on budget. Through March 31, we have spent approximately $1.3 billion of the approximately $2.4 billion project total, including financing cost. 
As you all may remember, we made a commitment to North Carolina air regulators that we will retire approximately 1,000 megawatts of older, less efficient, coal-fired generation through 2018 when Cliffside Unit 6 becomes operational in 2012. 
Also, the Cliffside modernization project involves the installation of a scrubber on our existing Unit 5, which will share a common stack with Unit 6. The Unit 5 scrubber is on time and on budget, and it is scheduled to become operational this fall. 
The Edwardsport project Indiana is over 55% complete, with final engineering over 90% complete. Through March 31, we have spent approximately $1.6 billion on the project, including financing cost. 
This project is expected to become operational in 2012 and will give us the ability to replace the existing 160 megawatts of 1940s era generation located at the site. It will also help offset the required shutdown last fall of three units totaling 265 megawatts at our Wabash River station in Indiana. This shutdown stemmed from last spring's ruling in our new source review case. 
As I noted earlier, in April, we informed the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission that the cost estimate of the Edwardsport project would increase to around $2.88 billion, about $530 million higher than the previous estimate. The main drivers for the increase are design evolution and scope growth arising from the uniqueness, complexity and scale of this plant. This is the first time a plant using this advanced cleaner coal technology has been built anywhere in the world at this scale. 
Unlike a plant design that has been constructed many times, this project is essentially custom design, so existing guidance is limited on the project scope and the amounts of materials needed. 
One of the larger items contributing to the cost increase is the need for a gray water treatment system at the plant, a cost of approximately $125 million. We are presenting to the commission a complete and detailed explanation of what is driving the higher estimated cost. 
Meanwhile, we are working hard with our vendors and contractors and all facets of the project to find ways to mitigate these increased costs. We filed our testimony supporting the increased cost estimate in mid-April, and the IURC will conduct a hearing on this issue in August. 
Finally, let me comment on our Buck and Dan River combined cycle gas-fired projects in North Carolina. We have broken ground on Buck and are making progress on our pre-construction efforts at Dan River. Both are on track and expected to come online in 2011 and 2012 respectively. These two projects are estimated to cost a total of approximately $1.4 billion including financing cost. 
Before I close, let me take a moment to give you our point of view on the status of the energy and climate change legislation in Washington. The conventional wisdom today in Washington is that there is a low probability that a bill will be passed this year. Congress faces several options at this juncture. 
First, they can start over in the next session of Congress and leave it to the EPA to act in 2011 if Congress fails to act by year end. Secondly, they can attempt to pass Senators Kerry and Lieberman's bill and as you all know, Senator Graham stepped away for a variety of reasons two weeks ago from the support of this bill. But this bill is currently being modeled by the EPA, and they should complete their work in five to six weeks. 
And as can be expected, numerous other senators are drafting a variety of related bills. Some are discussing the pursuit of a utility-only energy and carbon bill. It would be coupled with provisions that would reduce further the emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury. Certainly, this would give the utility industry a complete and clear roadmap as to its future admissions requirements. I suspect that this is a low-probability outcome in the coming months. 
Every week seems different. With the oil spill last week, the probabilities and possibilities seem to change yet again. So my report to you is more to come as we move forward, addressing this issue in Washington.
Turning to Slide 9, this is a slide we will come back to throughout the year to demonstrate the progress we continue to make to fulfill the short and long-term commitments we made to you at our February Analyst Meeting. As you can see, with the first quarter behind us, we are on track for our short-term commitments; such as achieving the 2010 adjusted diluted EPS range of $1.25 to $1.30 and continuing our plans to finance the business. 
Although it is important to focus on our short-term objectives, our business makes it imperative that we stay focused on the longer-term. This is why we have been active in Washington, as well as at the state and local levels, fighting for fair and reasonable legislative outcomes for both our customers and investors. 
Our long-term commitments include the following: First, growing earnings and dividends. Our plans support achieving a 4% to 6% compounded annual growth rate and adjusted diluted EPS off a base of 2009 over the next few years. 
Additionally, we are targeting continued growth in the dividend, but at a rate slower than the growth in our adjusted diluted EPS. 2010 represents the 84th consecutive year that Duke Energy has paid a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock. 
Second, allocating capital efficiently and earning competitive returns. In our Regulated businesses, the mitigation of regulatory lag closing the gap between our allowed and earned returns is job one. In our Commercial business, job one is achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns. 
And finally, maintaining a strong balance sheet. This involves maintaining our liquidity and credit ratings, which supports our ability to execute on our business plans. Overall, our long-term focus on modernizing our fleet and grid makes Duke a solid value proposition for investors. 
Before we take your questions, I would also like to refer you to our 2009 and 2010 sustainability report, which we recently published. This report has extensive metrics on our operational and environmental performance over the last year. 
It also describes how we make decisions, balancing the need for affordable, reliable and increasingly clean energy. 2009 was the fourth consecutive year that Duke Energy was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North American Companies in the electric utility sector. You can access our sustainability report on our website at www.duke-energy.com.

And so as we think about perhaps a three-year extension, '12, '13 and '14, you should be considering sort of an average market price out in that period as a proxy for the range that we would be targeting in our negotiations."

We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy. 
I'll start with the bottom line for the quarter. It was an excellent quarter. The economy is showing signs of improvement, the weather was hot and our team's performance was excellent. As you saw in our news release this morning, we announced adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.34 for the second quarter of 2010 versus $0.26 for the second quarter of 2009. This is a quarter-over-quarter increase of around 31%. On a weather-normalized basis, the quarter-over-quarter increase was approximately 20%. 
Our reported results for second quarter 2010 also included non-cash charges of $500 million, reflecting the write off of the remaining goodwill related our Midwest non-regulated generation fleet and the $160 million related to the impairment of certain non-regulated unscrubbed units in the Midwest. Lynn will discuss these charges in more detail during her presentation, and I will update you in a few moments on pending environmental regulations. 
These charges resulted in reported diluted net loss per share for second quarter 2010 of $0.17 compared to reported diluted earnings per share of $0.21 for the second quarter '09. Let me highlight three of the more significant drivers of our results this quarter: First, higher revenues from our base rate increases approved in '09 in North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio and Kentucky; second, favorable weather. We experienced above normal temperatures in all five of our regulated jurisdictions during the second quarter, and in the Carolinas, we experienced the hottest June on record; third, signs of economic recovery. During the quarter, we realized increased weather-normalized sales volumes, mostly due to improved industrial sales. We will continue to remain cautiously optimistic about the future. Lynn will provide more color around sales volumes and our outlook for the latter half of 2010 in her presentation. 
I want to highlight that our employees delivered excellent performance to the unusually hot weather. Our year-to-date nuclear capacity was over 95%. Similarly, our fossil fleet had a commercial availability of approximately 87% on a year-to-date basis. 
In the latest J.D. Power and Associates annual customer satisfaction survey, Duke Energy Carolina has ranked number one in the South. This demonstrates our commitment to providing outstanding customer service. 
Our strong operational performance in the first half of the year has us on target to achieve our operational metrics for 2010. Based upon our results today, supported by favorable weather and stronger-than-expected weather-normalized retail volumes, we are increasing our 2010 adjusted diluted EPS outlook range from $1.25 to $1.30 per share to $1.30 to $1.35 per share. 
Before I turn the call over to Lynn, I want to say that I am very pleased with where we are through June 2010, and I'm very proud of the performance of our employees who have remained focused on our objective to safely provide low-cost electric and gas services to our customers, while earning reasonable returns for our investors. 
Let me now ask Lynn to provide more details around our second quarter results."
267850,108968154,71651,"Duke Energy Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-03-2010",2010-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Duke Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and thank you for joining us. Let me begin with an overview of our financial performance. As you can see in the table on Slide 4, our total adjusted segment EBIT increased approximately $175 million when compared with the second quarter of",2396,"Thank you, Jim, and thank you for joining us. Let me begin with an overview of our financial performance. As you can see in the table on Slide 4, our total adjusted segment EBIT increased approximately $175 million when compared with the second quarter of last year. 
The results for all of our business segments taken as a whole were higher than our expectations, principally driven by favorable weather and strong industrial sales. The competitive environment in Ohio continues to be challenging, but we have been successful in executing in our plans to defend margins in that business. 
Let me quickly review the significant drivers of results of each of our business segments. Adjusted segment EBIT for U.S. Franchised Electric & Gas, our largest segment, increased $171 million over the prior-year quarter. Approximately $70 million of this increase was due to the impact of rate increases in the Carolinas approved in 2009. These rate increases reflect the recovery of prudently-incurred utility investments and will continue to positively impact results in future periods. 
Another $56 million was the result of unusually warm weather. Weather impacts way driven by above-normal temperatures in all five of our service territories throughout the quarter. In the Carolinas and Midwest, cooling degree days were approximately 50% above normal. 
Other positive drivers to the segment's results were higher allowance for funds used during construction from Duke Energy's ongoing construction program and increased weather-adjusted volumes, most notably in the industrial sector. Partially offsetting the increases to the segment's adjusted EBIT were higher operation and maintenance costs, primarily due to the timing of planned outages. And in our Commercial Power segment, customer switching and competition continue to highlight the market in Ohio, resulting in lower adjusted EBIT of approximately $25 million versus the second quarter of 2009. 
Despite lower results, to date, Duke Energy Retail Sales, our competitive retail arm, has acquired approximately 60% of Duke Energy Ohio's switch customers. Other drivers affected Commercial Powers' results as well. These included higher O&M costs resulting from an arbitration decision, lower gains from coal sales and a 2009 deferral of operation and maintenance costs to the Beckjord plant under our Electric Security Plan. Offsetting these drivers were favorable PJM capacity payments earned by our Midwest gas assets. In fact, we continue to be pleased with the performance of our Midwest gas-fired fleet, which for 2010 is on track to exceed the level of adjusted segment EBIT which was experienced in 2009, driven not only by increased capacity payments but also by higher energy margins. 
Now let me take a few moments to discuss the non-cash impairment charges related to goodwill and certain unscrubbed units in Ohio. You will recall that similar charges were recorded in the third quarter of 2009 as a result of depressed current and forward power prices, and reduced customer load due to the recession. Customer switching has also continued to increase from approximately 30% at September 30, 2009, to approximately 56% at June 30, 2010. As well, power prices are projected to remain low through the next several years impacting our evaluation of possible outcomes from our upcoming ESP extension in Ohio. 
In addition, we have more clarity around proposed environmental regulations from the EPA, and expect further environmental regulations in 2011 on hazardous air pollutants such as mercury, as well as more stringent air quality standards. Although not yet issued a final form, these regulations are expected to result in significant capital and O&M expenditures for the affected coal-fired generation plants or the shutdown of certain units. 
In light of these uncertainties, we wrote off the remaining amount of goodwill associated with the non-regulated Ohio generation, and recorded impairment charges related to certain unscrubbed coal units in Ohio. These impairments are non-cash charges and do not impact our liquidity or compliance with any of our debt or credit facilities. These charges totaled $660 million. 
Returning now to a review of our segment drivers, adjusted segment EBIT for international increased $32 million over second quarter 2009. The primary drivers of this increase include favorable foreign exchange rates, favorable hydrology in Brazil and an increased contribution from National Methanol, principally due to higher commodity prices. 
Finally, two additional drivers impacted our overall results. The first was an increase in interest expense of approximately $26 million due to higher debt balances resulting from planned financing of our capital expansion program. The second positive driver was a decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate from 36% in the second quarter of 2009 to 32% this year. We are still targeting a 31% effective tax rate for 2010, excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment charge, which is non-deductible for tax purposes. For detailed quarter-over-quarter drivers for each of our segments, please refer to the appendix. 
As Jim and I previously mentioned, weather was a significant contributor to our results for the second quarter. But more importantly, the quarter also saw positive trends in weather-normalized sales, most notably to our industrial class of customers. 
For the second quarter in a row, we experienced an increase in overall sales volumes compared to the same periods in 2009. Our weather-normalized electric volumes rose approximately 3.6% this quarter, primarily driven by increased industrial sales activity. On a weather-normalized basis, commercial volumes were essentially flat, which we attribute to the fact that this class tends to lag the overall economy. In the residential sector, traditionally a very stable class, normalized volumes were also flat compared to the second quarter of 2009. On a year-to-date basis, Residential volumes are up approximately 1% over 2009. We are still seeing modest residential customer growth in both the Carolinas and the Midwest, and we remain optimistic that residential customer sales will see growth in the future. 
Although we are pleased by these volume trends, we must carefully consider how to factor them into our outlook. As we entered 2010, you will recall that we expected a slow economic recovery and forecasted overall weather-normalized load growth to be flat to 2009. We had a good reason to feel that way. Our largest industrial customers were cautious in their outlooks, and the unemployment rate in each of our state jurisdictions had climbed to levels that did not support historical levels of sales growth. 
Despite improved sales for each of the last two quarters, certain macroeconomic indicators caused us to remain cautious in our outlook. Double-digit unemployment levels above the national average persists in all of our service territories. Single-family building permits, though somewhat stabilized, are also at historical lows in both the Carolinas and the Midwest. Based on recent discussions with our large industrial customers, the second half of 2010 is expected to be consistent with the first half. However, uncertainty remains the dominant theme for 2011. 
Balancing all of these factors and weighing them against our recent experience, our outlook for 2010 now includes an approximate 2% increase, an average weather-adjusted retail sales volumes for the full year versus 2009, with the increase largely coming from our industrial customer class.  Through the second quarter, volumes have increased approximately 3% over 2009. However, we do not expect that rate of increase to continue for the remainder of the year since the rebound in industrial activity began in the second half of 2009. 
Let's move on to competition in Ohio. As of June 30, the gross switching rate of our Ohio customer load was around 56%, while the net switching rate, net of load acquired by Duke Energy Retail Sales, was about 23%. These are in-line with our expectations. Our outlook for the full year includes a gross switching level that is at the top end of the average 50% to 55% range we communicated to you after the first quarter. We expect the financial impact to be at the upper end of the negative $0.04 to $0.07 EPS range we provided at our February analyst meeting. 
As expected, the focus of customer switching in Ohio has moved from our industrial customers, and to a lesser extent our commercial customers, to the residential class. This shift toward residential switching is being met by our retail strategy at Duke Energy Retail Sales. As government aggregation efforts and individual mass marketing efforts have increased, Duke Energy Retail Sales has aggressively pursued current Duke Energy Ohio ESP customers that are at significant risks of switching to other providers. One measure of our success is the fact that Duke Energy Retail Sales acquired around 80% to 90% of individual residential customers to switch from Duke Energy Ohio during the second quarter. In part, due to the success of our retail strategy, Commercial Power remains on track to achieve its 2010 estimated adjusted segment EBIT of $315 million. 
Our Ohio strategy for 2010 is mostly one of blocking and tackling, with an emphasis on Duke Energy Retail Sales aggressively acquiring customers who leave Duke Energy Ohio's ESP rate structure and selectively acquiring Ohio-based load from outsider service territory. At the same time, we are considering how to best position our Ohio business for the near and longer term. As you know, the current ESP expires at the end of 2011, and we are currently evaluating various strategic plans to carry us into 2012 and beyond. As a first step, we expect to make an initial filing with the Ohio Commission by the end of this year. This will give us sufficient time to negotiate a new plan that will be constructive for both Duke Energy Ohio and its customers. 
The illustration on this slide gives you a perspective on the various options that are available to us. But we currently believe that another ESP is the most likely outcome for post-2011. Obviously, each of these options has positive and negative implications, which we are carefully evaluating. 
As we approach renegotiation of the ESP, our proposals will strive to achieve a balance between ensuring fair returns on our assets, including compensation for dedication of our assets to serve the native-load customer, and maintaining stability rates to our customers. Our proposals will also address inherent risks in our business such as future environmental compliance costs and customer switching. As we progress through this year and into 2011, we will continue to keep you apprised of developments in this area. 
As long as customer choice exists in Ohio, Duke Energy Retail Sales will continue to target customer classes susceptible to switching from both within and outside of our service territory. Duke Energy Retail Sales will continue to participate in competitive options and will evaluate other strategic options within Ohio, including extensions of customer contracts for customers who remain interested in market rates. The Duke Energy Retail Sales may expand its supply relationships with Ohio-based customers to include their out-of-state operations. We do not currently expect to broadly participate in markets outside of Ohio. 
To further position the company for success in the Ohio markets, in May, we made a filing in support of a proposed transfer to PJM. The filing requests FERC's approval to change the membership of Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Kentucky from MISO to the PJM regional transmission organization effective January 1, 2012. 
Joining PJM will bring long-term benefits for our Duke Energy Ohio customers because it puts all Ohio utilities in the same wholesale market, where customers will benefit from the same wholesale and retail market rules, which are designed to facilitate operations in a competitive market such as Ohio's. Because our Kentucky system is connected to our Ohio transmission system, the move to PJM also benefits our Kentucky customers. We co-own six non-regulated power plants with other Ohio utilities that are also members of PJM. Having all power plant owners in the same RTO, subject to the same price and market signals, will assist in outage and maintenance planning. 
We expect to incur MISO exit fees as well as obligations for legacy MISO and future PJM transmission expansion costs. However, we are still having discussions with MISO and other parties to determine the magnitude of these costs. We will provide you with further details when reasonable estimates can be made. 
MISO and other parties have intervened in our FERC application. Most of the interveners comments focus on the rationale for our transfer, and fail to recognize that RTO membership is voluntary. Additionally, these filings fail to recognize the competitive challenges facing our Ohio business and the value of joining the other Ohio utilities in PJM. We will be responding to these filings shortly. 
Slide 8 summarizes our year-to-date results from our cost-control measures. Our cost objective for 2010 is to hold O&M down, net of deferrals and cost recovery writers, flat to 2009. As a result, we must sustain the O&M cuts we achieved in 2009 as well as absorb the impact of inflation to our cost in 2010. 
Through the second quarter, we are on track to achieve our cost objective for 2010. However, we expect modest cost pressure from the impact of the unusually warm weather that continued into this quarter. The bottom line is that we are running our plants more than we had expected. 
We will stay focused on cost control throughout the latter half of this year. Additionally, we continue executing on the voluntary separation and office consolidation plans that I highlighted less quarter. We continue to target a two to three-year payback period for these costs. 
Our focus on cost control and operational excellence is important given our active regulatory calendar. We must control costs and efficiently operate our plants to lessen the impact of price increases on our customers. We remain committed to cost-control measures and to the continued reliability and quality of our service. 
In closing, we are encouraged by our strong performance during the first half of 2010. As Jim told you, we are increasing our 2010 adjusted diluted EPS range from $1.25 to $1.30 to $1.30 to $1.35. Achievement of this increased EPS range assumes normal weather during the second half of 2010, continued success with our cost-control efforts and maintaining our strong operational performance. We're off to a good start for the third quarter as all indications are the July weather was favorable to normal. However, it is important to remember that our annual performance will be largely dependent upon our third quarter results, typically, our most significant quarter. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Jim."

Now I will provide an update of our major construction project. We continue progressing on time and on budget with our Cliffside 825-megawatt supercritical pulverized coal project in North Carolina, as well as our Buck and Dan River combi",1282,"Thank you, Lynn. Now I will provide an update of our major construction project. We continue progressing on time and on budget with our Cliffside 825-megawatt supercritical pulverized coal project in North Carolina, as well as our Buck and Dan River combined cycle gas-fired projects in North Carolina. 
Additionally, our two non-regulated wind projects now under construction, Kit Carson and Top of the World, are both on time and under budget and expected to be operational by the end of this year. The 618-megawatt Edwardsport IGCC project in Indiana is approximately 65% complete, with final engineering over 90% complete. The project is expected to be in commercial operation in 2012. 
Through June 30, we have spent approximately $1.8 billion of the $2.35 billion previously authorized by the Indiana Commission. As I outlined in our first quarter call, we are seeking authorization from the commission to raise this cost estimate by $530 million to $2.88 billion. This matter has been put into a separate sub-docket from our semi-annual quip writer updates. 
While we're not happy with having to raise the cost estimate on Edwardsport, we feel believe that have managed this large and complex project as prudently as possible. Many of the challenges we have faced stem from the first-of-a-kind nature of IGCC technology at this scale, and equally important, issues arising from the engineering, design and procurement phase of the project. The good news is that this phase is now essentially complete, and we're building momentum as we work through the construction phase. As with any complex project of this size, there are uncertainties. However, we have captured our best estimate of these uncertainties in the revised cost estimate. 
Recall that in addition to our own assessments, the commission is being advised on the status of the project by Black & Veatch, an independent engineering contractor. This has given the commission independent insight into the nature and extent of our challenges with the project. We continue to believe that the Edwardsport project meets our customers' future electricity needs in a manner that prudently balances reliability, affordability and environmental stewardship. 
Our testimony is supported by the continuing need for the project; the cost effectiveness of the project, even with the increased cost; and the economic importance of the project to the Indiana economy, local jobs and the region's coal industry. To accommodate the commission's busy regulatory calendar, we have agreed to extend the procedural schedule. Interveners filed testimony last week, and our rebuttal testimony is due September 2. The IURC will conduct a hearing on this issue in September. 
As we prepare for the hearing, we continue to review testimony filed last week by several intervener groups. These interveners have recommended various courses of action for the project such as establishing cost caps, halting construction and changing the rate-making mechanisms related to the project. It's important to note that several of these arguments have been previously advocated and rejected by the Indiana Commission. Nevertheless, we will respond vigorously to these arguments in our rebuttal testimony and at the hearing. 
We have been holding informal discussions with many of our stakeholders to give them greater transparency into the project and will continue to look for ways to address their concerns, and all of these conversations may well lead to a settlement with respect to this expansion. Over the coming weeks, we will update you on the status of this important proceeding. 
Pending resolution to this matter, we continue to file for quip recovery on costs incurred to date. In June, we filed for our fifth writer. Additionally, the IURC recently approved our fourth IGCC quip writer filing, allowing us financing cost recovery on capital costs spent through September 2009. 
Before I close, let me spend a minute discussing pending environmental regulations from the EPA. As I previously mentioned, our fleet modernization strategy is driven by existing and proposed environmental regulations, principally focused on coal generation. 
Over the past few months, the EPA has moved forward with proposals to tighten regulations around emissions from coal-fired generation. Our focus on providing new, cleaner generation has us well positioned to comply with these new environmental regulations. We have been working for more than a decade to reduce emissions to the installation of environmental control equipment, and we are recovering through rates or costs to make those retrofits. 
We're currently evaluating recent EPA proposals regarding coal combustion residuals and the Transport Rule [CATR] to replace the CAIR rule. We also expect the EPA to issue a proposed MACT [maximum achievable control technology] rule on hazardous air pollutants, such as mercury, in early 2011. 
While the exact effects of pending environmental regulations are unknown, we're planning for different scenarios and the potential impact on our stations. This may include additional cost due to the installation of air emissions control equipment as well as additional or accelerated unit retirements beyond what we are currently planning. 
Over the past decade, we have spent about $5 billion to comply with federal and state clean air regulations. Our modeling suggests future investment could be in the same range, phased in over a long time period and likely beginning after 2012. We were disappointed with the recent news of the Senate shelving their efforts on comprehensive energy and environmental legislation. We believe an opportunity was missed to develop an energy and environmental policy for our country, including a program that will lead to a cleaner, low-carbon economy. We will continue to work with these issues in the weeks and months ahead asking the next Congress to provide our industry with the regulatory clarity that we seek. 
Regardless of congressional action, the EPA will begin regulating greenhouse gases, such as carbon, on January 2, 2011. We will continue to fight for reasonable outcomes that help minimize the cost impact of these regulations to our customers over time. 
I will close with a summary of our progress in fulfilling the short and long-term commitments we made at our February analyst meeting. First, our commitment to grow earnings and dividends. We have had a strong first half of 2010, and are increasing our 2010 adjusted diluted EPS outlook range from $1.25 to $1.30 to $1.30 to $1.35. We recently increased our quarterly cash dividend by about 2%. This increase is consistent with our objective to continue growing the dividend, but at a slower rate than the long-term growth in our adjusted diluted earnings per share. It marks the 84th consecutive year that Duke Energy has paid a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock. 
As you may remember, our second commitment is to allocate capital efficiently and earn competitive returns. We are modernizing our fleet and have allocated significant capital to these projects. We expect to earn reasonable, regulated returns in the jurisdictions of which we operate, while meeting our customers' future electricity needs in a manner that prudently balances reliability, affordability and environmental stewardship. 
Our renewable projects, both wind and solar, are under budget and on schedule. We have demonstrated an ability to produce attractive risk-adjusted returns and to finance and efficiently operate a utility scale renewable portfolio. 
Finally, our third commitment is to maintain a strong balance sheet. S&P recently reaffirmed our A-minus corporate credit ratings with a stable outlook. We intend to maintain our current credit ratings, which have given us strong access to the capital markets and supported our ability to issue debt at historically low coupons. These low-cost financing help us manage the cost increases to our customers during this period of significant reinvestment. Our long-term focus on modernizing our fleet and grid continues to offer a solid value proposition for our investors.

We had a very strong rebound in the first quarter, really led by Primary Metals in our service territories. Textiles have also performed well. As we look at the second quarter, that strength has broadened beyond Primary Metals into Automotive and Chemicals as well. So we see, as you noticed on the chart, 12.4% increase. As we talk to this Industrial customers, they are confident about the back half of 2010. Where the confidence starts to weakened a bit, though, is when they talk about 2011. So I think we feel good about where we are for '10, but I think are still cautious about the strength of the rebound into '11. The other thing that I would note is that Residential and Commercial had been roughly flat for the quarter. Residential is up about 1% for the year, but that is still a bit of a challenged growth rate, and we'd like to see a bit stronger turnaround in these two segments as well."

The assets that we're really talking about in the Midwest were deregulated in 2000 and then dedicated to our customers for five years. And then we entered into an RSP, which I always referred to as a regulatory light approach. And during that period, our market price was equal to -- I mean, our RSP price was equal to or below that market price at the time. And when we entered into this ESP, we expected to continue to operate in this regulatory light world with that 4,000 megawatts of generation. Now that we have -- the prices had dropped so dramatically in PJM, it's obviously forced us to think differently about these assets. Because at the end of the day, we have roughly 4,000 megawatts of gas-fired generation that was left over from DENA [Duke Energy North America] in the Midwest. And so in a sense, if you see this regulatory light assumption that we operated in morphing to where we have 8,000 megawatts of merchant generation in the Midwest, we have to kind of rethink do we really want to hold that position and the risk and the volatility of earnings? Or can we structure a deal with the Ohio Commission that allows us this regulatory light approach going forward, primarily with these 4,000 megawatts. So yes, we're thinking about a wide range of options today and have been thinking about them as we watch the market price fall in PJM over the last year. So we are -- our thinking with respect to this is under active consideration, and I'd go a step further. As we look out and you see the market curves, the markets turn up significantly in '16 and '17. And so one of the questions that we ask ourselves, even if we were to stomp out of our position, this is the time in history to do it to get the greatest value. So I think our first priority is to work with the regulators to get a deal that works. Our gas assets are performing better each year. And as demand comes back and the economy recovers, they will only increase in value. So a lot depends on what this ESP looks like that we renegotiate as to what alternative that we actually pursue. But I've kind of been very open in sharing with you the range of possibilities that are under consideration, given where we are today."

As you look forward, not only will there be retrofit costs, but there are going to be retirements. And to the extent people retire units in PJM, that is really going to change the supply-demand equation and in all likelihood, drive up prices overtime. And there's an open question with respect to even gas-fired generation and the dependence on shale gas. Will that shale gas continue to keep gas prices below $5? Or will that price start to move up because there have been many questions asked about the amount of shale gas and availability, but many environmental questions raised. And so in our minds, there's great promise to show gas, but there are a lot of unanswered questions as to whether it will be available and at what price. So I think you have to take into account the retirements, how gas prices are going to move, how coal prices are going to move. If you see retirements of coal plants in the region, you can envision a decline in coal prices. So those with harder coal assets might offset the environmental expenditures on retrofit with lower cost of coal. So it's a very complex equation, and we're kind of working our way through each aspect of it."

So there is a compelling logic in my mind, if we have co-owned plants, with all of them are in PJM, that it makes sense for our plants' output to be in PJM also. So from our standpoint, there is a strong logic to us making this transition now. And it's simply -- and then I guess one last point is that MISO has refused to establish a capacity market that's meaningful compared to PJM. And they have a capacity market, and that makes a fundamental difference if we find ourselves increasingly in a merchant position with respect to our coal plants. So we feel like that they have, in my judgment, overreacted and they've forgotten the basics, and we were one of the founding members of MISO. So it's with some reluctance that we withdraw something that we helped create. But the world changes, and it's changed in a way that today, it makes sense for us to make this move."

We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy. 
I'll start with the bottom line for the quarter. It was an excellent quarter. The economy is showing signs of improvement, the weather was hot and our team's performance was excellent. As you saw in our news release this morning, we announced adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.34 for the second quarter of 2010 versus $0.26 for the second quarter of 2009. This is a quarter-over-quarter increase of around 31%. On a weather-normalized basis, the quarter-over-quarter increase was approximately 20%. 
Our reported results for second quarter 2010 also included non-cash charges of $500 million, reflecting the write-off of the remaining goodwill related our Midwest non-regulated generation fleet and the $160 million related to the impairment of certain non-regulated unscrubbed units in the Midwest. Lynn will discuss these charges in more detail during her presentation, and I will update you in a few moments on pending environmental regulations. 
These charges resulted in reported diluted net loss per share for second quarter 2010 of $0.17 compared to reported diluted earnings per share of $0.21 for the second quarter '09. Let me highlight three of the more significant drivers of our results this quarter. First, higher revenues from our base rate increases approved in '09 in North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio and Kentucky. Second, favorable weather. We experienced above normal temperatures in all five of our regulated jurisdictions during the second quarter, and in the Carolinas, we experienced the hottest June on record. Third, signs of economic recovery. During the quarter, we realized increased weather-normalized sales volumes, mostly due to improved industrial sales. We will continue to remain cautiously optimistic about the future. Lynn will provide more color around sales volumes and our outlook for the latter half of 2010 in her presentation. 
I want to highlight that our employees delivered excellent performance to the unusually hot weather. Our year-to-date nuclear capacity was over 95%. Similarly, our fossil fleet had a commercial availability of approximately 87% on a year-to-date basis. 
In the latest J.D. Power and Associates annual customer satisfaction survey, Duke Energy-Carolinas ranked number one in the South. This demonstrates our commitment to providing outstanding customer service. 
Our strong operational performance in the first half of the year has us on target to achieve our operational metrics for 2010. Based upon our results today, supported by favorable weather and stronger-than-expected weather-normalized retail volumes, we are increasing our 2010 adjusted diluted EPS outlook range from $1.25 to $1.30 per share to $1.30 to $1.35 per share. 
Before I turn the call over to Lynn, I want to say that I am very pleased with where we are through June 2010, and I'm very proud of the performance of our employees who have remained focused on our objective to safely provide low-cost electric and gas services to our customers, while earning reasonable returns for our investors. 
Let me now ask Lynn to provide more details around our second quarter results."
267850,108968154,71688,"Duke Energy Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-03-2010",2010-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Duke Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and thank you for joining us. Let me begin with an overview of our financial performance. As you can see in the table on Slide 4, our total adjusted segment EBIT increased approximately $175 million when compared with the second quarter of",2395,"Thank you, Jim, and thank you for joining us. Let me begin with an overview of our financial performance. As you can see in the table on Slide 4, our total adjusted segment EBIT increased approximately $175 million when compared with the second quarter of last year. 
The results for all of our business segments taken as a whole were higher than our expectations, principally driven by favorable weather and strong industrial sales. The competitive environment in Ohio continues to be challenging, but we have been successful in executing in our plans to defend margins in that business. 
Let me quickly review the significant drivers of results of each of our business segments. Adjusted segment EBIT for U.S. Franchised Electric & Gas, our largest segment, increased $171 million over the prior-year quarter. Approximately $70 million of this increase was due to the impact of rate increases in the Carolinas approved in 2009. These rate increases reflect the recovery of prudently-incurred utility investments and will continue to positively impact results in future periods. 
Another $56 million was the result of unusually warm weather. Weather impacts way driven by above-normal temperatures in all five of our service territories throughout the quarter. In the Carolinas and Midwest, cooling degree days were approximately 50% above normal. 
Other positive drivers to the segment's results were higher allowance for funds used during construction from Duke Energy's ongoing construction program and increased weather-adjusted volumes, most notably in the industrial sector. Partially offsetting the increases to the segment's adjusted EBIT were higher operation and maintenance costs, primarily due to the timing of planned outages. And in our Commercial Power segment, customer switching and competition continue to highlight the market in Ohio, resulting in lower adjusted EBIT of approximately $25 million versus the second quarter of 2009. 
Despite lower results, to date, Duke Energy Retail Sales, our competitive retail arm, has acquired approximately 60% of Duke Energy Ohio's switch customers. Other drivers affected Commercial Powers' results as well. These included higher O&M costs resulting from an arbitration decision, lower gains from coal sales and a 2009 deferral of operation and maintenance costs to the Beckjord plant under our Electric Security Plan. Offsetting these drivers were favorable PJM capacity payments earned by our Midwest gas assets. In fact, we continue to be pleased with the performance of our Midwest gas-fired fleet, which for 2010 is on track to exceed the level of adjusted segment EBIT which was experienced in 2009, driven not only by increased capacity payments but also by higher energy margins. 
Now let me take a few moments to discuss the non-cash impairment charges related to goodwill and certain unscrubbed units in Ohio. You will recall that similar charges were recorded in the third quarter of 2009 as a result of depressed current and forward power prices, and reduced customer load due to the recession. Customer switching has also continued to increase from approximately 30% at September 30, 2009, to approximately 56% at June 30, 2010. As well, power prices are projected to remain low through the next several years impacting our evaluation of possible outcomes from our upcoming ESP extension in Ohio. 
In addition, we have more clarity around proposed environmental regulations from the EPA, and expect further environmental regulations in 2011 on hazardous air pollutants such as mercury, as well as more stringent air quality standards. Although not yet issued in final form, these regulations are expected to result in significant capital and O&M expenditures for the affected coal-fired generation plants or the shutdown of certain units. 
In light of these uncertainties, we wrote off the remaining amount of goodwill associated with the non-regulated Ohio generation and recorded impairment charges related to certain unscrubbed coal units in Ohio. These impairments are non-cash charges and do not impact our liquidity or compliance with any of our debt or credit facilities. These charges totaled $660 million. 
Returning now to a review of our segment drivers, adjusted segment EBIT for international increased $32 million over second quarter 2009. The primary drivers of this increase include favorable foreign exchange rates, favorable hydrology in Brazil and an increased contribution from National Methanol, principally due to higher commodity prices. 
Finally, two additional drivers impacted our overall results. The first was an increase in interest expense of approximately $26 million due to higher debt balances resulting from planned financing of our capital expansion program. The second positive driver was a decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate from 36% in the second quarter of 2009 to 32% this year. We are still targeting a 31% effective tax rate for 2010, excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment charge, which is non-deductible for tax purposes. For detailed quarter-over-quarter drivers for each of our segments, please refer to the appendix. 
As Jim and I previously mentioned, weather was a significant contributor to our results for the second quarter. But more importantly, the quarter also saw positive trends in weather-normalized sales, most notably to our industrial class of customers. 
For the second quarter in a row, we experienced an increase in overall sales volumes compared to the same periods in 2009. Our weather-normalized electric volumes rose approximately 3.6% this quarter, primarily driven by increased industrial sales activity. On a weather-normalized basis, commercial volumes were essentially flat, which we attribute to the fact that this class tends to lag the overall economy. In the residential sector, traditionally a very stable class, normalized volumes were also flat compared to the second quarter of 2009. On a year-to-date basis, Residential volumes are up approximately 1% over 2009. We are still seeing modest residential customer growth in both the Carolinas and the Midwest, and we remain optimistic that residential customer sales will see growth in the future. 
Although we are pleased by these volume trends, we must carefully consider how to factor them into our outlook. As we entered 2010, you will recall that we expected a slow economic recovery and forecasted overall weather-normalized load growth to be flat to 2009. We had a good reason to feel that way. Our largest industrial customers were cautious in their outlooks, and the unemployment rate in each of our state jurisdictions had climbed to levels that did not support historical levels of sales growth. 
Despite improved sales for each of the last two quarters, certain macroeconomic indicators cause us to remain cautious in our outlook. Double-digit unemployment levels above the national average persist in all of our service territories. Single-family building permits, though somewhat stabilized, are also at historical lows in both the Carolinas and the Midwest. Based on recent discussions with our large industrial customers, the second half of 2010 is expected to be consistent with the first half. However, uncertainty remains the dominant theme for 2011. 
Balancing all of these factors and weighing them against our recent experience, our outlook for 2010 now includes an approximate 2% increase in average weather-adjusted retail sales volumes for the full year versus 2009, with the increase largely coming from our industrial customer class.  Through the second quarter, volumes have increased approximately 3% over 2009. However, we do not expect that rate of increase to continue for the remainder of the year since the rebound in industrial activity began in the second half of 2009. 
Let's move on to competition in Ohio. As of June 30, the gross switching rate of our Ohio customer load was around 56%, while the net switching rate, net of load acquired by Duke Energy Retail Sales, was about 23%. These are in-line with our expectations. Our outlook for the full year includes a gross switching level that is at the top end of the average 50% to 55% range we communicated to you after the first quarter. We expect the financial impact to be at the upper end of the negative $0.04 to $0.07 EPS range we provided at our February analyst meeting. 
As expected, the focus of customer switching in Ohio has moved from our industrial customers, and to a lesser extent our commercial customers, to the residential class. This shift toward residential switching is being met by our retail strategy at Duke Energy Retail Sales. As government aggregation efforts and individual mass marketing efforts have increased, Duke Energy Retail Sales has aggressively pursued current Duke Energy Ohio ESP customers that are at significant risks of switching to other providers. One measure of our success is the fact that Duke Energy Retail Sales acquired around 80% to 90% of individual residential customers to switch from Duke Energy Ohio during the second quarter. In part, due to the success of our retail strategy, Commercial Power remains on track to achieve its 2010 estimated adjusted segment EBIT of $315 million. 
Our Ohio strategy for 2010 is mostly one of blocking and tackling, with an emphasis on Duke Energy Retail Sales aggressively acquiring customers who leave Duke Energy Ohio's ESP rate structure and selectively acquiring Ohio-based load from outsider service territory. At the same time, we are considering how to best position our Ohio business for the near and longer term. As you know, the current ESP expires at the end of 2011, and we are currently evaluating various strategic plans to carry us into 2012 and beyond. As a first step, we expect to make an initial filing with the Ohio Commission by the end of this year. This will give us sufficient time to negotiate a new plan that will be constructive for both Duke Energy Ohio and its customers. 
The illustration on this slide gives you a perspective on the various options that are available to us. But we currently believe that another ESP is the most likely outcome for post-2011. Obviously, each of these options has positive and negative implications, which we are carefully evaluating. 
As we approach renegotiation of the ESP, our proposals will strive to achieve a balance between ensuring fair returns on our assets, including compensation for dedication of our assets to serve the native-load customer, and maintaining stability rates to our customers. Our proposals will also address inherent risks in our business such as future environmental compliance costs and customer switching. As we progress through this year and into 2011, we will continue to keep you apprised of developments in this area. 
As long as customer choice exists in Ohio, Duke Energy Retail Sales will continue to target customer classes susceptible to switching from both within and outside of our service territory. Duke Energy Retail Sales will continue to participate in competitive options and will evaluate other strategic options within Ohio, including extensions of customer contracts for customers who remain interested in market rates. The Duke Energy Retail Sales may expand its supply relationships with Ohio-based customers to include their out-of-state operations. We do not currently expect to broadly participate in markets outside of Ohio. 
To further position the company for success in the Ohio markets, in May, we made a filing in support of a proposed transfer to PJM. The filing requests FERC's approval to change the membership of Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Kentucky from MISO to the PJM regional transmission organization effective January 1, 2012. 
Joining PJM will bring long-term benefits for our Duke Energy Ohio customers because it puts all Ohio utilities in the same wholesale market, where customers will benefit from the same wholesale and retail market rules, which are designed to facilitate operations in a competitive market such as Ohio's. Because our Kentucky system is connected to our Ohio transmission system, the move to PJM also benefits our Kentucky customers. We co-own six non-regulated power plants with other Ohio utilities that are also members of PJM. Having all power plant owners in the same RTO, subject to the same price and market signals, will assist in outage and maintenance planning. 
We expect to incur MISO exit fees as well as obligations for legacy MISO and future PJM transmission expansion costs. However, we are still having discussions with MISO and other parties to determine the magnitude of these costs. We will provide you with further details when reasonable estimates can be made. 
MISO and other parties have intervened in our FERC application. Most of the interveners comments focus on the rationale for our transfer and fail to recognize that RTO membership is voluntary. Additionally, these filings fail to recognize the competitive challenges facing our Ohio business and the value of joining the other Ohio utilities in PJM. We will be responding to these filings shortly. 
Slide 8 summarizes our year-to-date results from our cost-control measures. Our cost objective for 2010 is to hold O&M, net of deferrals and cost recovery writers, flat to 2009. As a result, we must sustain the O&M cuts we achieved in 2009 as well as absorb the impact of inflation to our cost in 2010. 
Through the second quarter, we are on track to achieve our cost objective for 2010. However, we expect modest cost pressure from the impact of the unusually warm weather that continued into this quarter. The bottom line is that we are running our plants more than we had expected. 
We will stay focused on cost control throughout the latter half of this year. Additionally, we continue executing on the voluntary separation and office consolidation plans that I highlighted last quarter. We continue to target a two to three-year payback period for these costs. 
Our focus on cost control and operational excellence is important given our active regulatory calendar. We must control costs and efficiently operate our plants to lessen the impact of price increases on our customers. We remain committed to cost-control measures and to the continued reliability and quality of our service. 
In closing, we are encouraged by our strong performance during the first half of 2010. As Jim told you, we are increasing our 2010 adjusted diluted EPS range from $1.25 to $1.30, to $1.30 to $1.35. Achievement of this increased EPS range assumes normal weather during the second half of 2010, continued success with our cost-control efforts and maintaining our strong operational performance. We're off to a good start for the third quarter as all indications are the July weather was favorable to normal. However, it is important to remember that our annual performance will be largely dependent upon our third quarter results, typically, our most significant quarter. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Jim."

Now I will provide an update of our major construction project. We continue progressing on time and on budget with our Cliffside 825-megawatt supercritical pulverized coal project in North Carolina, as well as our Buck and Dan River combi",1282,"Thank you, Lynn. Now I will provide an update of our major construction project. We continue progressing on time and on budget with our Cliffside 825-megawatt supercritical pulverized coal project in North Carolina, as well as our Buck and Dan River combined cycle gas-fired projects in North Carolina. 
Additionally, our two non-regulated wind projects now under construction, Kit Carson and Top of the World, are both on time and under budget and expected to be operational by the end of this year. The 618-megawatt Edwardsport IGCC project in Indiana is approximately 65% complete, with final engineering over 90% complete. The project is expected to be in commercial operation in 2012. 
Through June 30, we have spent approximately $1.8 billion of the $2.35 billion previously authorized by the Indiana Commission. As I outlined in our first quarter call, we are seeking authorization from the commission to raise this cost estimate by $530 million to $2.88 billion. This matter has been put into a separate sub-docket from our semi-annual quip writer updates. 
While we're not happy with having to raise the cost estimate on Edwardsport, we feel believe that have managed this large and complex project as prudently as possible. Many of the challenges we have faced stem from the first-of-a-kind nature of IGCC technology at this scale, and equally important, issues arising from the engineering, design and procurement phase of the project. The good news is that this phase is now essentially complete, and we're building momentum as we work through the construction phase. As with any complex project of this size, there are uncertainties. However, we have captured our best estimate of these uncertainties in the revised cost estimate. 
Recall that in addition to our own assessments, the commission is being advised on the status of the project by Black & Veatch, an independent engineering contractor. This has given the commission independent insight into the nature and extent of our challenges with the project. We continue to believe that the Edwardsport project meets our customers' future electricity needs in a manner that prudently balances reliability, affordability and environmental stewardship. 
Our testimony is supported by the continuing need for the project; the cost effectiveness of the project, even with the increased cost; and the economic importance of the project to the Indiana economy, local jobs and the region's coal industry. To accommodate the commission's busy regulatory calendar, we have agreed to extend the procedural schedule. Interveners filed testimony last week, and our rebuttal testimony is due September 2. The IURC will conduct a hearing on this issue in September. 
As we prepare for the hearing, we continue to review testimony filed last week by several intervener groups. These interveners have recommended various courses of action for the project such as establishing cost caps, halting construction and changing the rate-making mechanisms related to the project. It's important to note that several of these arguments have been previously advocated and rejected by the Indiana Commission. Nevertheless, we will respond vigorously to these arguments in our rebuttal testimony and at the hearing. 
We have been holding informal discussions with many of our stakeholders to give them greater transparency into the project and will continue to look for ways to address their concerns, and all of these conversations may well lead to a settlement with respect to this expansion. Over the coming weeks, we will update you on the status of this important proceeding. 
Pending resolution to this matter, we continue to file for quip recovery on costs incurred to date. In June, we filed for our fifth writer. Additionally, the IURC recently approved our fourth IGCC quip writer filing, allowing us financing cost recovery on capital costs spent through September 2009. 
Before I close, let me spend a minute discussing pending environmental regulations from the EPA. As I previously mentioned, our fleet modernization strategy is driven by existing and proposed environmental regulations, principally focused on coal generation. 
Over the past few months, the EPA has moved forward with proposals to tighten regulations around emissions from coal-fired generation. Our focus on providing new, cleaner generation has us well positioned to comply with these new environmental regulations. We have been working for more than a decade to reduce emissions through the installation of environmental control equipment, and we are recovering through rates our costs to make those retrofits. 
We're currently evaluating recent EPA proposals regarding coal combustion residuals and the Transport Rule [CATR] to replace the CAIR rule. We also expect the EPA to issue a proposed MACT [maximum achievable control technology] rule on hazardous air pollutants, such as mercury, in early 2011. 
While the exact effects of pending environmental regulations are unknown, we're planning for different scenarios and the potential impact on our stations. This may include additional cost due to the installation of air emissions control equipment, as well as additional or accelerated unit retirements beyond what we are currently planning. 
Over the past decade, we have spent about $5 billion to comply with federal and state clean air regulations. Our modeling suggests future investment could be in the same range, phased in over a long time period and likely beginning after 2012. We were disappointed with the recent news of the Senate shelving their efforts on comprehensive energy and environmental legislation. We believe an opportunity was missed to develop an energy and environmental policy for our country, including a program that will lead to a cleaner, low-carbon economy. We will continue to work with these issues in the weeks and months ahead, asking the next Congress to provide our industry with the regulatory clarity that we seek. 
Regardless of congressional action, the EPA will begin regulating greenhouse gases, such as carbon, on January 2, 2011. We will continue to fight for reasonable outcomes that help minimize the cost impact of these regulations to our customers over time. 
I will close with a summary of our progress in fulfilling the short and long-term commitments we made at our February analyst meeting. First, our commitment to grow earnings and dividends. We have had a strong first half of 2010 and are increasing our 2010 adjusted diluted EPS outlook range from $1.25 to $1.30, to $1.30 to $1.35. We recently increased our quarterly cash dividend by about 2%. This increase is consistent with our objective to continue growing the dividend, but at a slower rate than the long-term growth in our adjusted diluted earnings per share. It marks the 84th consecutive year that Duke Energy has paid a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock. 
As you may remember, our second commitment is to allocate capital efficiently and earn competitive returns. We are modernizing our fleet and have allocated significant capital to these projects. We expect to earn reasonable, regulated returns in the jurisdictions of which we operate, while meeting our customers' future electricity needs in a manner that prudently balances reliability, affordability and environmental stewardship. 
Our renewable projects, both wind and solar, are under budget and on schedule. We have demonstrated an ability to produce attractive risk-adjusted returns and to finance and efficiently operate a utility scale renewable portfolio. 
Finally, our third commitment is to maintain a strong balance sheet. S&P recently reaffirmed our A- corporate credit ratings with a stable outlook. We intend to maintain our current credit ratings, which have given us strong access to the capital markets and supported our ability to issue debt at historically low coupons. These low-cost financing help us manage the cost increases to our customers during this period of significant reinvestment. Our long-term focus on modernizing our fleet and grid continues to offer a solid value proposition for our investors. 
Now let's open up the lines for your questions."

We had a very strong rebound in the first quarter, really led by Primary Metals in our service territories. Textiles have also performed well. As we look at the second quarter, that strength has broadened beyond Primary Metals into Automotive and Chemicals as well. So we see, as you noticed on the chart, 12.4% increase. As we talk to those Industrial customers, they are confident about the back half of 2010. Where the confidence starts to weaken a bit, though, is when they talk about 2011. So I think we feel good about where we are for '10, but I think are still cautious about the strength of the rebound into '11. The other thing that I would note is that Residential and Commercial had been roughly flat for the quarter. Residential is up about 1% for the year, but that is still a bit of a challenged growth rate, and we'd like to see a bit stronger turnaround in those two segments as well."

So in a sense, we've already started down the road because we think reinvesting in new plants with a low cost of capital and lower rates for consumers and by starting now, it will smooth out the cost increases for consumers over the decade. It's difficult to make further decisions until we get greater clarity with respect to the EPA regulations. We have modeled it many, many different ways, and we're waiting to see the proposed rule before we move forward. But we think most of the major decisions will really lead up to 2015."

And the historic tendency, and it seems to be playing out again, is that these assets absorb an undue amount of sort of management attention and analyst attention and ultimately, have very little potential upside. And I was just -- wanted to get your views about alternatives to continuing to own those assets. Is it something that you've explored? Or do you feel that you're completely bound in to ownership given the PUCO's [Public Utilities Commission of Ohio] restrictions on transfer?"

And then we entered into an RSP,",425,"Hugh, let me take a shot at your question. I think a couple of things to keep in mind. The assets that we're really talking about in the Midwest were deregulated in 2000 and then dedicated to our customers for five years. And then we entered into an RSP, which I always referred to as a regulatory light approach. And during that period, our market price was equal to -- I mean, our RSP price was equal to or below the market price at the time. And when we entered into this ESP, we expected to continue to operate in this regulatory light world with that 4,000 megawatts of generation. Now that we have -- the prices had dropped so dramatically in PJM, it's obviously forced us to think differently about these assets because at the end of the day, we have roughly 4,000 megawatts of gas-fired generation that was left over from DENA [Duke Energy North America] in the Midwest. And so in a sense, if you see this regulatory light assumption that we operated in morphing to where we have 8,000 megawatts of merchant generation in the Midwest, we have to kind of rethink, do we really want to hold that position and the risk and the volatility of earnings? Or can we structure a deal with the Ohio Commission that allows us this regulatory light approach going forward, primarily with these 4,000 megawatts. So yes, we're thinking about a wide range of options today and have been thinking about them as we watch the market price fall in PJM over the last year. So we are -- our thinking with respect to this is under active consideration, and I'd go a step further. As we look out and you see the market curves, the markets turn up significantly in '16 and '17. And so one of the questions that we ask ourselves, even if we were to stomp out of our position, this is the time in history to do it to get the greatest value. So I think our first priority is to work with the regulators to get a deal that works. Our gas assets are performing better each year. And as demand comes back and the economy recovers, they will only increase in value. So a lot depends on what this ESP looks like that we renegotiate as to what alternative that we actually pursue. But I've kind of been very open in sharing with you the range of possibilities that are under consideration given where we are today."

As you look forward, not only will there be retrofit costs, but there are going to be retirements. And to the extent people retire units in PJM, that is really going to change the supply-demand equation and in all likelihood, drive up prices overtime. And there's an open question with respect to even gas-fired generation and the dependence on shale gas. Will that shale gas continue to keep gas prices below $5? Or will that price start to move up because there have been many questions asked about the amount of shale gas and availability, but many environmental questions raised. And so in our minds, there's great promise to show gas, but there are a lot of unanswered questions as to whether it will be available and at what price. So I think you have to take into account the retirements, how gas prices are going to move, how coal prices are going to move. If you see retirements of coal plants in the region, you can envision a decline in coal prices. So those with harder coal assets might offset the environmental expenditures on retrofit with lower cost of coal. So it's a very complex equation, and we're kind of working our way through each aspect of it."

So there is a compelling logic in my mind, if we have co-owned plants, with all of them are in PJM, that it makes sense for our plants' output to be in PJM also. So from our standpoint, there is a strong logic to us making this transition now. And it's simply -- and I guess one last point is, that MISO has refused to establish a capacity market that's meaningful compared to PJM.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy.I'll start with the bottom line for the third quarter results. They were excellent. The weather remained hot, t",630,"Thank you, Stephen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy.
I'll start with the bottom line for the third quarter results. They were excellent. The weather remained hot, the economy continued to show slow but steady signs of improvement, especially in our industrial class and our employees executed extremely well. As you saw in our news release this morning, we announced adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.51 for the third quarter of 2010 versus $0.40 for the third quarter of 2009. This is a quarter-over-quarter increase of around 28%. If you remove the impact of weather from each of these quarters, the quarter-over-quarter increase was approximately 7%.
Let me highlight the more significant drivers of our results for this quarter. First, favorable weather. We experienced well above normal temperatures in all five of our regulated jurisdictions during the third quarter. In the Carolinas, the quarter was the hottest third quarter in nearly 50 years. 
Additionally, we continued to realize higher revenues from our base rate increases approved in 2009 in North Carolina and South Carolina. And our employees and fleet continued to deliver excellent performance throughout the third quarter's unusually hot weather. 
Our year-to-date nuclear capacity factor was 96%, while our fossil fuel fleet had a commercial availability of 89%. This strong operational performance through the end of the third quarter puts us on target to achieve our operational metrics for 2010, some of which are outlined on Slide 18 in the appendix. 
Based upon our results for the third quarter, usually our most significant quarter, we are increasing our 2010 adjusted diluted EPS outlook. We're going to increase that range to $1.40 to $1.45 per share. To put this in some perspective, at the start of the year, our 2010 adjusted diluted EPS outlook range was $1.25 to $1.30. After our second quarter results, we increased the outlook range to $1.30 to $1.35. Assumptions underlying this revised outlook include: normal weather for the rest of the year, continued costs control, continued strong operational performance and a stable economy. 
Before I turn the call over to Lynn to discuss the quarterly results, let me spend a few moments on Indiana. On November 3, I will have an opportunity to reaffirm our need for Edwardsport in a technical conference at the Indiana Commission and to answer any questions that the commission, its staff or any of the parties in the proceeding may have. Edwardsport is the cornerstone of our modernization strategy in Indiana. It helps us reduce the environmental impact of our existing coal generation fleet and prepares us for the inevitable retirement of some of our older coal plants, renew environmental regulations for coal-fired plants are issued in the coming years by the EPA. 
Our IRP, our Integrated Resource Plan, supports our need for Edwardsport, even at the higher costs estimates of $2.88 billion. Based on this analysis, it is the best long-term economic solution to meet the needs of our Indiana customers at this time. Edwardsport is currently around 74% complete and is scheduled to be in service, 2012. 
As you may know, questions have been raised related to the recent hiring of an attorney formerly with the Indiana Commission. In response, we have retain an outside law firm to conduct an independent investigation. We're also cooperating with Indiana Commission and the Inspector General in the reviews of this matter. 
Once the investigations are concluded, we will take whatever actions are appropriate. Because these investigations are ongoing, I cannot comment at this time, on the investigations or any actions we may take. However, this matter is a top priority for me, as well as my management team. 
Now let me turn it over to Lynn."
267850,114269062,82737,"Duke Energy Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Duke Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Let me begin with an overview of our financial performance for the quarter. As you can see in the table on Slide 4, our total adjusted segment EBIT increased approximately $200 million compared with the third quarter of last year. The results",1237,"Thanks, Jim. Let me begin with an overview of our financial performance for the quarter. As you can see in the table on Slide 4, our total adjusted segment EBIT increased approximately $200 million compared with the third quarter of last year. The results for each of our business segments were strong, driven principally by favorable weather in all five of our states and in the Carolinas, increased pricing. The competitive environment in Ohio continues to be challenging, but we are extremely pleased with the efforts of our competitive retail arm, Duke Energy Retail, in defending and capturing margins. 
Let me briefly review the significant drivers of results for each of our business segments. Adjusted segment EBIT for U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas, our largest segment, increased $230 million over the prior-year third quarter. The significant drivers of this segment were the following. First, we experienced unusually warm summer weather, resulting in increased segment earnings of $157 million. The number of cooling degree days in the Carolinas during the third quarter was 27% above normal, while our Midwest service territory experienced total cooling degree days 32% above normal. 
Secondly, the impact of rate increases in the Carolinas approved in 2009 resulted in increased segment earnings of approximately $90 million. These rate increases reflect the recovery of prudently incurred utility investments and will continue to positively impact results in future periods. 
Thirdly, higher allowance for funds used during construction, resulting from Duke Energy's ongoing construction program, increased segment earnings another $20 million. Partially offsetting these increases to the segment's adjusted EBIT was an impairment charge of $44 million, recognized in connection with the September settlement agreement we reached with the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor and certain industrial customers related to the cost of the Edwardsport IGCC project. The impairment charge resulted from the settlement provision, which lowers the return on equity for amounts expended in excess of the currently approved project cost of $2.35 billion. The settlement agreement is subject to approval by the Indiana Commission, which will hold hearings on the matter on November 29 and 30. 
Next, I will discuss our Commercial Power segment. As we expected, Commercial Power's adjusted segment EBIT for the quarter was lower than the prior-year third quarter. However, as a result of strong energy margins from our Midwest gas-fired assets and the success of Duke Energy Retail in defending and capturing margin, Commercial Power has already exceeded its original 2010 adjusted segment EBIT expectations of $315 million. In fact, despite competitive pressures in Ohio throughout 2010, Duke Energy Retail has responded quickly and aggressively by pursuing customers not only inside Duke Energy Ohio's service territory, but also in other service territories within Ohio. Importantly, switching pressures in Ohio have stabilized. 
We are also pleased with the operational performance of Commercial Power's generation fleet and its continued focus on containing costs. Midwest generation is ahead of its safety and commercial availability targets for the year. They have accomplished these results while significantly reducing non-fuel O&M, principally labor costs. 
Turning now to our International operations, adjusted segment EBIT increased $10 million over third quarter of 2009. The primary drivers of this increase include favorable pricing and foreign exchange rates in Brazil, offset by lower dispatch of our thermal generation in Central America due to strong hydrology. 
Finally, two additional drivers impacted Duke Energy's overall results. The first was an increase in interest expense of $12 million, due to higher debt balances resulting from planned financings of our capital expansion program. The second, a positive driver, was a decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate from 33% in the third quarter of 2009 to 31% in the third quarter of 2010. We are now targeting a 32% effective tax rate for 2010, excluding the effect of the second quarter goodwill impairment charge, which is non-deductible for tax purposes. This targeted effective tax rate for 2010 is slightly higher than our original target of 31%, primarily as a result of the increased pretax earnings we expect, resulting from the strong weather experienced to date. For detailed quarter-over-quarter drivers for each of our segments, please refer to the appendix.
Now I'll turn our attention to volume trends. For the third quarter in a row, we experienced an increase in overall weather normalized sales volumes compared to the same period in 2009. Our weather normalized electric volumes rose approximately 1% this quarter, driven primarily by increased industrial sales activity across a broad range of major industrial classes. We continue to closely watch our sales volume trends, are cautiously optimistic about the continued industrial recovery in the near term. As industrial indicators point to continued expansion, the rate of growth has slowed. 
Earlier in the year, the Industrial recovery began in the primary metal sector. As the year has progressed, the recovery has spread to other Industrial sectors, including chemicals, textiles and automotive. However, primary metals growth has recently slowed primarily due to reduced commercial and residential construction activity. Additionally, our commercial and residential weather normalized volumes were essentially flat compared to third quarter of 2009. However, we continue to see modest growth in the total number of residential customers we serve in both the Carolinas and the Midwest. We remain optimistic in residential sales will see growth in the future.
At the same time, we are experiencing improved sales. Certain macroeconomic indicators cause us to remain cautious in our outlook for the future. Economists remain concerned about slow growth, as national and global economic challenges persist. Unemployment rates remain at or above the national average in all of our service territories. Single-family building permits have somewhat stabilized, remain at historical lows in both the Carolinas and the Midwest. 
Balancing all of these factors and weighing them against our recent experience, our outlook for 2010 continues to assume an approximate 2% increase in average weather normalized retail sales volumes for the full year versus 2009, with the increase largely coming from our industrial customer class. Nevertheless, recent discussions with our large industrial customers confirm that uncertainty remains the dominant theme for 2011. The next few months will give us a clear picture regarding next year's volume forecast.
Next, we'll look at cost control. Slide 6 summarizes our year-to-date results for our cost control measures. Our cost objective for 2010 is to hold O&M, net of deferrals and cost recovery riders, flat to 2009. This will require us to sustain the O&M cuts we achieved in 2009, as well as absorb the impacts of inflation and other cost increases in 2010. Through the third quarter, we are on track to achieve our cost objective as our year-to-date costs are relatively flat to the prior year. However, we continue to experience modest cost pressures, resulting from the impact of the unusually warm weather that we've seen in 2010. These cost pressures require us to stay focused on cost control throughout the remainder of this year. 
We will continue to execute on the voluntary separation and office consolidation plans we highlighted earlier this year. We are targeting a two- to three-year payback period for these costs. However, based upon additional cost reduction efforts identified as part of these plans, we have the potential to achieve a two-year payback. Even though we are committed to our cost control program, we also remain firmly focused on providing reliable, high-quality service to customers. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Jim."

I would like to conclude our prepared comments with a brief discussion on our Ohio business, as well as an update of our major construction projects. 
First, let me turn to Ohio, where we have non-regulated generation that is dedicated to serve the native load. Customer pricing is governed by the Electric Security Plan, or ESP, that expires at the end of 2011. The market in Ohio remains challenging due to continued low commodity prices and significant customer switching, even though it has slowed in the last several months. In the near term, the ESP regulatory framework under which we operate today in Ohio, creates more downside risk than potential for upside in today's markets. This framework makes it difficult for us to earn consistent and appropriate risk-adjusted returns for investment. This does not fit well with our value proposition for shareholders nor our overall risk profile. We continue to consider a full range of strategic options for Ohio generation portfolio for our upcoming standard service offer filing sometime in mid-November. This filing will balance the need to provide our investors with an appropriate risk-adjusted return and our customers with affordable and reliable electricity. 
We've outlined three potential options for our next standard service offer filing on this slide. We don't have specific details to share with you today. But we intend to work hard to reach constructive outcomes for both customers and shareholders. After we file our plan in the coming weeks, we will host a webcast to fully discuss the filing. 
On another Ohio matter, we were pleased last week when FERC conditionally approved the transfer of our Ohio and Kentucky transmission from MISO to PJM effective January 1, 2012. Additionally, FERC approved the participation of our mostly coal-based generation in Ohio and at Kentucky transmission from MISO to in PJM effective Jan [January] 1, '12. Additionally, FERC approved the participation of our mostly coal-based generation Ohio and Kentucky in PJM's May 2011 base residual option for the 2014 and '15 delivery period. There are remaining milestones we must meet related to this transfer, but FERC's approval is a strong first step. We are also seeking approval of the transfer from the Kentucky Commission. 
Next, I'll provide an update on our major construction projects, which are the centerpiece of our fleet modernization strategy. As I said earlier, in Indiana, our 618-megawatt Edwardsport project is 74% complete with approximately $2 billion spent to date. The project remains scheduled to go online in 2012. As Lynn mentioned, we entered into a settlement agreement with intervening parties regarding the increased costs of the Edwardsport project from $2.35 billion to $2.88 billion. This settlement is subject to commission approval. A public hearing is scheduled for November 29 and 30. The settlement balances customer rate impacts with the need to modernize our fleet and reduce our environmental footprint in Indiana. Further details of the settlement were discussed during our September 20 webcast, which can be found on our website and are included in the appendix to today's presentation. 
The commission has delayed hearings on our IGCC 5 semi-annual CWIP Rider related to Edwardsport from October 26 to December 2 after the hearings in late November on our recent settlement agreement. Meanwhile, we continue progressing on time and on budget with our three major North Carolina construction projects, which are outlined on this slide. Our 825-megawatt Cliffside supercritical pulverized coal plant scheduled to go online in 2012 is now 72% complete, with more than $1.5 billion spent to date. Additionally, the scrubber for Cliffside Unit 5 has been successfully tied in at the plant site. 
Our 620-megawatt Buck combined-cycle gas-fired plant scheduled to go online in 2011 is now 15% complete with $350 million spent to date. And last week, we broke ground on our second new combined-cycle gas-fired plant in North Carolina, our 620-megawatt Dan River facility scheduled to go online in 2012 with about $225 million spent to date. 
We've also made significant progress with our non-regulated renewable projects, which are underpinned with long-term power purchase agreements. Our 200-megawatt Top of the World wind farm in Wyoming went online earlier this month under budget and is selling all of its output to Pacific Corp. under a 20-year power purchase agreement. 
Our 51-megawatt Kit Carson wind farm in Colorado is expected to go online by the end of this year. The project will sell all of its output to Tri-State Generation under a 20-year power purchase agreement. These two projects, once online, will bring our total operating wind generation to nearly 1,000 megawatts by year end. In addition, our 14-megawatt Blue Wing commercial solar project in Texas is expected to go online as early as next week. The project has a 30-year power purchase agreement with CPS Energy.
Let me close with an update of our NSR cases. Earlier this month, we received a favorable ruling from a federal appeals court, which reversed a jury's finding that three of our coal units at Wabash River Station in Indiana had violated the Federal Clean Air Act. As a result of the initial jury decision, we had taken these three units out of service in 2009. This favorable ruling effectively ends over 10 years of litigation around EPA enforcement actions with respect to our Midwest generation fleet. We are pleased to have it behind us, although we are taking necessary steps to bring the three Wabash units back into service. We continue to evaluate whether more stringent upcoming environmental regulations will require their early retirement within the next several years. 
In conclusion, I am extremely pleased with our results this quarter and year-to-date. We remain focused on achieving an outstanding year. Our long-term strategy to modernize our fleet and grid continues to be an important part of what we're doing both for our customers, as well as investors. On the earnings front, we had a strong third quarter and are increasing our 2010 adjusted diluted EPS outlook range to $1.40 to $1.45 per share. On the dividend front, we increased our quarterly cash dividend, about 2% this year, the 84th consecutive year we paid a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock. 
Next week, several members of our executive team will attend the EEI [Edison Electric Institute] Financial Conference. I'll be in Indiana for the commission hearing on Edwardsport and thus unable to attend a conference. Additionally, I want you to know that the management team and I plan to conduct our 2011 Analyst and Investor Meeting in New York in February 2011. At that time, we'll provide an overview of our fourth quarter and 2010 earnings, as well as a strategic summary of each of our businesses. Further, we will discuss our 2011 adjusted earnings per share guidance range and financial outlook for 2011 and beyond. Details on the date and time will be sent to you shortly.

I think the way to put the stage is to say for the past nine years, the customers have benefited from a five-year rate freeze and a negotiated rate that was below the market price for four years. It worked for both customers and investors during that period. Today, the situation is very different. Prices have dropped dramatically in PJM, and we've experienced significant switching to the benefit of consumers, but not investors. At the heart of the problem, in my judgment, is that customers have a free option. Said another way, they have the ability to get the lower of market price or a negotiated rate. And the commission has been unwilling to permit a non-bypassable charge for standing ready to serve our customers when they return. As you know so well in truly competitive markets, there are no free options. Consequently, the way I view the situation in Ohio, we are neither regulated or allowed to completely to market today. So we are taking a very close look at the MRO, because that is a way to transition to market. It seems to be emerging in our analysis as the appropriate way forward, with respect to getting the appropriate returns for investors and continuing to provide to our customers reliable and affordable service. The way I would say it is, is that we're continuing to think our way through this. We're continuing to examine the pluses and minuses of the ESP approach that's been so beneficial to customers and investors in the past. And we're continuing to drill down on all of the implications of the MRO. As you know, FirstEnergy's MRO request was rejected several years ago, and we've looked closely at the basis for its rejection. And if we go that route, we will make sure that we address the issues that were raised by the commission there. So on balance, we believe that we have to make a very difficult decision between now and mid-November. But if you had to say, well, where are you leaning? I would say we're leaning toward the MRO at this point, but that's not a final decision. We have more work to do."

First of all, under our ESP which will still be in effect in '11, we have dedicated that capacity to our customers under the terms of the ESP. What we do beyond '12, it's my understanding, even with the MRO, there will be a commitment of this capacity to the retail load. So the issue of hedging out the capacity is not an issue that's in front of us in the short or medium term. I think that's a longer-term consideration. The other point I want to make to kind of bring clarity to this. Our Duke Energy Retail grew, which has picked up roughly 60% of the load to switch. What they have done is gone into the market and hedged the load as they picked it up to lock in the margins. So I draw those two distinctions, both with respect to next year and beyond, with respect to our generation and with respect to our door approach and whether or not we do ESP or MRO or some variation with respect to our existing generation.

But the first point is that if you did an ESP by definition, the price would probably less than it is today going forward and that's after 2012, because the negotiated price has to reflect the market price. And obviously, we're all well aware that there's been a dramatic drop in the price of PJM over the last year. The MRO feature, which is in my judgment could be a positive is the way you're permitted to blend your existing generation with purchases in the market to come up with a negotiated price for your customers. So the amount of the blend from your existing generation or from the market is something that would be negotiated as you go down the MRO path. But again, we need to be realistic about this as all the merchant guys in the Midwest who are in PJM appreciate the margins have been squeezed dramatically for all the merchant players. I don't see that letting up in the next several years. However, if you look out five years or more, you can see the prices rising again. And the wild card in this is how many coal plants will actually be shut down and there have been estimates of between 20% and 30% of all the coal plants in the U.S. will be shut down in the next decade. I suspect the lion's share of these assets will be in the Midwest. Is there anything, Lynn, you'd like to add to that?"

I'll start with the bottom line for the third quarter results. They were excellent. The weather remained hot, the economy continued to show slow but steady signs of improvement, especially in our industrial class and our employees executed extremely well. As you saw in our news release this morning, we announced adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.51 for the third quarter of 2010 versus $0.40 for the third quarter of 2009. This is a quarter-over-quarter increase of around 28%. If you remove the impact of weather from each of these quarters, the quarter-over-quarter increase was approximately 7%.
Let me highlight the more significant drivers of our results for this quarter. First, favorable weather. We experienced well above normal temperatures in all five of our regulated jurisdictions during the third quarter. In the Carolinas, the quarter was the hottest third quarter in nearly 50 years. 
Additionally, we continued to realize higher revenues from our base rate increases approved in 2009 in North Carolina and South Carolina. And our employees and fleet continued to deliver excellent performance throughout the third quarter's unusually hot weather. 
Our year-to-date nuclear capacity factor was 96%, while our fossil fuel fleet had a commercial availability of 89%. This strong operational performance through the end of the third quarter puts us on target to achieve our operational metrics for 2010, some of which are outlined on Slide 18 in the appendix. 
Based upon our results for the third quarter, usually our most significant quarter, we are increasing our 2010 adjusted diluted EPS outlook. We're going to increase that range to $1.40 to $1.45 per share. To put this in some perspective, at the start of the year, our 2010 adjusted diluted EPS outlook range was $1.25 to $1.30. After our second quarter results, we increased the outlook range to $1.30 to $1.35. Assumptions underlying this revised outlook include: normal weather for the rest of the year, continued costs control, continued strong operational performance and a stable economy. 
Before I turn the call over to Lynn to discuss the quarterly results, let me spend a few moments on Indiana. On November 3, I will have an opportunity to reaffirm our need for Edwardsport in a technical conference at the Indiana Commission and to answer any questions that the commission, its staff or any of the parties in the proceeding may have. Edwardsport is the cornerstone of our modernization strategy in Indiana. It helps us reduce the environmental impact of our existing coal generation fleet and prepares us for the inevitable retirement of some of our older coal plants, renew environmental regulations for coal-fired plants are issued in the coming years by the EPA. 
Our IRP, our Integrated Resource Plan, supports our need for Edwardsport, even at the higher costs estimates of $2.88 billion. Based on this analysis, it is the best long-term economic solution to meet the needs of our Indiana customers at this time. Edwardsport is currently around 74% complete and is scheduled to be in service, 2012. 
As you may know, questions have been raised related to the recent hiring of an attorney formerly with the Indiana Commission. In response, we have retain an outside law firm to conduct an independent investigation. We're also cooperating with Indiana Commission and the Inspector General in the reviews of this matter. 
Once the investigations are concluded, we will take whatever actions are appropriate. Because these investigations are ongoing, I cannot comment at this time, on the investigations or any actions we may take. However, this matter is a top priority for me, as well as my management team. 
Now let me turn it over to Lynn.

Let me begin with an overview of our financial performance for the quarter. As you can see in the table on Slide 4, our total adjusted segment EBIT increased approximately $200 million compared with the third quarter of last year. The results",1237,"Thanks, Jim. Let me begin with an overview of our financial performance for the quarter. As you can see in the table on Slide 4, our total adjusted segment EBIT increased approximately $200 million compared with the third quarter of last year. The results for each of our business segments were strong, driven principally by favorable weather in all five of our states and in the Carolinas, increased pricing. The competitive environment in Ohio continues to be challenging, but we are extremely pleased with the efforts of our competitive retail arm, Duke Energy Retail, in defending and capturing margins. 
Let me briefly review the significant drivers of results for each of our business segments. Adjusted segment EBIT for U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas, our largest segment, increased $230 million over the prior-year third quarter. The significant drivers of this segment were the following. First, we experienced unusually warm summer weather, resulting in increased segment earnings of $157 million. The number of cooling degree days in the Carolinas during the third quarter was 27% above normal, while our Midwest service territory experienced total cooling degree days 32% above normal. 
Secondly, the impact of rate increases in the Carolinas approved in 2009 resulted in increased segment earnings of approximately $90 million. These rate increases reflect the recovery of prudently incurred utility investments and will continue to positively impact results in future periods. 
Thirdly, higher allowance for funds used during construction, resulting from Duke Energy's ongoing construction program, increased segment earnings another $20 million. Partially offsetting these increases to the segment's adjusted EBIT was an impairment charge of $44 million, recognized in connection with the September settlement agreement we reached with the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor and certain industrial customers related to the cost of the Edwardsport IGCC project. The impairment charge resulted from the settlement provision, which lowers the return on equity for amounts expended in excess of the currently approved project cost of $2.35 billion. The settlement agreement is subject to approval by the Indiana Commission, which will hold hearings on the matter on November 29 and 30. 
Next, I will discuss our Commercial Power segment. As we expected, Commercial Power's adjusted segment EBIT for the quarter was lower than the prior-year third quarter. However, as a result of strong energy margins from our Midwest gas-fired assets and the success of Duke Energy Retail in defending and capturing margin, Commercial Power has already exceeded its original 2010 adjusted segment EBIT expectations of $315 million. In fact, despite competitive pressures in Ohio throughout 2010, Duke Energy Retail has responded quickly and aggressively by pursuing customers not only inside Duke Energy Ohio's service territory, but also in other service territories within Ohio. Importantly, switching pressures in Ohio have stabilized. 
We are also pleased with the operational performance of Commercial Power's generation fleet and its continued focus on containing costs. Midwest generation is ahead of its safety and commercial availability targets for the year. They have accomplished these results while significantly reducing non-fuel O&M, principally labor costs. 
Turning now to our International operations, adjusted segment EBIT increased $10 million over third quarter of 2009. The primary drivers of this increase include favorable pricing and foreign exchange rates in Brazil, offset by lower dispatch of our thermal generation in Central America due to strong hydrology. 
Finally, two additional drivers impacted Duke Energy's overall results. The first was an increase in interest expense of $12 million, due to higher debt balances resulting from planned financings of our capital expansion program. The second, a positive driver, was a decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate from 33% in the third quarter of 2009 to 31% in the third quarter of 2010. We are now targeting a 32% effective tax rate for 2010, excluding the effect of the second quarter goodwill impairment charge, which is non-deductible for tax purposes. This targeted effective tax rate for 2010 is slightly higher than our original target of 31%, primarily as a result of the increased pretax earnings we expect, resulting from the strong weather experienced to date. For detailed quarter-over-quarter drivers for each of our segments, please refer to the appendix.
Now I'll turn our attention to volume trends. For the third quarter in a row, we experienced an increase in overall weather normalized sales volumes compared to the same period in 2009. Our weather normalized electric volumes rose approximately 1% this quarter, driven primarily by increased industrial sales activity across a broad range of major industrial classes. We continue to closely watch our sales volume trends, are cautiously optimistic about the continued industrial recovery in the near term. As industrial indicators point to continued expansion, the rate of growth has slowed. 
Earlier in the year, the Industrial recovery began in the primary metal sector. As the year has progressed, the recovery has spread to other Industrial sectors, including chemicals, textiles and automotive. However, primary metals growth has recently slowed primarily due to reduced commercial and residential construction activity. Additionally, our commercial and residential weather normalized volumes were essentially flat compared to third quarter of 2009. However, we continue to see modest growth in the total number of residential customers we serve in both the Carolinas and the Midwest. We remain optimistic in residential sales will see growth in the future.
At the same time, we are experiencing improved sales. Certain macroeconomic indicators cause us to remain cautious in our outlook for the future. Economists remain concerned about slow growth, as national and global economic challenges persist. Unemployment rates remain at or above the national average in all of our service territories. Single-family building permits have somewhat stabilized, remain at historical lows in both the Carolinas and the Midwest. 
Balancing all of these factors and weighing them against our recent experience, our outlook for 2010 continues to assume an approximate 2% increase in average weather normalized retail sales volumes for the full year versus 2009, with the increase largely coming from our industrial customer class. Nevertheless, recent discussions with our large industrial customers confirm that uncertainty remains the dominant theme for 2011. The next few months will give us a clear picture regarding next year's volume forecast.
Next, we'll look at cost control. Slide 6 summarizes our year-to-date results for our cost control measures. Our cost objective for 2010 is to hold O&M, net of deferrals and cost recovery riders, flat to 2009. This will require us to sustain the O&M cuts we achieved in 2009, as well as absorb the impacts of inflation and other cost increases in 2010. Through the third quarter, we are on track to achieve our cost objective as our year-to-date costs are relatively flat to the prior year. However, we continue to experience modest cost pressures, resulting from the impact of the unusually warm weather that we've seen in 2010. These cost pressures require us to stay focused on cost control throughout the remainder of this year. 
We will continue to execute on the voluntary separation and office consolidation plans we highlighted earlier this year. We are targeting a two- to three-year payback period for these costs. However, based upon additional cost reduction efforts identified as part of these plans, we have the potential to achieve a two-year payback. Even though we are committed to our cost control program, we also remain firmly focused on providing reliable, high-quality service to customers. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Jim.

I would like to conclude our prepared comments with a brief discussion on our Ohio business, as well as an update of our major construction projects. 
First, let me turn to Ohio, where we have non-regulated generation that is dedicated to serve the native load. Customer pricing is governed by the Electric Security Plan, or ESP, that expires at the end of 2011. The market in Ohio remains challenging due to continued low commodity prices and significant customer switching, even though it has slowed in the last several months. In the near term, the ESP regulatory framework under which we operate today in Ohio, creates more downside risk than potential for upside in today's markets. This framework makes it difficult for us to earn consistent and appropriate risk-adjusted returns for investment. This does not fit well with our value proposition for shareholders nor our overall risk profile. We continue to consider a full range of strategic options for Ohio generation portfolio for our upcoming standard service offer filing sometime in mid-November. This filing will balance the need to provide our investors with an appropriate risk-adjusted return and our customers with affordable and reliable electricity. 
We've outlined three potential options for our next standard service offer filing on this slide. We don't have specific details to share with you today. But we intend to work hard to reach constructive outcomes for both customers and shareholders. After we file our plan in the coming weeks, we will host a webcast to fully discuss the filing. 
On another Ohio matter, we were pleased last week when FERC conditionally approved the transfer of our Ohio and Kentucky transmission from MISO to PJM effective January 1, 2012. Additionally, FERC approved the participation of our mostly coal-based generation in Ohio and at Kentucky transmission from MISO to in PJM effective Jan [January] 1, '12. Additionally, FERC approved the participation of our mostly coal-based generation Ohio and Kentucky in PJM's May 2011 base residual option for the 2014 and '15 delivery period. There are remaining milestones we must meet related to this transfer, but FERC's approval is a strong first step. We are also seeking approval of the transfer from the Kentucky Commission. 
Next, I'll provide an update on our major construction projects, which are the centerpiece of our fleet modernization strategy. As I said earlier, in Indiana, our 618-megawatt Edwardsport project is 74% complete with approximately $2 billion spent to date. The project remains scheduled to go online in 2012. As Lynn mentioned, we entered into a settlement agreement with intervening parties regarding the increased costs of the Edwardsport project from $2.35 billion to $2.88 billion. This settlement is subject to commission approval. A public hearing is scheduled for November 29 and 30. The settlement balances customer rate impacts with the need to modernize our fleet and reduce our environmental footprint in Indiana. Further details of the settlement were discussed during our September 20 webcast, which can be found on our website and are included in the appendix to today's presentation. 
The commission has delayed hearings on our IGCC 5 semi-annual CWIP Rider related to Edwardsport from October 26 to December 2 after the hearings in late November on our recent settlement agreement. Meanwhile, we continue progressing on time and on budget with our three major North Carolina construction projects, which are outlined on this slide. Our 825-megawatt Cliffside supercritical pulverized coal plant scheduled to go online in 2012 is now 72% complete, with more than $1.5 billion spent to date. Additionally, the scrubber for Cliffside Unit 5 has been successfully tied in at the plant site. 
Our 620-megawatt Buck combined-cycle gas-fired plant scheduled to go online in 2011 is now 15% complete with $350 million spent to date. And last week, we broke ground on our second new combined-cycle gas-fired plant in North Carolina, our 620-megawatt Dan River facility scheduled to go online in 2012 with about $225 million spent to date. 
We've also made significant progress with our non-regulated renewable projects, which are underpinned with long-term power purchase agreements. Our 200-megawatt Top of the World wind farm in Wyoming went online earlier this month under budget and is selling all of its output to Pacific Corp. under a 20-year power purchase agreement. 
Our 51-megawatt Kit Carson wind farm in Colorado is expected to go online by the end of this year. The project will sell all of its output to Tri-State Generation under a 20-year power purchase agreement. These two projects, once online, will bring our total operating wind generation to nearly 1,000 megawatts by year end. In addition, our 14-megawatt Blue Wing commercial solar project in Texas is expected to go online as early as next week. The project has a 30-year power purchase agreement with CPS Energy.
Let me close with an update of our NSR cases. Earlier this month, we received a favorable ruling from a federal appeals court, which reversed a jury's finding that three of our coal units at Wabash River Station in Indiana had violated the Federal Clean Air Act. As a result of the initial jury decision, we had taken these three units out of service in 2009. This favorable ruling effectively ends over 10 years of litigation around EPA enforcement actions with respect to our Midwest generation fleet. We are pleased to have it behind us, although we are taking necessary steps to bring the three Wabash units back into service. We continue to evaluate whether more stringent upcoming environmental regulations will require their early retirement within the next several years. 
In conclusion, I am extremely pleased with our results this quarter and year-to-date. We remain focused on achieving an outstanding year. Our long-term strategy to modernize our fleet and grid continues to be an important part of what we're doing both for our customers, as well as investors. On the earnings front, we had a strong third quarter and are increasing our 2010 adjusted diluted EPS outlook range to $1.40 to $1.45 per share. On the dividend front, we increased our quarterly cash dividend, about 2% this year, the 84th consecutive year we paid a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock. 
Next week, several members of our executive team will attend the EEI [Edison Electric Institute] Financial Conference. I'll be in Indiana for the commission hearing on Edwardsport and thus unable to attend a conference. Additionally, I want you to know that the management team and I plan to conduct our 2011 Analyst and Investor Meeting in New York in February 2011. At that time, we'll provide an overview of our fourth quarter and 2010 earnings, as well as a strategic summary of each of our businesses. Further, we will discuss our 2011 adjusted earnings per share guidance range and financial outlook for 2011 and beyond. Details on the date and time will be sent to you shortly.

I think the way to put the stage is to say for the past nine years, the customers have benefited from a five-year rate freeze and a negotiated rate that was below the market price for four years. It worked for both customers and investors during that period. Today, the situation is very different. Prices have dropped dramatically in PJM, and we've experienced significant switching to the benefit of consumers, but not investors. At the heart of the problem, in my judgment, is that customers have a free option. Said another way, they have the ability to get the lower of market price or a negotiated rate. And the commission has been unwilling to permit a non-bypassable charge for standing ready to serve our customers when they return. As you know so well in truly competitive markets, there are no free options. Consequently, the way I view the situation in Ohio, we are neither regulated or allowed to completely to market today. So we are taking a very close look at the MRO, because that is a way to transition to market. It seems to be emerging in our analysis as the appropriate way forward, with respect to getting the appropriate returns for investors and continuing to provide to our customers reliable and affordable service. The way I would say it is, is that we're continuing to think our way through this. We're continuing to examine the pluses and minuses of the ESP approach that's been so beneficial to customers and investors in the past. And we're continuing to drill down on all of the implications of the MRO. As you know, FirstEnergy's MRO request was rejected several years ago, and we've looked closely at the basis for its rejection. And if we go that route, we will make sure that we address the issues that were raised by the commission there. So on balance, we believe that we have to make a very difficult decision between now and mid-November. But if you had to say, well, where are you leaning? I would say we're leaning toward the MRO at this point, but that's not a final decision. We have more work to do.

First of all, under our ESP which will still be in effect in '11, we have dedicated that capacity to our customers under the terms of the ESP. What we do beyond '12, it's my understanding, even with the MRO, there will be a commitment of this capacity to the retail load. So the issue of hedging out the capacity is not an issue that's in front of us in the short or medium term. I think that's a longer-term consideration. The other point I want to make to kind of bring clarity to this. Our Duke Energy Retail grew, which has picked up roughly 60% of the load to switch. What they have done is gone into the market and hedged the load as they picked it up to lock in the margins. So I draw those two distinctions, both with respect to next year and beyond, with respect to our generation and with respect to our door approach and whether or not we do ESP or MRO or some variation with respect to our existing generation. Is that clear?

Would that get us to a point where virtually all energy sales, Energy Ohio at or close to market, so that the transition to a MRO or the transition to an ESP in '12 would have very little incremental effect? Or will there still be some residual risk of retail prices slipping further beyond '11?

This, in my judgment, has been a good business because we're primarily building our wind and solar in states that have renewable portfolio standards. So they are mandated to purchase. Secondly, we are in every instance before we start construction put in place at least a 20-year PPA. And thirdly, the tax incentives associated in this business are very attractive. As you know, we're able to recover 38% of our investment in the first year. And coupled with that, we've been able to do project financing, so we've been able to get attractive returns on these investments. But our current sense of the market is that it is softening. And so the opportunities that are available may not be as great as they have been in past years. And I believe that's consistent with sort of the perception that FP&L has, which is really the leader in the industry in terms of developing wind. And I think we've all seen a softening in the demand for renewable energies, even in the states with the mandates to meet certain targets in future periods.

But the first point is that if you did an ESP by definition, the price would probably less than it is today going forward and that's after 2012, because the negotiated price has to reflect the market price. And obviously, we're all well aware that there's been a dramatic drop in the price of PJM over the last year. The MRO feature, which is in my judgment could be a positive is the way you're permitted to blend your existing generation with purchases in the market to come up with a negotiated price for your customers. So the amount of the blend from your existing generation or from the market is something that would be negotiated as you go down the MRO path. But again, we need to be realistic about this as all the merchant guys in the Midwest who are in PJM appreciate the margins have been squeezed dramatically for all the merchant players. I don't see that letting up in the next several years. However, if you look out five years or more, you can see the prices rising again. And the wild card in this is how many coal plants will actually be shut down and there have been estimates of between 20% and 30% of all the coal plants in the U.S. will be shut down in the next decade. I suspect the lion's share of these assets will be in the Midwest. Is there anything, Lynn, you'd like to add to that?

Good morning, everyone, and thank you, all, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy.I'll start with the bottom line for the third quarter results. They were excellent. The weather remained hot,",631,"Thank you, Stephen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you, all, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy.
I'll start with the bottom line for the third quarter results. They were excellent. The weather remained hot, the economy continued to show slow but steady signs of improvement, especially in our industrial class and our employees executed extremely well. As you saw in our news release this morning, we announced adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.51 for the third quarter of 2010 versus $0.40 for the third quarter of 2009. This is a quarter-over-quarter increase of around 28%. If you remove the impact of weather from each of these quarters, the quarter-over-quarter increase was approximately 7%.
Let me highlight the more significant drivers of our results for this quarter. First, favorable weather. We experienced well above normal temperatures in all five of our regulated jurisdictions during the third quarter. In the Carolinas, the quarter was the hottest third quarter in nearly 50 years. 
Additionally, we continued to realize higher revenues from our base rate increases approved in 2009 in North Carolina and South Carolina. And our employees and fleet continued to deliver excellent performance throughout the third quarter's unusually hot weather. 
Our year-to-date nuclear capacity factor was 96%, while our fossil fuel fleet had commercial availability of 89%. This strong operational performance through the end of the third quarter puts us on target to achieve our operational metrics for 2010, some of which are outlined on Slide 18 in the appendix. 
Based upon our results for the third quarter, usually our most significant quarter, we are increasing our 2010 adjusted diluted EPS outlook. We're going to increase that range to $1.40 to $1.45 per share. To put this in some perspective, at the start of the year, our 2010 adjusted diluted EPS outlook range was $1.25 to $1.30. After our second quarter results, we increased the outlook range to $1.30 to $1.35. Assumptions underlying this revised outlook include: normal weather for the rest of the year, continued cost control, continued strong operational performance and a stable economy. 
Before I turn the call over to Lynn to discuss the quarterly results, let me spend a few moments on Indiana. On November 3, I will have an opportunity to reaffirm our need for Edwardsport in a technical conference at the Indiana Commission and to answer any questions that the commission, its staff or any of the parties in the proceeding may have. Edwardsport is the cornerstone of our modernization strategy in Indiana. It helps us reduce the environmental impact of our existing coal generation fleet and prepares us for the inevitable retirement of some of our older coal plants when new environmental regulations for coal-fired plants are issued in the coming years by the EPA. 
Our IRP, our Integrated Resource Plan, supports our need for Edwardsport, even at the higher costs estimates of $2.88 billion. Based on this analysis, it is the best long-term economic solution to meet the needs of our Indiana customers at this time. Edwardsport is currently around 74% complete and is scheduled to be in service 2012. 
As you may know, questions have been raised related to the recent hiring of an attorney formerly with the Indiana Commission. In response, we have retained an outside law firm to conduct an independent investigation. We are also cooperating with Indiana Commission and the Inspector General in the reviews of this matter. 
Once the investigations are concluded, we will take whatever actions are appropriate. Because these investigations are ongoing, I cannot comment at this time on the investigations or any actions we may take. However, this matter is a top priority for me, as well as my management team. 
Now let me turn it over to Lynn."

Let me begin with an overview of our financial performance for the quarter. As you can see in the table on Slide 4, our total adjusted segment EBIT increased approximately $200 million compared with the third quarter of last year. The results",1236,"Thanks, Jim. Let me begin with an overview of our financial performance for the quarter. As you can see in the table on Slide 4, our total adjusted segment EBIT increased approximately $200 million compared with the third quarter of last year. The results for each of our business segments were strong, driven principally by favorable weather in all five of our states and in the Carolinas, increased pricing. The competitive environment in Ohio continues to be challenging, but we are extremely pleased with the efforts of our competitive retail arm, Duke Energy Retail, in defending and capturing margins. 
Let me briefly review the significant drivers of results for each of our business segments. Adjusted segment EBIT for U.S. Franchised Electric & Gas, our largest segment, increased $230 million over the prior-year third quarter. The significant drivers of this segment were the following. First, we experienced unusually warm summer weather, resulting in increased segment earnings of $157 million. The number of cooling degree days in the Carolinas during the third quarter was 27% above normal, while our Midwest service territory experienced total cooling degree days 32% above normal. 
Secondly, the impact of rate increases in the Carolinas approved in 2009 resulted in increased segment earnings of approximately $90 million. These rate increases reflect the recovery of prudently incurred utility investments and will continue to positively impact results in future periods. 
Thirdly, higher allowance for funds used during construction, resulting from Duke Energy's ongoing construction program, increased segment earnings another $20 million. Partially offsetting these increases to the segment's adjusted EBIT was an impairment charge of $44 million, recognized in connection with the September settlement agreement we reached with the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor and certain industrial customers related to the cost of the Edwardsport IGCC project. The impairment charge resulted from the settlement provision, which lowers the return on equity for amounts expended in excess of the currently approved project cost of $2.35 billion. The settlement agreement is subject to approval by the Indiana Commission, which will hold hearings on the matter on November 29 and 30. 
Next, I will discuss our Commercial Power segment. As we expected, Commercial Power's adjusted segment EBIT for the quarter was lower than the prior-year third quarter. However, as a result of strong energy margins from our Midwest gas-fired assets and the success of Duke Energy Retail in defending and capturing margin, Commercial Power has already exceeded its original 2010 adjusted segment EBIT expectation of $315 million. In fact, despite competitive pressures in Ohio throughout 2010, Duke Energy Retail has responded quickly and aggressively by pursuing customers not only inside Duke Energy Ohio's service territory, but also in other service territories within Ohio. Importantly, switching pressures in Ohio have stabilized. 
We are also pleased with the operational performance of Commercial Power's generation fleet and its continued focus on containing costs. Midwest generation is ahead of its safety and commercial availability targets for the year. They have accomplished these results while significantly reducing non-fuel O&M, principally labor costs. 
Turning now to our International operations. Adjusted segment EBIT increased $10 million over third quarter 2009. The primary drivers of this increase include favorable pricing and foreign exchange rates in Brazil, offset by lower dispatch of our thermal generation in Central America due to strong hydrology. 
Finally, two additional drivers impacted Duke Energy's overall results. The first was an increase in interest expense of $12 million, due to higher debt balances resulting from planned financings of our capital expansion program. The second, a positive driver, was a decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate from 33% in the third quarter of 2009 to 31% in the third quarter of 2010. We are now targeting a 32% effective tax rate for 2010, excluding the effect of the second quarter goodwill impairment charge, which is non-deductible for tax purposes. This targeted effective tax rate for 2010 is slightly higher than our original target of 31%, primarily as a result of the increased pretax earnings we expect, resulting from the strong weather experienced to date. For detailed quarter-over-quarter drivers for each of our segments, please refer to the appendix.
Now I'll turn our attention to volume trends. For the third quarter in a row, we experienced an increase in overall weather normalized sales volumes compared to the same periods in 2009. Our weather normalized electric volumes rose approximately 1% this quarter, driven primarily by increased industrial sales activity across a broad range of major industrial classes. We continue to closely watch our sales volume trends, are cautiously optimistic about the continued industrial recovery in the near term, as industrial indicators point to continued expansion, though the rate of growth has slowed. 
Earlier in the year, the Industrial recovery began in the primary metal sector. As the year has progressed, the recovery has spread to other Industrial sectors, including chemicals, textiles and automotive. However, primary metals growth has recently slowed primarily due to reduced commercial and residential construction activity. Additionally, our commercial and residential weather normalized volumes were essentially flat compared to third quarter 2009. However, we continue to see modest growth in the total number of residential customers we serve in both the Carolinas and the Midwest. We remain optimistic that residential sales will see growth in the future.
At the same time we are experiencing improved sales, certain macroeconomic indicators cause us to remain cautious in our outlook for the future. Economists remain concerned about slow growth, as national and global economic challenges persist. Unemployment rates remain at or above the national average in all of our service territories. Single-family building permits have somewhat stabilized, remain at historical lows in both the Carolinas and the Midwest. 
Balancing all of these factors and weighing them against our recent experience, our outlook for 2010 continues to assume an approximate 2% increase in average weather normalized retail sales volumes for the full year versus 2009, with the increase largely coming from our industrial customer class. Nevertheless, recent discussions with our large industrial customers confirm that uncertainty remains the dominant theme for 2011. The next few months will give us a clear picture regarding next year's volume forecast.
Next, we'll look at cost control. Slide 6 summarizes our year-to-date results for from cost control measures. Our cost objective for 2010 is to hold O&M, net of deferrals and cost recovery riders, flat to 2009. This will require us to sustain the O&M cuts we achieved in 2009, as well as absorb the impacts of inflation and other cost increases in 2010. Through the third quarter, we are on track to achieve our cost objective as our year-to-date costs are relatively flat to the prior year. However, we continue to experience modest cost pressures, resulting from the impact of the unusually warm weather that we've seen in 2010. These cost pressures require us to stay focused on cost control throughout the remainder of this year. 
We will continue to execute on the voluntary separation and office consolidation plans we highlighted earlier this year. We are targeting a two- to three-year payback period for these costs. However, based upon additional cost reduction efforts identified as part of these plans, we have the potential to achieve a two-year payback. Even though we are committed to our cost control program, we also remain firmly focused on providing reliable, high-quality service to customers. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Jim."

I would like to conclude our prepared comments with a brief discussion on our Ohio business, as well as an update of our major construction projects. 
First, let me turn to Ohio, where we have non-regulated generation that is dedicated to serve the native load. Customer pricing is governed by the Electric Security Plan, or ESP, that expires at the end of 2011. The market in Ohio remains challenging, due to continued low commodity prices and significant customer switching, even though it has slowed in the last several months. In the near term, the ESP regulatory framework under which we operate today in Ohio creates more downside risk than potential for upside in today's markets. This framework makes it difficult for us to earn consistent and appropriate risk-adjusted returns for investment. This does not fit well with our value proposition for shareholders nor our overall risk profile. We continue to consider a full range of strategic options for Ohio generation portfolio for our upcoming standard service offer filing sometime in mid-November. This filing will balance the need to provide our investors with an appropriate risk-adjusted return and our customers with affordable and reliable electricity. 
We've outlined three potential options for our next standard service offer filing on this slide. We don't have specific details to share with you today. But we intend to work hard to reach constructive outcomes for both customers and shareholders. After we file our plan in the coming weeks, we will host a webcast to fully discuss the filing. 
On another Ohio matter, we were pleased last week when FERC conditionally approved the transfer of our Ohio and Kentucky transmission from MISO to PJM effective Jan 1, ‘12. Additionally, FERC approved the participation of our mostly coal-based generation Ohio and Kentucky in PJM's May 2011 base residual auction for the 2014 and '15 delivery period. There are remaining milestones we must meet related to this transfer, but FERC's approval is a strong first step. We are also seeking approval of the transfer from the Kentucky Commission. 
Next, I'll provide an update on our major construction projects, which are the centerpiece of our fleet modernization strategy. As I said earlier, in Indiana, our 618-megawatt Edwardsport project is 74% complete with approximately $2 billion spent to date. The project remains scheduled to go online in 2012. As Lynn mentioned, we entered into a settlement agreement with intervening parties regarding the increased costs of the Edwardsport project from $2.35 billion to $2.88 billion. This settlement is subject to commission approval. A public hearing is scheduled for November 29 and 30. The settlement balances customer rate impacts with the need to modernize our fleet and reduce our environmental footprint in Indiana. Further details of the settlement were discussed during our September 20 webcast, which can be found on our website and are included in the appendix to today's presentation. 
The commission has delayed hearings on our IGCC 5 semi-annual CWIP Rider related to Edwardsport from October 26 to December 2 after the hearings in late November on our recent settlement agreement. Meanwhile, we continue progressing on time and on budget with our three major North Carolina construction projects, which are outlined on this slide. Our 825-megawatt Cliffside supercritical pulverized coal plant scheduled to go online in 2012 is now 72% complete, with more than $1.5 billion spent to date. Additionally, the scrubber for Cliffside Unit 5 has been successfully tied in at the plant site. 
Our 620-megawatt Buck combined-cycle gas-fired plant scheduled to go online in 2011 is now 15% complete with $350 million spent to date. And last week, we broke ground on our second new combined-cycle gas-fired plant in North Carolina, our 620-megawatt Dan River facility scheduled to go online in 2012 with about $225 million spent to date. 
We've also made significant progress with our non-regulated renewable projects, which are underpinned with long-term power purchase agreements. Our 200-megawatt Top of the World wind farm in Wyoming went online earlier this month under budget and is selling all of its output to PacifiCorp under a 20-year power purchase agreement. 
Our 51-megawatt Kit Carson wind farm in Colorado is expected to go online by the end of this year. The project will sell all of its output to Tri-State Generation under a 20-year power purchase agreement. These two projects, once online, will bring our total operating wind generation to nearly 1,000 megawatts by year end. In addition, our 14-megawatt Blue Wing commercial solar project in Texas is expected to go online as early as next week. The project has a 30-year power purchase agreement with CPS Energy.
Let me close with an update of our NSR cases. Earlier this month, we received a favorable ruling from a federal appeals court, which reversed a jury's finding that three of our coal units at Wabash River Station in Indiana had violated the federal Clean Air Act. As a result of the initial jury decision, we had taken these three units out of service in 2009. This favorable ruling effectively ends over 10 years of litigation around EPA enforcement actions with respect to our Midwest generation fleet. We are pleased to have it behind us, although we are taking necessary steps to bring the three Wabash units back into service. We continue to evaluate whether more stringent upcoming environmental regulations will require their early retirement within the next several years. 
In conclusion, I am extremely pleased with our results this quarter and year-to-date. We remain focused on achieving an outstanding year. Our long-term strategy to modernize our fleet and grid continues to be an important part of what we're doing both for our customers, as well as investors. On the earnings front, we had a strong third quarter and are increasing our 2010 adjusted diluted EPS outlook range to $1.40 to $1.45 per share. On the dividend front, we increased our quarterly cash dividend about 2% this year, the 84th consecutive year we paid a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock. 
Next week, several members of our executive team will attend the EEI [Edison Electric Institute] Financial Conference. I'll be in Indiana for the commission hearing on Edwardsport and thus unable to attend a conference. Additionally, I want you to know that the management team and I plan to conduct our 2011 Analyst and Investor Meeting in New York in February 2011. At that time, we'll provide an overview of our fourth quarter and 2010 earnings, as well as a strategic summary of each of our businesses. Further, we will discuss our 2011 adjusted earnings per share guidance range and financial outlook for 2011 and beyond. Details on the date and time will be sent to you shortly.

I think the way to put the stage is to say for the past nine years, the customers have benefited from a five-year rate freeze and a negotiated rate that was below the market price for four years. It worked for both customers and investors during that period. Today, the situation is very different. Prices have dropped dramatically in PJM, and we've experienced significant switching to the benefit of consumers, but not investors. At the heart of the problem, in my judgment, is that customers have a free option. Said another way, they have the ability to get the lower of market price or a negotiated rate. And the commission has been unwilling to permit a non-bypassable charge for standing ready to serve our customers when they return. As you know so well, in truly competitive markets, there are no free options. Consequently, the way I view the situation in Ohio, we are neither regulated or allowed to go completely to market today. So we are taking a very close look at the MRO, because that is a way to transition to market. It seems to be emerging in our analysis as the appropriate way forward, with respect to getting the appropriate returns for investors and continuing to provide to our customers reliable and affordable service. The way I would say it is that we're continuing to think our way through this. We're continuing to examine the pluses and minuses of the ESP approach that's been so beneficial to customers and investors in the past. And we're continuing to drill down on all of the implications of the MRO. As you know, FirstEnergy's MRO request was rejected several years ago, and we've looked closely at the basis for its rejection. And if we go that route, we will make sure that we address the issues that were raised by the commission there. So on balance, we believe that we have to make a very difficult decision between now and mid-November. But if you had to say, “Well, where are you leaning?” I would say we're leaning toward the MRO at this point, but that's not a final decision. We have more work to do."

What we do beyond '12, it's my understanding, even with an MRO, there would be a commitment of this capacity to the retail load. So the issue of hedging out the capacity is not an issue that's in front of us in the short or medium term. I think that's a longer-term consideration. The other point I want to make to kind of bring clarity to this that our Duke Energy Retail grew, which has picked up roughly 60% of the load to switch. What they have done is gone into the market and hedged the load as they picked it up to lock in the margins. So I draw those two distinctions, both with respect to next year and beyond, with respect to our generation and with respect to our DER approach and whether or not we do ESP or MRO or some variation with respect to our existing generation.

But the first point is that if you did an ESP by definition, the price would probably be less than it is today going forward and that's after 2012, because the negotiated price has to reflect the market price. And obviously, we're all well aware that there's been a dramatic drop in the price of PJM over the last year. The MRO’s feature, which, in my judgment could be a positive, is the way you're permitted to blend your existing generation with purchases in the market to come up with a negotiated price for your customers. So the amount of the blend from your existing generation or from the market is something that would be negotiated as you go down the MRO path. But again, we need to be realistic about this as all the merchant guys in the Midwest who are in PJM appreciate the margins have been squeezed dramatically for all the merchant players. I don't see that letting up in the next several years. However, if you look out five years or more, you can see the prices rising again. And the wild card in this is how many coal plants will actually be shut down and there have been estimates of between 20% and 30% of all the coal plants in the U.S. will be shut down in the next decade. I suspect the lion's share of these assets will be in the Midwest. Is there anything, Lynn, you'd like to add to that?"

Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy. I'll start with the bottom line for the third quarter results. They were excellent. The weather remained hot,",630," Thank you, Stephen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy.
 I'll start with the bottom line for the third quarter results. They were excellent. The weather remained hot, the economy continued to show slow but steady signs of improvement, especially in our industrial class and our employees executed extremely well. As you saw in our news release this morning, we announced adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.51 for the third quarter of 2010 versus $0.40 for the third quarter of 2009. This is a quarter-over-quarter increase of around 28%. If you remove the impact of weather from each of these quarters, the quarter-over-quarter increase was approximately 7%.
 Let me highlight the more significant drivers of our results for this quarter. First, favorable weather. We experienced well above normal temperatures in all five of our regulated jurisdictions during the third quarter. In the Carolinas, the quarter was the hottest third quarter in nearly 50 years.
 Additionally, we continued to realize higher revenues from our base rate increases approved in 2009 in North Carolina and South Carolina. And our employees and fleet continued to deliver excellent performance throughout the third quarter's unusually hot weather.
 Our year-to-date nuclear capacity factor was 96%, while our fossil fuel fleet had a commercial availability of 89%. This strong operational performance through the end of the third quarter puts us on target to achieve our operational metrics for 2010, some of which are outlined on Slide 18 in the appendix.
 Based upon our results for the third quarter, usually our most significant quarter, we are increasing our 2010 adjusted diluted EPS outlook. We're going to increase that range to $1.40 to $1.45 per share. To put this in some perspective, at the start of the year, our 2010 adjusted diluted EPS outlook range was $1.25 to $1.30. After our second quarter results, we increased the outlook range to $1.30 to $1.35. Assumptions underlying this revised outlook include: normal weather for the rest of the year, continued costs control, continued strong operational performance and a stable economy.
 Before I turn the call over to Lynn to discuss the quarterly results, let me spend a few moments on Indiana. On November 3, I will have an opportunity to reaffirm our need for Edwardsport in a technical conference at the Indiana Commission and to answer any questions that the commission, its staff or any of the parties in the proceeding may have. Edwardsport is the cornerstone of our modernization strategy in Indiana. It helps us reduce the environmental impact of our existing coal generation fleet and prepares us for the inevitable retirement of some of our older coal plants, renew environmental regulations for coal-fired plants are issued in the coming years by the EPA.
 Our IRP, our Integrated Resource Plan, supports our need for Edwardsport, even at the higher costs estimates of $2.88 billion. Based on this analysis, it is the best long-term economic solution to meet the needs of our Indiana customers at this time. Edwardsport is currently around 74% complete and is scheduled to be in service, 2012.
 As you may know, questions have been raised related to the recent hiring of an attorney formerly with the Indiana Commission. In response, we have retain an outside law firm to conduct an independent investigation. We're also cooperating with Indiana Commission and the Inspector General in the reviews of this matter.
 Once the investigations are concluded, we will take whatever actions are appropriate. Because these investigations are ongoing, I cannot comment at this time, on the investigations or any actions we may take. However, this matter is a top priority for me, as well as my management team.
 Now let me turn it over to Lynn.

Let me begin with an overview of our financial performance for the quarter. As you can see in the table on Slide 4, our total adjusted segment EBIT increased approximately $200 million compared with the third quarter of last year. The result",1237," Thanks, Jim. Let me begin with an overview of our financial performance for the quarter. As you can see in the table on Slide 4, our total adjusted segment EBIT increased approximately $200 million compared with the third quarter of last year. The results for each of our business segments were strong, driven principally by favorable weather in all five of our states and in the Carolinas, increased pricing. The competitive environment in Ohio continues to be challenging, but we are extremely pleased with the efforts of our competitive retail arm, Duke Energy Retail, in defending and capturing margins.
 Let me briefly review the significant drivers of results for each of our business segments. Adjusted segment EBIT for U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas, our largest segment, increased $230 million over the prior-year third quarter. The significant drivers of this segment were the following. First, we experienced unusually warm summer weather, resulting in increased segment earnings of $157 million. The number of cooling degree days in the Carolinas during the third quarter was 27% above normal, while our Midwest service territory experienced total cooling degree days 32% above normal.
 Secondly, the impact of rate increases in the Carolinas approved in 2009 resulted in increased segment earnings of approximately $90 million. These rate increases reflect the recovery of prudently incurred utility investments and will continue to positively impact results in future periods.
 Thirdly, higher allowance for funds used during construction, resulting from Duke Energy's ongoing construction program, increased segment earnings another $20 million. Partially offsetting these increases to the segment's adjusted EBIT was an impairment charge of $44 million, recognized in connection with the September settlement agreement we reached with the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor and certain industrial customers related to the cost of the Edwardsport IGCC project. The impairment charge resulted from the settlement provision, which lowers the return on equity for amounts expended in excess of the currently approved project cost of $2.35 billion. The settlement agreement is subject to approval by the Indiana Commission, which will hold hearings on the matter on November 29 and 30.
 Next, I will discuss our Commercial Power segment. As we expected, Commercial Power's adjusted segment EBIT for the quarter was lower than the prior-year third quarter. However, as a result of strong energy margins from our Midwest gas-fired assets and the success of Duke Energy Retail in defending and capturing margin, Commercial Power has already exceeded its original 2010 adjusted segment EBIT expectations of $315 million. In fact, despite competitive pressures in Ohio throughout 2010, Duke Energy Retail has responded quickly and aggressively by pursuing customers not only inside Duke Energy Ohio's service territory, but also in other service territories within Ohio. Importantly, switching pressures in Ohio have stabilized.
 We are also pleased with the operational performance of Commercial Power's generation fleet and its continued focus on containing costs. Midwest generation is ahead of its safety and commercial availability targets for the year. They have accomplished these results while significantly reducing non-fuel O&M, principally labor costs.
 Turning now to our International operations, adjusted segment EBIT increased $10 million over third quarter of 2009. The primary drivers of this increase include favorable pricing and foreign exchange rates in Brazil, offset by lower dispatch of our thermal generation in Central America due to strong hydrology.
 Finally, two additional drivers impacted Duke Energy's overall results. The first was an increase in interest expense of $12 million, due to higher debt balances resulting from planned financings of our capital expansion program. The second, a positive driver, was a decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate from 33% in the third quarter of 2009 to 31% in the third quarter of 2010. We are now targeting a 32% effective tax rate for 2010, excluding the effect of the second quarter goodwill impairment charge, which is non-deductible for tax purposes. This targeted effective tax rate for 2010 is slightly higher than our original target of 31%, primarily as a result of the increased pretax earnings we expect, resulting from the strong weather experienced to date. For detailed quarter-over-quarter drivers for each of our segments, please refer to the appendix.
 Now I'll turn our attention to volume trends. For the third quarter in a row, we experienced an increase in overall weather normalized sales volumes compared to the same period in 2009. Our weather normalized electric volumes rose approximately 1% this quarter, driven primarily by increased industrial sales activity across a broad range of major industrial classes. We continue to closely watch our sales volume trends, are cautiously optimistic about the continued industrial recovery in the near term. As industrial indicators point to continued expansion, the rate of growth has slowed.
 Earlier in the year, the Industrial recovery began in the primary metal sector. As the year has progressed, the recovery has spread to other Industrial sectors, including chemicals, textiles and automotive. However, primary metals growth has recently slowed primarily due to reduced commercial and residential construction activity. Additionally, our commercial and residential weather normalized volumes were essentially flat compared to third quarter of 2009. However, we continue to see modest growth in the total number of residential customers we serve in both the Carolinas and the Midwest. We remain optimistic in residential sales will see growth in the future.
 At the same time, we are experiencing improved sales. Certain macroeconomic indicators cause us to remain cautious in our outlook for the future. Economists remain concerned about slow growth, as national and global economic challenges persist. Unemployment rates remain at or above the national average in all of our service territories. Single-family building permits have somewhat stabilized, remain at historical lows in both the Carolinas and the Midwest.
 Balancing all of these factors and weighing them against our recent experience, our outlook for 2010 continues to assume an approximate 2% increase in average weather normalized retail sales volumes for the full year versus 2009, with the increase largely coming from our industrial customer class. Nevertheless, recent discussions with our large industrial customers confirm that uncertainty remains the dominant theme for 2011. The next few months will give us a clear picture regarding next year's volume forecast.
 Next, we'll look at cost control. Slide 6 summarizes our year-to-date results for our cost control measures. Our cost objective for 2010 is to hold O&M, net of deferrals and cost recovery riders, flat to 2009. This will require us to sustain the O&M cuts we achieved in 2009, as well as absorb the impacts of inflation and other cost increases in 2010. Through the third quarter, we are on track to achieve our cost objective as our year-to-date costs are relatively flat to the prior year. However, we continue to experience modest cost pressures, resulting from the impact of the unusually warm weather that we've seen in 2010. These cost pressures require us to stay focused on cost control throughout the remainder of this year.
 We will continue to execute on the voluntary separation and office consolidation plans we highlighted earlier this year. We are targeting a two- to three-year payback period for these costs. However, based upon additional cost reduction efforts identified as part of these plans, we have the potential to achieve a two-year payback. Even though we are committed to our cost control program, we also remain firmly focused on providing reliable, high-quality service to customers.
 With that, I'll turn it back over to Jim.

I would like to conclude our prepared comments with a brief discussion on our Ohio business, as well as an update of our major construction projects.
 First, let me turn to Ohio, where we have non-regulated generation that is dedicated to serve the native load. Customer pricing is governed by the Electric Security Plan, or ESP, that expires at the end of 2011. The market in Ohio remains challenging due to continued low commodity prices and significant customer switching, even though it has slowed in the last several months. In the near term, the ESP regulatory framework under which we operate today in Ohio, creates more downside risk than potential for upside in today's markets. This framework makes it difficult for us to earn consistent and appropriate risk-adjusted returns for investment. This does not fit well with our value proposition for shareholders nor our overall risk profile. We continue to consider a full range of strategic options for Ohio generation portfolio for our upcoming standard service offer filing sometime in mid-November. This filing will balance the need to provide our investors with an appropriate risk-adjusted return and our customers with affordable and reliable electricity.
 We've outlined three potential options for our next standard service offer filing on this slide. We don't have specific details to share with you today. But we intend to work hard to reach constructive outcomes for both customers and shareholders. After we file our plan in the coming weeks, we will host a webcast to fully discuss the filing.
 On another Ohio matter, we were pleased last week when FERC conditionally approved the transfer of our Ohio and Kentucky transmission from MISO to PJM effective January 1, 2012. Additionally, FERC approved the participation of our mostly coal-based generation in Ohio and at Kentucky transmission from MISO to in PJM effective Jan [January] 1, '12. Additionally, FERC approved the participation of our mostly coal-based generation Ohio and Kentucky in PJM's May 2011 base residual option for the 2014 and '15 delivery period. There are remaining milestones we must meet related to this transfer, but FERC's approval is a strong first step. We are also seeking approval of the transfer from the Kentucky Commission.
 Next, I'll provide an update on our major construction projects, which are the centerpiece of our fleet modernization strategy. As I said earlier, in Indiana, our 618-megawatt Edwardsport project is 74% complete with approximately $2 billion spent to date. The project remains scheduled to go online in 2012. As Lynn mentioned, we entered into a settlement agreement with intervening parties regarding the increased costs of the Edwardsport project from $2.35 billion to $2.88 billion. This settlement is subject to commission approval. A public hearing is scheduled for November 29 and 30. The settlement balances customer rate impacts with the need to modernize our fleet and reduce our environmental footprint in Indiana. Further details of the settlement were discussed during our September 20 webcast, which can be found on our website and are included in the appendix to today's presentation.
 The commission has delayed hearings on our IGCC 5 semi-annual CWIP Rider related to Edwardsport from October 26 to December 2 after the hearings in late November on our recent settlement agreement. Meanwhile, we continue progressing on time and on budget with our three major North Carolina construction projects, which are outlined on this slide. Our 825-megawatt Cliffside supercritical pulverized coal plant scheduled to go online in 2012 is now 72% complete, with more than $1.5 billion spent to date. Additionally, the scrubber for Cliffside Unit 5 has been successfully tied in at the plant site.
 Our 620-megawatt Buck combined-cycle gas-fired plant scheduled to go online in 2011 is now 15% complete with $350 million spent to date. And last week, we broke ground on our second new combined-cycle gas-fired plant in North Carolina, our 620-megawatt Dan River facility scheduled to go online in 2012 with about $225 million spent to date.
 We've also made significant progress with our non-regulated renewable projects, which are underpinned with long-term power purchase agreements. Our 200-megawatt Top of the World wind farm in Wyoming went online earlier this month under budget and is selling all of its output to Pacific Corp. under a 20-year power purchase agreement.
 Our 51-megawatt Kit Carson wind farm in Colorado is expected to go online by the end of this year. The project will sell all of its output to Tri-State Generation under a 20-year power purchase agreement. These two projects, once online, will bring our total operating wind generation to nearly 1,000 megawatts by year end. In addition, our 14-megawatt Blue Wing commercial solar project in Texas is expected to go online as early as next week. The project has a 30-year power purchase agreement with CPS Energy.
 Let me close with an update of our NSR cases. Earlier this month, we received a favorable ruling from a federal appeals court, which reversed a jury's finding that three of our coal units at Wabash River Station in Indiana had violated the Federal Clean Air Act. As a result of the initial jury decision, we had taken these three units out of service in 2009. This favorable ruling effectively ends over 10 years of litigation around EPA enforcement actions with respect to our Midwest generation fleet. We are pleased to have it behind us, although we are taking necessary steps to bring the three Wabash units back into service. We continue to evaluate whether more stringent upcoming environmental regulations will require their early retirement within the next several years.
 In conclusion, I am extremely pleased with our results this quarter and year-to-date. We remain focused on achieving an outstanding year. Our long-term strategy to modernize our fleet and grid continues to be an important part of what we're doing both for our customers, as well as investors. On the earnings front, we had a strong third quarter and are increasing our 2010 adjusted diluted EPS outlook range to $1.40 to $1.45 per share. On the dividend front, we increased our quarterly cash dividend, about 2% this year, the 84th consecutive year we paid a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock.
 Next week, several members of our executive team will attend the EEI [Edison Electric Institute] Financial Conference. I'll be in Indiana for the commission hearing on Edwardsport and thus unable to attend a conference. Additionally, I want you to know that the management team and I plan to conduct our 2011 Analyst and Investor Meeting in New York in February 2011. At that time, we'll provide an overview of our fourth quarter and 2010 earnings, as well as a strategic summary of each of our businesses. Further, we will discuss our 2011 adjusted earnings per share guidance range and financial outlook for 2011 and beyond. Details on the date and time will be sent to you shortly.

I think the way to put the stage is to say for the past nine years, the customers have benefited from a five-year rate freeze and a negotiated rate that was below the market price for four years. It worked for both customers and investors during that period. Today, the situation is very different. Prices have dropped dramatically in PJM, and we've experienced significant switching to the benefit of consumers, but not investors. At the heart of the problem, in my judgment, is that customers have a free option. Said another way, they have the ability to get the lower of market price or a negotiated rate. And the commission has been unwilling to permit a non-bypassable charge for standing ready to serve our customers when they return. As you know so well in truly competitive markets, there are no free options. Consequently, the way I view the situation in Ohio, we are neither regulated or allowed to completely to market today. So we are taking a very close look at the MRO, because that is a way to transition to market. It seems to be emerging in our analysis as the appropriate way forward, with respect to getting the appropriate returns for investors and continuing to provide to our customers reliable and affordable service. The way I would say it is, is that we're continuing to think our way through this. We're continuing to examine the pluses and minuses of the ESP approach that's been so beneficial to customers and investors in the past. And we're continuing to drill down on all of the implications of the MRO. As you know, FirstEnergy's MRO request was rejected several years ago, and we've looked closely at the basis for its rejection. And if we go that route, we will make sure that we address the issues that were raised by the commission there. So on balance, we believe that we have to make a very difficult decision between now and mid-November. But if you had to say, well, where are you leaning? I would say we're leaning toward the MRO at this point, but that's not a final decision. We have more work to do.

First of all, under our ESP which will still be in effect in '11, we have dedicated that capacity to our customers under the terms of the ESP. What we do beyond '12, it's my understanding, even with the MRO, there will be a commitment of this capacity to the retail load. So the issue of hedging out the capacity is not an issue that's in front of us in the short or medium term. I think that's a longer-term consideration. The other point I want to make to kind of bring clarity to this. Our Duke Energy Retail grew, which has picked up roughly 60% of the load to switch. What they have done is gone into the market and hedged the load as they picked it up to lock in the margins. So I draw those two distinctions, both with respect to next year and beyond, with respect to our generation and with respect to our door approach and whether or not we do ESP or MRO or some variation with respect to our existing generation. Is that clear?

This, in my judgment, has been a good business because we're primarily building our wind and solar in states that have renewable portfolio standards. So they are mandated to purchase.

As you know, we're able to recover 38% of our investment in the first year. And coupled with that, we've been able to do project financing, so we've been able to get attractive returns on these investments. But our current sense of the market is that it is softening. And so the opportunities that are available may not be as great as they have been in past years. And I believe that's consistent with sort of the perception that FP&L has, which is really the leader in the industry in terms of developing wind.

But the first point is that if you did an ESP by definition, the price would probably less than it is today going forward and that's after 2012, because the negotiated price has to reflect the market price. And obviously, we're all well aware that there's been a dramatic drop in the price of PJM over the last year. The MRO feature, which is in my judgment could be a positive is the way you're permitted to blend your existing generation with purchases in the market to come up with a negotiated price for your customers. So the amount of the blend from your existing generation or from the market is something that would be negotiated as you go down the MRO path. But again, we need to be realistic about this as all the merchant guys in the Midwest who are in PJM appreciate the margins have been squeezed dramatically for all the merchant players. I don't see that letting up in the next several years. However, if you look out five years or more, you can see the prices rising again. And the wild card in this is how many coal plants will actually be shut down and there have been estimates of between 20% and 30% of all the coal plants in the U.S. will be shut down in the next decade. I suspect the lion's share of these assets will be in the Midwest. Is there anything, Lynn, you'd like to add to that?
