Obviously, we are -- at the end of this roller coaster year, we are delighted to be able to report that our profitability string is intact and to be able to report even a very modest profit in this environ",977,"Thanks, Marvin. Thanks, everyone, for joining us. Obviously, we are -- at the end of this roller coaster year, we are delighted to be able to report that our profitability string is intact and to be able to report even a very modest profit in this environment, I think, is a huge accomplishment. But I'm very proud of our employees. It's been a real roller coaster. A lot of changes, a lot of challenges, but I think they more than prove that they are up to the task. The earnings for the fourth quarter to start there were $74 million on a non-GAAP basis and that's $0.10 a share better than a year ago, better than the Wall Street estimate and certainly better than what we thought six, eight months ago.For the full year, we did $143 million in earnings, again on a non-GAAP basis. That's $0.19 a share down from the 2008 levels, but certainly understandable given the very challenging economy that we faced in 2009. A lot of remarkable things about the fourth quarter though. The fourth quarter, at least to the best of my recollection, has never been the best quarter in a year and this year, it was by far, it was the best unit revenue performance of the year, but that means that we set an all-time record in terms of quarterly unit revenue in the fourth quarter of a recession. And that is remarkable indeed. And you might say it's because we adjusted our capacity but that doesn't explain it because their traffic was actually up and we added record level of traffic for a fourth quarter and that's despite a near 80%  drop in our capacity. It's probably  not too surprising to you than the sign that we also had a  record load factor performance for the fourth quarter as we did for the full year. So a number of very strong metrics, if you will, measuring our revenue performance. And so we're just delighted all the way around. And it took -- It's not just our Marketing department, not just our Schedule Planning department, not just Operations, not just Revenue Management. It took literally every employee at Southwest Airlines to produce those kinds of results and make the kinds of changes that we did in 2009.At this point, we have strong bookings in place for the balance of the quarter. Here in the first quarter of '10, January, February, March bookings looked really good. Just glancing at yesterday's bookings this morning, we had another strong day yesterday. The trend so far in January, Laura will speak to in a minute, but we're very pleased with the trends that we're seeing so far in 2010.Just to give you a very quick recap on some of the things that we did in 2009 to boost our revenue, I think first and foremost was the focus on our very high quality operation. We've had the best on-time performance that we've seen in years. We're turning out some of the best baggage handling numbers that we have ever had in our history. And once again, we're leading the industry in the fewest customer complaints. So just a very, very high quality operation, once again, despite all of the aggressive changes that took place. The other again, first and foremost, steps that we took, is we just focused on our Low Fare Brand. And we had some very successful, aggressive fare sales. We've launched a series of advertising campaigns that really drive home what we stand for and of course, we're all very proud of our Bags Fly Free Campaign. You can't find a customer now who isn't aware that Southwest doesn't charge for bags and we're getting a lot of credit for that and I think that course is certainly one of the reasons that we're seeing a pretty significant share shift to Southwest Airlines. Our capacity is down but our traffic is up.We had a number of aggressive changes to the schedule this year. I've already mentioned our fare sales. We introduced our EarlyBird product, we now carry  [ph] (15:54) pets, we added a three very large cities to our route network, launching Milwaukee as our fourth city late in the year. We've seen huge gains in our Denver market. And Denver in August of this year will be up to 144 daily departures, making it the fifth largest city in our route network and by far, the most successful new city we've ever had. And we also have some very nice opportunities that are unfolding in St. Louis.The sequential improvement that we've seen in our business in the fourth quarter is very broad, and that is compared primarily, let's say, to the second quarter earlier this year. But I do think it's fair to say that our short-haul markets are still lagging behind some of the other markets and I would also attribute that to a still a softness in business travel. And then finally, before I turn it over to Laura, I just want to make appointment very -- even on the earnings weren't at record levels for the year, we did have a very respectable fourth quarter earnings performance. If you compare it to the last five years, it's not our best but it ain't bad. But I think more importantly for the year, we had near $1 billion in operating cash flow that was generated and to be able to do that in a recessionary environment, we have already managed our capital spending much lower, was again just a very, very encouraging sign. So it's been a very gratifying year for us. And I think without a doubt, we're very, very confident about how we think about our future. So with that, I would just like to turn it over to Ms. Laura Wright, our Chief Financial Officer."

We're very pleased to report a profit for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our fourth quarter net income of $116 million included a net gain of $42 million relating to non-cash, market-to-market and other",2133,"Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to report a profit for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our fourth quarter net income of $116 million included a net gain of $42 million relating to non-cash, market-to-market and other items associated with SFAS 133. Excluding these special items, our fourth quarter net income was $74 million or $0.10 per diluted share, which was far better than we thought possible just months ago and easily exceeded Wall Street's mean estimate of $0.07 per diluted share.Our fourth quarter revenue results were outstanding and our unit revenue trends have continued to outperform the industry. For the fourth quarter, our operating unit revenues were up 7.4% year-over-year. We continue to gain market share with our traffic up over 5% in the quarter despite an almost 8% reduction in our capacity. We posted monthly record load factors beginning with July and ended the year strong with the fourth quarter record performance of 77.3%, which was up almost 10 points from a year ago. This surpassed a long record, our record performance is 70.3% from the fourth quarter of 2006.In July, we launched a WOW! Sale for travel post-Labor Day through mid-November. It set all-time booking records and helped drive our load factors during this period to new highs. We're also seeing a positive customer reaction to our Bags Fly Free campaign and as a result, our year-over-year unit revenue comparisons were favorable in October, November and December. November and December's year-over-year unit revenue comparisons were impacted by the Thanksgiving shift, which did sit on  November resin [ph] (19:35) between one and two percentage points. For the two months combined, our unit revenues were up almost 8% compared to November and December of 2008.Strong bookings and year-over-year unit revenue trends are continuing into 2010 and month to date, our January passenger resin [ph] (19:54) is estimated to have increased between 14% and 15% year-over-year. I do keep in mind that our January capacity is estimated to be down almost 7% compared to a 4% to 5% reduction in February and March, which will make our comparisons a little more difficult in the February and March time periodBased on our full fare mix, we believe that our full fare business traffic has stabilized but we are definitely not back to pre-recession levels and for the fourth quarter of 2009, our full fare mix was 18%. Again, our employees have done an extraordinary job responding to the weak demand environment and we couldn't be more pleased with their efforts. As Gary mentioned, we launched a number of new revenue initiatives during the year. Although unplanned, we introduced our new Pet Fare, our Unaccompanied Minor charge, EarlyBird Check-in and we're very pleased with the revenue contribution of these initiatives. Our EarlyBird revenues, which are included in other revenues were approximately $13 million in the fourth quarter. Our Business Select revenue in the fourth quarter held steady at about $18 million and for the full year with $72 million. In addition to that, we generated over $10 million in other revenues for our new Pet Fare, Unaccompanied Minor charges and excess heavy bag fees.Our schedule optimization efforts has been a huge success and was significantly benefiting from our capacity cuts and the realignment of our network. We've eliminated approximately 10% of our flights that were unprofitable over the last year and we kept our fleet flat because of weak travel demand. Our own capacity cuts, the successful schedule optimization, represented the majority of our 7.4% year-over-year RASM increase. Through our optimization efforts, we were able to open Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York LaGuardia, Boston Logan and Milwaukee as well as coexisting markets such as Denver and St. Louis. We continue to advance our revenue management structure and techniques and we're very pleased with the results of the steps we took late in the third quarter to restructure our fares to provide an array of low-fare options that better respond to the impact the recession has had on demand. The fourth quarter revenue impact was greater than expected and produced tens of million in incremental revenue for the quarter.We've also upgraded www.southwest.com and are seeing higher book-to-look rates and higher average fares from our shoppers. With respect to freight and other revenues, our freight revenues were down about 16% year-over-year due to the weak economy. We expect our freight revenues for the first quarter of 2010 to be in line with our fourth quarter 2009 freight revenues. Our other revenues were up significantly year-over-year in the fourth quarter and as I mentioned before, the ancillary revenues from Pets, UMs, early birds and bags combined for almost $25 million during the quarter. We expect a strong year-over-year improvement in our other revenues to continue into the first quarter of 2010.Turning to our fourth quarter cost performance. Our fourth quarter operating expenses, excluding special items, decreased 2.7% versus fourth quarter of last year, largely due to lower fuel costs. Our economic fuel cost decreased 3.1% to $2.20 per gallon for the quarter, which was slightly better than we anticipated. Fuel prices remain volatile and we continue to actively manage our portfolio and our associated premium costs. We recently restructured our 2010 fuel hedge portfolio and we're currently about 50% hedged in 2010 at prices up to about $100 per barrel. We recently sold call options, which decreased our protection to 20% if the market prices settle in the $100 to $120 per barrel range and we added another layer of purchase call options to provide catastrophic protection at levels above $120, which increases our protection to approximately 40% hedged if market prices exceed $120.Our 2010 hedged portfolio includes a combination of swaps, callers, call options and call spreads. The premium costs associated with our 2010 fuel hedge portfolio, which are recorded below the line in other gains and losses were estimated to be approximately $115 million in 2010 or about $30 million per quarter, which is less than the $148 million spent in 2009. Based on current market prices, we're estimating our first quarter 2010 fuel costs including fuel taxes, but excluding premiums, to be in the $2.35 per gallon range. Our first quarter 2010 fuel price estimates includes a $0.10 per gallon hedge penalty based on current market prices. This has significantly improved from the $0.17 penalty at the time we de-hedged in the fourth quarter of 2008.To provide you with some sensitivity with respect to our first quarter 2010 fuel hedge, if first quarter prices drop an average $60 per barrel for the quarter, our hedging penalty increases to about $0.24 per gallon as the current gains we have in the hedges placed in 2009 are reduced and no longer offset the loss from the 2008 de-hedging. If first quarter prices rise in average $95 per barrel for the quarter, we would expect to have a $0.09 per gallon hedging benefit.Volatility mix is quite difficult to provide precise [ph] (26:18) guidance for 2010, however, our best touch points based on the current forward prices and our existing hedge portfolio is in the $2.30 to $2.35 per gallon range, which is about $0.10 above current market prices. For 2011, we currently have about 40% our estimated fuel consumption hedged with the majority using callers and we have modest positions in place for 2012 and 2013. As of two days ago, the total net liability of our current steel hedge portfolio was around $500 million.Excluding fuel and special items, our unit costs were up 8.6% year-over-year to $7.45. This performance was in line with our expectations and slightly under our guidance of $7.5. One of the drivers of the increase in our unit cost was our reduction in capacity, which was down 7.7% in the quarter. The remaining is inflationary pressures in such areas as salaries, wages and airport costs. Based on current cost trends and headwinds from lower first quarter capacity, we currently estimate our first quarter 2010 unit costs, excluding fuel-related taxes, will increase from fourth quarter 2009 to $7.45. Our year-over-year unit cost pressures are more heavily weighted towards the first half of 2010, in particular the first quarter, due to our capacity reductions. Our first quarter 2010 available seat miles will be down in the 5% to 6% range while we expect our full-year ASMs to be roughly flat. For the full year 2010, we are projecting our ex-fuel unit cost to be up in the 5% range as a result of our flat capacity and inflationary pressures in many cost categories.We can assure you that we know this is not acceptable and adjusting our cost structure and improving our productivity to support the changes that we've made with our schedule will be one of our top priorities in 2010. We've swiftly adjusted our schedule to adapt to a higher underlying cost structure due to energy prices and a weaker demand environment. Now is the time to adjust our costs to our more flexible schedule and it is our intent to do so. That being said, it cannot be done overnight and it will take us time to build and make the necessary adjustments.With respect to our airport costs, our landing fees and other rentals on a unit basis, increased 18.5% to $0.77, primarily due to airport rate increases and that was partially offset by some favorable airport product adjustments. Based on the continuous rate inflation at various airports, which was really being driven primarily by capacity reductions, we expect our first quarter airport unit cost to exceed fourth quarter, $0.77 and we're currently estimating the first quarter 2010 airport unit costs to be in the mid-$0.80 range.Our salaries, wages and benefits increased on a unit basis to $3.66 over fourth quarter at last year, and higher wage rates accompanied by our 7.7% capacity reduction contributed to the year-over-year increase. Based on our current cost and capacity trends, we expect our first quarter 2010 salaries, wages and benefits unit cost to increase from fourth quarter's $3.66. And on a year-over-year basis, we expect the unit cost to be up in the 8% to 9% range. Our maintenance unit cost decreased 11.5% year-over-year, which was better than anticipated, primarily due to fewer-than-expected events. Based on the planned events and the reduced capacity, we expect our first quarter 2010's maintenance unit cost to be in the high $0.70 range.Turning to the balance sheet. Our liquidity remains strong. One of our main goals for 2009 was to protect our financial health and we succeeded by maintaining a healthy cash balance and investment rating and modest levels of debt. As of yesterday, we had core unrestricted cash and short-term investments of $2.4 billion. Our $600 million credit facility remains fully undrawn and available. Our leverage, including aircraft leases, is in the 45% range and we have very manageable scheduled debt maturities in 2010. For 2009, our cash flow from operations was $985 million, which was net of a $90 million increase in our fuel hedge collateral deposits. After capital spending and scheduled debt payments, we generated free cash flow of $400 million, which we used to repay our revolver.For the full-year 2010, we expect that our capital spending will be in the $600 million to $700 million range. With respect to our fleet, we ended 2009 with 537 Boeing aircraft. During the fourth quarter, we did not have any scheduled firm orders from Boeing but we reduced our fleet by four aircrafts. Our fourth quarter available seat mile capacity decreased 7.7% and our full-year capacity was down 5.1% compared to 2008. We remain very cautious with our capacity plans for 2010 and we are not planning to grow the fleet this year and expect our full-year available seat mile capacity to be roughly flat with 2009. As I mentioned earlier, our year-over-year capacity declines are weighted to the first half of the year with our largest quarterly declines planned for the first quarter. Our forecasted quarterly ASM capacity is as follows: In the first quarter, we'll will be down in the 5% range. In the second quarter, our ASMs will be down in the 1% range. The third quarter, we're currently projected to be up in the 1% range and the fourth quarter up into 2% range.As we've done successfully for the past several years, we will continue to optimize each published schedule. We have firm orders with Boeing this year for 10 700 aircraft and we have a like amount of classic lease aircraft and with expiring leases as well as the ability to retire our own traffic aircraft. We have included an updated Boeing delivery schedule in the accompanying tables to the press release issued this morning. And Marvin, with that, I think Gary and I are ready to take questions."

So 2010 for Southwest Airlines is as you know, will probably be the highest hedged jet fuel cost for Southwest Airlines in our history. So we need to be prosperous to afford to grow. We need to be hitting our return on investment targets. I believe that we will soon hit those targets before we add to the fleet. And on the heels of -- when I saw the ATA reporting yesterday, this is the worst drop in revenues the airline industry has ever experienced. I certainly agree with that and that's the way it felt. So I don't think any of us believe that now is the time to be talking about growth. We want to grow, we'll be looking for opportunities to grow. We'd like to be bold but the risk reward will just need to balance out there, but in terms of thinking about any new opportunities. But for the time being, you should just expect that if our results are like they were in '09, we would not want to grow the fleet."

I've just tried to say it in a little bit different way to see if you don't clarify. We've had a long history of producing what, for all practical purposes, was a static schedule. And the only changes to our static schedule were more airplanes and more flights. Now what we are forced to do is to react to a higher energy cost, which means higher costs per trip. So you can't fly your way into lower unit costs with energy. And what you're seeing now in 2010 is the most exaggerated scheduling for us, adjusting to seasonality. So I think that's the point Laura was making is that we've really pulled down capacity in January because the demand is lower. And we are  purposely bringing it back in a more flexible way mid February, when we think demand will pick up seasonally. We've never done that before. So that's that. And then underneath that, we basically have the same staff in place in a fixed way on the ground to a lesser degree in the air, whether we have a reduced schedule in January or whether we have a full schedule in March. So we have not quite cracked that nut on how we make our cost structure a little bit more flexible, although we're determined to do that. So I don't think neither one of us is prepared to describe today what we're going to do or what our ideas are and none of it will necessary come easy. But that's the challenge and we'll just repeat, like what I said at the beginning, I think our people are more than up to that challenge. But our focus right now has been improving the customer experience and transforming Southwest's capabilities, and we are performing exceptionally well there. And we don't turn our sights on and 2010 is getting our productivity enhanced even further. If you look at our employees per aircraft, it improved yet again in 2009. So we're making progress. We just need to make more rapid progress. And I think just finally, one of the things that we're faced with here on the airports, Laura, she pieced that one out, our airport costs are going up for two reasons: One is the nominal costs are going up, which is painful and another cell. But secondly, the overall activity in the industry is going down and I know you understand all that. But that's one of our bigger cost issues in 2010 and what I describe won't address that. So we're going to have to find offsets to that very significant cost pressure that we're incurring at this point."

We've been -- especially in 2008 with the obvious pressure that we've had in energy costs that we had a number of aggressive fare increases that year. And it worked very well until we slammed into November, really in the fourth quarter of '08. Even in 2009, our normal mantra is it's really hard to price yourself out of a recession. But even in 2009, we've had a series of -- they've been broad but very tactical, I think very wise efforts to increase fares. I think a fair evaluation of the success of those that most of those worked well. Obviously, the first fare increase has a better chance of driving revenue than the last one, because they sort of compound. But now, we're in a mood where -- again, back to the comment i made earlier, we must adjust as an industry and as an airline to higher operating costs. We're doing that as aggressively as we dare. And the results of all of our various actions over the last couple of years, I'm very pleased with. I think the evidence is very strong that our folks are doing a great job there. We'll continue to look for fare increase opportunities, because we're not hitting our profit targets yet. And we are expecting to have cost hurdles to overcome. So we're trying to do that in a way that we maintain our Low Fare Brand. And I think again, that's one of the reasons why the Bags Fly Free has become such a meaningful weapon in our arsenal. It's just another way for us to demonstrate to customers that we do stand for overall low fares, and it's something that our competitors can't match. And at the same time, we can keep the rest of our fare structure relatively low, even though we will be increasing it overtime. On the New York question, no share shift that's visible to us at all from ice-led sales [ph] (58:36). I don't see there's any cannibalization there at all. The LaGuardia operation for Southwest is quite small, it's eight round trips. The on-time performance with those flights has been slightly below average but certainly nothing that we have been concerned about. Obviously, we're doing our best to make sure that if there are some operational integrity issues there that we don't affect the rest of the system. And again, we have the best on-time performance year in 2009 that we've had in many years even with the additions of some challenging places like that. The business for us in New York LaGuardia has been spectacular. It's been a huge contributor right off the bat. I don't think any of us are shocked at that because we did have a very conservative schedule. We have far more demand for Southwest into New York than what we can satisfy with any flights. And the revenue performance certainly provides evidence to that."

The problem of course in this business is if we're forced today to make decisions about 2012, it's just a track sheet, so vis-a-vis your questions. But no, I think we have plenty of flexibility to add capacity at least to a degree in the near term if that's what we want to do. Now, we're published out through August 13. So even that, we could jam in more airplanes and more flights in that time period if we want to. But it would be a little painful and it wouldn't be optimized, so I think the best thing for us is to be able to add more flights after August 13 and have it all integrated on what we're working on right now."

And that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to win more customers and we would love to sell them more stuff. So we've got all that work underway as well.

And I think with what you all know, when you kind of put these things together, what we've been reporting all year long, I think that we'll probably -- with new things that have been added, Business Select, EarlyBird, Pets, just a long list of things. We're probably close to $1 billion in incremental revenues, we're just that stuffed. And I don't think it's a leap at all to believe that what we have teed up for 2010 and 2011 will easily fill out the $1.5 billion. I think the only other point that I would make is that we all recognize that our target is now more than $1.5 billion. And we know that and of course, you all should know that. But again, Dan, I think the things that are in front of us, our international approach here, which should provide a very meaningful contribution. It's a no-brainer that it will add revenue. And we know we have a very powerful domestic network and we have a very strong brand. We will definitely add customers and revenues once we get those up and running. And then secondly, it is our next-generation Rapid Rewards program, it is very straightforward. In addition to the ambitious goal of desiring more loyalty, we're just looking at getting our current members to be a little stickier within so that they'll fly us more and encourage more of them to use the Southwest credit card.

It hasn't gotten worse since summertime, if anything, it may have gotten better. But we're certainly not seeing a large return of business traffic nor are we predicting that for 2010. So the strength in our revenues, I think is pretty easily demonstrated. It's not the short-haul markets, it's the medium, the longer-haul markets. It's more of the leisure flavor to it. And again, in addition to all the things that we've added like EarlyBird, we're just getting more customers and they're more leisure customers. The domestic market isn't growing in the U.S. but Southwest is growing even without adding capacity. So that's the share shift that we're talking about and with the Low Fare Brand in a recessionary environment where people are trying to spend their money more wisely, I just think we're getting a real nice craze here. And when business travel does pick up, I think you're going to see a very nice boost in our revenues yet again. So we're doing very well on the revenue front."

Thanks, everyone, for joining us. Obviously, we are -- at the end of this roller coaster year, we are delighted to be able to report that our profitability string is intact and to be able to report even a very modest profit in this environment, I think, is a huge accomplishment. But I'm very proud of our employees. It's been a real roller coaster. A lot of changes, a lot of challenges, but I think they more than prove that they are up to the task. The earnings for the fourth quarter to start there were $74 million on a non-GAAP basis and that's $0.10 a share better than a year ago, better than the Wall Street estimate and certainly better than what we thought six, eight months ago.For the full year, we did $143 million in earnings, again on a non-GAAP basis. That's $0.19 a share down from the 2008 levels, but certainly understandable given the very challenging economy that we faced in 2009. A lot of remarkable things about the fourth quarter though. The fourth quarter, at least to the best of my recollection, has never been the best quarter in a year and this year, it was by far, it was the best unit revenue performance of the year, but that means that we set an all-time record in terms of quarterly unit revenue in the fourth quarter of a recession. And that is remarkable indeed. And you might say it's because we adjusted our capacity but that doesn't explain it because their traffic was actually up and we added record level of traffic for a fourth quarter and that's despite a near 80%  drop in our capacity. It's probably  not too surprising to you than the sign that we also had a  record load factor performance for the fourth quarter as we did for the full year. So a number of very strong metrics, if you will, measuring our revenue performance. And so we're just delighted all the way around. And it took -- It's not just our Marketing department, not just our Schedule Planning department, not just Operations, not just Revenue Management. It took literally every employee at Southwest Airlines to produce those kinds of results and make the kinds of changes that we did in 2009.At this point, we have strong bookings in place for the balance of the quarter. Here in the first quarter of '10, January, February, March bookings looked really good. Just glancing at yesterday's bookings this morning, we had another strong day yesterday. The trend so far in January, Laura will speak to in a minute, but we're very pleased with the trends that we're seeing so far in 2010.Just to give you a very quick recap on some of the things that we did in 2009 to boost our revenue, I think first and foremost was the focus on our very high quality operation. We've had the best on-time performance that we've seen in years. We're turning out some of the best baggage handling numbers that we have ever had in our history. And once again, we're leading the industry in the fewest customer complaints. So just a very, very high quality operation, once again, despite all of the aggressive changes that took place. The other again, first and foremost, steps that we took, is we just focused on our Low Fare Brand. And we had some very successful, aggressive fare sales. We've launched a series of advertising campaigns that really drive home what we stand for and of course, we're all very proud of our Bags Fly Free Campaign. You can't find a customer now who isn't aware that Southwest doesn't charge for bags and we're getting a lot of credit for that and I think that course is certainly one of the reasons that we're seeing a pretty significant share shift to Southwest Airlines. Our capacity is down but our traffic is up.We had a number of aggressive changes to the schedule this year. I've already mentioned our fare sales. We introduced our EarlyBird product, we now carry  [ph] (15:54) pets, we added a three very large cities to our route network, launching Milwaukee as our fourth city late in the year. We've seen huge gains in our Denver market. And Denver in August of this year will be up to 144 daily departures, making it the fifth largest city in our route network and by far, the most successful new city we've ever had. And we also have some very nice opportunities that are unfolding in St. Louis.The sequential improvement that we've seen in our business in the fourth quarter is very broad, and that is compared primarily, let's say, to the second quarter earlier this year. But I do think it's fair to say that our short-haul markets are still lagging behind some of the other markets and I would also attribute that to a still a softness in business travel. And then finally, before I turn it over to Laura, I just want to make appointment very -- even on the earnings weren't at record levels for the year, we did have a very respectable fourth quarter earnings performance. If you compare it to the last five years, it's not our best but it ain't bad. But I think more importantly for the year, we had near $1 billion in operating cash flow that was generated and to be able to do that in a recessionary environment, we have already managed our capital spending much lower, was again just a very, very encouraging sign. So it's been a very gratifying year for us. And I think without a doubt, we're very, very confident about how we think about our future. So with that, I would just like to turn it over to Ms. Laura Wright, our Chief Financial Officer."

We're very pleased to report a profit for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our fourth quarter net income of $116 million included a net gain of $42 million relating to non-cash, market-to-market and other items associated with SFAS 133. Excluding these special items, our fourth quarter net income was $74 million or $0.10 per diluted share, which was far better than we thought possible just months ago and easily exceeded Wall Street's mean estimate of $0.07 per diluted share.Our fourth quarter revenue results were outstanding and our unit revenue trends have continued to outperform the industry. For the fourth quarter, our operating unit revenues were up 7.4% year-over-year. We continue to gain market share with our traffic up over 5% in the quarter despite an almost 8% reduction in our capacity. We posted monthly record load factors beginning with July and ended the year strong with the fourth quarter record performance of 77.3%, which was up almost 10 points from a year ago. This surpassed a long record, our record performance is 70.3% from the fourth quarter of 2006.In July, we launched a WOW! Sale for travel post-Labor Day through mid-November. It set all-time booking records and helped drive our load factors during this period to new highs. We're also seeing a positive customer reaction to our Bags Fly Free campaign and as a result, our year-over-year unit revenue comparisons were favorable in October, November and December. November and December's year-over-year unit revenue comparisons were impacted by the Thanksgiving shift, which did sit on  November resin [ph] (19:35) between one and two percentage points. For the two months combined, our unit revenues were up almost 8% compared to November and December of 2008.Strong bookings and year-over-year unit revenue trends are continuing into 2010 and month to date, our January passenger resin [ph] (19:54) is estimated to have increased between 14% and 15% year-over-year. I do keep in mind that our January capacity is estimated to be down almost 7% compared to a 4% to 5% reduction in February and March, which will make our comparisons a little more difficult in the February and March time periodBased on our full fare mix, we believe that our full fare business traffic has stabilized but we are definitely not back to pre-recession levels and for the fourth quarter of 2009, our full fare mix was 18%. Again, our employees have done an extraordinary job responding to the weak demand environment and we couldn't be more pleased with their efforts. As Gary mentioned, we launched a number of new revenue initiatives during the year. Although unplanned, we introduced our new Pet Fare, our Unaccompanied Minor charge, EarlyBird Check-in and we're very pleased with the revenue contribution of these initiatives. Our EarlyBird revenues, which are included in other revenues were approximately $13 million in the fourth quarter. Our Business Select revenue in the fourth quarter held steady at about $18 million and for the full year with $72 million. In addition to that, we generated over $10 million in other revenues for our new Pet Fare, Unaccompanied Minor charges and excess heavy bag fees.Our schedule optimization efforts has been a huge success and was significantly benefiting from our capacity cuts and the realignment of our network. We've eliminated approximately 10% of our flights that were unprofitable over the last year and we kept our fleet flat because of weak travel demand. Our own capacity cuts, the successful schedule optimization, represented the majority of our 7.4% year-over-year RASM increase. Through our optimization efforts, we were able to open Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York LaGuardia, Boston Logan and Milwaukee as well as coexisting markets such as Denver and St. Louis. We continue to advance our revenue management structure and techniques and we're very pleased with the results of the steps we took late in the third quarter to restructure our fares to provide an array of low-fare options that better respond to the impact the recession has had on demand. The fourth quarter revenue impact was greater than expected and produced tens of million in incremental revenue for the quarter.We've also upgraded www.southwest.com and are seeing higher book-to-look rates and higher average fares from our shoppers. With respect to freight and other revenues, our freight revenues were down about 16% year-over-year due to the weak economy. We expect our freight revenues for the first quarter of 2010 to be in line with our fourth quarter 2009 freight revenues. Our other revenues were up significantly year-over-year in the fourth quarter and as I mentioned before, the ancillary revenues from Pets, UMs, early birds and bags combined for almost $25 million during the quarter. We expect a strong year-over-year improvement in our other revenues to continue into the first quarter of 2010.Turning to our fourth quarter cost performance. Our fourth quarter operating expenses, excluding special items, decreased 2.7% versus fourth quarter of last year, largely due to lower fuel costs. Our economic fuel cost decreased 3.1% to $2.20 per gallon for the quarter, which was slightly better than we anticipated. Fuel prices remain volatile and we continue to actively manage our portfolio and our associated premium costs. We recently restructured our 2010 fuel hedge portfolio and we're currently about 50% hedged in 2010 at prices up to about $100 per barrel. We recently sold call options, which decreased our protection to 20% if the market prices settle in the $100 to $120 per barrel range and we added another layer of purchase call options to provide catastrophic protection at levels above $120, which increases our protection to approximately 40% hedged if market prices exceed $120.Our 2010 hedged portfolio includes a combination of swaps, callers, call options and call spreads. The premium costs associated with our 2010 fuel hedge portfolio, which are recorded below the line in other gains and losses were estimated to be approximately $115 million in 2010 or about $30 million per quarter, which is less than the $148 million spent in 2009. Based on current market prices, we're estimating our first quarter 2010 fuel costs including fuel taxes, but excluding premiums, to be in the $2.35 per gallon range. Our first quarter 2010 fuel price estimates includes a $0.10 per gallon hedge penalty based on current market prices. This has significantly improved from the $0.17 penalty at the time we de-hedged in the fourth quarter of 2008.To provide you with some sensitivity with respect to our first quarter 2010 fuel hedge, if first quarter prices drop an average $60 per barrel for the quarter, our hedging penalty increases to about $0.24 per gallon as the current gains we have in the hedges placed in 2009 are reduced and no longer offset the loss from the 2008 de-hedging. If first quarter prices rise in average $95 per barrel for the quarter, we would expect to have a $0.09 per gallon hedging benefit.Volatility mix is quite difficult to provide precise [ph] (26:18) guidance for 2010, however, our best touch points based on the current forward prices and our existing hedge portfolio is in the $2.30 to $2.35 per gallon range, which is about $0.10 above current market prices. For 2011, we currently have about 40% our estimated fuel consumption hedged with the majority using callers and we have modest positions in place for 2012 and 2013. As of two days ago, the total net liability of our current steel hedge portfolio was around $500 million.Excluding fuel and special items, our unit costs were up 8.6% year-over-year to $7.45. This performance was in line with our expectations and slightly under our guidance of $7.5. One of the drivers of the increase in our unit cost was our reduction in capacity, which was down 7.7% in the quarter. The remaining is inflationary pressures in such areas as salaries, wages and airport costs. Based on current cost trends and headwinds from lower first quarter capacity, we currently estimate our first quarter 2010 unit costs, excluding fuel-related taxes, will increase from fourth quarter 2009 to $7.45. Our year-over-year unit cost pressures are more heavily weighted towards the first half of 2010, in particular the first quarter, due to our capacity reductions. Our first quarter 2010 available seat miles will be down in the 5% to 6% range while we expect our full-year ASMs to be roughly flat. For the full year 2010, we are projecting our ex-fuel unit cost to be up in the 5% range as a result of our flat capacity and inflationary pressures in many cost categories.We can assure you that we know this is not acceptable and adjusting our cost structure and improving our productivity to support the changes that we've made with our schedule will be one of our top priorities in 2010. We've swiftly adjusted our schedule to adapt to a higher underlying cost structure due to energy prices and a weaker demand environment. Now is the time to adjust our costs to our more flexible schedule and it is our intent to do so. That being said, it cannot be done overnight and it will take us time to build and make the necessary adjustments.With respect to our airport costs, our landing fees and other rentals on a unit basis, increased 18.5% to $0.77, primarily due to airport rate increases and that was partially offset by some favorable airport product adjustments. Based on the continuous rate inflation at various airports, which was really being driven primarily by capacity reductions, we expect our first quarter airport unit cost to exceed fourth quarter, $0.77 and we're currently estimating the first quarter 2010 airport unit costs to be in the mid-$0.80 range.Our salaries, wages and benefits increased on a unit basis to $3.66 over fourth quarter at last year, and higher wage rates accompanied by our 7.7% capacity reduction contributed to the year-over-year increase. Based on our current cost and capacity trends, we expect our first quarter 2010 salaries, wages and benefits unit cost to increase from fourth quarter's $3.66. And on a year-over-year basis, we expect the unit cost to be up in the 8% to 9% range. Our maintenance unit cost decreased 11.5% year-over-year, which was better than anticipated, primarily due to fewer-than-expected events. Based on the planned events and the reduced capacity, we expect our first quarter 2010's maintenance unit cost to be in the high $0.70 range.Turning to the balance sheet. Our liquidity remains strong. One of our main goals for 2009 was to protect our financial health and we succeeded by maintaining a healthy cash balance and investment rating and modest levels of debt. As of yesterday, we had core unrestricted cash and short-term investments of $2.4 billion. Our $600 million credit facility remains fully undrawn and available. Our leverage, including aircraft leases, is in the 45% range and we have very manageable scheduled debt maturities in 2010. For 2009, our cash flow from operations was $985 million, which was net of a $90 million increase in our fuel hedge collateral deposits. After capital spending and scheduled debt payments, we generated free cash flow of $400 million, which we used to repay our revolver.For the full-year 2010, we expect that our capital spending will be in the $600 million to $700 million range. With respect to our fleet, we ended 2009 with 537 Boeing aircraft. During the fourth quarter, we did not have any scheduled firm orders from Boeing but we reduced our fleet by four aircrafts. Our fourth quarter available seat mile capacity decreased 7.7% and our full-year capacity was down 5.1% compared to 2008. We remain very cautious with our capacity plans for 2010 and we are not planning to grow the fleet this year and expect our full-year available seat mile capacity to be roughly flat with 2009. As I mentioned earlier, our year-over-year capacity declines are weighted to the first half of the year with our largest quarterly declines planned for the first quarter. Our forecasted quarterly ASM capacity is as follows: In the first quarter, we'll will be down in the 5% range. In the second quarter, our ASMs will be down in the 1% range. The third quarter, we're currently projected to be up in the 1% range and the fourth quarter up into 2% range.As we've done successfully for the past several years, we will continue to optimize each published schedule. We have firm orders with Boeing this year for 10 700 aircraft and we have a like amount of classic lease aircraft and with expiring leases as well as the ability to retire our own traffic aircraft. We have included an updated Boeing delivery schedule in the accompanying tables to the press release issued this morning. And Marvin, with that, I think Gary and I are ready to take questions."

Laura mentioned that we're managing schedule by schedule. You know what we have been describing over the past couple of years in terms of transforming Southwest Airlines' capabilities to deal with a new reality. I think about one of the new realities, of course, is much higher energy cost. And Bill, I just don't think we are there yet. So 2010 for Southwest Airlines is as you know, will probably be the highest hedged jet fuel cost for Southwest Airlines in our history. So we need to be prosperous to afford to grow. We need to be hitting our return on investment targets. I believe that we will soon hit those targets before we add to the fleet. And on the heels of -- when I saw the ATA reporting yesterday, this is the worst drop in revenues the airline industry has ever experienced. I certainly agree with that and that's the way it felt. So I don't think any of us believe that now is the time to be talking about growth. We want to grow, we'll be looking for opportunities to grow. We'd like to be bold but the risk reward will just need to balance out there, but in terms of thinking about any new opportunities. But for the time being, you should just expect that if our results are like they were in '09, we would not want to grow the fleet."

So I think, really, the point is it just takes time for us to adjust our operations and improve our productivity to adjust to those changes. So I don't know if there's anything else you might want to add."

I've just tried to say it in a little bit different way to see if you don't clarify. We've had a long history of producing what, for all practical purposes, was a static schedule. And the only changes to our static schedule were more airplanes and more flights. Now what we are forced to do is to react to a higher energy cost, which means higher costs per trip. So you can't fly your way into lower unit costs with energy. And what you're seeing now in 2010 is the most exaggerated scheduling for us, adjusting to seasonality. So I think that's the point Laura was making is that we've really pulled down capacity in January because the demand is lower. And we are  purposely bringing it back in a more flexible way mid February, when we think demand will pick up seasonally. We've never done that before. So that's that. And then underneath that, we basically have the same staff in place in a fixed way on the ground to a lesser degree in the air, whether we have a reduced schedule in January or whether we have a full schedule in March. So we have not quite cracked that nut on how we make our cost structure a little bit more flexible, although we're determined to do that. So I don't think neither one of us is prepared to describe today what we're going to do or what our ideas are and none of it will necessary come easy. But that's the challenge and we'll just repeat, like what I said at the beginning, I think our people are more than up to that challenge. But our focus right now has been improving the customer experience and transforming Southwest's capabilities, and we are performing exceptionally well there. And we don't turn our sights on and 2010 is getting our productivity enhanced even further. If you look at our employees per aircraft, it improved yet again in 2009. So we're making progress. We just need to make more rapid progress. And I think just finally, one of the things that we're faced with here on the airports, Laura, she pieced that one out, our airport costs are going up for two reasons: One is the nominal costs are going up, which is painful and another cell. But secondly, the overall activity in the industry is going down and I know you understand all that. But that's one of our bigger cost issues in 2010 and what I describe won't address that. So we're going to have to find offsets to that very significant cost pressure that we're incurring at this point."

We've been -- especially in 2008 with the obvious pressure that we've had in energy costs that we had a number of aggressive fare increases that year. And it worked very well until we slammed into November, really in the fourth quarter of '08. Even in 2009, our normal mantra is it's really hard to price yourself out of a recession. But even in 2009, we've had a series of -- they've been broad but very tactical, I think very wise efforts to increase fares. I think a fair evaluation of the success of those that most of those worked well. Obviously, the first fare increase has a better chance of driving revenue than the last one, because they sort of compound. But now, we're in a mood where -- again, back to the comment i made earlier, we must adjust as an industry and as an airline to higher operating costs. We're doing that as aggressively as we dare. And the results of all of our various actions over the last couple of years, I'm very pleased with. I think the evidence is very strong that our folks are doing a great job there. We'll continue to look for fare increase opportunities, because we're not hitting our profit targets yet. And we are expecting to have cost hurdles to overcome. So we're trying to do that in a way that we maintain our Low Fare Brand. And I think again, that's one of the reasons why the Bags Fly Free has become such a meaningful weapon in our arsenal. It's just another way for us to demonstrate to customers that we do stand for overall low fares, and it's something that our competitors can't match. And at the same time, we can keep the rest of our fare structure relatively low, even though we will be increasing it overtime. On the New York question, no share shift that's visible to us at all from ice-led sales [ph] (58:36). I don't see there's any cannibalization there at all. The LaGuardia operation for Southwest is quite small, it's eight round trips. The on-time performance with those flights has been slightly below average but certainly nothing that we have been concerned about. Obviously, we're doing our best to make sure that if there are some operational integrity issues there that we don't affect the rest of the system. And again, we have the best on-time performance year in 2009 that we've had in many years even with the additions of some challenging places like that. The business for us in New York LaGuardia has been spectacular. It's been a huge contributor right off the bat. I don't think any of us are shocked at that because we did have a very conservative schedule. We have far more demand for Southwest into New York than what we can satisfy with any flights. And the revenue performance certainly provides evidence to that."

And I think with what you all know, when you kind of put these things together, what we've been reporting all year long, I think that we'll probably -- with new things that have been added, Business Select, EarlyBird, Pets, just a long list of things. We're probably close to $1 billion in incremental revenues, we're just that stuffed. And I don't think it's a leap at all to believe that what we have teed up for 2010 and 2011 will easily fill out the $1.5 billion. I think the only other point that I would make is that we all recognize that our target is now more than $1.5 billion. And we know that and of course, you all should know that. But again, Dan, I think the things that are in front of us, our international approach here, which should provide a very meaningful contribution. It's a no-brainer that it will add revenue. And we know we have a very powerful domestic network and we have a very strong brand. We will definitely add customers and revenues once we get those up and running. And then secondly, it is our next-generation Rapid Rewards program, it is very straightforward. In addition to the ambitious goal of desiring more loyalty, we're just looking at getting our current members to be a little stickier within so that they'll fly us more and encourage more of them to use the Southwest credit card. So it's not a pie-in-the-sky thing here that we're talking. I think we've got a very meaningful revenue opportunity, certainly relative to our peer group that we've not realized yet. And I think we know why and we intend to close that gap."

Would you characterize it as being driven primarily by business or leisure?

It hasn't gotten worse since summertime, if anything, it may have gotten better. But we're certainly not seeing a large return of business traffic nor are we predicting that for 2010. So the strength in our revenues, I think is pretty easily demonstrated. It's not the short-haul markets, it's the medium, the longer-haul markets. It's more of the leisure flavor to it. And again, in addition to all the things that we've added like EarlyBird, we're just getting more customers and they're more leisure customers. The domestic market isn't growing in the U.S. but Southwest is growing even without adding capacity. So that's the share shift that we're talking about and with the Low Fare Brand in a recessionary environment where people are trying to spend their money more wisely, I just think we're getting a real nice craze here. And when business travel does pick up, I think you're going to see a very nice boost in our revenues yet again. So we're doing very well on the revenue front."

Thanks, everyone, for joining us. Obviously, we are -- at the end of this roller coaster year, we are delighted to be able to report that our profitability string is intact and to be able to report even a very modest profit in this environment, I think, is a huge accomplishment. But I'm very proud of our employees. It's been a real roller coaster. A lot of changes, a lot of challenges, but I think they more than prove that they are up to the task. The earnings for the fourth quarter to start there were $74 million on a non-GAAP basis and that's $0.10 a share better than a year ago, better than the Wall Street estimate and certainly better than what we thought six, eight months ago.For the full year, we did $143 million in earnings, again on a non-GAAP basis. That's $0.19 a share down from the 2008 levels, but certainly understandable given the very challenging economy that we faced in 2009. A lot of remarkable things about the fourth quarter though. The fourth quarter, at least to the best of my recollection, has never been the best quarter in a year and this year, it was by far, it was the best unit revenue performance of the year, but that means that we set an all-time record in terms of quarterly unit revenue in the fourth quarter of a recession. And that is remarkable indeed. And you might say it's because we adjusted our capacity but that doesn't explain it because their traffic was actually up and we added record level of traffic for a fourth quarter and that's despite a near 80%  drop in our capacity. It's probably  not too surprising to you than the sign that we also had a  record load factor performance for the fourth quarter as we did for the full year. So a number of very strong metrics, if you will, measuring our revenue performance. And so we're just delighted all the way around. And it took -- It's not just our Marketing department, not just our Schedule Planning department, not just Operations, not just Revenue Management. It took literally every employee at Southwest Airlines to produce those kinds of results and make the kinds of changes that we did in 2009.At this point, we have strong bookings in place for the balance of the quarter. Here in the first quarter of '10, January, February, March bookings looked really good. Just glancing at yesterday's bookings this morning, we had another strong day yesterday. The trend so far in January, Laura will speak to in a minute, but we're very pleased with the trends that we're seeing so far in 2010.Just to give you a very quick recap on some of the things that we did in 2009 to boost our revenue, I think first and foremost was the focus on our very high quality operation. We've had the best on-time performance that we've seen in years. We're turning out some of the best baggage handling numbers that we have ever had in our history. And once again, we're leading the industry in the fewest customer complaints. So just a very, very high quality operation, once again, despite all of the aggressive changes that took place. The other again, first and foremost, steps that we took, is we just focused on our Low Fare Brand. And we had some very successful, aggressive fare sales. We've launched a series of advertising campaigns that really drive home what we stand for and of course, we're all very proud of our Bags Fly Free Campaign. You can't find a customer now who isn't aware that Southwest doesn't charge for bags and we're getting a lot of credit for that and I think that course is certainly one of the reasons that we're seeing a pretty significant share shift to Southwest Airlines. Our capacity is down but our traffic is up.We had a number of aggressive changes to the schedule this year. I've already mentioned our fare sales. We introduced our EarlyBird product, we now carry pets, we added a three very large cities to our route network, launching Milwaukee as our fourth city late in the year. We've seen huge gains in our Denver market. And Denver in August of this year will be up to 144 daily departures, making it the fifth largest city in our route network and by far, the most successful new city we've ever had. And we also have some very nice opportunities that are unfolding in St. Louis.The sequential improvement that we've seen in our business in the fourth quarter is very broad, and that is compared primarily, let's say, to the second quarter earlier this year. But I do think it's fair to say that our short-haul markets are still lagging behind some of the other markets and I would also attribute that to a still a softness in business travel. And then finally, before I turn it over to Laura, I just want to make appointment very -- even on the earnings weren't at record levels for the year, we did have a very respectable fourth quarter earnings performance. If you compare it to the last five years, it's not our best but it ain't bad. But I think more importantly for the year, we had near $1 billion in operating cash flow that was generated and to be able to do that in a recessionary environment, we have already managed our capital spending much lower, was again just a very, very encouraging sign. So it's been a very gratifying year for us. And I think without a doubt, we're very, very confident about how we think about our future. So with that, I would just like to turn it over to Ms. Laura Wright, our Chief Financial Officer."

We're very pleased to report a profit for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our fourth quarter net income of $116 million included a net gain of $42 million relating to non-cash, market-to-market and other items associated with SFAS 133. Excluding these special items, our fourth quarter net income was $74 million or $0.10 per diluted share, which was far better than we thought possible just months ago and easily exceeded Wall Street's mean estimate of $0.07 per diluted share.Our fourth quarter revenue results were outstanding and our unit revenue trends have continued to outperform the industry. For the fourth quarter, our operating unit revenues were up 7.4% year-over-year. We continue to gain market share with our traffic up over 5% in the quarter despite an almost 8% reduction in our capacity. We posted monthly record load factors beginning with July and ended the year strong with the fourth quarter record performance of 77.3%, which was up almost 10 points from a year ago. This surpassed a long record, our record performance is 70.3% from the fourth quarter of 2006.In July, we launched a WOW! Sale for travel post-Labor Day through mid-November. It set all-time booking records and helped drive our load factors during this period to new highs. We're also seeing a positive customer reaction to our Bags Fly Free campaign and as a result, our year-over-year unit revenue comparisons were favorable in October, November and December. November and December's year-over-year unit revenue comparisons were impacted by the Thanksgiving shift, which did sit on  November RASM between one and two percentage points. For the two months combined, our unit revenues were up almost 8% compared to November and December of 2008.Strong bookings and year-over-year unit revenue trends are continuing into 2010 and month to date, our January passenger RASM is estimated to have increased between 14% and 15% year-over-year. I do keep in mind that our January capacity is estimated to be down almost 7% compared to a 4% to 5% reduction in February and March, which will make our comparisons a little more difficult in the February and March time periodBased on our full fare mix, we believe that our full fare business traffic has stabilized but we are definitely not back to pre-recession levels and for the fourth quarter of 2009, our full fare mix was 18%. Again, our employees have done an extraordinary job responding to the weak demand environment and we couldn't be more pleased with their efforts. As Gary mentioned, we launched a number of new revenue initiatives during the year. Although unplanned, we introduced our new Pet Fare, our Unaccompanied Minor charge, EarlyBird Check-in and we're very pleased with the revenue contribution of these initiatives. Our EarlyBird revenues, which are included in other revenues were approximately $13 million in the fourth quarter. Our Business Select revenue in the fourth quarter held steady at about $18 million and for the full year with $72 million. In addition to that, we generated over $10 million in other revenues for our new Pet Fare, Unaccompanied Minor charges and excess heavy bag fees.Our schedule optimization efforts has been a huge success and was significantly benefiting from our capacity cuts and the realignment of our network. We've eliminated approximately 10% of our flights that were unprofitable over the last year and we kept our fleet flat because of weak travel demand. Our own capacity cuts, the successful schedule optimization, represented the majority of our 7.4% year-over-year RASM increase. Through our optimization efforts, we were able to open Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York LaGuardia, Boston Logan and Milwaukee as well as coexisting markets such as Denver and St. Louis. We continue to advance our revenue management structure and techniques and we're very pleased with the results of the steps we took late in the third quarter to restructure our fares to provide an array of low-fare options that better respond to the impact the recession has had on demand. The fourth quarter revenue impact was greater than expected and produced tens of million in incremental revenue for the quarter.We've also upgraded www.southwest.com and are seeing higher book-to-look rates and higher average fares from our shoppers. With respect to freight and other revenues, our freight revenues were down about 16% year-over-year due to the weak economy. We expect our freight revenues for the first quarter of 2010 to be in line with our fourth quarter 2009 freight revenues. Our other revenues were up significantly year-over-year in the fourth quarter and as I mentioned before, the ancillary revenues from Pets, UMs, early birds and bags combined for almost $25 million during the quarter. We expect a strong year-over-year improvement in our other revenues to continue into the first quarter of 2010.Turning to our fourth quarter cost performance. Our fourth quarter operating expenses, excluding special items, decreased 2.7% versus fourth quarter of last year, largely due to lower fuel costs. Our economic fuel cost decreased 3.1% to $2.20 per gallon for the quarter, which was slightly better than we anticipated. Fuel prices remain volatile and we continue to actively manage our portfolio and our associated premium costs. We recently restructured our 2010 fuel hedge portfolio and we're currently about 50% hedged in 2010 at prices up to about $100 per barrel. We recently sold call options, which decreased our protection to 20% if the market prices settle in the $100 to $120 per barrel range and we added another layer of purchase call options to provide catastrophic protection at levels above $120, which increases our protection to approximately 40% hedged if market prices exceed $120.Our 2010 hedged portfolio includes a combination of swaps, callers, call options and call spreads. The premium costs associated with our 2010 fuel hedge portfolio, which are recorded below the line in other gains and losses were estimated to be approximately $115 million in 2010 or about $30 million per quarter, which is less than the $148 million spent in 2009. Based on current market prices, we're estimating our first quarter 2010 fuel costs including fuel taxes, but excluding premiums, to be in the $2.35 per gallon range. Our first quarter 2010 fuel price estimates includes a $0.10 per gallon hedge penalty based on current market prices. This has significantly improved from the $0.17 penalty at the time we de-hedged in the fourth quarter of 2008.To provide you with some sensitivity with respect to our first quarter 2010 fuel hedge, if first quarter prices drop an average $60 per barrel for the quarter, our hedging penalty increases to about $0.24 per gallon as the current gains we have in the hedges placed in 2009 are reduced and no longer offset the loss from the 2008 de-hedging. If first quarter prices rise in average $95 per barrel for the quarter, we would expect to have a $0.09 per gallon hedging benefit.Volatility mix is quite difficult to provide precise guidance for 2010, however, our best touch points based on the current forward prices and our existing hedge portfolio is in the $2.30 to $2.35 per gallon range, which is about $0.10 above current market prices. For 2011, we currently have about 40% our estimated fuel consumption hedged with the majority using callers and we have modest positions in place for 2012 and 2013. As of two days ago, the total net liability of our current steel hedge portfolio was around $500 million.Excluding fuel and special items, our unit costs were up 8.6% year-over-year to $7.45. This performance was in line with our expectations and slightly under our guidance of $7.5. One of the drivers of the increase in our unit cost was our reduction in capacity, which was down 7.7% in the quarter. The remaining is inflationary pressures in such areas as salaries, wages and airport costs. Based on current cost trends and headwinds from lower first quarter capacity, we currently estimate our first quarter 2010 unit costs, excluding fuel-related taxes, will increase from fourth quarter 2009 to $7.45. Our year-over-year unit cost pressures are more heavily weighted towards the first half of 2010, in particular the first quarter, due to our capacity reductions. Our first quarter 2010 available seat miles will be down in the 5% to 6% range while we expect our full-year ASMs to be roughly flat. For the full year 2010, we are projecting our x fuel unit cost to be up in the 5% range as a result of our flat capacity and inflationary pressures in many cost categories.We can assure you that we know this is not acceptable and adjusting our cost structure and improving our productivity to support the changes that we've made with our schedule will be one of our top priorities in 2010. We've swiftly adjusted our schedule to adapt to a higher underlying cost structure due to energy prices and a weaker demand environment. Now is the time to adjust our costs to our more flexible schedule and it is our intent to do so. That being said, it cannot be done overnight and it will take us time to build and make the necessary adjustments.With respect to our airport costs, our landing fees and other rentals on a unit basis, increased 18 1/2% to $0.77, primarily due to airport rate increases and that was partially offset by some favorable airport product adjustments. Based on the continuous rate inflation at various airports, which was really being driven primarily by capacity reductions, we expect our first quarter airport unit cost to exceed fourth quarter, $0.77 and we're currently estimating the first quarter 2010 airport unit costs to be in the mid-$0.80 range.Our salaries, wages and benefits increased on a unit basis to $3.66 over fourth quarter at last year, and higher wage rates accompanied by our 7.7% capacity reduction contributed to the year-over-year increase. Based on our current cost and capacity trends, we expect our first quarter 2010 salaries, wages and benefits unit cost to increase from fourth quarter's $3.66. And on a year-over-year basis, we expect the unit cost to be up in the 8% to 9% range. Our maintenance unit cost decreased 11 1/2% year-over-year, which was better than anticipated, primarily due to fewer-than-expected events. Based on the planned events and the reduced capacity, we expect our first quarter 2010's maintenance unit cost to be in the high $0.70 range.Turning to the balance sheet. Our liquidity remains strong. One of our main goals for 2009 was to protect our financial health and we succeeded by maintaining a healthy cash balance and investment rating and modest levels of debt. As of yesterday, we had core unrestricted cash and short-term investments of $2.4 billion. Our $600 million credit facility remains fully undrawn and available. Our leverage, including aircraft leases, is in the 45% range and we have very manageable scheduled debt maturities in 2010. For 2009, our cash flow from operations was $985 million, which was net of a $90 million increase in our fuel hedge collateral deposits. After capital spending and scheduled debt payments, we generated free cash flow of $400 million, which we used to repay our revolver.For the full-year 2010, we expect that our capital spending will be in the $600 million to $700 million range. With respect to our fleet, we ended 2009 with 537 Boeing aircraft. During the fourth quarter, we did not have any scheduled firm orders from Boeing but we reduced our fleet by four aircrafts. Our fourth quarter available seat mile capacity decreased 7.7% and our full-year capacity was down 5.1% compared to 2008. We remain very cautious with our capacity plans for 2010 and we are not planning to grow the fleet this year and expect our full-year available seat mile capacity to be roughly flat with 2009. As I mentioned earlier, our year-over-year capacity declines are weighted to the first half of the year with our largest quarterly declines planned for the first quarter. Our forecasted quarterly ASM capacity is as follows: In the first quarter, we'll be down in the 5% range. In the second quarter, our ASMs will be down in the 1% range. The third quarter, we're currently projected to be up in the 1% range and the fourth quarter up into 2% range.As we've done successfully for the past several years, we will continue to optimize each published schedule. We have firm orders with Boeing this year, for '10, 700 aircraft and we have a like amount of classic lease aircraft and with expiring leases as well as the ability to retire our own traffic aircraft. We have included an updated Boeing delivery schedule in the accompanying tables to the press release issued this morning. And Marvin, with that, I think Gary and I are ready to take questions."

Laura mentioned that we're managing schedule by schedule. You know what we have been describing over the past couple of years in terms of transforming Southwest Airlines' capabilities to deal with a new reality. I think about one of the new realities, of course, is much higher energy cost. And Bill, I just don't think we are there yet. So 2010 for Southwest Airlines is as you know, will probably be the highest hedged jet fuel cost for Southwest Airlines in our history. So we need to be prosperous to afford to grow. We need to be hitting our return on investment targets. I believe that we will soon hit those targets before we add to the fleet. And on the heels of -- when I saw the ATA reporting yesterday, this is the worst drop in revenues the airline industry has ever experienced. I certainly agree with that and that's the way it felt. So I don't think any of us believe that now is the time to be talking about growth. We want to grow, we'll be looking for opportunities to grow. We'd like to be bold but the risk reward will just need to balance out there, but in terms of thinking about any new opportunities. But for the time being, you should just expect that if our results are like they were in '09, we would not want to grow the fleet."

I've just tried to say it in a little bit different way to see if you don't clarify. We've had a long history of producing what, for all practical purposes, was a static schedule. And the only changes to our static schedule were more airplanes and more flights. Now what we are forced to do is to react to a higher energy cost, which means higher costs per trip. So you can't fly your way into lower unit costs with energy. And what you're seeing now in 2010 is the most exaggerated scheduling for us, adjusting to seasonality. So I think that's the point Laura was making is that we've really pulled down capacity in January because the demand is lower. And we are  purposely bringing it back in a more flexible way mid February, when we think demand will pick up seasonally. We've never done that before. So that's that. And then underneath that, we basically have the same staff in place in a fixed way on the ground to a lesser degree in the air, whether we have a reduced schedule in January or whether we have a full schedule in March. So we have not quite cracked that nut on how we make our cost structure a little bit more flexible, although we're determined to do that. So I don't think neither one of us is prepared to describe today what we're going to do or what our ideas are and none of it will necessary come easy. But that's the challenge and we'll just repeat, like what I said at the beginning, I think our people are more than up to that challenge. But our focus right now has been improving the customer experience and transforming Southwest's capabilities, and we are performing exceptionally well there. And we don't turn our sights on and 2010 is getting our productivity enhanced even further. If you look at our employees per aircraft, it improved yet again in 2009. So we're making progress. We just need to make more rapid progress. And I think just finally, one of the things that we're faced with here on the airports, Laura, she pieced that one out, our airport costs are going up for two reasons: One is the nominal costs are going up, which is painful and another cell. But secondly, the overall activity in the industry is going down and I know you understand all that. But that's one of our bigger cost issues in 2010 and what I describe won't address that. So we're going to have to find offsets to that very significant cost pressure that we're incurring at this point."

We've been -- especially in 2008 with the obvious pressure that we've had in energy costs that we had a number of aggressive fare increases that year. And it worked very well until we slammed into November, really in the fourth quarter of '08. Even in 2009, our normal mantra is it's really hard to price yourself out of a recession. But even in 2009, we've had a series of -- they've been broad but very tactical, I think very wise efforts to increase fares. I think a fair evaluation of the success of those that most of those worked well. Obviously, the first fare increase has a better chance of driving revenue than the last one, because they sort of compound. But now, we're in a mode where -- again, back to the comment i made earlier, we must adjust as an industry and as an airline to higher operating costs. We're doing that as aggressively as we dare. And the results of all of our various actions over the last couple of years, I'm very pleased with. I think the evidence is very strong that our folks are doing a great job there. We'll continue to look for fare increase opportunities, because we're not hitting our profit targets yet. And we are expecting to have cost hurdles to overcome. So we're trying to do that in a way that we maintain our Low Fare Brand. And I think again, that's one of the reasons why the Bags Fly Free has become such a meaningful weapon in our arsenal. It's just another way for us to demonstrate to customers that we do stand for overall low fares, and it's something that our competitors can't match. And at the same time, we can keep the rest of our fare structure relatively low, even though we will be increasing it overtime. On the New York question, no share shift that's visible to us at all from ice-led sales [ph]. I don't see there's any cannibalization there at all. The LaGuardia operation for Southwest is quite small, it's eight round trips. The on-time performance with those flights has been slightly below average but certainly nothing that we have been concerned about. Obviously, we're doing our best to make sure that if there are some operational integrity issues there that we don't affect the rest of the system. And again, we have the best on-time performance year in 2009 that we've had in many years even with the additions of some challenging places like that. The business for us in New York LaGuardia has been spectacular. It's been a huge contributor right off the bat. I don't think any of us are shocked at that because we did have a very conservative schedule. We have far more demand for Southwest into New York than what we can satisfy with eight flights. And the revenue performance certainly provides evidence to that."

And that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to win more customers and we would love to sell them more stuff. So we've got all that work underway as well.

And I don't think it's a leap at all to believe that what we have teed up for 2010 and 2011 will easily fill out the $1.5 billion. I think the only other point that I would make is that we all recognize that our target is now more than $1.5 billion. And we know that and of course, you all should know that. But again, Dan, I think the things that are in front of us, our international approach here, which should provide a very meaningful contribution. It's a no-brainer that it will add revenue.

And then secondly, it is our next-generation Rapid Rewards program, it is very straightforward.

And again, in addition to all the things that we've added like EarlyBird, we're just getting more customers and they're more leisure customers. The domestic market isn't growing in the U.S. but Southwest is growing even without adding capacity.

Thanks everyone for joining us this morning. We are delighted with our first quarter results. We had net income excluding special items of $24 million or $0.03 a share which was in line with our analyst estimates. With very high energy prices and weak demand quarter seasonally, it's just very tough to make a profit in the first quarter or so, just to have a profit I think is a very significant accomplishment.
I've already been asked to today how did our people do it. I think its very straight forward. We did it with industry leading low cost. We've done it with industry leading revenue performances and then finally with our great people. We have another outstanding quarter in terms of our customer service performance, another quarter of excellent operations and I'm very, very proud of our people.
It's been a significant transformation effort for them, a lot of change to manage and so again to have these kinds of results is just a huge tribute to our people. We have continued to aggressively turn our revenues with revenue management techniques, changes to our fair structure and also with our network planning that had a very nice benefit in the first quarter and course that will continue indefinitely.
Capacity was down 6.4% in the first quarter, and as a consequence our load factor was up. We had a record 75.9% first quarter load factor that was up six points, but also bucking the normal trend, our yields were also and normally when we see traffic rise and load factors arrives if that the expense of yields. Our yields were up 9.1%, which again is really helping to drive our revenue performance, just outstanding all the way around.
We set a number of records. We had an all time record quarterly unit revenue performance. If you look back compared to 2007, our unit revenues are up over 25%, and of course 19.3% just compared to the last year's recessionary performance. Second quarter that's far the trends are strengthening still; we have very strong bookings in place for April, May, June.
We are looking forward to opening up Panama City in May and I've been especially pleased with the strength of the bookings in that market because we just don't have any history because there is little air service in Panama City. We have a very unique partnership St. Joe Company.
It's just again a testament to the strong Southwest network and also the brand that we enjoy. The other real highlight I think to report on, and the real star in the quarter was Denver. We thanked our people there. Over and over, our Denver performance is pretty incredible. Our RASM was up in that market over 20%.
Our traffic is up over 20% and we're adding capacity at the same time. So just one example of how we are driving revenues at Southwest, but with that very quick overview and my thanks again to all of our people and all the great work they have done, Laura Wright, our Chief Financial Officer is going to take us through the details of the quarter.

To begin with I'd like to echo Gary's comments and state that we are really pleased to report a first quarter profit. Our first quarter GAAP net income was $11 million or a penny per diluted share excluding special and non-GAAP charges totally a net of $13 million relating to mark-to-market and other items associated with FAS 133.
Our first quarter net income was $24 million or $0.03 per diluted share. That compares to a net loss of $20 million or $0.03 loss per diluted share in first quarter of '09 and these group results were in line with Wall Street main estimate at $0.03. Our improved first quarter results were driven by remarkably strong revenue performance.
Our passenger revenues were up over $240 million or 10.8%, and our other revenues were up $30 million or 40% despite capacity reduction of 6.4% during the quarter. Air traffic continued to grow again this quarter by 1.6% again despite of 6.4% reduction capacity. We continued to believe we are gaining market share with our steadfast commitment to our Bags Fly Free campaign and overall finance still primarily on the leisure side remained strong as evidenced by our record monthly load factors in each month of the quarter.
Our passenger revenue yields turned positive on a year-over-year basis during the quarter for the first time since January of 2009 resulting in a 9.1% increase compared to the first quarter of last year. This yield improvement strengthened throughout the quarter with January essentially flat, February up 9% to 10% and March yields up 16% to 17%.
As a result of the year-over-year important in both our load factor and our passenger yields, which is a combination we really like and we had an 18.4% year-over-year improvement in our first quarter passenger unit revenues. As reported in our monthly traffic releases, the year-over-year improvements in our passenger unit revenues also improved throughout the quarter.
We began to see some signs of improvement in our business demand in March. Our full fare mix in the first quarter was 20% up slightly from the first quarter of last year and up two points from the fourth quarter of 2009. However, for the month of March our full fare mix was up 3% versus March of '09. although our year-over-year comparisons became easier starting in February, the mix improvement particularly in our short-haul markets indicate were beginning to see some recovery in business travel demand.
Despite this increase in trends, we have not recovered the previous estimated levels that we saw pre-2009 that none the less, the trends are perfectly moving in the right direction. Demand for our Business Select product was strong in the quarter. Our Business Select revenue was $21 million. That's up from $18 million in both the first and fourth quarters of last year and we carried 15% more Business Select passengers in the first quarter of this year.
Our Wright amendment revenues were $47 million in the first quarter of 2010, a nice improvement from the $38 million from a year ago period and we again we continue to see significant benefit from our capacity test our network realignment and our revenue management effort, which combines contributed 100s of millions in revenues in the first quarter.
Overall, we're very encouraged by the recent passenger revenue trend, and so the first half of April, our month-to-date passenger RASM is estimated to have increased in the 19% range compared to the same period for April of last year. And as Gary noted, our bookings thus far for May and June also look strong.
Based on our revenue and bookings trend thus far, we're currently expecting another significant year-over-year improvement in our second quarter passenger unit revenues. Our freight revenues were in line with the first quarter of last year as a reduction in our capacity was offset by higher average rate.
Our other revenues increased 40% from the first quarter of last year's to $105 million, and that was primarily due to new revenue and this was never launched in the summer and fall of 2009. Our Early Bird revenues were approximately $17 million for the first quarter, that's up from $13 million in the fourth quarter of last year and we generated about $10 million in revenues on our pet carrier on the Company's minor service charge and access heavy bag in the fourth quarter combined.
We expect the similar year-over-year performance in our freight and other revenues in the second quarter as experienced in the first quarter. Turning to our cost performance, our first quarter operating expenses excluding special items increased 8.7% compared to the first quarter of last year due to largely to higher energy prices.
Our economic fuel cost including fuel taxes increased 33% to $2.34 per gallon in the first quarter, which was in line with what we anticipated. Based on the current forward curve, our crude prices are expected to increase with the back at this year forecasted close to $90 a barrel and heading at those levels are higher beyond 2010.
With the goal to minimize the impact of volatile energy prices, we continue to aggressively manage our fuel hedge portfolio using a combination of caller, call options and call spread. We provided our hedge positions for the remainder of 2010 including the second quarter in our press release this morning that to break that down at this further for the second quarter were effectively 44% hedged at prices settling up to $100 per barrel.
We are also about 17% hedged in the second quarter if price is settled in the $100 to $120 per barrel and about 35% hedge if price above $120 per barrel. Premium cost associated with our second quarter fuel hedge which are recorded below the line and other gains and losses are estimated to be in the $30 million range. For the second half of this year, we are approximately 75% hedge and crude prices up to $100 per barrel. The coverage dropped to 50% and prices settled in the $100 to $120 per barrel range and it increases to 75% to prices averaged above $120 per barrel.
Our premium cost for the second half of this year are estimated to be up about $70 million. Based on the April 20th market price which was around $85 a barrel for the second quarter, we estimate that our second quarter 2010 fuel cost including taxes, but excluding premiums will be in the $2.40 and $2.45 per gallon range.
This estimate includes a $0.04 per gallon hedge penalty. To provide you with some sensitivity with respect to our second quarter 2010 fuel hedge position and the corresponding fuel cost per gallon, at second quarter prices dropped from current levels in average $75 a barrel for the quarter, our estimated hedging penalty increases to $0.17 per gallon. However, second quarter average prices rise from current levels and average around $95 per barrel for the quarter. We would expect to have $0.07 per gallon hedging gain.
With respect to our fuel hedging strategy, we have not changed our fundamental philosophy that we must protect the enterprise against catastrophic energy prices. And as opportunities unfold in this market that will allow us to layer in protection in a cost effective, we are well placed to react.
Looking at the full-year of 2010, the volatility that we are experiencing is quite difficult to provide revised full-year guidance. However, based on the current forward prices, and our current hedge portfolio, our best estimate at 2010 fuel price and the $2.45 per gallon range and that's equates to about $0.06 per gallon, penalty of the current market prices for full-year 2010.
As of two days ago, the total net liability of our concurrent fuel hedge portfolio was about $260 million. Turning to non-fuel cost, our first quarter operating expenses excluding fuel in special items increased to 2.7% compared to the first quarter of 2009 or 9.8% on a unit basis driven primarily by the 6.4% year-over-year reduction in our capacity.
Increased profit sharing and revenue-related charges, which are primarily charged from discounts accounted for approximately one point of the 9.8% CASM ex-fuel increase. Weather cancellations accounted for 1 to 2 points of a 8.9% year-over-year non-fuel cost unit cost increase and if you exclude the weather impact, our non-fuel unit cost performance was slightly better than we expected, primarily due to lower than expected maintenance expense.
However, continued inflationary cost pressure most notably in our airport cost, non-labor or cost to strengthen our efforts to maximize our productivity gains. Based on these existing cost pressures, we currently expect our second quarter 2010 unit cost excluding fuel-related taxes to significantly increase from second quarter 2009's $0.0691, but to decline from the first quarter 2010's $0.0776.
For full-year 2010, our year-over-year unit cost pressure should ease somewhat in the back half of the year compared to the first half as a result of very modest capacity additions in the third and fourth quarter. With respect to airport costs, our first quarter landing fees and other rental unit cost increased 21.7% year-over-year to $0.0084, primarily due to airport rate increases and fewer favorable airport audit adjustments this year.
Based on the continued rate inflation at various airports, we expect our second quarter 2010 airport unit cost to increase from second quarter 2009's $0.070 that declined slightly from our first quarter 2010's $0.0084. Our first quarter salaries, wages and benefits increased 10.4% to $0.0382 over the first quarter of last year.
Higher wage rates in capacity reduction significantly contributed to the fourth quarter year-over-year increase. The weather disruptions related cancellations also increased our salaries, wages and benefits starting the quarter. During the second quarter of 2010, we currently expect a similar year-over-year increase from second quarter 2009 to $0.0338.
Our maintenance unit costs came in better than expected at $0.73, a decrease of 3.9% from the first quarter of last year, primarily due to fewer than expected airplane events and lower engine expense with less flying due to the weather cancellation. We currently expect our second quarter 2010 maintenance unit costs to be in line with second quarter 2009's, $0.0074.
Our first quarter other operating expenses for ASM increased 9.6% year-over-year to $0.0148, primarily due to reduced capacity and an increased in our revenue-related cost. We expect a similar year-over-year increase in second quarter 2010 better operating expense and the cost.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $2.8 billion in unrestricted cash in short-term investment and we currently have core unrestricted cash in short-term investments of approximately $3 billion and our $600 million credit facility remains fully and done and available.
Our leverage including aircraft leases is in the low 40% range. Starting the quarter, we generated $373 million of cash flow from operations with first quarter capital expenditure of $139 million. For the full-year 2010, we continue to expect our capital spending to be in the $600 million, $700 million range.
With respect to our fleet, we ended the first quarter with 541 aircraft. During the quarter, we received three new airplanes from Boeing and we returned one as 737-300 on lease. Our fleeting capacity plans are unchanged with our full-year available mile capacity. We expected to be roughly flat with 2009 and as I mentioned earlier our year-over-year capacity declines awaited the first of the year with our largest quarterly capacity decline behind us in the first quarter.
For the second quarter, we expect our available seat mile capacity to be relatively flat or slightly better from last year's second quarter and our third and fourth quarters would both be up in the 2% to 3% range. We included an update in Boeing delivery schedule in the accompanying tables to the press release that was issued this morning and Robert with that Gary and I are now ready to take questions.

There is nothing new Hunter in that view. I think that's always been our view and we have acquired two airlines in our history.

So that's not new news. With the work that was spooled back up in the fall we jointly agreed with our two co-chair partners how we would approach that in terms of a work effort and timelines and deliverables in 2010. So with that revised work plan that was developed last year we're on track on that. The work that we have in front of us was intended to serve both countries, both Canada and Mexico. So I think in that respect in other words, our work continues uninterrupted by the termination with Canada.
The other thing to mention is that it's always been our desire to have a limited number of co-chair partners and part of it is more tactical in terms of where we go internationally with co-chair partners than strategic. So the point being that we felt like two partners was the right number to try to manage simultaneously.
Right now we're down to one and I think we're happy with that. If we can find another co-chair partner to an attractive market that fits in with our work plan over the next 12 to 24 months I think we would be open to that. But it's not anything that we're actively pursuing at this point. I think we're happy to concentrate on Mexico and Volaris, who is a terrific partner to work with thus far.

Good afternoon. Gary, I'm wondering if we can think about something. One of your low-cost competitors has started breaking out fuel costs from the ticket price, sort of in effect creating a full surcharge concept for domestic tickets and it seems to me that could be a powerful tool for Southwest, given how low your ex-fuel unit costs are. But it's also got an unbundling aspect to it, which I sense you think is not a good thing. So how do we think about the idea of offering a lower fare, plus a fuel cost? Is that ever a good idea? How do you think about that kind of idea?

But passing on some of the, whether its easy or hard for us to do those kinds of things, one of the things that I'm concerned about as we evolve the Southwest Airlines brand here is complexity and we want to be transparent with our customers. We want them to be able to trust the Southwest brand, to be able to count on Southwest to deliver on promises and it just seems to me that the more you break that down, the more complex you make it and the more apt you are to surprise customers.
Nobody likes to show-up and at the last minute be stuck with an additional charge. But you asked a good question and it's something that I think we could probably give a little bit more thought to but I would admit to you, it's nothing that we have considered doing. I think Laura wants to comment.

Answering your question all assumes that we publish it and market it in a way that meets the DOT rules which at least one of our competitors right now, there are lines and lines and lines of small print that are required in order to comply with the adequate representation of the fares.

So that's where my mind goes when you ask that question.
We want to - we are in a mode where we want to win more customers and fortunately we're delivering against that very powerful goal. We've seen a very significant shift to Southwest Airlines over the last 24 months, probably for a variety of reasons but we feel like we're really delivering against that.
Within that, I think competitively, what would keep me up at night is we don't want to lose our competitive advantage with customers. We don't want to lose the low fare position in their mind. We don't want to lose our operational excellence and lose bags and be late. So, we really focus on the fundamentals at Southwest.
Alternatively, while we want to continue to invest in the customer experience, I consider that to be investing in the basics. So I don't think you're going to see us chase the last customer by spending money foolishly to add frills and amenities that most customers just don't appreciate.
So, I don't think that takes us to an extreme. All that said, you've got to have good people who care about each other and who care about serving customers. So to maintain our competitive advantage I think more than anything we've just got to maintain our very strong culture.

We haven't met our return on capital in a decade and that's just not acceptable to us. So I think we all know why and we all know what the history has been but we are working as fast as we can to restore those proper margins.
As you know, it's not like throwing darts and we're going to make judgments about our outlook, about the future. It's hard to predict when a volcano is going to erupt and fortunately that doesn't affect Southwest Airlines but it is a very tough business and we won't get it perfect.
But I mentioned that in light of not really providing an excuse but just also factoring in that we're going to need to be - we're going to need to err on the side of caution here unless we have a really compelling opportunity back to Hunter's question and until we're comfortable that we're getting our profit targets it makes no sense to grow the fleet.
Now I don't want you to take that too literally. We may add five airplanes next year. But in terms of getting back to annual growth of 20 units a year, I just don't see that that is in the cards for us unless we're hitting our returns. We do have a belief though. We're going to be in 69 destinations next month with Panama City and we believe we can do a lot more than that and we're retooling Southwest so that international destinations ultimately simply become a tactical decision instead of a strategy and we'll get there at some point.
But we do want to grow and I think we've got some very powerful evidence, especially over the last year that adding new cities actually helps our unit revenue production. So again you're seeing record revenue numbers, fourth quarter, first quarter with four brand new cities but we're able to do that of course by culling less effective markets in lieu of these markets. So yes we want to grow and we're hopeful that we can but we're not going to do it if we're not hitting our profit target.

There's just so many variables at play here. If we can sustain something close to 20% for a while, I am very, very pleased with that. And of course it encourages us to take a few risks and try some new things which is where new learnings come along and one can afford to do that.
So we're doing a lot as you know with the schedule and with revenue management. Some of those things may not work from time to time and sometimes it takes us a while to evaluate that but long story short, I think that the point I was trying to make with my opening remarks Jamie is that as best we can distil a variety of questions about trends, we think that our trends in the second quarter look stronger than the trends that we have behind us in the first quarter and exactly how the arithmetic works out eventually, obviously what remains to be seen.

You have a very efficient airline. You have very productive employees turning out outstanding operations. So when you look across that spectrum, there is just not a lot broken. Our employees do enjoy very good compensation packages but they've earned them and so as we go forward we're going to be looking for continuous improvement to eliminate waste and to eliminate inefficiencies. You see that every single quarter.
So, our headcount for aircraft was down yet again in the first quarter. So I think ones expectations needs to be realistic and I think you should expect that we're going to work very hard to continue to keep our costs under control. But I don't see the same kind of upside potential there that we, as compared to what we have on the revenue side.

First of all we started out Milwaukee I think with a dozen daily departures and we intend that we're going to sit there for a little while and certainly that's my feeling today. We don't have any plans at least I'm ready to share that we want to grow at Milwaukee from where we are.
Now Denver has been entirely different. It's been a very high growth market. We anticipated that it would be, although it's far exceeded our expectations and I think we're in great shape in terms of the ground facilities in Denver. If need be, there is, at least in the footprint of the airport, there is the ability to build out more space at terminal C which is the one that we operate in. But I think we're up to 15 gates there. We'll be at 144 daily departures in August and I think all that works just fine.
So long story short, not concerned about facilities there. We were facilities constrained in Philadelphia for a long. We have addressed that, feel real good about that but at least in the near term the focus area for us in that respect is Denver. We have got some growth opportunities in St Louis; we have got plenty of facilities there to expand.
So for a change we don't have facility constraints is the issue for Southwest. In most places it's really the opposite whether it's plenty of facilities available.

I hope that our network planners are been too conservative there but we don't know. American was carrying a tremendous amount of flow traffic through St Louis. So, it's not a one to one ratio here in other words, if they drop one flight it's not worth one flights worth of additions to us because we are obviously interested in local traffic.
But nonetheless, we have seen very strong share shifts; we have seen a strong RASM performance. We have got some needs to add some new non-stops for us out of St Louis and all of that is out there and published and it's definitely a good growth story for us.

Opening up Panama City for an airline would be significant risk. Now that we have - so we mitigated that with our relationship with the St. Joe Company. So we are very, very excited about this opportunity. We think it's going to do very well. We think we will do well, we think we can do good for the community. One of the problems we are trying to provide air service to the Panhandle or Northwest Florida is that actually there is a handful of airports.
Now we are not going to compete against Tampa. So, that part of your question I think you can easily eliminate that we won't. Its 100s of miles from TAMP around the cost but you have Mobile, Alabama, Pensacola, Florida, Fort Walton Beach and then finally Panama City in the east. So, the traffic that does fly is distributed among four airports and what we hope to do obviously is provide superior service now at Panama City.
Brand new airport has virtually no air service today and that was our struggle is how we can get comfortable with no history that we can generate traffic there. But Southwest brand is strong, our network is strong. We have got four non-stop markets with two daily departures each. The bookings look very, very good, It implies that we will have very solid load factors once we get up and running and I have told everyone at Southwest I am just stunned because there was just now way to know but it looks like its going to be a great success and we are very anxious to get started and as you it will be a brand new airport.
We don't know where the bookings are coming from and my recollection is from Dave"" Ridley, our Senior VP of Marketing that they are about 15 million visitors a year by automobile and so part of the game here is to get them out of their minivans and SVUs on the Southwest flights and we don't need very many of them to fill eight flights up. So, it looks like our strategy is going to work well.

But, you were cutting your capacity in the second half of last year, and I don't know if it was just that or maybe a change in philosophy around revenue management, but you have these big year-to-year load factor increases in the second half of '09. And I wonder as you think about the second half of this year comping against those big year to year increases in load, will it be more difficult to push yield only? Or how should we think about that dynamic in terms of RASM growth as we comp against those big load factor increases last year?

So we want to keep our revenues gains that we have earned that we have worked really hard to get it to this point. That gains if you fast forward to 2011 what kind of gain should we expect there. I don't think we can answer that question yet. Now our goal is to continue to grind out some gains it will be harder to accomplish a six point load factor increase in the first quarter of 2011.
So I think we can concede all of that, so we will need to look to some other tools revenue management is far from done and they will continue to do some aggressive pruning with their techniques and they have got an entire system of replacement effort that is our plan for the next couple of years.
The other big thing of course is coming is a rapid reward system replacement and we really believe that, that's going to bring with it a significant revenue contribution that we are not currently getting. So, I think the mechanical answer to your question is we will continue to look for new sources of revenue along the way and those I think can be most readily identified from our frequent flyer program and Southwest.com techniques and then we are going to want to continue to perfect and the grow the things that we have already introduced. So, a quick example business select, its doing $80 million, $90 million a year we think here in 2010. Early bird like amount, they are brand new products.
The awareness among our customers is amazingly low. So its sort of begs the question of what is the potential of those kinds of products. Again you go back to our marketing challenge. We have a number of virtues that we would love to sell to our customers and we have the great position of having a strong with which ones do we sell. So, banks by free has worked famously now for us and but again well that has been somewhat at the expense of trying to push some of the other features that we really want to push but a good question, I don't think we have unlimited potential with their load factor. On the other hand I don't think we are done and we will certainly as a goal desire to boast our loads again next year but it will be a combination of basic things, load factors, revenue management techniques, some modest fare increases and we will continue to pursue the introduction of new product. So, three things.

Thanks, everyone for joining us this morning. We are delighted with our first quarter results. We had net income, excluding special items, of $24 million or $0.03 a share, which was in line with analyst estimates. With very high energy prices and a weak demand quarter seasonally, it's just very tough to make a profit in the first quarter. So just to have a profit, I think, is a very significant accomplishment. 
I've already been asked to today, well, how did our people do it? I think it's very straightforward. We did it with industry-leading low costs. We've done it with industry-leading revenue performances and then finally, with our great people. We had another outstanding quarter in terms of our customer service performance, another quarter of excellent operations, and I'm very, very proud of our people. It's been a significant transformation effort for them, a lot of change to manage. And so again, to have these kinds of results is just a huge tribute to our people. 
We have continued to aggressively tune our revenues with revenue management techniques, changes to our fare structure and also with our network planning. That had a very nice benefit in the first quarter, and of course, that will continue indefinitely. Capacity was down 6.4% in the first quarter, and as a consequence, our load factor was up. We had a record 75.9% first quarter load factor that was up six points but also, bucking the normal trend, our yields were also up. Normally, when we see traffic rise and load factors rise, it's at the expense of yield. Our yields were up 9.1%, which again, is really helping to drive our revenue performance, just outstanding all the way around. 
We set a number of records. We had an all-time record quarterly unit revenue performance. If you look back compared to 2007, our unit revenues are up over 25% and of course, 19.3% just compared to last year's recessionary performance. Second quarter, thus far, the trends are strengthening still. We have very strong bookings in place for April, May, June. We are looking forward to opening up Panama City in May. And I've been especially pleased with the strength of the bookings in that market because we just don't have any history. There's very little air service in Panama City. We have a very unique partnership with the St. Joe Company. It's just, again, a testament to the strong Southwest network and also the brand that we enjoy. 
The other real highlight, I think, to report on and a real star in the quarter was Denver. We thanked our people there over and over. Our Denver performance is pretty incredible. Our RASM was up in that market over 20%. Our traffic is up over 20%, and we're adding capacity at the same time. So just one example of how we're driving revenues in Southwest. But with that very quick overview and my thanks again to all of our people and all the great work that they've done, Laura Wright, our Chief Financial Officer, is going to take us through the details of the quarter."
31726,84500217,57559,"Southwest Airlines Co., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-22-2010",2010-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Southwest Airlines Co.","Executives","Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. To begin with, I'd like to echo Gary's comments and state that we're really pleased to report a first quarter profit. Our first quarter GAAP net income was $11 million or $0.01 per diluted share. Excluding spec",1982,"Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. To begin with, I'd like to echo Gary's comments and state that we're really pleased to report a first quarter profit. Our first quarter GAAP net income was $11 million or $0.01 per diluted share. Excluding special non-cash charges totaling a net of $13 million relating to mark-to-market and other items associated with FAS 133, our first quarter net income was $24 million or $0.03 per diluted share. That compares to a net loss of $20 million or $0.03 loss per diluted share in first quarter of '09, and these results were in line with Wall Street's mean estimate of $0.03. 
Our improved first quarter results were driven by remarkably strong revenue performance. Our passenger revenues were up over $240 million or 10.8%, and our other revenues were up $30 million or 40% despite capacity reduction of 6.4% during the quarter. Our traffic continued to grow again this quarter by 1.6%, again, despite a 6.4% reduction in capacity. We continue to believe we're gaining market share with our steadfast commitment to our Bags Fly Free campaign, and overall demand, still primarily on the leisure side, remains strong as evidenced by our record monthly load factors in each month of the quarter. 
Our passenger revenue yields turned positive on a year-over-year basis during the quarter for the first time since January of 2009, resulting in a 9.1% increase compared to the first quarter of last year. This yield improvement strengthened throughout the quarter, with January essentially flat, February up 9% to 10% and March yields up 16% to 17%. As a result of the year-over-year improvement in both our load factor and our passenger yields, which is a combination we really like, we had an 18.4% year-over-year improvement in our first quarter passenger unit revenues. As reported in our monthly traffic releases, the year-over-year improvements in our passenger unit revenues also improved throughout the quarter. 
We began to see some signs of improvement in our business demand in March. Our full-fare mix in the first quarter was 20%, up slightly from the first quarter of last year and up two points from the fourth quarter of 2009. However, for the month of March, our full-fare mix was up 3% versus March of '09. Although our year-over-year comparisons became easier starting in February, the mix improvement, particularly in our short-haul markets, indicates we're beginning to see some recovery in business travel demand. Despite these encouraging trends, we have not recovered to the pre-recessionary levels that we saw pre-2009, but nonetheless, the trends appear to be moving in the right direction. 
Demand for our Business Select product was strong in the quarter. Our Business Select revenue was $21 million. That's up from $18 million in both the first and fourth quarters of last year, and we carried 15% more Business Select passengers in the first quarter of this year. Our Wright Amendment revenues were $47 million in the first quarter of 2010, a nice improvement from the $38 million from a year-ago period. And again, we continue to see significant benefit from our capacity cuts, our network realignment and our revenue management efforts, which combined, contributed hundreds of millions in revenues in the first quarter. 
Overall, we're very encouraged by the recent passenger revenue trend. And for the first half of April, our month-to-date passenger RASM is estimated to have increased in the 19% range compared to the same period for April of last year. And as Gary noted, our bookings, thus far, for May and June also look strong. Based on our revenue and booking trends thus far, we're currently expecting another significant year-over-year improvement in our second quarter passenger unit revenues. 
Our freight revenues were in line with the first quarter of last year as a reduction in our capacity was offset by higher average rates. Our other revenues increased 40% from the first quarter of last year to $105 million, and that was primarily due to new revenue initiatives that were launched in the summer and fall of 2009. Our EarlyBird revenues were approximately $17 million for the first quarter. That's up from $13 million in the fourth quarter of last year, and we generated about $10 million in revenues on our Pet Fare, Unaccompanied Minors service charge and excess heavy bags in the first quarter combined. We expect a similar year-over-year performance in our freight and other revenues in the second quarter as experienced in the first quarter. 
Turning to our cost performance, our first quarter operating expenses, excluding special items, increased 8.7% compared to the first quarter of last year due largely to higher energy prices. Our economic fuel costs, including fuel taxes, increased 33% to $2.34 per gallon in the first quarter, which was in line with what we anticipated. Based on the current forward curve, crude prices are expected to increase with the back of this year forecasted close to $90 a barrel and hovering at those levels or higher beyond 2010. 
With the goal to minimize the impact of volatile energy prices, we continue to aggressively manage our fuel hedge portfolio using a combination of caller, call options and cost spread. We provided our hedge positions for the remainder of 2010, including the second quarter, in our press release this morning but to break that down a bit further, for the second quarter, we're effectively 44% hedged at prices settling up to $100 per barrel. We're also about 17% hedged in the second quarter if prices settle in the $100 to $120 per barrel range and about 35% hedged if prices settle above $120 per barrel. 
Premium costs associated with our second quarter fuel hedge, which are recorded below the line in other gains and losses, are estimated to be in the $30 million range. For the second half of this year, we're approximately 75% hedged at crude prices up to $100 per barrel. That coverage drops to 50% if prices settle in the $100 to $120 per barrel range, and it increases to 75% if prices average above $120 per barrel. Our premium costs for the second half of this year are estimated to be up about $70 million. 
Based on the April 20 market price, which was around $85 a barrel for the second quarter, we estimate that our second quarter 2010 fuel costs, including taxes but excluding premiums, will be in the $2.40 to $2.45 per gallon range. This estimate includes a $0.04 per gallon hedge penalty. 
To provide you with some sensitivity with respect to our second quarter 2010 fuel hedge position and the corresponding fuel cost per gallon, if second quarter prices drop from current levels and average $75 a barrel for the quarter, our estimated hedging penalty increases to $0.17 per gallon. However, if second quarter average prices rise from current levels and average around $95 per barrel for the quarter, we would expect to have a $0.07 per gallon hedging gain. 
With respect to our fuel hedging strategy, we have not changed our fundamental philosophy that we must protect the enterprise against catastrophic energy prices. And as opportunities unfold in this market that allow us to layer in protection in a cost-effective manner, we are well placed to react. 
Looking at the full year of 2010, the volatility that we're experiencing makes it quite difficult to provide precise fuel full year guidance. However, based on the current forward prices and our current hedge portfolio, our best estimate is at 2010, fuel price in the $2.45 per gallon range. And that equates to about a $0.06 per gallon penalty above current market prices for full year 2010. As of two days ago, the total net liability of our current fuel hedge portfolio was about $260 million. 
Turning to non-fuel costs, our first quarter operating expenses, excluding fuel and special items, increased 2.7% compared to the first quarter of 2009 on 9.8% on a unit basis, driven primarily by the 6.4% year-over-year reduction in our capacity. Increased profit sharing and revenue-related charges, which are primarily charged off [ph] (24:41) discounts accounted for approximately one point of the 9.8% CASM x fuel increase. Weather cancellations accounted for 1 to 2 points of the 9.8% year-over-year non-fuel unit cost increase, and if you exclude the weather impact, our non-fuel unit cost performance was slightly better than we expected, primarily due to lower-than-expected maintenance expense. 
However, continued inflationary cost pressures, most notably in our airport costs and our labor costs or costs to strengthen our efforts to maximize our productivity gains, based on these existing cost pressures, we currently expect our second quarter 2010 unit costs, excluding fuel-related taxes, to significantly increase from second quarter 2009's $6.91 but to decline from the first quarter of 2010's $7.76. 
For full year 2010, our year-over-year unit cost pressures should ease somewhat in the back half of the year compared to the first half as a result of very modest capacity additions in the third and fourth quarter. With respect to airport costs, our first quarter landing fees and other rental unit costs increased 21.7% year-over-year to $0.84, primarily due to airport rate increases and fewer favorable airport audit adjustments this year. Based on the continued rate inflation at various airports, we expect our second quarter 2010 airport unit costs to increase from second quarter 2009's $0.70 but to decline slightly from our first quarter 2010's $0.84. 
Our first quarter salaries, wages and benefits increased 10.4% to $3.82 over the first quarter of last year. Higher wage rates and capacity reductions significantly contributed to the first quarter year-over-year increase. The weather disruptions and related cancellations also increased our salaries, wages and benefits during the quarter. For the second quarter of 2010, we currently expect a similar year-over-year increase from second quarter 2009's $3.38. 
Our maintenance unit costs came in better than expected at $0.73, a decrease of 3.9% from the first quarter of last year, primarily due to fewer-than-expected airframe events and lower engine expense with less flying due to the weather cancellations. We currently expect our second quarter 2010 maintenance unit costs to be in line with second quarter 2009's $0.74. 
Our first quarter other operating expenses per ASM increased 9.6% year-over-year to $1.48, primarily due to reduced capacity and an increase in our revenue-related costs. We expect a similar year-over-year increase in second quarter 2010 other operating expense unit costs. 
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $2.8 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments, and we currently have core unrestricted cash and short-term investments of approximately $3 billion. And our $600 million credit facility remains fully undrawn and available. Our leverage, including aircraft leases, is in the low 40% range. 
During the quarter, we've generated $373 million of cash flow from operations, with first quarter capital expenditures of $139 million. For the full year 2010, we continue to expect our capital spending to be in the $600 million to $700 million range.  With respect to our fleet, we ended the first quarter with 541 aircrafts. During the quarter, we received three new airplanes from Boeing and we returned one 737-300 on lease. Our fleet and capacity plans are unchanged with our full year available seat mile capacity expected to be roughly flat with 2009. And as I mentioned earlier, our year-over-year capacity declines are weighted the first half of the year, with our largest quarterly capacity decline behind us in the first quarter. 
For the second quarter, we expect our available seat mile capacity to be relatively flat or slightly down from last year's second quarter, and our third and fourth quarters will both be up in the 2% to 3% range. We've included an updated Boeing delivery schedule in the accompanying tables to the press release that was issued this morning. And Robert, with that, Gary and I are now ready to take questions."

But we have, I think, very solid principles that we think about in terms of our strategy and our vision of what we want to be, really the best at Southwest Airlines. So that's where my mind goes when you ask that question. We are in a mode where we want to win more customers. And fortunately, we're delivering against that very powerful goal. We've seen a very significant shift to Southwest Airlines over the last 24 months, probably for a variety of reasons, but we feel like we're really delivering against that. Within that, I think, competitively, what would keep me up at night is we don't want to lose our competitive advantage with customers. We don't want to lose the low fare position in their mind. We don't want to lose our operational excellence and lose bags and be late. So we really focus on the fundamentals at Southwest. Alternatively, why we want to continue to invest in the customer experience, I consider that to be investing in the basics. So I don't think you're going to see us chase the last customer by spending money foolishly to add frills and amenities that most customers just don't appreciate. So I don't think that takes us to an extreme. All that says, you got to have good people who care about each other and who care about serving customers. So to maintain our competitive advantage, I think more than anything, we've just got to maintain our very strong culture."

And we're going to make judgments about our outlook and about the future. It's hard to predict when the volcano is going to erupt, and fortunately, that doesn't affect Southwest Airlines. But it is a very tough business, and we won't get it perfect. But I've mentioned that in light of not really providing an excuse, but just also factoring in that we're going to need to err on the side of caution here unless we have a really compelling opportunity back to Hunter's question. And until we're comfortable that we're getting our profit targets, it makes no sense to grow the fleet. Now I don't want you to take that too literally. We may add five airplanes next year. But in terms of getting back to annual growth of 20 units a year, I just don't see that, that is in the cards for us unless we're hitting our returns. We do have a belief, though. We're going to be 69 destinations next month with Panama City, and we believe we can do a lot more than that. And we're retooling Southwest so that international destinations ultimately simply become a tactical decision instead of a strategy, and we'll get there at some point. So we do want to grow, and I think we've got some very powerful evidence, especially over the last year, that adding new cities actually helps our unit revenue production. So again, you're seeing record revenue numbers fourth quarter, first quarter with four brand-new cities. But we're able to do that, of course, by culling less effective markets in lieu of these better markets, though. Yes, we want to grow, and we're hopeful that we can, but we're not going to do it if we're not hitting our profit target."

Is last year's number that we're using as the reference point, is it perfect? Is it right? There's just so many variables at play here. If we can sustain something close to 20% for a while, I'm very, very pleased with that. And of course, it encourages us to take a few risks and try some new things, which is where new learnings come along, and one can afford to do that. So we're doing a lot, as you know, with the schedule and with revenue management. Some of those things may not work from time to time, and sometimes it takes us a while to evaluate that.

We'd anticipated that it would be, although it's far exceeded our expectations, and I think we're in great shape in terms of the ground facilities in Denver. If need be, there is, at least in the footprint of the airport, there's the ability to build out more space in terminal C, which is the one that we operate in. But I think we're up to 15 gates there. We'll be at 144 daily departures in August, and I think all that works just fine. So long story short, not concerned about facilities there. We were facilities-constrained in Philadelphia for a long time, we've addressed that. Feel real good about that, but at least in the near term, the focus area for us in that respect is Denver. We've got some growth opportunities in St. Louis. We've got plenty of facilities there to expand. So for a change, we don't have facility constraints as the issue for Southwest.

We think it's going to do very well, and we think we'll do well. We think we can do good for the community. One of the problems with trying to provide air service to the Panhandle or Northwest Florida is, that actually, there's a handful of airports. Now we're not going to compete against Tampa, so that part of your question, I think, you can easily eliminate, that we won't -- it's hundreds of miles from Tampa around the coast. But you have Mobile, Alabama, Pensacola Florida, Fort Walton Beach and then finally, Panama City in the east. So the traffic that does fly is distributed among four airports. And what we hope to do, obviously, is provide superior service now at Panama City. A brand-new airport has virtually no air service today. And that was our struggle, is how can we get comfortable with no history that we can generate traffic there? But Southwest brand is strong. Our network is strong. We've got four non-stop markets with two daily departures each. The bookings look very, very good. It implies that we'll have very solid load factors once we get up and running. And I've told everyone at Southwest, I'm just stunned because there was just no way to know. But it looks like it's going to be a great success, and we're very anxious to get started. And as you know, it'll be a brand-new airport. We don't know where the bookings are coming from. My recollection is from Dave Ridley, our Senior VP of Marketing, that there are about 15 million visitors a year by automobile. And so part of the game here is to get them out of their minivans and SUVs on the Southwest flights, and we don't need very many of them to fill the eight flights up.

So we want to keep our revenue gains that we've earned, and we worked really hard to get it to this point. The gains, if you fast forward to 2011, what kind of gains should we expect there? I don't think we can answer that question yet. Now our goal is to continue to grind out some gains. It will be harder to accomplish a six-point load factor increase in the first quarter of 2011, so I think we will concede all of that. So we'll need to look to some other tools. Revenue management is far from done, and they'll continue to do some aggressive pruning with their techniques and they've got an entire system of replacement effort that is a plan for the next couple of years. The other big thing, of course, that's coming is a Rapid Rewards system replacement. And we really believe that, that's going to bring with it a significant revenue contribution that we're not currently getting. So I think the mechanical answer to your question is, we'll continue to look for new sources of revenue along the way and those, I think, can be most readily identified from our Frequent Flyer Program and southwest.com techniques. And then we're going to want to continue to perfect and grow the things that we've already introduced. So a quick example, Business Select, it's doing $80 million, $90 million a year, we think, here in 2010. EarlyBird, a like amount, their brand-new products, the awareness among our customers is amazingly low. So it sort of begs the question of what is the potential of those kinds of products? Again, you go back to our marketing challenge. We have a number of virtues that we would love to sell to our customers, and we have the great position of having to struggle with which ones. Which ones do we sell? So Bags Fly Free has worked famously now for us, but again, that's been somewhat at the expense of trying to push some of the other features that we really want to push. But good question, I don't think we have unlimited potential with our load factor. On the other hand, I don't think we're done. And we'll certainly, as a goal, desire to boost our loads again next year. But it'll be a combination of basic things: load factors, revenue management techniques, some modest fare increases, and we'll continue to pursue the introduction of new products, those three things."

We had a very strong performance. We are very pleased with the profit for the quarter x items $216 million, which is $0.29 a share, each of those represents more than a tripling of our year ago results.
Of course, all the credit goes to our people. They've done a marvelous job getting Southwest Airlines to this point. Certainly performed extraordinarily well in the quarter. They've managed a tremendous amount of change, not just over the last couple of years but for the last decade. So, I'm very, very proud of them and very proud of these results. We continued to set a number of company records relating to revenues during the quarter and we placed first in the domestic airline industry in two very important categories.
First of all, revenue growth, revenue growth of 21.1%, is the best in the industry, domestically and, that comes on slightly down capacity growth at Southwest Airlines. And, that means that we also placed first in the domestic industry in terms of year-over-year unit revenue growth, at almost 22%.
Our passenger counts were up, our traffic was up. Very strong yield performance in the quarter, yields were up over 17%, at record low factor of 79.3%, up 2.3 points, compared to 09. And, Laura's going to spend quite a bit of time talking about revenues as well, because it's a revenue story that's what drove our earnings growth and a number of factors are in involved, of course, driving our revenue growth.
All that led to the second best quarterly profit in our history, second only to Q2 of 2006. From this point forward, beginning in the third quarter, our year-over-year comps change a great deal. Last year was significantly off of normal trends based on our current July results. So far, in the bookings, for the rest of the quarter, we don't expect any significant deviation from normal years, seasonal trends, just our continued strong revenue production.
Talking a little bit about Panama City beach, we added to our route system in May, we're off to a great start there. Customers response has been tremendous and, I do want to say that we really appreciate all the support we've gotten from the St. Joe Company but, also the airport and the entire community.
And, again, thanks for helping us to get off to a good start and, hopefully, we're doing a small part to help the community as well. And, I've been there and I can report that the beaches look great, by the way. So, everyone should don their swimsuits and get down there ASAP on a southwest flight. I'll turn it over to Laura to take us through the quarter.

Our second quarter GAAP net income was $112 million or $0.15 per share.

Our second quarter GAAP net income was $112 million or $0.15 per share. Excluding special items totaling a net of $104 million, relating to mark to market and other items associated with FAS 133, our second quarter net income was $216 million or $0.29 per share. A significant improvement over second quarter last year's earnings of $59 million or $0.08 per share.
Our second quarter operating income, excluding special items, was $414 million resulting in an operating margin of 13% and, our pretax income, excluding special items, was $350 million, resulting in a 11% pretax margin. Overall, it was a very strong second quarter performance, the second best in our history and I'd like to congratulate our employees on these results and thank them for their hard work and their outstanding customer service.
The revenue momentum that started in the second half of last year continues into the second quarter producing another record revenue performance. Our passenger revenues increased over $500 million to $3 billion and our other revenues increased nearly 50% or $38 million, compared to last year.
With both record lows and record passenger yields, we also had a record 20.7% year-over-year improvement in our passenger unit revenues, leading the industry in domestic revenue results. More importantly compared to the second quarter of 2008, our unit revenues grew 14%.
Our total revenues of $5.8 billion for the first six months of 2010 represents a revenue increase of over $1 billion from our revenues for the first six months of 2007 while our capacity for the first half of this year is approximately 1% less than the first half of 2007. The plan that we set forth in 2007 to grow our revenues is producing results even despite the still weak economic environment and even with business travel well below pre-downturn levels.
Our revenue strength in the quarter was driven by our revenue initiatives, fewer fare sales and strong overall consumer demand. The yield improvement strengthened throughout the quarter, with April and May up 16% and June up 19%, resulting in an all time record 17.3% growth in RPM yield. Business travel demand continued to strengthen during the quarter and our full fare mix was just under 20%, up almost two points from Q2 of last year and down less than a point from the Q1 of 2010.
The sequential decline of under one point was better than historical sequential trends, suggesting some stabilization in our full fare demand and, in our short haul markets we saw more than a three point year-over-year improvement in our second full fare mix.
We are very encouraged by the improvement in our business trends, but we also recognize business travel has not fully recovered. We had strong demand for our business select products with 24% more business select passengers than a year ago, producing $24 million in incremental revenue, up from $18 million in the second quarter of last year. We also had strong demand for our early bird product, generating $23 million in early bird revenues, compared to $17 million in the first quarter of this year and $13 million in the fourth quarter of 09.
We have not seen any noticeable impact to our business select revenues from the introduction of our early bird product. Our early bird passengers continue to increase as the percentage of total passengers, while our business select passengers are above the early bird introduction levels.
Our right amendment revenues were $55 million in the quarter, compared to $37 million second quarter a year ago and overall, we are very encouraged by our passenger revenue trends. Month to date, our July passenger unit revenues are up in the 17% range from the respective year ago period and bookings, thus far, for August and September also look strong.
Based on revenue and booking trends thus far, we're currently expecting another significant year-over-year improvement in third quarter passenger unit revenues, but at a lower year-over-year rate than experienced in the second quarter. As the current quarter and remainder of the year progress, our year-over-year comparisons become more difficult due to our industry leading improvement and unit revenue trends in the second half of last year.
Our freight revenues increased 13.8%, to $33 million, primarily due to higher average rates and we expect that our second quarter freight revenues will be comparable to the second quarter. Our other revenues increased almost 50% to $119 million, due to our fall 2009 revenue initiatives. As I mentioned earlier, we generated about $23 million in early bird revenues. And, we also generated approximately $13 million in revenues from our PET fares, unaccompanied minor service charges and excess heavy bag fees.
We expect another year-over-year increase in our other revenues in the third quarter but at a much lower rate than experienced in the second quarter due to fewer charters anticipated and also to reaching the anniversary on the introduction of some of our revenue initiatives. As a reminder, in the third quarter of last year, we generated $12 million in revenues from these same revenue initiatives.
Turning to our cost performance, our second quarter operating expenses, excluding special items, increased 13%, which results in the 13% unit cost increase. Although we had non-field cost pressure contributing to our overall unit cost increase, the most significant pressure came from higher fuel costs.
Our economic fuel costs increased 32.4% to $2.37 per gallon, which was slightly better than expected due to lower crude oil prices offset by higher heating oil crack spreads and jet differentials.
Based on the third quarter fuel hedge provided in our press release this morning and the July 26 forward curve, our guidance for the third quarter economic fuel price is in the $2.40 per gallon range. This estimate includes fuel taxes that excludes fuel hedging premiums.
We are currently estimating a slightly higher third quarter fuel price than the second quarter, due to higher jet disk as we move in to the hurricane season and a slightly higher fuel hedge penalty. Our premium costs associated with our third quarter fuel hedge, which are recorded below the line in other gains and losses, are estimated to be in the $36 million range.
And based on market prices, as of July 26 and our hedge for the second half of this year, we're estimating our 2010 economic fuel price, including taxes, will be in the $2.40 per gallon range. We have factored the various price points and percentages of our current hedge position, plus the impact from the hedges that were unwound in 2008, into our fuel price guidance and the sensitivities that we will provide in the form 10-Q. We continue to actively manage our hedge portfolio with the philosophy of protecting the business against catastrophic energy prices.
And we've included our current hedge positions for 2011 and beyond, in this morning's press release. Excluding fuel and special items, our second quarter costs increased 6.4% on a unit basis. Although still up more than we would like, our second quarter nonfuel cost performance was better than anticipated primarily due to the deferral of advertising costs and a refund of excess security fees paid to TSA.
Regarding our advertising spend, we chose to defer about $8 million, originally planned for the second quarter, to later in the year including some to the third quarter. Higher profit sharing and 401-k accounted for approximately three points of the 6.4% chasm ex-fuel increase. We accrued $62 million in profit sharing and $49 million in 401-k, for a total benefit to our employees of $110 million this quarter.
Our revenue related charges, which are primarily charge sell discounts, accounted for another point of the nonfuel chasm increase. Of course, we're always happy to talk about higher profit sharing and revenue related charges. With that being said, we also continue to have inflationary cost pressures, most notably in our airport and labor costs.
Based on these continued cost pressures, we currently expect our third quarter nonfuel unit cost to increase from third quarter 2009, to $0.0711 and we currently expect that increase to be in the 6% range year-over-year, which is similar to what we saw in the second quarter.
Although it's reasonable to expect that our third year-over-year unit cost pressure would ease, due to the modest capacity increase that we have planned for the third quarter, keep in mind that the $18 million security refund and the deferral of the advertising spend benefited our second quarter nonfuel unit costs by about 1.5 points.
For the full year of 2010, we are expecting our unit costs, excluding fuel and special items to increase in the 6% to 7% range, compared to last year. This estimate is higher than the 5% estimate we provided at the beginning of this year and is being driven by increased profit sharing and revenue related expenses.
Before I move onto the balance sheet, I'd like to quickly talk about our labor and airport costs. As expected, our labor costs increased 9.8% on a unit basis versus last year, primarily due to wage rate inflation and profit sharing. And based on current trends, we expect our third quarter labor unit costs to be comparable to second quarter's $0.0371.
With respect to airport costs, our landing fees and other rentals unit costs increased 15.7% year-over-year, primarily due to airport rate increases and fewer favorable airport audit adjustments this year. Based on the continued rate inflation at various airports, we're expecting our third quarter airport unit costs to fall in the mid $0.80 range.
Now, moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We currently have $3.4 billion in core unrestricted cash and short-term investments and our $600 million credit facility remains fully undrawn and available. Our leverage, including aircraft leases, is forecasted to be in the low 40% range by year-end.
We generated about $400 million in free cash flow in the second quarter, with $540 million of cash flow from operations and capital spending of $159 million. Year to date, our cash flow from operations are over $900 million and we generated over $600 million in free cash flow. Based on current trends and projected 2010 capital spending of less than $600 million, we currently expect to generate free cash flow for the year.
We're currently working on our strategic plan for the next decade and capital planning is certainly a significant part of that exercise. We recently updated our fleet plan with Boeing, which I will go over shortly, without any material change to our total future capital spending.
In regards to our fleet and our capacity plans, during the quarter we acquired three 700's from Boeing and we ended the quarter with a fleet of 544 aircraft. We're well underway in evaluating our long-term fleet plans. And, as part of that planning, we've decided to slightly accelerate the retirement of our classic fleet. Accordingly, we worked with Boeing to update our future from orders and options scheduled, with no net change to our fleet plans. We converted six purchase rights to options and exercised 25 options for firm orders from 2011 through 2016. We've included the updated Boeing delivery schedules as an accompanying table to this morning's press release.
We do not intend to significantly grow the fleet until our financial goals are achieved or in sight. Further, we're planning for flat capacity to share. Third quarter, our ASMs will be up about 2.5% year-over-year and in the fourth quarter they're going to be up approximately 4.5% year-over-year. For 2011, we're projecting a modest capacity increase and flat fleet.
And, keep in mind that the modest increase in our 2011 capacity, will be heavier weighted towards first half of the year, as a function of our 2010 flight schedule adjustments. As always, we'll continue to closely monitor demands and remain prepared to adjust our flight schedules accordingly. And Mervin, with that overview, Gary and I are ready to take questions.

You know, we have talked about the sensitivity of your passenger base. Where you would move fares up a few dollars and it was always the proverbial family of four not taking the trip. I then look at this quarter and I see your one-way fares go from $110 or $112 to $132. I mean, these are high by historical levels for Southwest. And then, I look at where the unemployment rate is in the U.S., it's close to a 30 year high at 10%. We know that the consumer is constrained discretionary spending is just - it's tight.
And yet, even then, it's not coming on the business side. I mean you've seen some modest improvement. So, the question is, is it that your network has evolved, your breadth of your network today, you're in a lot of business markets, you're the biggest domestic carrier, plus the fact that you have a more advanced revenue management system. I mean, is it easier today for Southwest to raise fares, or has your passenger base changed? Has their price elasticity of demand come down? I mean, what's - I know this is a very long and winded question here but when I look at these numbers I've never seen fair improvement of this magnitude given a challenging macro-backdrop.

And, you know, Laura referenced in her remarks, the strategy that we put forth in 2007. And, we'll want to summarize this better for the investment community this fall and just show you where we are vis-à-vis that plan but the point is a lot has changed. Now, we have - we have argued and can demonstrate to you, that there is a significant market share shift that's taking place over the last several years. You know that costs are up. We'd already admitted, years ago, we were going to have to find a way to adjust our fare structure upwards to deal with higher costs and we're doing that.
So, I think you've got a combination of shifting out of short haul markets in to longer hall markets, which is helping. You've got the fact that has Southwest offered more choice to people who want more service and are willing to pay for it and Laura pointed out 24% increase in business select as an example. We've seen weeks where it's up 30% and 40%. So, we're finding opportunities to bring new products and services to the market that people will pay us. And, of course, the other material change just over the last 12 months is early bird.
There was concern, when we introduced early bird that it would cannibalize business select and, obviously, Laura is reporting no evidence of that. So, there's a few pieces in there, in terms of just overall fares though, getting to our core fare structure, our revenue management has evolved dramatically in 36 months.
They are much more skilled at setting inventory levels at various prices and not giving away anymore than they have to and so I think there's a significant benefit associated with that. And, then the other thing that you've seen from an overall schedule perspective, if you took 100% of our flights three years ago you trimmed out the flights that weren't very good which is what we've done, and instead you came back with a flight schedule that was more powerful, which is what we done, then that's a way to ring out revenues as well.
So, in the old days Mike, we would have flights at the end of the day that might have 20 people on them. And, you're not getting very good yields on them either. Those days are gone. So now, you have much more condensed flight schedules with much higher load factors, many more itineraries being published, a few more connecting customers on board. So, we've created better demand for our own product in addition to the fact that we're taking share from our competitors.

Our July revenue results are actually exceeding - slightly exceeding what we normally see on the average from month to month.
That's what we are trying to talk about in terms of seasonal trends versus year-over-year trends, that the results we're seeing in July and the bookings that we have thus far for August and September, relative to the nominal results that we had in the Q2 makes sense to us.

It is very normal for us to have a peak in the year in the Q2 and that's what we're expecting this year.
The normally, if you average some of those years that you were describing. I think all we were trying to point in the earnings release is that 2009 is really off, it's off of normal trends, the Q4 was the best quarter of the year. And it's hard to go back in history and find a year like that. Normally, I would say, this is just Gary talking, is we're normally down RASM, Q3 versus Q2, in the 2% to 3% range.
And, some years, June is the best month of the year, some years July is the best month of the year and it's possible that July, I think this is a point Laura is trying to make, is that when we look at the strength of our revenues coming in to the Q3, they are very good. And, in fact, July may very well be the best month this year. September is still September and will not match an April or May. So, that's what you're typically contending with seasonally.

So, I wouldn't read anything in to it other than that's what we've chosen the do in 2010 and 2011. The flat fleet I wouldn't take literally, I'm sure we'll be up a few units or down a few units from time to time. It's just more of the direction that we want you all to know that we don't have plans to materially increase the fleet. In 2011, I don't think we can add anymore new cities other than the two in South Carolina, unless we make a change to our fleet plans.
So I think that answers your question for next year. For 2012, really all we're telling you all at this point about 2012 is that we are not currently committed to any change in the fleet for 2012. On the other hand, we've made no plans for 2012. So, if we are going to add new cities, those are decisions that will be out in front of us. As well as how we fund those new cities in terms of airplanes. So, we're not telling you a prediction, that we will not grow fleet in 2012, it's just at this point our baseline is no change in the fleet. I'd love for us to add a couple of cities in 12. And, we certainly a have long list that we're contemplating and we are working a lot of those opportunities. There's a chicken and egg question here to some degree, but, at least, that'll give you some guidance for the near term which would be a 2011.

So, if you buy my normal trend of Q2 to Q3 is down two, that's a seven point swing, so, that's, that's what I would urge you to look at and think about and of course then, based on that, the July comp to June fits pretty well. So and, again, it's because last year's July was off trend relative to last year's June. It's a comp issue more than it is a seasonality issue. This year June to July is going to be something.

But, first of all, we haven't changed our philosophy of running a strong balance sheet and retaining our investment grade rating. Our leverage is forecast to be back to 40% by the end of year and as you know, we have reduced or capital spending.
So, what we're doing right now is we're exploring all of our options which as you know are limited. We've looked at our fleet plan, we're thinking about protection on fuel prices. Of course, we've got a steady share repurchase, debt retirements, we've got about $400 million. That matures at the end of 2011. And, about $300 million, I think, in first quarter of 2012. We've got to be prepared for opportunities that present themselves, and we're also kind of looking at this financial reform legislation. So, through all that we're working with our board right now.
We haven't made any decisions and what we want to do with the excess cash. As you know, our focus is on maximizing shareholder value. So, I think you can expect us to come back to you at some point in the future with an answer to that question but we have not made a decision yet.

Although, we don't expect that we're going to be there. In terms of how we publish it, it's on our website, in our IR tab. But, our numerator is our non-GAAP operating income, less the gains and losses from the time value of hedges and, then, we also neutralize the P&L impact of leasing aircraft versus purchasing them. And, the denominator is the average of our debt and our equity, net of the balance sheet other comprehensive income and hedging ineffectiveness and net present value of future aircraft grants - but we we'd be happy to. Marcy and Ron would be happy to walk you through those calculations and you can look them up on the web site also.

We think we got the cost structure and the customer experience package and the people to do that. I think consolidation works in our favor in that regard. And it certainly has to this point. I think just the fact that we can demonstrate to you that we're winning customers right now in significant revenue gains as a share of the domestic market, gives us a will the of encouragement going forward.

I think Laura and I have not provided a lot of specific details at this point but more information obviously is coming on that when we get ready to launch that program. But, I think the headlines are pretty straight forward. We don't get our fair share of frequent flyers relative to our seat chair if you will. The frequent flyers that we have we don't get our fair share of their flights and then of the frequent flyers that we have we also don't get our fair share of credit cards. So, then of course, one has to understand what do you mean by fair share and is there truly an opportunity there.
So, we delve into that, we believe there is a very significant opportunity to win more business customers, win more flights from the customers that we get, and then get a whole bunch more Southwest visa credit cards and wallets out there. The combined value of all that is gigantic. The value of just the credit cards, quite frankly, is a very, very large number. But admittedly, I think this is why Laura and I have been reluctant to share targeted numbers is they're all speculative and in - whenever you're talking about getting a market share change, that may take some time to build. So, I think the easiest penetration, from a revenue generation, will be with the credit card and that's what we really hung our business case on. But when we've surveyed business customers over the last decade the single biggest point they made with us is they want a different frequent flier program. Single biggest issue and, we believe them.
So, we have been in design and construction for some time now and looking forward to having that project wrap up this year and then launch next year. It's very exciting for us. We're obviously hopeful we can make it a game changer. That, you couple that again with some of the other amenities that we're bringing forward, most notably wireless in the cabin. I think we're going to have a very, very compelling sales pitch for business travelers. We already get a whole bunch of business travelers, so it's not like we are starting from scratch there.

But we're very mindful of the challenge there. We've made very dramatic schedule changes for this company frequently over the last several years and it is, very admittedly, it is very difficult for our operation to adjust to that. So, it's just another reason for me to praise our people and how hard they've worked and how well they've done. There is definitely a cost penalty that we need to go in there and try to extract.
One of things we've been waiting for, Glen, is some stability. In other words, to try to attack the cost question, and then to come back with yet another radical schedule change, sort of renders some of that work worthless. So, we do seem to be getting in to more stability. We might actually, and I'm sure what's happening here in the Q4 is we're adding a few frequencies back in, which will certainly help that cost question. I'm not at all satisfied in fact with the quality of our flight schedule.
In other words, while it's been good for revenue production, we've actually taken some of the convenient flight times out from a customer perspective and even a competitive perspective. So, our desire is to be able to add capacity back here with the existing fleet in a way that satisfies both. It's revenue positive and it also helps on the cost side. Otherwise, we'll be looking at making sure that we take full advantage of the variability of staffing that is available to us. We have not taken full advantage of that at this point.
So, we got some, I wouldn't call that a constructural constraint but it's just more of a operating style change we're going to need to be making. And, as I said we are in the midst of pursuing that. That's a fancy way of saying we might want to use more part time employment in certain areas of the company in the future as compared to what we've done historically.

We're very pleased with the profit for the quarter. x items, $216 million, which is $0.29 a share. Each of those represents more than a tripling of our year-ago results.
Of course, all the credit goes to our people. They've done a marvelous job getting Southwest Airlines to this point. They certainly performed extraordinarily well in the quarter. They've managed a tremendous amount of change, not just over last couple of years, but for the last decade. So I'm very, very proud of them and very proud of these results.
We continued to set a number of company records relating to revenues during the quarter. We placed first in the domestic airline industry in two very important categories. First of all, revenue growth of 21.1% is the best in the industry, domestically, and that comes on a slightly down capacity growth at Southwest Airlines. And that means that we also placed first in the domestic industry in terms of year-over-year unit revenue growth, at almost 22%.
Our passenger counts were up. Our traffic was up. Very strong yield performance in the quarter. Our yields were up over 17%. Had a record load factor of 79.3%, which was up 2.3 points compared to '09. And Laura's going to spend quite a bit of time talking about revenues as well, because it's a revenue story. That's what drove our earnings growth. And a number of factors are involved, of course, driving our revenue growth. All that led to the second-best quarterly profit in our history, second only to the second quarter of 2006.
So from this point forward, beginning in the third quarter, our year-over-year comps changed a great deal. Last year was significantly off our normal trends. Based on our current July results so far, and the bookings for the rest of the quarter, we don't expect any significant deviation from normal years’ seasonal trends; just our continued strong revenue production.
Talking a little bit about Panama City Beach, we added to our route system in May. We're off to a great start there. Customers' response has been tremendous. And I do want to say that we really appreciate all the support we've gotten from the St. Joe Company, but also the airport and the entire community. And again, thanks for helping us to get off to a good start, and hopefully we're doing a small part to help the community as well. And I've been there, and I can report that the beaches look great, by the way. So everyone should don their swimsuits and get down there ASAP on a Southwest flight. 
I'll turn it over to Laura to take us through the quarter."

Our second quarter GAAP net income was $112 million or $0.15 per share.

Our second quarter GAAP net income was $112 million or $0.15 per share. Excluding special items totaling a net of $104 million relating to mark-to-market and other items associated with FAS 133, our second quarter net income was $216 million or $0.29 per share; a significant improvement over second quarter last year's earnings of $59 million or $0.08 per share.
Our second quarter operating income, excluding special items, was $414 million, resulting in an operating margin of 13%. And our pretax income, excluding special items, was $350 million, resulting in an 11% pretax margin.
Overall, it was a very strong second quarter performance, the second best in our history. And I'd like to congratulate our employees on these results and thank them for their hard work and their outstanding customer service.
The revenue momentum that started in the second half of last year continued into the second quarter, producing another record revenue performance. Our passenger revenues increased over $500 million to $3 billion.  And our other revenues increased nearly 50%, or $38 million compared to last year. With both record loads and record passenger yields, we also had a record 20.7% year-over-year improvement in our passenger unit revenues within the industry and domestic revenue results. 
More importantly, compared to the second quarter of 2008, our unit revenues grew 14%. Our total revenues of $5.8 billion for the first six months of 2010 represents a revenue increase of over $1 billion from our revenues for the first six months of 2007, while our capacity for the first half of this year is approximately 1% less than the first half of 2007.
The plan that we set forth in 2007 to grow our revenues is producing results, even despite the still-weak economic environment and even with business travel well below pre-downturn levels. Our revenue strength in the quarter was driven by our revenue initiatives, fewer fare sales and strong overall consumer demand. The yield improvement strengthened throughout the quarter, with April and May up 16% and June up 19%, resulting in an all-time record 17.3% growth in RPM yields. 
Business travel demand continued to strengthen during the quarter, and our full-fare mix was just under 20%, up almost two points from second quarter of last year and down less than a point from the first quarter of 2010. The sequential decline of under one point was better than historical sequential trends, suggesting some stabilization in our full-fare demand. And in our short-haul markets, we saw more than a three-point year-over-year improvement in our second quarter full-fare mix. We're very encouraged by the improvement in our business trends, but we also recognize that business travel has not fully recovered.
We have strong demand for our Business Select products, with 24% more Business Select passengers than a year ago, producing $24 million in incremental revenue, up from $18 million in the second quarter of last year. We also had strong demand from our EarlyBird product, generating $23 million in EarlyBird revenues, compared to $17 million in the first quarter of this year and $13 million in the fourth quarter of '09.
We have not seen any noticeable impact to our Business Select revenues from the introduction of our EarlyBird product. Our EarlyBird passengers continue to increase as a percentage of total passengers, while our Business Select passengers are above the EarlyBird introduction levels.
Our Wright Amendment revenues were $55 million in the quarter, compared to $37 million second quarter a year ago. And overall, we are very encouraged by our passenger revenue trends.
Month-to-date, our July passenger unit revenues are up in the 17% range from the respective year-ago period. And bookings thus far for August and September also look strong. Based on revenue and booking trends thus far, we're currently expecting another significant year-over-year improvement in our third quarter passenger unit revenues, but at a lower year-over-year rate, and experienced in the second quarter. As the current quarter and the remainder of the year progress, our year-over-year comparisons become more difficult due to our industry-leading improvement in revenue trends in the second half of last year.
Our freight revenues increased 15.8% to $33 million, primarily due to higher average rates. And we expect that our third quarter freight revenues will be comparable to the second quarter. Our other revenues increased almost 50% to $119 million, due to our fall 2009 revenue initiatives. As I mentioned earlier, we generated about $23 million in EarlyBird revenues, and we also generated approximately $13 million in revenues from our Pet Fares, Unaccompanied Minors service charges and excess heavy bag fees. 
We expect another year-over-year increase in our other revenues in the third quarter, but at a much lower rate than experienced in the second quarter, due to fewer charters anticipated and also to reaching the anniversary on the introduction of some of our revenue initiatives.
As a reminder, in the third quarter of last year, we generated about $12 million in revenues from these same revenue initiatives.
Turning to our cost performance. Our second quarter operating expenses, excluding special items, increased 13%, which results in a 13% unit cost increase. Although we had non-fuel cost pressure contributing to our overall unit cost increase, the most significant pressure came from higher fuel costs. Our economic fuel cost increased 32.4% to $2.37 per gallon, which was slightly better than expected, due to lower crude oil prices offset by higher heating oil crack spreads and jet differentials.
Based on the third quarter fuel hedge provided in our press release this morning, and the July 26 forward curve, our guidance for the third quarter economic fuel price is in the $2.40 per gallon range.  This estimate includes fuel taxes, but excludes fuel hedging premiums. We're currently estimating a slightly higher third quarter fuel price in the second quarter, due to higher jet diff as we move into the hurricane season, and a slightly higher fuel hedge penalty.
Our premium costs associated with our third quarter fuel hedge, which are recorded below the line in other gains and losses, are estimated to be in the $36 million range. And based on market prices as of July 26, and our hedge for the second half of this year, we're estimating our 2010 economic fuel price, including taxes, will be in the $2.40 per gallon range.
We have factored the various price points and percentages of our current hedge position, plus the impact from the hedges that were unwound in 2008, into our fuel price guidance and the sensitivities that we will provide in the Form 10-Q.
We continue to actively manage our hedge portfolio with the philosophy of protecting the business against catastrophic energy prices, and we've included our current hedge positions for 2011 and beyond in this morning's press release.
Excluding fuel and special items, our second quarter costs increased 6.4% on a unit basis. Although still up more than we would like, our second quarter non-fuel cost performance was better than anticipated, primarily due to deferral of advertising cost and a refund of excess security fees paid to the TSA. Regarding our advertising spend, we chose to defer about $8 million originally planned for the second quarter to later in the year, including some to the third quarter.
Higher profit sharing in 401(k) accounted for approximately three points of the 6.4% CASM x fuel increase. We accrued $62 million in profit sharing and $49 million in 401(k) for a total benefit to our employees of $110 million this quarter.
Our revenue-related charges, which are primarily charge-sell [ph] (14:19) discounts, accounted for another point of the non-fuel CASM increase. And, of course, we're always happy to talk about higher profit sharing and revenue-related charges. But that being said, we also continue to have inflationary cost pressure, most notably in our airport and our labor costs. Based on these continued cost pressures, we currently expect our third quarter non-fuel unit cost to increase from third quarter 2009 $7.11, and we currently expect that increase to be in the 6% range year-over-year, which is similar to what we saw in the second quarter.
Although it's reasonable to expect that our third quarter year-over-year unit cost pressure would ease, due to the modest capacity increase that we have planned for the third quarter, keep in mind that the $18 million security refund and the deferral of the advertising spend benefited our second quarter non-fuel unit cost by about 1½ points. 
For the full year of 2010, we are expecting our unit costs, excluding fuel and special items, to increase in the 6% to 7% range compared to last year. This estimate is higher than the 5% estimate we provided at the beginning of this year, and is being driven by increased profit sharing and revenue-related expenses.
Before I move on to the balance sheet, I'd like to quickly talk about our labor and airport costs. As expected, our labor costs increased 9.8% on a unit basis versus last year, primarily due to wage rate inflation and profit sharing. And based on current trends, we expect our third quarter labor unit costs to be comparable to second quarter's $3.71. 
With respect to airport costs, our landing fees and other rentals unit costs increased 15.7% year-over-year, primarily due to airport rate increases and fewer favorable airport audit adjustments this year. Based on the continued rate inflation at various airports, we're expecting our third quarter airport unit costs to fall in the mid-$0.80 range.
Now moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. We currently have $3.4 billion in core unrestricted cash and short-term investments, and our $600 million credit facility remains fully undrawn and available. Our leverage, including aircraft leases, is forecasted to be in the low-40% range by year end. We generated about $400 million in free cash flow in the second quarter, with $540 million of cash flow from operations and capital spending of $159 million.
Year-to-date, our cash flow from operations are over $900 million, and we generated over $600 million in free cash flow. Based on current trends, and our projected 2010 capital spending of less than $600 million, we currently expect to generate free cash flow for the year.
We're currently working on our strategic plan for the next decade, and capital planning is certainly a significant part of that exercise. We recently updated our fleet plan with Boeing, which I will go over shortly, without any material change to our total future capital spending.
In regards to our fleet and our capacity plan, during the quarter, we acquired three 700s from Boeing, and we ended the quarter with the fleet of 544 aircrafts. 
We're well underway in evaluating our long-term fleet plans. And as part of that planning, we've decided to slightly accelerate the retirement of our classic fleet. Accordingly, we worked with Boeing to update our future from orders and options schedules, with no net change to our fleet plans. We converted six purchase rights to options, and exercised 25 options for firm orders from 2011 through 2016. We've included the updated Boeing delivery schedules as an accompanying table to this morning's press release. 
We do not intend to significantly grow the fleet until our financial goals are achieved or in sight. Further, we're planning for flat capacity this year. Third quarter ASMs will be about 2½% year-over-year. And in the fourth quarter, they're going to be up approximately 4½% year-over-year.
For 2011, we're projecting a modest capacity increase and flat fleet. And keep in mind that the modest increase in our 2011 capacity will be heavier-weighted towards the first half of the year as a function of our 2010 flight schedule adjustments.
As always, we'll continue to closely monitor demand and remain prepared to adjust our flight schedules accordingly. 
And Marvin, with that overview, Gary and I are ready to take questions."

I then look at this quarter, and I see your one-way fares go from $110 or $112 to $132. I mean, these are high by historical levels for Southwest. And then I look at where the unemployment rate is in the U.S. It's close to a 30-year high at 10%. We know that the consumer is constrained. Discretionary spending is just tight. And yet, even then, it's not coming on the business side. I mean, you've seen some modest improvement. So the question is, is it that your network has evolved, your breadth of your network today? You're in a lot of business markets, you're the biggest domestic carrier, plus the fact that you have a more advanced Revenue Management System. I mean, is it easier today for Southwest to raise fares? Or has your passenger base changed? Has their price elasticity of demand come down? I mean, I know this is a very long and winded question here, but when I look at these numbers, I've never seen fare improvement of this magnitude, given a very challenging macro backdrop."

But I was just glancing at the earnings release and the average length of the passenger haul is now 883 miles. That's at least part of the standards. But there's a lot going on here, Mike. And Laura referenced in her remarks the strategy that we put forth in 2007, and we'll want to summarize this better for the investment community this fall, and just show you where we are vis-à-vis that plan. But the point is, a lot has changed. Now, we have argued and can demonstrate to you that there's a significant market share shift that's taking place over the last several years. You know that costs are up. We've already admitted, years ago, that we were going to have to find a way to adjust our fare structure upwards to deal with higher costs, and we're doing that. So I think you've got a combination of shifting out of short-haul markets into longer-haul markets, which is helping. You've got the fact that Southwest has offered more choice to people who want more service and are willing to pay for it. And Laura pointed out a 24% increase in Business Select as an example. We've seen weeks where it's up 30% and 40%. So we're finding opportunities to bring new products and services to the market that people will pay us. And, of course, the other material change just over the last 12 months is EarlyBird. There was concern when we introduced EarlyBird that it would cannibalize Business Select, and obviously, Laura's reporting that there's no evidence of that. So there's a few pieces in there. In terms of just our over overall fares though, getting to our core fare structure, our revenue management has evolved dramatically in 36 months. They are much more skilled at setting inventory levels at various prices and not giving away any more than they have to. And so I think there's a significant benefit associated with that. And then the other thing that you've seen from an overall schedule perspective, if you took 100% of our flights three years ago and you trimmed out the flights that weren't very good, which is what we've done, and instead you came back with a flight schedule that was more powerful, which is what we've done, then that's a way to ring out revenues as well. So in the old days, Mike, we would have flights at the end of the day that might have 20 people on them. And you're not getting very good yields on them either. Those days are gone. And so now you have a much more condensed flight schedule with much higher load factors, many more itineraries being published, a few more connecting customers are on board. So we've created better demand for our own product in addition to the fact that we're taking share from our competitors."

So we really haven't seen any drop-off in the momentum that we built up in the second quarter."

It is very normal for us to have a peak in the year in the second quarter. And that's what we're expecting this year. Normally, if you average some of those years that you were describing -- I think all we were trying to point in the earnings release is that 2009 is really off. It is really off of normal trends. The fourth quarter was the best quarter of the year. And it's hard to go back in history and find a year like that. Normally, I would say -- this is just Gary talking -- is we're normally down RASM 3Q versus Q2 in the 2%- to 3%-range. And some years, June is the best month of the year. Some years, July is the best month of the year. And it's possible that July -- I think this is the point Laura's really trying to make, is that when we look at the strength of our revenues coming into the third quarter, they are very good. And, in fact, July may very well be the best month this year. September is still September, and will not match an April or May. So that's what you're typically contending with seasonally."

So I wouldn't read anything into it other than that's what we've chosen to do in 2010 and 2011. The flat fleet, I wouldn't take literally. I'm sure will be up a few units or down a few units from time to time. It's just more of the direction that we want you all to know that we don't have any plans to materially increase the fleet. In 2011, I don't think we can add any more new cities other than the two in South Carolina unless we make a change to our fleet plans. So I think that answers your question for next year. For 2012, really all we're telling you all at this point about 2012 is that we are not currently committed to any change in the fleet for 2012. On the other hand, we've made no plans for 2012. So if we are going to add new cities, those are decisions that will be out in front of us, as well as how we fund those new cities in terms of airplanes. So we're not telling you a prediction that we will not grow the fleet in 2012. It's just, at this point, our baseline is no change in the fleet. I'd love for us to add a couple of cities in '12, and we certainly have a long list that we're contemplating. And we're working a lot of those opportunities. So there's a chicken-and-egg question here to some degree, but at least that’ll give you some guidance for the near term, which would be 2011."

I'd have to think about the Fourth of July and what impact that holiday timing might have on those months. But our RASM in '09 from 2Q to 3Q was up five points. And that just doesn't happen. So if you buy my normal trend of 2Q to 3Q is down two, that's a seven-point swing. So that's what I would urge you to look at and think about. And, of course, then based on that, the July comps, the June fits pretty well. And again, it's because last year’s July was off-trend relative to last year's June. It's a comp issue more than it is a seasonality issue. Because this year's June to July is going to be something. Laura will have to tell you what she wants to tell you on this year's July, but I guess you've got to wait a couple of days to hear those results. But this year's July looks really good."

So if you'll just permit me not to offer you much color here and just say that our near-term fleet plans, certainly '10, '11 and '12, are not dependent upon the question that you pose. However, we have enormous interest in the topic that you raised. And if I could just say that we're engaged deeply with Boeing on the retirement of our classics, on the replacement of the classics, on the re-engining opportunity, and then complete next-generation airplane opportunities. So we're deep into that with Boeing. I'll defer to them to tell you where they are in that process. We are clearly -- first of all, we're huge fans of Boeing. They are great partners with us, have been for four decades. And, secondly, we are in need of a more efficient, cost-effective aircraft. And that is our mission. And we're obviously very hopeful that Boeing can meet our needs there going forward."

There are many more cities that we would like to serve in the United States and, of course, we are pondering whether we want to prepare ourselves to fly international. And I would expect the decision on that sometime this year. So we want to continue to grow, is my point. We think we’ve got the cost structure and the customer experience package, and the people to do that. I think consolidation works in our favor in that regard. And it certainly has to this point. I think just the fact that we can demonstrate to you that we're winning customers right now and significant revenue gains as a share of the domestic market gives us a lot of encouragement going forward. So we're going to continue to invest in our own customer experience. And if consolidation continues, again, I think that, that -- I just don't see that, that's a negative for us.

But more information, obviously, is coming on that when we get ready to launch that program. But I think the headlines are pretty straightforward. We don't get our fair share of frequent flyers relative to our seat share, if you will. The frequent flyers that we have, we don't get our fair share of their flights. And then of the frequent flyers that we have, we also don't get our fair share of credit cards. So then, of course, one has to understand, “Well, what do you mean by fair share? And is there truly an opportunity there?” So we've delved into that. We believe that there is a very significant opportunity for us to win more business customers, win more flights from the customers that we get, and then get a whole bunch more Southwest Visa Credit Cards in wallets out there. The combined value of all that is gigantic. The value of just the Credit Cards, quite frankly, is a very, very large number. But admittedly, and I think this is why Laura and I have always been reluctant to share any targeted numbers, is they're all speculative. And whenever you're talking about getting a market share change, that may take some time to build. So I think the easiest penetration from a revenue generation will be with the credit card, and that's what we really hung our business case on. But when we've surveyed business customers over the last decade, the single biggest point they've made with us is they want a different Frequent Flyer program. Single biggest issue. And we believe them, so we've been in design and construction for some time now, and looking forward to having that project wrapped up this year and then launched next year. So it's very exciting for us. We're obviously hopeful that we can make it a game-changer. But you couple that, again, with some of the other amenities that we're bringing forward, most notably wireless in the cabin, I think we're going to have a very, very compelling sales pitch for business travelers. We already get a whole bunch of business travelers, so it's not like we're starting from scratch there. We just think we can get more."

But we're very mindful of the challenge there. We've made very dramatic schedule changes for this company. Frequently, over the last several years, admittedly, it is very difficult for our operation to adjust to that. So it's just another reason for me to praise our people and how hard they've worked, and how well they've done. There is definitely a cost penalty that we need to go in there and try to extract. One of the things that we've been waiting for, Glenn, is some stability. In other words, to try to attack the cost question and then to come back with yet another radical schedule change sort of renders some of that work worthless. So we do seem to be getting into more stability. We might actually -- and I'm sure what's happening here in the fourth quarter is we're adding a few frequencies back in, which will certainly help that cost question. I'm not at all satisfied, in fact, with the quality of our flight schedule. In other words, while it's been good for revenue production, we've actually taken some of the convenient flight times out from a customer perspective and even a competitive prospective. And so our desire is to be able to add capacity back here with the existing fleet in a way that satisfies both. It's revenue positive, and it also helps on the cost side. Otherwise, we’ll be looking at making sure that we take full advantage of the variability and of staffing that is available to us. We have not taken full advantage of that at this point. So we've got some -- I wouldn't call that a structural constraint, but it's just more of an operating style change that we're going to need to be making. And, as I said, we're in the midst of pursuing that. That's a fancy way of saying we might want to use more part-time employment in certain areas of the company in the future, as compared to what we've done historically."

We are very, very pleased to report what is a record third quarter earnings performance. And I want to start out by thanking all of our employees. Our people have done an extraordinary job operating an excellent airline, providing outstanding customer service and all the while building for the future, enhancing our customer brand and our customer experience. The result is another long list of revenue-related records, including a record third quarter load factor of 80.9%. 
Of course, as many of you know, we've deployed a number of revenue initiatives over the last several years. We've deployed a number of revenue management techniques that are designed to drive revenue per flight. We're continuing to optimize each published flight schedule with an emphasis on optimizing our five relatively new Southwest destinations along with a real emphasis on Denver, which has now become our fifth-largest operation and that in less than five years.
We continue to advertise and promote our low-cost, low-fare competitive advantage in our nationwide low-fare leadership and in particular with our Bags Fly Free campaign. We've added new sources of revenues such as EarlyBird and Pets Onboard. We continue to see strong growth from relatively new sources relating to areas such as Rapid Rewards, Business Select and our Dallas Love Field itineraries. We'll soon launch our marketing and distribution agreement with Volaris to Mexico.
Next year, we'll launch the Rapid Rewards 2.0 product. Yesterday, we announced schedules and fares for a March 13, 2011, launch of Greenville, Spartanburg and Charleston, South Carolina. Soon, we'll announce schedules and fares for a 2011 launch of Newark, New Jersey. And finally and I hope very soon, we'll acquire AirTran Airways, and that will provide a host of route, destination, profit and growth opportunities for Southwest Airlines.
In the meantime, we're evaluating the timing of bringing up a new reservation system, which, among many things, will bring us international capabilities. And then finally, we're in the final evaluation phase of whether to add the 737-800 to our fleet beginning no earlier than 2012. No commitment has been made on the -800s yet. Needless to say, we think we've got a very exciting future. We have a very full agenda for the first half of the next decade. I think we have the leadership team. We've got the people. We've got the financial resources to make all of this happen.
If I wasn't clear at the beginning, I will just say I am extremely happy with where we are with these results. There are always challenges in this very difficult airline business. But I am just glad I'm at Southwest Airlines.
So with that very brief overview, I'd like to turn it over to our tremendous Chief Financial Officer, Ms. Laura Wright."

Our third quarter GAAP net income was $205 million or $0.27 per diluted share. Excluding special items, our third quarter net income was $195 million or $0.26 per diluted share,",1861,"Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone, including our webcast listeners. Our third quarter GAAP net income was $205 million or $0.27 per diluted share. Excluding special items, our third quarter net income was $195 million or $0.26 per diluted share, a significant improvement over our third quarter 2009 earnings, excluding special items of $31 million or $0.04 per diluted share. This net income, excluding special items, produced a 6.1% net margin.
These results exceeded Wall Street's mean estimate of $0.25 per diluted share. Our third quarter operating income, excluding special items, was $388 million, resulting in a 12% operating margin, and our pretax income, excluding special items, was $315 million, resulting in a 10% pretax margin.
And on a rolling 12-month basis, our pretax return on invested capital was approximately 10%. Overall, we had a very strong quarterly performance, delivering a record third quarter profit, excluding special items, and I'd like to join Gary in congratulating our employees on these tremendous results.
Our revenue performance was very strong, continuing the momentum that we had in the first half of the year. Our passenger revenues for the quarter increased by nearly $500 million to a record $3 billion, and our other revenues increased nearly 50% or about $40 million, primarily due to $29 million of EarlyBird revenues this quarter.
When combined with our 11% improvement in freight revenues, our total operating revenues for the quarter increased almost 20% to a record $3.2 billion. On a unit basis, our passenger revenues grew 15.3%, and our operating revenues grew 16.1% on a unit basis compared to the third quarter of last year.
Our unit revenue performance in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter produced a sequential trends that was better than historical average change from the second quarter to the third quarter. Further, compared to the third quarter of 2008, our total revenues grew by $266 million on about 3% less available seat miles, resulting in a two-year unit revenue increase of 13.5%. It truly was a phenomenal revenue performance.
Our third quarter traffic levels were high, resulting in record monthly load factors each month throughout the quarter to produce a record third quarter load factor of 80.9%. Besides carrying record loads, our passenger yields were up 13.4% due to an increase in full-fare passengers and less discount in sell fares. Our third quarter full-fare mix was 18%, which is up about a point from the third quarter of last year and down about 1.5 points from the second quarter of 2010.
Demand for our Business Select product remains strong, with 21% more Business Select passengers than a year ago, producing $22 million in incremental revenue, which is up from $18 million in the third quarter of last year. We were also very pleased to see a 40% year-over-year increase in our Wright Amendment revenue with $59 million of revenues in the quarter compared to $42 million a year ago.
Month-to-date, our October passenger unit revenues are up in the 11% range from the respective year ago period. Our October results thus far suggest a sequential change in nominal PRASM for September that, again, exceeds historical sequential average changes for this time period. Bookings thus far for the remainder of October and for November and December also look strong. However, our year-over-year PRASM comparisons may become more difficult in November and December compared to October with the last year's PRASM acceleration as the quarter progressed. Additionally, we have more difficult year-over-year capacity comparisons as we move through the fourth quarter versus what we saw in the third quarter.
So although we are encouraged to begin the fourth quarter with a similar year-over-year run rate as we experienced in September, our year-over-year comparisons for the rest of the quarter should be more difficult. That being said, the good news is that despite the mixed economic data that we read about everyday, our bookings in place and our sequential revenue trends, at least thus far here in October, indicate sustained momentum of our year-to-date revenue results.
Our freight revenues increased 10.7% to $31 million, primarily due to higher average rates, and we expect that our fourth quarter freight revenues will be comparable to the third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, our other revenues increased almost 50% to $129 million, which includes $29 million in EarlyBird revenues and $14 million in revenues from pets, unaccompanied minors and excess bag charges combined, and that's versus $2 million a year ago for EarlyBird and $10 million a year ago for pets, unaccompanied minors and bags.
We expect another year-over-year increase in our other revenues in the fourth quarter but at a much lower rate than experienced in the third quarter, taking into consideration that we had $24 million in ancillary revenues in the fourth quarter of last year from these initiatives versus only $12 million in the third quarter of last year from the same initiatives as they were just being introduced.
Turning to our cost performance. Our third quarter operating expenses, excluding special items, increased to 10.5% year-over-year. The increase was 7.1% on a unit basis, which once again, was due largely to higher fuel costs. Our economic fuel costs increased 11.7% to $2.38 per gallon. The decrease in crude oil during the quarter was essentially offset by an increase in crack spreads.
Based on the fourth quarter fuel hedge, which we provided in our press release this morning, and using the October 15 forward curve, we're currently expecting our fourth quarter economic fuel price to be in the $2.45 to $2.50 per gallon range, including taxes. Premium costs associated with our fourth quarter fuel hedge are estimated to be in the $36 million range. We will also provide a fuel sensitivity table for your reference in our Form 10-Q, which we plan to file soon. And as a reminder, the sensitivity table that we have in the 10-Q factors in the various price points and percentages of our current hedge positions, as well as the lock-in losses from the hedges that were unwound in late 2008.
For 2011, the recent volatility makes it quite difficult to give 2011 fuel guidance with any precision. However, based on the current forward curve, crude is averaging in the mid- to high $80 per barrel range next year. So clearly, if that occurs, that would create a year-over-year headwind for us in terms of price per gallon. Using this forward curve and our existing hedges, our current estimate is about $2.60 per gallon range, which is about $0.10 above the current market price for 2011.
Excluding fuel and special items, our third quarter cost increased 5.1% on a unit basis. Higher salaries, wages and benefits accounted for over three points of the year-over-year increase, a vast majority of which was due to significantly higher profit sharing expense in the third quarter compared to a year ago. We accrued $56 million in profit sharing and $49 million in 401(k) expense, for a total benefit to our employees of $105 million in the third quarter, up from $55 million a year ago.
Excluding fuel, special items and profit-sharing expense, our unit cost increased 2.5% from a year ago. Airport costs, higher revenue-related charges and advertising costs accounted for the remainder of the year-over-year increase. 
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we continue to have inflationary cost pressures, most notably in airport and labor costs. Our labor costs typically increased sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter due to seasonal flying and associated increases with holiday pay. In addition, based on the existing contract we have with our pilots, our pilots are eligible for a profitability-based rate increase effective September 1 of 3%, and that's due to the company's earnings performance for the 12 months ended September 30. As you remember a year ago under the same formula, they did not receive a rate increase.
We also anticipate advertising cost to increase year-over-year in the fourth quarter due to targeted ad campaigns that we have scheduled. And finally, we expect our fourth quarter maintenance unit cost to be similar to third quarter at $0.77, which is higher than last year's fourth quarter maintenance cost at $0.69. Based on these cost trends, we're estimating another year-over-year increase in our fourth quarter nonfuel unit cost currently in the 6% range.
Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. As we reported in this morning's release, we currently have approximately $3.7 billion in core unrestricted cash and short-term investments and our $600 million credit facility remains fully undrawn and available. Our leverage, including aircraft leases, is forecast to be around 40% by year end. We generated $285 million in free cash flow for the quarter, and our year-to-date cash flow from operations are approximately $1.3 billion, with almost $900 million in free cash flow.
We currently expect that our 2010 capital spending will be less than $500 million. And for 2011, we're currently forecasting capital spending to be in the $800 million to $900 million range.
Turning to fleet capacity. During the quarter, we acquired three 700s from Boeing, and we ended the quarter with a fleet of 547 airplanes. We expect to take delivery of one more aircraft from Boeing this year, and we are picking up three lease aircraft in the secondary market, one of which is expected to be delivered by the end of the year and the other two early next year. The three additional aircraft are being leased solely to cover additional maintenance flyings needed for elective maintenance needs that we have opted to accelerate over the next several years.
Based on six planned retirements this year, we expect to end the year with 546 airplanes and for 2011, we have 14 firm orders from Boeing and the two leased aircraft that I just mentioned, and we're going to have 16 retirements. So we will end 2011 with flat fleet. So absent the AirTran acquisition, we are not planning for any fleet growth next year. As far as capacity plans, our fourth quarter capacity is expected to be up approximately 5.3% year-over-year, and our full year 2010 capacity still remains flat with 2009 at 0.4%.
For 2011, as demand has continued to strengthen, we have attracted opportunities to better utilize our existing fleet, and we're currently expecting to increase our capacity in the first quarter of next year in the 8% range and in the second quarter in the 5% range.
In fact, our schedule optimization is allowing us to add three new cities next year, two of which are Charleston and Greenville, which we announced service plans for yesterday. Charleston will have seven daily departures to four cities beginning on March 13. And Greenville, Spartanburg will have seven daily departures to five cities also beginning on March 13. And as previously announced, we are excited to begin service to Newark in March of 2011 pursuant to our lease agreement with Continental for 36 slots. In closing, we continue to closely monitor demand, and we do remain prepared to adjust our schedule accordingly. 
And Tom, with that overview, Gary and I are ready to take questions."

But I think at least for the fourth quarter of '10 that the two year ago numbers still a decent comparison. We've started looking back at '07. We've started looking back at sort of a basket of years to compare to because you run into such distortions with '09 and even the latter part of '08. But in every way we look at it and Laura, again, I just have to re-emphasize her point, the fact that October appears to us the way it does compared to September, August, July is very meaningful. So it suggests that we are continuing to build momentum. And I think that's logical because you haven't seen the full return of the business traveler. And if one believes that, that is gradually occurring over time, all else being equal, you ought to continue to see a strengthening in revenue movement. Now that's the prediction earlier this year and so far, that's playing out pretty well. But we're not seeing the levels of business traffic at Southwest that we had in '07 and '08.

We're leading the industry in virtually every economic category with our low-fare approach. We're the only one who doesn't charge all the ridiculous fees. So, of course, that's not what our strategy is. Our strategy is to keep our fare as low, continue to be the low-fare leader in the United States, not nickel-and-dime our customers. We already see a host of opportunities, particularly in Atlanta to go in and reduce the fares by half. And so to what Southwest Airlines levels are and enjoy the famous Southwest effect of stimulating traffic. So it is not our plan to convert ourselves from a low-fare carrier to a the high-fare carrier. You won't see that happen."

It looks like it's going to be similar to the other 73s. Now I did -- on your call that you had announcing the AirTran merger, you did indicate, you sort of -- maybe it was on the side, but you kind of said what we don't want is to create a situation where the pilots jump between the different airplane types.

Marketing has recently done some surveys to they try to get a sense of what our mix of business travelers is compared to other airlines. If you extrapolate that into the number of customers that we carry, we're among the leaders in the country in terms of the number of business customers that we serve. Arguably, historically, at least last couple of years, we've been the largest. With Delta, Northwest combining and now United, Continental. They will probably outboard us in terms of business customers. So the point is we already serve a whole bunch of business customers. Clearly, we're gaining share. That's an undeniable fact domestically. We're gaining share relative to the last several years. A lot of that share is consumer, but it's also business travelers. So just with the product enhancements we've made, giving the road warriors more choice, we do believe that we're seeing more business customers come Southwest way. But there's a variety of things going on in our 16.1% unit revenue improvement. And so there, we've deployed 10 different initiatives or more, and it's hard for us to piece apart what value is being driven by each one. But again, we want to share that with you all when we have more time to do that. But what I hear from business customers is the fact that we've introduced an enhanced boarding process with the Business Select product, with enhanced frequent-flyer benefits has caused them to change their flying behavior and bring their business to Southwest. And the fact that we allow for flexibility in changing flights, where we do not charge the change fee, is huge with business customers. The bag fees maybe not so much. I think that's probably more benefit for consumers. But even the bag fees I think is an attribute that some business customers like. So I think it's a basket of things. Clearly, there's much better revenue management than there was three years ago. There is much better schedule optimization than there was three years ago. We've created itineraries that are more marketable for connecting customers or connecting passengers are up more than our nonstop passengers. They are not at the expense of nonstop, so we're still carrying the same amount of nonstop passengers. The increase of the load factor has been driven more by carrying more connecting passengers, and so one would infer that, that could be more heavily weighted towards consumers. But I think it's a variety of things and in fact, Mike, with the recession, what you know you always find with a drop in business travel, that's sort of our bread-and-butter short-haul markets, and they are lagging in the recovery compared to our medium and longer haul markets for that reason. So I do think that when the business traveler does come back, we're going to see hopefully a very strong response, especially in our short-haul routes."

The opportunity for us is twofold, but the easier one to visualize is there are at least two dozen cities in our route system that AirTran does not serve. So those are simple. You go in. We see that the fares are quite high. We know we can come in, lower the fares, stimulate the market. It will be additive, in other words, to the AirTran route system. That is huge. Campbell-Hill came up with an estimate of 2 million incremental O&D passengers. Well, we just looked at that subset of markets. Our number wasn't 2 million, but it was still really big. In addition to that, so I'm moving on to the next argument. In addition to that, the AirTran route system is probably not fully fleshed out. So in other words, even where they do have service, especially if it's service to an existing Southwest city, we see the opportunity to at least consider adding frequencies and tap into the strength that we have on the destination submarket. So we're sort of loathe to tell our competitors our game plan, but an obvious one is Chicago Midway, where we have a lot of customers in Chicago. It's one of our largest cities that we operate from. We may very well have opportunities to add to the AirTran route map and generate a lot more customers. Then there's probably places that we don't serve that AirTran does where they may not have enough frequencies either. And of course, in 2008, they were forced for economic reasons to withdraw a lot of capacity from Atlanta because of high fuel prices. Well some of that could at least in theory be considered for restoration. So I really think it's three basic pools of opportunities there. But according to Campbell-Hill, if you look at all of those three in aggregate, it's an annual opportunity of about 2 million incremental passengers."

So first of all, we thought that we were pleased with the results. In terms of why the sequential trends, I think it maybe goes back to some of the discussion that we had with Mike Linenberg on Gary's response to his question. There seems to be a lot of factors working together out there. Certainly, what we've seen at Southwest is increased loads, record load factors in 14 of the last 15 months. So we're slowly picking up business traffic but at the same time, we seem to be picking up more incremental leisure traffic as well. So it just seems to be a very good combination for us. In terms of the -- I'm not sure I can answer what's driving the overall macro recovery. Anything you want to add, Gary?"

And I think it's possible that the air travel demand and, Gary, you all may have a better sense of this than I do since you look at every airline and you aggregate these things at least faster than we do sometimes. But I mean, there could be a pickup in the air travel demand market. I would project that over time, there is a gradual return of the business traveler. So that might help support, and that was a point that I made earlier. This is a view that we have, and I don't know that it's shared by all. So it's just a view. But I do think that the economic environment -- I think it's hard to find anybody who thinks that the economy is really strong. So I do think that the environment is such that consumers especially are looking for value. I read all the time about business travelers looking for value and buying in advance to get better ticket prices as an example. And that's an environment where we really shine. And the bags fly free message, of course, just pounds home what a low-fare philosophy that we have at Southwest Airlines. So I continue to believe that we're going to continue to outperform our competitors. These are Laura Wright's comments saying that at Southwest Airlines, we're seeing this escalation seasonally. So I don't know that we're going to find if that's true for the industry. I think that our product is getting better every year, and we're continuing to add new features and functions, and I think that, that's all a plus. And there's just a fair amount of excitement that we feel within the company and I sense that without that we're doing some things. I think the fact that we've added five new cities in the last 18 months is huge because it's not just exciting for the people in Boston, LaGuardia, Minneapolis, Panama City and Milwaukee, it's the rest of our system that has now another flight opportunity on Southwest Airlines. And there aren't any real competitors that are able to offer the same kind of -- I think, it's a wow factor. There others that might say it's not such a wow factor. But it's great fun for us to be able to announce yesterday South Carolina as an example."

The fact that we are seeing such strength in October is very material to what we are contemplating for the first quarter. I think we're going to have another record load factor in October. I think we'll have another record load factor in November. I'm not predicting it. I'm just trying to set the stage for why we believe that the capacity plan for next year is appropriate. We see very strong demand for the next 60 to 90 days, which we think will carry through to the first quarter of next year, with an optimized schedule that has new markets in it, at least in our view, will justify that amount of flight activity. It certainly, and I think Dan made this point earlier that the fact that we can add that capacity at an incremental cost makes the profit opportunity quite handsome for all the obvious reasons. So I'm comfortable with it. And hopefully, that's -- we're not doing it with more airplanes. So it's just utilizing the assets that we have and the workforce that we have to provide better flights and again, we're confident that the revenues will be there.

So that's just sort of an advance warning on that and something that we'll have to factor into our plans accordingly. Our capacity plans, again, actually help mitigate that to a degree because a lot of those cost increases are fixed. So to the extent that we can add more capacity that drives down the unit cost. The other point to reiterate with the capacity increase is that we believe we drive more revenue and more profits with that approach as opposed to not. So it's a way of saying, ""What are we going to do about our airport cost pressure?"" One of the answers is, ""Fortunately, we have some opportunities to add some profitable capacity here in the near term."""

And then the new rev system what we need to have done first is a good effort on our integration planning here with AirTran. So we may have to delay a little bit the spilling up of that effort, Bob. So in any event, I think that the attributes associated with a new reservation system likely won't begin to come online for probably 18 to 24 months at the earliest. And then all up, I can't imagine that we'll be completely converted to a new reservation system given this new AirTran initiative for three years will be my guess. So we'll probably start that work in earnest in a couple of months. But even that is just a target date. But yes, Volaris and Rapid Rewards are very, very close, and you'll find more about those two."

We are very, very pleased to report what is a record third quarter earnings performance. I want to start out by thanking all of our employees. Our people have done an extraordinary job operating an excellent airline, providing outstanding customer service and all the while building for the future enhancing our customer brand and our customer experience.
The result is another long list of revenue related records including a record third quarter load factor of 80.9%. Of course, as many of you know, we've deployed a number of revenue initiatives over the last several years. We have deployed a number of revenue management techniques that are designed to drive revenues per flight. We are continuing to optimize each published flight schedule with an emphasis on optimizing our five relatively new Southwest destinations along with a real emphasis on Denver, which has now become our fifth largest operation, and that in less than five years.
We continue to advertise and promote our low cost, low fare competitive advantage and our nationwide low fare leadership and in particular with our 'Bags Fly Free' campaign. We have added new sources of revenues, such as EarlyBird and pets on board. We continue to see strong growth from relatively new sources, relating to areas such as Rapid Rewards, Business Select and our Dallas Love Field new [item] in the itineraries.
We will soon launch our marketing and distribution agreement with Volaris to Mexico. Next year, we will launch the Rapid Rewards 2.0 product. Yesterday, we announced schedules and fares for a March 13, 2011 launch of Greenville-Spartanburg and Charleston, South Carolina. Soon we will announce schedules and fares for 2011 launch of New York-New Jersey. Finally, and I hope a very soon, we will acquire AirTran Airways and that will provide a host of route destination, profit and growth opportunities for Southwest Airlines.
In the meantime, we are evaluating the timing of bringing up a new reservation system, which, among many things, will bring us international capabilities.
Finally, we are in the final evaluation phase of whether to add the 737-800 to our fleet, beginning no earlier than 2012. No commitment has been made on the Dash 800 GF. Needless to say, we think we have got a very exciting future. We have a very full agenda for the first half of the next decade. We have the leadership team, we have got the people, and we have got the financial resources to make all this happen
If I wasn't clear in the beginning, I will just say, I am extremely happy with where we are, with these results. There are always challenges and this very difficult airline business, but I am just glad I'm at Southwest Airlines.
With that very brief overview, I would like to turn it over to our tremendous Chief Financial Officer, Ms. Laura Wright.

Excluding special items, our third quarter net income was $195 million or $0.26 per diluted share, a significant improvement over our third quarter 2009 earnings excluding special items of $31 million or $0.04 per diluted share. This net income excluding special items produced 6.1% net margin. These results exceeded Wall Street's mean estimate of $0.25 per diluted share.
Our third quarter operating income excluding special items was $388 million resulting in 12% operating margin. Our pretax income excluding special items was $315 million resulting in a 10% pretax margin. On a rolling 12 months basis, our pre-tax return on invested capital is approximately 10%.
Overall, we had a very strong quarterly performance delivering a record third quarter profit excluding special items. I would like to join Gary in congratulating our employees on these tremendous results.
Our revenue performance was very strong, continuing the momentum that we had in the first half of the year. Our passenger revenues for the quarter increased by nearly $500 million to a record $3 billion. Our other revenues increased nearly 50% or about $40 million, primarily due to $29 million of EarlyBird revenues this quarter.
When combined with our 11% improvement in freight revenues, our total operating revenues for the quarter increased almost 20% to a record $3.2 billion. On a unit basis, our passenger revenues grew 16.3% and our operating revenues grew 16.1% on a unit basis compared to the third quarter of last year.
Our unit revenue performance in the third quarter, as compared to the second quarter, produced a sequential trend that was better than historical average change from the second quarter to the third quarter. Further, compared to the third quarter of 2008, our total revenues grew by $266 million on about 3% last available seat miles, resulting in a two-year unit revenue increase of 13.5%. It truly was a phenomenal revenue performance.
Our third quarter traffic levels were high resulting in record monthly load factors each month throughout the quarter to produce a record third quarter load factor of 80.9%. Besides carrying record loads, our passenger yields were up 13.4% due to an increase in full fare passengers and less discounts in sale fares. Our third quarter full fare mix was 18%, which is up about a point from the third quarter of last year and down about 1.5 points from the second quarter of 2010.
Demand for our Business Select product remained strong with 21% more Business Select passengers from a year ago producing $22 million in incremental revenue, which is up from $18 million in the third quarter of last year. We were also very pleased to see 40% year-over-year increase in our Wright Amendment revenue with $59 million of revenues in the quarter compared to $42 million a year ago.
Month-to-date, our October passenger unit revenues are up in the 11% range from the respective year ago period. Our October results, thus far, suggest a sequential change in nominal CASM for September that again exceeds historical sequential average changes for this time period.
Bookings thus far, for the remainder of October and for November and December, also look strong. However, our year-over-year present comparisons leave may become more difficult in November and December, compared to October due to last year's CASM acceleration as the quarter progressed.
Additionally, we have more difficult year-over-year capacity comparisons as we move through the fourth quarter versus what we saw in the third quarter.
Although we are encouraged to begin the fourth quarter with a similar year-over-year run rate as we experienced in September, our year-over-year comparisons for the rest of the quarter should be more difficult. That being said, the good news is that despite the mixed economic data that we read about every day, our bookings and price and our sequential revenue trends, at least thus far here in October, indicate sustained momentum of our year-to-date revenue results.
Our freight revenues increased 10.7% to $31 million, primarily due to higher average rates, and we expect that our fourth quarter freight revenues will be comparable to the third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, our other revenues increased almost 50% to $129 million, which includes $29 million in EarlyBird revenues and $14 million in revenues from pets, unaccompanied minors and excess bag charges combined versus $2 million a year ago for EarlyBirds and $10 million a year ago for pets, unaccompanied minors and bags.
We expect another year-over-year increase in our other revenues in the fourth quarter but at a much lower rate than experienced in the third quarter, taking into consideration that we had $24 million in ancillary revenues in the fourth quarter of last year on these initiatives versus only $12 million in the third quarter of last year for the same initiatives as they were just being introduced.
Turning to our cost performance, our third quarter operating expenses, excluding special items, increased 10.5% year-over-year. The increase was 7.1% on a unit basis, which once again, was due largely to higher fuel costs. Our economic fuel costs increased 11.7% to $2.38 per gallon. The decrease in crude oil during the quarter was essentially offset by an increase in crack spreads.
Based on the fourth quarter fuel hedge which we provided in our press release this morning and using the October 15 forward curve, we are currently expecting our fourth quarter economic fuel price to be in the $2.45 to $2.50 per gallon range including taxes. Premium costs associated with our fourth quarter fuel hedge are estimated to be in the $36 million range.
We will also provide a fuel sensitivity table for your reference in our Form 10-Q, which we plan to file soon. As a reminder, the sensitivity table that we have in the 10-Q factors in the various price points and percentages of our current hedge position as well as the locked in losses from the hedges that were unwound in late 2008.
For 2011, the recent volatility makes it quite difficult to give 2011 fuel guidance with any precision. However, based on the current forward curve, crude is averaging in the mid to high $80 per barrel range next year. Clearly, if that occurs that would create a year-over-year headwind for us in terms of price per gallon. Using this forward curve in our existing hedges, our current estimate is about $2.60 per gallon range, which is about $0.10 above the current market price for 2011.
Excluding fuel and special items, our third quarter costs increased 5.1% on a unit basis. Higher salaries, wages and benefits accounted for over 3 points of the year-over-year increase, a vast majority of which was due to significantly higher profit sharing expense in the third quarter compared to a year ago.
We accrued $56 million in profit sharing and $49 million in 401 K expense for a total benefit to our employees of $105 million in the third quarter, up from $55 million a year ago. Excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing expense, our unit cost increased 2.5% from a year ago. Airport costs, higher revenue-related charges and advertising costs accounted for the remainder of the year-over-year increase.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we continue to have inflationary cost pressures, most notably in airport and labor costs. Our labor cost typically increase sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter due to seasonal flying and associated increases with holiday pay. In addition, based on the existing contract we have with our pilots, our pilots are eligible for a profitability-based rate increase effective September 1 at 3%, and that's due to the company's earnings performance for the 12 months ended September 30. If you remember, a year ago, under the same formula, they did not receive our rate increase. We also anticipate advertising cost to increase year-over-year in the fourth quarter due to targeted ad campaigns that we have scheduled.
Finally, we expect our fourth quarter maintenance unit cost to be similar to third quarter's $0.077, which is higher than last year's fourth quarter maintenance cost of $0.069. Based on these cost trends, we are estimating another year-over-year increase in our fourth quarter non-fuel unit cost currently in the 6% range.
Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow, as we reported in this morning's release, we currently have approximately $3.7 billion in core, unrestricted cash and short-term investments. Our $600 million credit facility remains fully un-drawn and available. Our leverage including aircraft leases is forecasted to be around 40% by year-end.
We generated $285 million in free cash flow for the quarter, and our year-to-date cash flow from operations are approximately $1.3 billion with almost $900 million in free cash flow. We currently expect that our 2010 capital spending will be less than $500 million. For 2011, we are currently forecasting capital spending to be in the $800 million to $900 million range.
Turning to fleet capacity, during the quarter we acquired three 700s from Boeing and we ended the quarter with a fleet of 547 airplanes. We expect to take delivery of one more aircraft from Boeing this year and we are picking up three leased aircraft in the secondary market, one of which is expected to be delivered by the end of the year and the other two early next year. The three additional aircraft are being leased solely to cover additional maintenance lines needed for elective maintenance needs that we have opted to accelerate over the next several years.
Based on six planned retirements this year, we expect to end the year with 546 airplanes. For 2011, we have 14 firm orders from Boeing and with the two leased aircraft that I just mentioned, and we are going to have a 16 retirements. We will end 2011 with flat fleet. Absent the AirTran acquisition, we are not planning for any fleet growth next year.
As far as capacity plans, our fourth quarter capacity is expected to be up approximately 5.3% year-over-year and our full year 2010 capacity still remains flat with 2009 at 0.4%. For 2011, as demand has continued to strengthen, we have attractive opportunities to better utilize our existing fleet and we are currently expecting to increase our capacity in the first quarter of next year in the 8% range and in the second quarter in the 5% range.
Our schedule authorization is allowing us to add three new cities next year, two of which are Charleston and Greenville, which we announced service plans for yesterday. At Charleston, we will have seven daily departures to four cities beginning on March 13, and Greenville-Spartanburg will have seven daily departures to five cities also beginning on March 13. As previously announced, we are excited to begin service to New York in March of 2011 as pursuant to our lease agreement with Continental for 36 slots.
In closing, we continue to closely monitor demand and we do remain prepared to adjust schedule accordingly.
Tom, with that overview, Gary and I are ready to take questions.

Elsewhere, We're doing a pretty darn good job and we'll launch Rapid Rewards next year with a new product and that will require some marketing support. We're again in the planning stages for how much we want to spend there, but you're exactly right, we've got, from what we have published we can probably increase capacity next year a low of 3.5%. Just again with no additional aircraft, you're right we can probably hit a run rate of something ahead of 5% for the year.

We've done a lot of good in a short period of time, and everybody at Southwest is proud of our 2010 results compared to the 2010 plan that we laid out three years ago. Fuel prices are much higher than what we contemplated in '07. So, if there is a concern in the plan next year, that's it, but the revenue production is better with the capacity plan that we're deploying as compared to now.

Obviously, we started to see three significant improvements in fourth quarter '09, so that one won't be as good. At least for the fourth quarter of '10 that the two year ago number is still a decent comparison. We've started looking back at '07. We've started looking back at a basket of years to compare to because you run into such distortions, with '09 and even the latter part of '08, but every way we look at it. Laura, again, just have to reemphasize her point, the fact that October appears to us the way it does compared to September, August, July is very meaningful.
It suggests that we're continuing to build momentum. That logical because you haven't seen the full return of the business traveler. If one believes that that is gradually occurring over time, all else being equal, you ought to continue to see strengthening of revenue momentum.
That would be a prediction earlier this year, and so far that's playing out pretty well. We're not seeing the levels of business traffic in Southwest that we had in '07 and '08. Certainly, what I've heard from counterparts around the industry, no one is representing that their business travelers recovered to that level. You've got that upside in any event.

Marketing has recently has done some surveys to try to get a sense of what our mix of business travelers is compared to other airlines. If you extrapolate that into the number of customers that we carry, we're among the leaders in the country in terms of the number of the business customers that we serve. Arguably, historically, at least last couple of years, we've been the largest with Delta, Northwest combining and now United Continental, they will probably outboard us in terms of business customers. The point is, we already serve a whole bunch of business customers.
Clearly, we're gaining share. That's an undeniable fact domestically. We're gaining share relative to the last several years. A lot of that share is to consumer, but it's also business travelers. Just with the product enhancements we've made, giving the road warriors more choice, we do believe that we're seeing more business customers come Southwest way. There is variety of things going on in our 16.1% unit revenue improvement. We've deployed 10 different initiatives or more and it's hard for us to piece apart what value is being driven by each one, but again we want to share that with you all when we'll have more time to do that. What I hear from business customers is the fact that we've introduced an enhanced boarding process with the Business Select product, with enhanced frequent flier benefits, has caused them to change their flying behavior and bring their business to Southwest.
The fact that we allow more flexibility in changing flights where we do not charge the change fee is huge with business customers. The bag fees may be not so much. That's probably more benefit for consumers, but even the bag fees is an attribute that some business customers like. It's a basket of things. Clearly, there is much better revenue management than there was three years ago. There is much better schedule optimization than there was three years ago. We've created itineraries that are more marketable for connecting customers or connecting passengers are up more than our non-stop passengers. They are not at the expense of non-stops. We're still carrying the same amount of non-stop passengers.
The increase in the load factor has been driven more by carrying more connecting passengers. So, one would infer that could be more heavily weighted towards consumers. It's a variety of things, and in fact, Mike, with the recession, which you know you'll always find with a drop in business travel, that's our bread and butter, short-haul markets, and they are lagging in the recovery compared to our medium and longer haul markets for that reason. I do think that when the business traveler does come back, we're going to see, hopefully, a very strong response, especially in our shorter haul routes.

The opportunity for us is twofold, but the easier one to visualize is there are at least two dozen cities in our route system that AirTran does not serve. So, those are simple. You go in, we see that the fares are quite high, we know we can come in, lower the fares, and stimulate the market. It will be additive, in other words, to the AirTran route system. That is huge. Campbell-Hill came up with an estimate of 2 million incremental O&D passengers. We just looked at that subset of markets. Our number wasn't 2 million, but it was still really big. In addition to that I'm moving on to the next argument.
The AirTran route system is probably not fully fleshed out. In other words, even where they do have service, especially if it's serviced to an existing Southwest city, we see the opportunity to at least consider adding frequencies and tap into the strength that we have on the destination markets. We loathe to tell our competitors our game plan, but an obvious one is Chicago Midway where we have a lot of customers in Chicago. It's one or our largest cities that we operate from. We may very well have opportunities to add to the AirTran route map and generate a lot more customers. Then there are probably places that we don't serve that AirTran does where they may not have enough frequencies either. Of course, in 2008, they were forced for economic reasons to withdraw a lot of capacity from Atlanta because of high fuel prices. Some of that could, at least in theory, be considered for restoration. So, I really think its three basic pools of opportunities there, but again, according to Campbell-Hill if you look at all of those three in aggregate, it's an annual opportunity of about 2 million incremental passengers.

I wondered if maybe you could describe what it is that you think is driving it? What's driving this good tone to business? I didn't think the September numbers were particularly impressive for Southwest and for some others, but October and certainly the commentary on November sounds like it is. Is there something that you've maybe put your finger that is contributing to it?

If you kind of compare us to two years ago, our unit revenues are up about 13.5% in a still pretty depressed economic environment. We were pleased with the results. In terms of why the sequential trends, it maybe goes back to some of the discussion that we had with Mike Linenberg, and Gary's response to his question, there seems to be a lot of factors working together out there. Certainly, what we've seen at Southwest is increased loads, record load factors in 14 of the last 15 months. We're slow at picking up business traffic, but at the same time we seem to be picking up more incremental leisure traffic as well. It just seems to be a very good combination for us. I’m not sure I can answer what's driving the overall macro recovery.

I was trying to think while Laura was talking there and it's possible that the air travel demand, and Gary, you all may have a better sense of this than I do since you look at every airline, and you aggregate these things at least faster than we do sometimes, but there could be a pickup in the air travel demand market. I would project that over time there is a gradual return of the business travelers. That might help support and that was a point that I made earlier. This is a view that we have and I don't know that it's shared by all. It's just a view, but I do think that the economic environment.
It's hard to find anybody who thinks that the economy is really strong, so I do think that the environment is such that consumers, especially, are looking for value. I read all the time about business travelers looking for value and buying in advance to get better ticket prices as an example. That's an environment where we really shine and the 'Bags Fly Free' message of course just pounds home what a low fair philosophy that we have at Southwest Airlines. I continue to believe that we're going to continue to outperform our competitors. Now, these are Laura Wright's comments, saying that, at Southwest Airlines we are seeing this escalation seasonally. 
I don't know that we're going to find if that's true for the industry. That our product is getting better every year and we're continuing to add new features and functions, and that that's all a plus and there is just a fair amount of excitement that we feel within the Company and I sense that without it that we're doing some things. The fact that we've added five new cities in the last 18 months is huge, because it's not just exciting for the people in Boston, LaGuardia, Minneapolis, Panama City and Milwaukee it's the rest of our system that has now another flight opportunity on Southwest Airlines. There aren't any real competitors they are able to offer the same kind of it's a 'wow' factor. There are others that might say it's not such of a 'wow' factor, but its great fun for us to be able to announce yesterday South Carolina, as an example.

If you think about the schedule optimization you undertook last year at this time, at least, I understood as you wanted to get a lot of capacity out of these off peak periods, where revenue wasn't so good. It just seems like you're kind of coming back to that and you could clearly see it in a way you utilized your network this year. Summer schedules were tight, but they weren't in first quarter. Now, it feels like you're going to be much more back to a more leveled schedule, where you're really filling in those off-peaks. Is there some story there that we don't understand that is going to allow you to generate the turn to returns that you couldn't last year at that time?

If you look at the current and you all will get tired of me repeating this, but what Laura said earlier is very meaningful, the fact that we are seeing such strength in October is very material to what we are contemplating for the first quarter. We're going to have another record load factor in October. We'll have another record load factor in November. I'm not predicting it. I'm just trying to set the stage for why we believe that the capacity plan for next year is appropriate. We see very strong demand for the next 60 to 90 days, which we think will carry through to the first quarter of next year.
With an optimized schedule that has new markets in it that at least in our view will justify that amount of flight activity. Dan made this point earlier that the fact that we can add that capacity at an incremental cost makes the profit opportunity quite handsome for all the obvious reasons. I'm comfortable with it, and hopefully what I'm doing it with more airplanes, so it's just utilizing the assets that we have and the workforce that we have to provide better flights, and again, we're confident that the revenues would be there. My concern for next year is more fuel personally than it is the capacity plan that we're talking about.

Where we do have strength in the quarter, we're putting the capacity there. Where we have more weakness, we are pulling that capacity out. It's still very active. It's not simply publish something in August and let that carry through for the next six months. They are still active with their adds and their deletes. Again, we think that given the overall strength in the demand, we think we've got a good schedule out there for next year.

That's just an advanced warning on that and something that we'll have to factor into our plans accordingly. Our capacity plans, again, actually help mitigate that to a degree because a lot of those cost increases are fixed. So, to the extent that we can add more capacity, it drives down the unit cost. The other point to reiterate with the capacity increase is that we believe we drive more revenue and more profits with that approach as opposed to not. It's a way of saying what are we going to do about our airport cost pressure? One of the answers is, fortunately, we have some opportunities to add some profitable capacity here in the near term.

We are very, very pleased to report what is a record third quarter earnings performance. And I want to start out by thanking all of our employees. Our people have done an extraordinary job operating an excellent airline, providing outstanding customer service and all the while building for the future, enhancing our customer brand and our customer experience. The result is another long list of revenue-related records, including a record third quarter load factor of 80.9%. 
Of course, as many of you know, we've deployed a number of revenue initiatives over the last several years. We've deployed a number of revenue management techniques that are designed to drive revenue per flight. We're continuing to optimize each published flight schedule with an emphasis on optimizing our five relatively new Southwest destinations along with a real emphasis on Denver, which has now become our fifth-largest operation and that in less than five years.
We continue to advertise and promote our low-cost, low-fare competitive advantage and our nationwide low-fare leadership and in particular with our Bags Fly Free campaign. We've added new sources of revenues such as EarlyBird and Pets Onboard, and we continue to see strong growth from relatively new sources relating to areas such as Rapid Rewards, Business Select and our Dallas Love Field New Rider Itineraries. We'll soon launch our marketing and distribution agreement with Volaris to Mexico.
Next year, we'll launch the Rapid Rewards 2.0 product. Yesterday, we announced schedules and fares for a March 13, 2011 launch of Greenville, Spartanburg and Charleston, South Carolina. Soon, we'll announce schedules and fares for a 2011 launch of Newark, New Jersey. And finally and I hope very soon, we'll acquire AirTran Airways, and that will provide a host of route, destination, profit and growth opportunities for Southwest Airlines.
In the meantime, we're evaluating the timing of bringing up a new reservation system, which, among many things, will bring us international capabilities. And then finally, we're in the final evaluation phase of whether to add the 737-800 to our fleet beginning no earlier than 2012. No commitment has been made on the -800s yet. Needless to say, we think we've got a very exciting future. We have a very full agenda for the first half of the next decade. I think we have the leadership team. We've got the people. We've got the financial resources to make all of this happen.
If I wasn't clear at the beginning, I will just say I am extremely happy with where we are with these results. There are always challenges in this very difficult airline business. But I am just glad I'm at Southwest Airlines.
So with that very brief overview, I'd like to turn it over to our tremendous Chief Financial Officer, Ms. Laura Wright."

Our third quarter GAAP net income was $205 million or $0.27 per diluted share. Excluding special items, our third quarter net income was $195 million or $0.26 per diluted share,",1861,"Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone, including our webcast listeners. Our third quarter GAAP net income was $205 million or $0.27 per diluted share. Excluding special items, our third quarter net income was $195 million or $0.26 per diluted share, a significant improvement over our third quarter 2009 earnings, excluding special items of $31 million or $0.04 per diluted share. This net income, excluding special items, produced a 6.1% net margin.
These results exceeded Wall Street's mean estimate of $0.25 per diluted share. Our third quarter operating income, excluding special items, was $388 million, resulting in a 12% operating margin, and our pretax income, excluding special items, was $315 million, resulting in a 10% pretax margin.
And on a rolling 12-month basis, our pretax return on invested capital was approximately 10%. Overall, we had a very strong quarterly performance, delivering a record third quarter profit, excluding special items, and I'd like to join Gary in congratulating our employees on these tremendous results.
Our revenue performance was very strong, continuing the momentum that we had in the first half of the year. Our passenger revenues for the quarter increased by nearly $500 million to a record $3 billion, and our other revenues increased nearly 50% or about $40 million, primarily due to $29 million of EarlyBird revenues this quarter.
When combined with our 11% improvement in freight revenues, our total operating revenues for the quarter increased almost 20% to a record $3.2 billion. On a unit basis, our passenger revenues grew 15.3%, and our operating revenues grew 16.1% on a unit basis compared to the third quarter of last year.
Our unit revenue performance in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter produced a sequential trend that was better than historical average change from the second quarter to the third quarter. Further, compared to the third quarter of 2008, our total revenues grew by $266 million on about 3% less available seat miles, resulting in a two-year unit revenue increase of 13.5%. It truly was a phenomenal revenue performance.
Our third quarter traffic levels were high, resulting in record monthly load factors each month throughout the quarter to produce a record third quarter load factor of 80.9%. Besides carrying record loads, our passenger yields were up 13.4% due to an increase in full-fare passengers and less discount and sale fares. Our third quarter full-fare mix was 18%, which is up about a point from the third quarter of last year and down about 1.5 points from the second quarter of 2010.
Demand for our Business Select product remains strong, with 21% more Business Select passengers than a year ago, producing $22 million in incremental revenue, which is up from $18 million in the third quarter of last year. We were also very pleased to see a 40% year-over-year increase in our Wright Amendment revenue with $59 million of revenues in the quarter compared to $42 million a year ago.
Month-to-date, our October passenger unit revenues are up in the 11% range from the respective year-ago period. Our October results thus far suggest a sequential change in nominal PRASM for September that, again, exceeds historical sequential average changes for this time period. Bookings thus far for the remainder of October and for November and December also look strong. However, our year-over-year PRASM comparisons may become more difficult in November and December compared to October with the last year's PRASM acceleration as the quarter progressed. Additionally, we have more difficult year-over-year capacity comparisons as we move through the fourth quarter versus what we saw in the third quarter.
So although we are encouraged to begin the fourth quarter with a similar year-over-year run rate as we experienced in September, our year-over-year comparisons for the rest of the quarter should be more difficult. That being said, the good news is that despite the mixed economic data that we read about every day, our bookings in place and our sequential revenue trends, at least thus far here in October, indicate sustained momentum of our year-to-date revenue results.
Our freight revenues increased 10.7% to $31 million, primarily due to higher average rates, and we expect that our fourth quarter freight revenues will be comparable to the third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, our other revenues increased almost 50% to $129 million, which includes $29 million in EarlyBird revenues and $14 million in revenues from pets, unaccompanied minors and excess bag charges combined, and that's versus $2 million a year ago for EarlyBird and $10 million a year ago for pets, unaccompanied minors and bags.
We expect another year-over-year increase in our other revenues in the fourth quarter but at a much lower rate than experienced in the third quarter, taking into consideration that we had $24 million in ancillary revenues in the fourth quarter of last year from these initiatives versus only $12 million in the third quarter of last year for the same initiatives as they were just being introduced.
Turning to our cost performance. Our third quarter operating expenses, excluding special items, increased to 10 ½% year-over-year. The increase was 7.1% on a unit basis, which once again, was due largely to higher fuel costs. Our economic fuel costs increased 11.7% to $2.38 per gallon. The decrease in crude oil during the quarter was essentially offset by an increase in crack spreads.
Based on the fourth quarter fuel hedge, which we provided in our press release this morning, and using the October 15 forward curve, we're currently expecting our fourth quarter economic fuel price to be in the $2.45 to $2.50 per gallon range, including taxes. Premium costs associated with our fourth quarter fuel hedge are estimated to be in the $36 million range. We will also provide a fuel sensitivity table for your reference in our Form 10-Q, which we plan to file soon. And as a reminder, the sensitivity table that we have in the 10-Q factors in the various price points and percentages of our current hedge positions, as well as the lock-in losses from the hedges that were unwound in late 2008.
For 2011, the recent volatility makes it quite difficult to give 2011 fuel guidance with any precision. However, based on the current forward curve, crude is averaging in the mid- to high-$80 per barrel range next year. So clearly, if that occurs, that would create a year-over-year headwind for us in terms of price per gallon. Using this forward curve and our existing hedges, our current estimate is about $2.60 per gallon range, which is about $0.10 above the current market price for 2011.
Excluding fuel and special items, our third quarter costs increased 5.1% on a unit basis. Higher salaries, wages and benefits accounted for over three points of the year-over-year increase, a vast majority of which was due to significantly higher profit sharing expense in the third quarter compared to a year ago. We accrued $56 million in profit sharing and $49 million in 401(k) expense, for a total benefit to our employees of $105 million in the third quarter, up from $55 million a year ago.
Excluding fuel, special items and profit-sharing expense, our unit cost increased 2.5% from a year ago. Airport costs, higher revenue-related charges and advertising costs accounted for the remainder of the year-over-year increase. 
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we continue to have inflationary cost pressures, most notably in airport and labor costs. Our labor costs typically increase sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter due to seasonal flying and associated increases with holiday pay. In addition, based on the existing contract we have with our pilots, our pilots are eligible for a profitability-based rate increase effective September 1 of 3%, and that's due to the company's earnings performance for the 12 months ended September 30. As you remember a year ago under the same formula, they did not receive a rate increase.
We also anticipate advertising cost to increase year-over-year in the fourth quarter due to targeted ad campaigns that we have scheduled. And finally, we expect our fourth quarter maintenance unit cost to be similar to third quarter at $0.77, which is higher than last year's fourth quarter maintenance cost at $0.69. Based on these cost trends, we're estimating another year-over-year increase in our fourth quarter nonfuel unit cost currently in the 6% range.
Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. As we reported in this morning's release, we currently have approximately $3.7 billion in core unrestricted cash and short-term investments and our $600 million credit facility remains fully undrawn and available. Our leverage, including aircraft leases, is forecast to be around 40% by year end. We generated $285 million in free cash flow for the quarter, and our year-to-date cash flow from operations are approximately $1.3 billion, with almost $900 million in free cash flow.
We currently expect that our 2010 capital spending will be less than $500 million. And for 2011, we're currently forecasting capital spending to be in the $800 million to $900 million range.
Turning to fleet capacity. During the quarter, we acquired three 700s from Boeing, and we ended the quarter with a fleet of 547 airplanes. We expect to take delivery of one more aircraft from Boeing this year, and we are picking up three leased aircraft in the secondary market, one of which is expected to be delivered by the end of the year and the other two early next year. The three additional aircraft are being leased solely to cover additional maintenance flyings needed for elective maintenance needs that we have opted to accelerate over the next several years.
Based on six planned retirements this year, we expect to end the year with 546 airplanes and for 2011, we have 14 firm orders from Boeing and the two leased aircraft that I just mentioned, and we're going to have 16 retirements. So we will end 2011 with flat fleet. So absent the AirTran acquisition, we are not planning for any fleet growth next year. As far as capacity plans, our fourth quarter capacity is expected to be up approximately 5.3% year-over-year, and our full year 2010 capacity still remains flat with 2009 at 0.4%.
For 2011, as demand has continued to strengthen, we have attractive opportunities to better utilize our existing fleet, and we're currently expecting to increase our capacity in the first quarter of next year in the 8% range and in the second quarter in the 5% range.
In fact, our schedule optimization is allowing us to add three new cities next year, two of which are Charleston and Greenville, which we announced service plans for yesterday. Charleston will have seven daily departures to four cities beginning on March 13. And Greenville, Spartanburg will have seven daily departures to five cities also beginning on March 13. And as previously announced, we are excited to begin service to Newark in March of 2011 pursuant to our lease agreement with Continental for 36 slots. In closing, we continue to closely monitor demand, and we do remain prepared to adjust our schedule accordingly. 
And Tom, with that overview, Gary and I are ready to take questions."

So if you compare fourth quarter '10 to fourth quarter '08, at least with the forecast that I have in my mind, it's going to be a very handsome increase. Obviously, we started to see pretty significant improvement in fourth quarter '09. So that one won't be as good. But I think at least for the fourth quarter of '10 that the two-year-ago number is still a decent comparison. We've started looking back at '07. We've started looking back at sort of a basket of years to compare to because you run into such distortions with '09 and even the latter part of '08. But every way we look at it and, Laura, again, I just have to re-emphasize her point, the fact that October appears to us the way it does compared to September, August, July is very meaningful. So it suggests that we are continuing to build momentum. And I think that's logical because you haven't seen the full return of the business traveler. And if one believes that, that is gradually occurring over time, all else being equal, you ought to continue to see a strengthening in revenue movement. That be a prediction earlier this year and so far, that's playing out pretty well. But we're not seeing the levels of business traffic at Southwest that we had in '07 and '08. And certainly, what I've heard from counterparts around the industry, no one is representing that their business travel has recovered to that level. So you've got that upside in any event."

Marketing has recently done some surveys to try to get a sense of what our mix of business travelers is compared to other airlines’. If you extrapolate that into the number of customers that we carry, we're among the leaders in the country in terms of the number of business customers that we serve. Arguably, historically, at least last couple of years, we've been the largest. With Delta, Northwest combining and now United, Continental. They will probably outboard us in terms of business customers. So the point is we already serve a whole bunch of business customers. Clearly, we're gaining share. That's an undeniable fact domestically. We're gaining share relative to the last several years. A lot of that share is consumer, but it's also business travelers. So just with the product enhancements we've made, giving the road warriors more choice, we do believe that we're seeing more business customers come Southwest’s way. But there's a variety of things going on in our 16.1% unit revenue improvement. And so there, we've deployed 10 different initiatives or more, and it's hard for us to piece apart what value is being driven by each one. But again, we want to share that with you all when we have more time to do that. But what I hear from business customers is the fact that we've introduced an enhanced boarding process with the Business Select product, with enhanced frequent-flyer benefits and has caused them to change their flying behavior and bring their business to Southwest. And the fact that we allow for flexibility in changing flights, where we do not charge the change fee, is huge with business customers. The bag fees maybe not so much. I think that's probably more benefit for consumers. But even the bag fees I think is an attribute that some business customers like. So I think it's a basket of things. Clearly, there's much better revenue management than there was three years ago. There is much better schedule optimization than there was three years ago. We've created itineraries that are more marketable for connecting customers, our connecting passengers are up more than our nonstop passengers. They are not at the expense of nonstops, so we're still carrying the same amount of nonstop passengers. The increase of the load factor has been driven more by carrying more connecting passengers, and so one would infer that, that could be more heavily weighted towards consumers. But I think it's a variety of things and in fact, Mike, with the recession, what you know you always find with a drop in business travel, that's sort of our bread-and-butter, short-haul markets, and they are lagging in the recovery compared to our medium- and longer-haul markets for that reason. So I do think that when the business traveler does come back, we're going to see hopefully a very strong response, especially in our short-haul routes."

The opportunity for us is twofold, but the easier one to visualize is there are at least two dozen cities in our route system that AirTran does not serve. So those are simple. You go in. We see that the fares are quite high. We know we can come in, lower the fares, stimulate the market. It will be additive, in other words, to the AirTran route system. That is huge. Campbell-Hill came up with an estimate of 2 million incremental O&D passengers. Well, we just looked at that subset of markets. Our number wasn't 2 million, but it was still really big. In addition to that, so I'm moving on to the next argument. In addition to that, the AirTran route system is probably not fully fleshed out. So in other words, even where they do have service, especially if it's service to an existing Southwest city, we see the opportunity to at least consider adding frequencies and tap into the strength that we have on the destination submarket. So we're sort of loathe to tell our competitors our game plan, but an obvious one is Chicago Midway, where we have a lot of customers in Chicago. It's one of our largest cities that we operate from. We may very well have opportunities to add to the AirTran route map and generate a lot more customers. Then there's probably places that we don't serve that AirTran does where they may not have enough frequencies either. And of course, in 2008, they were forced for economic reasons to withdraw a lot of capacity from Atlanta because of high fuel prices. Well some of that could at least in theory be considered for restoration. So I really think it's three basic pools of opportunities there. But according to Campbell-Hill, if you look at all of those three in aggregate, it's an annual opportunity of about 2 million incremental passengers."

In terms of why the sequential trends, I think it maybe goes back to some of the discussion that we had with Mike Linenberg and Gary's response to his question. There seems to be a lot of factors working together out there. Certainly, what we've seen at Southwest is increased loads, record load factors in 14 of the last 15 months. So we're slowly picking up business traffic but at the same time, we seem to be picking up more incremental leisure traffic as well. So it just seems to be a very good combination for us.

And I think it's possible that the air travel demand and, Gary, you all may have a better sense of this than I do since you look at every airline and you aggregate these things at least faster than we do sometimes. But I mean, there could be a pickup in the air travel demand market. I would predict that over time, there is a gradual return of the business traveler. So that might help support, and that was a point that I made earlier. This is a view that we have, and I don't know that it's shared by all. So it's just a view. But I do think that the economic environment -- I think it's hard to find anybody who thinks that the economy is really strong. So I do think that the environment is such that consumers especially are looking for value. I read all the time about business travelers looking for value and buying in advance to get better ticket prices as an example. And that's an environment where we really shine. And the Bags Fly Free message, of course, just pounds home what a low-fare philosophy that we have at Southwest Airlines. So I continue to believe that we're going to continue to outperform our competitors. These are Laura Wright's comments saying that at Southwest Airlines, we're seeing this escalation seasonally. So I don't know that we're going to find that that's true for the industry. I think that our product is getting better every year, and we're continuing to add new features and functions, and I think that, that's all a plus. And there's just a fair amount of excitement that we feel within the company and I sense that without that we're doing some things. I think the fact that we've added five new cities in the last 18 months is huge because it's not just exciting for the people in Boston, LaGuardia, Minneapolis, Panama City and Milwaukee, it's the rest of our system that has now another flight opportunity on Southwest Airlines. And there aren't any real competitors that are able to offer the same kind of -- I think, it's a wow factor. There are others that might say it's not such of a wow factor. But it's great fun for us to be able to announce yesterday South Carolina as an example."

The fact that we are seeing such strength in October is very material to what we are contemplating for the first quarter. I think we're going to have another record load factor in October. I think we'll have another record load factor in November. I'm not predicting it. I'm just trying to set the stage for why we believe that the capacity plan for next year is appropriate. We see very strong demand for the next 60 to 90 days, which we think will carry through to the first quarter of next year, with an optimized schedule that has new markets in it, at least in our view, will justify that amount of flight activity. It certainly, and I think Dan made this point earlier that the fact that we can add that capacity at an incremental cost makes the profit opportunity quite handsome for all the obvious reasons. So I'm comfortable with it. And hopefully, that's -- we're not doing it with more airplanes.

And we all understand how long-lived those construction plans and projects and processes are. But that's a fact that's kind of confounded us. So far we've seen very significant increases in our airport costs this year. And the concern is that we'll see another significant increase next year. So that's just sort of an advance warning on that and something that we'll have to factor into our plans accordingly. Our capacity plans, again, actually help mitigate that to a degree because a lot of those cost increases are fixed. So to the extent that we can add more capacity, it drives down the unit cost. The other point to reiterate with the capacity increase is that we believe we drive more revenue and more profits with that approach as opposed to not. So it's a way of saying, ""What are we going to do about our airport cost pressure?"" One of the answers is, ""Fortunately, we have some opportunities to add some profitable capacity here in the near-term."""

And oh my, what a difference a year makes. We are very, very pleased to report what is a record third quarter earnings performance.

We are very, very pleased to report what is a record third quarter earnings performance. And I want to start out by thanking all of our employees. Our people have done an extraordinary job operating an excellent airline, providing outstanding customer service and all the while building for the future, enhancing our customer brand and our customer experience. The result is another long list of revenue-related records, including a record third quarter load factor of 80.9%. 
Of course, as many of you know, we've deployed a number of revenue initiatives over the last several years. We've deployed a number of revenue management techniques that are designed to drive revenue per flight. We're continuing to optimize each published flight schedule with an emphasis on optimizing our five relatively new Southwest destinations along with a real emphasis on Denver, which has now become our fifth-largest operation and that in less than five years.
We continue to advertise and promote our low-cost, low-fare competitive advantage and our nationwide low-fare leadership and in particular with our Bags Fly Free campaign. We've added new sources of revenues such as EarlyBird and Pets Onboard, and we continue to see strong growth from relatively new sources relating to areas such as Rapid Rewards, Business Select and our Dallas Love Field New Rider Itineraries. We'll soon launch our marketing and distribution agreement with Volaris to Mexico.
Next year, we'll launch the Rapid Rewards 2.0 product. Yesterday, we announced schedules and fares for a March 13, 2011 launch of Greenville-Spartanburg and Charleston, South Carolina. Soon, we'll announce schedules and fares for a 2011 launch of Newark, New Jersey. And finally and I hope very soon, we'll acquire AirTran Airways, and that will provide a host of route, destination, profit and growth opportunities for Southwest Airlines.
In the meantime, we're evaluating the timing of bringing up a new reservation system, which, among many things, will bring us international capabilities. And then finally, we're in the final evaluation phase of whether to add the 737-800 to our fleet beginning no earlier than 2012. No commitment has been made on the -800s yet. Needless to say, we think we've got a very exciting future. We have a very full agenda for the first half of the next decade. I think we have the leadership team. We've got the people. We've got the financial resources to make all of this happen.
If I wasn't clear in the beginning, I will just say I am extremely happy with where we are with these results. There are always challenges in this very difficult airline business. But I am just glad I'm at Southwest Airlines.
So with that very brief overview, I'd like to turn it over to our tremendous Chief Financial Officer, Ms. Laura Wright."

Our third quarter GAAP net income was $205 million or $0.27 per diluted share. Excluding special items, our third quarter net income was $195 million or $0.26 per diluted share,",1858,"Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone, including our webcast listeners. Our third quarter GAAP net income was $205 million or $0.27 per diluted share. Excluding special items, our third quarter net income was $195 million or $0.26 per diluted share, a significant improvement over our third quarter 2009 earnings, excluding special items of $31 million or $0.04 per diluted share. This net income, excluding special items, produced a 6.1% net margin.
These results exceeded Wall Street's mean estimate of $0.25 per diluted share. Our third quarter operating income, excluding special items, was $388 million, resulting in a 12% operating margin, and our pretax income, excluding special items, was $315 million, resulting in a 10% pretax margin.
And on a rolling 12-month basis, our pretax return on invested capital was approximately 10%. Overall, we had a very strong quarterly performance, delivering a record third quarter profit, excluding special items, and I'd like to join Gary in congratulating our employees on these tremendous results.
Our revenue performance was very strong, continuing the momentum that we had in the first half of the year. Our passenger revenues for the quarter increased by nearly $500 million to a record $3 billion, and our other revenues increased nearly 50% or about $40 million, primarily due to $29 million of EarlyBird revenues this quarter.
When combined with our 11% improvement in freight revenues, our total operating revenues for the quarter increased almost 20% to a record $3.2 billion. On a unit basis, our passenger revenues grew 15.3%, and our operating revenues grew 16.1% on a unit basis compared to the third quarter of last year.
Our unit revenue performance in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter produced a sequential trend that was better than historical average change from the second quarter to the third quarter. Further, compared to the third quarter of 2008, our total revenues grew by $266 million on about 3% less available seat miles, resulting in a two-year unit revenue increase of 13.5%. It truly was a phenomenal revenue performance.
Our third quarter traffic levels were high, resulting in record monthly load factors each month throughout the quarter to produce a record third quarter load factor of 80.9%. Besides carrying record loads, our passenger yields were up 13.4% due to an increase in full-fare passengers and less discount and sale fares. Our third quarter full-fare mix was 18%, which is up about a point from the third quarter of last year and down about 1.5 points from the second quarter of 2010.
Demand for our Business Select product remains strong, with 21% more Business Select passengers than a year ago, producing $22 million in incremental revenue, which is up from $18 million in the third quarter of last year. We were also very pleased to see a 40% year-over-year increase in our Wright Amendment revenue with $59 million of revenues in the quarter compared to $42 million a year ago.
Month-to-date, our October passenger unit revenues are up in the 11% range from the respective year-ago period. Our October results thus far suggest a sequential change in nominal PRASM for September that, again, exceeds historical sequential average changes for this time period. Bookings thus far for the remainder of October and for November and December also look strong. However, our year-over-year PRASM comparisons do become more difficult in November and December compared to October due to last year's PRASM acceleration as the quarter progressed. Additionally, we have more difficult year-over-year capacity comparisons as we move through the fourth quarter versus what we saw in the third quarter.
So although we are encouraged to begin the fourth quarter with a similar year-over-year run rate as we experienced in September, our year-over-year comparisons for the rest of the quarter should be more difficult. That being said, the good news is that despite the mixed economic data that we read about every day, our bookings in place and our sequential revenue trends, at least thus far here in October, indicate sustained momentum of our year-to-date revenue results.
Our freight revenues increased 10.7% to $31 million, primarily due to higher average rates, and we expect that our fourth quarter freight revenues will be comparable to the third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, our other revenues increased almost 50% to $129 million, which includes $29 million in EarlyBird revenues and $14 million in revenues from pets, unaccompanied minors and excess bag charges combined, and that's versus $2 million a year ago for EarlyBird and $10 million a year ago for pets, unaccompanied minors and bags.
We expect another year-over-year increase in our other revenues in the fourth quarter but at a much lower rate than experienced in the third quarter, taking into consideration that we had $24 million in ancillary revenues in the fourth quarter of last year from these initiatives versus only $12 million in the third quarter of last year for these same initiatives as they were just being introduced.
Turning to our cost performance. Our third quarter operating expenses, excluding special items, increased 10 ½% year-over-year. The increase was 7.1% on a unit basis, which once again, was due largely to higher fuel costs. Our economic fuel costs increased 11.7% to $2.38 per gallon. The decrease in crude oil during the quarter was essentially offset by an increase in crack spreads.
Based on the fourth quarter fuel hedge, which we provided in our press release this morning, and using the October 15 forward curve, we're currently expecting our fourth quarter economic fuel price to be in the $2.45 to $2.50 per gallon range, including taxes. Premium costs associated with our fourth quarter fuel hedge are estimated to be in the $36 million range. We will also provide a fuel sensitivity table for your reference in our Form 10-Q, which we plan to file soon. And as a reminder, the sensitivity table that we have in the 10-Q factors in the various price points and percentages of our current hedge positions, as well as the lock-in losses from the hedges that were unwound in late 2008.
For 2011, the recent volatility makes it quite difficult to give 2011 fuel guidance with any precision. However, based on the current forward curve, crude is averaging in the mid- to high-$80 per barrel range next year. So clearly, if that occurs, that would create a year-over-year headwind for us in terms of price per gallon. Using this forward curve and our existing hedges, our current estimate is about $2.60 per gallon range, which is about $0.10 above the current market price for 2011.
Excluding fuel and special items, our third quarter costs increased 5.1% on a unit basis. Higher salaries, wages and benefits accounted for over three points of the year-over-year increase, a vast majority of which was due to significantly higher profit sharing expense in the third quarter compared to a year ago. We accrued $56 million in profit sharing and $49 million in 401(k) expense, for a total benefit to our employees of $105 million in the third quarter, up from $55 million a year ago.
Excluding fuel, special items and profit-sharing expense, our unit cost increased 2.5% from a year ago. Airport costs, higher revenue-related charges and advertising costs accounted for the remainder of the year-over-year increase. 
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we continue to have inflationary cost pressures, most notably in airport and labor costs. Our labor costs typically increase sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter due to seasonal flying and associated increases with holiday pay. In addition, based on the existing contract we have with our pilots, our pilots are eligible for a profitability-based rate increase effective September 1 of 3%, and that's due to the company's earnings performance for the 12 months ended September 30. As you remember a year ago under the same formula, they did not receive a rate increase.
We also anticipate advertising cost to increase year-over-year in the fourth quarter due to targeted ad campaigns that we have scheduled. And finally, we expect our fourth quarter maintenance unit cost to be similar to third quarter's$0.77, which is higher than last year's fourth quarter maintenance cost of $0.69. Based on these cost trends, we're estimating another year-over-year increase in our fourth quarter nonfuel unit cost currently in the 6% range.
Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. As we reported in this morning's release, we currently have approximately $3.7 billion in core unrestricted cash and short-term investments and our $600 million credit facility remains fully undrawn and available. Our leverage, including aircraft leases, is forecast to be around 40% by year end. We generated $285 million in free cash flow for the quarter, and our year-to-date cash flow from operations are approximately $1.3 billion, with almost $900 million in free cash flow.
We currently expect that our 2010 capital spending will be less than $500 million. And for 2011, we're currently forecasting capital spending to be in the $800 million to $900 million range.
Turning to fleet capacity. During the quarter, we acquired three 700s from Boeing, and we ended the quarter with a fleet of 547 airplanes. We expect to take delivery of one more aircraft from Boeing this year, and we are picking up three leased aircraft in the secondary market, one of which is expected to be delivered by the end of the year and the other two early next year. The three additional aircraft are being leased solely to cover additional maintenance flyings needed for elective maintenance needs that we have opted to accelerate over the next several years.
Based on six planned retirements this year, we expect to end the year with 546 airplanes and for 2011, we have 14 firm orders from Boeing and the two leased aircraft that I just mentioned, and we're going to have 16 retirements. So we will end 2011 with flat fleet. So absent the AirTran acquisition, we are not planning for any fleet growth next year. As far as capacity plans, our fourth quarter capacity is expected to be up approximately 5.3% year-over-year, and our full year 2010 capacity still remains flat with 2009 at 0.4%.
For 2011, as demand has continued to strengthen, we have attractive opportunities to better utilize our existing fleet, and we're currently expecting to increase our capacity in the first quarter of next year in the 8% range and in the second quarter in the 5% range.
In fact, our schedule optimization is allowing us to add three new cities next year, two of which are Charleston and Greenville, which we announced service plans for yesterday. Charleston will have seven daily departures to four cities beginning on March 13. And Greenville, Spartanburg will have seven daily departures to five cities also beginning on March 13. And as previously announced, we are excited to begin service to Newark in March of 2011 pursuant to our lease agreement with Continental for 36 slots. In closing, we continue to closely monitor demand, and we do remain prepared to adjust our schedule accordingly. 
And Tom, with that overview, Gary and I are ready to take questions."

We think we have a strong case, and I don't want to speak for AirTran, but I know they wouldn't have entered into the agreement unless they felt the same thing.

But I think at least for the fourth quarter of '10 that the two-year-ago number is still a decent comparison. We've started looking back at '07. We've started looking back at sort of a basket of years to compare to because you run into such distortions with '09 and even the latter part of '08. But every way we look at it and, Laura, again, I just have to re-emphasize her point, the fact that October appears to us the way it does compared to September, August, July is very meaningful. So it suggests that we are continuing to build momentum. And I think that's logical because you haven't seen the full return of the business traveler. And if one believes that, that is gradually occurring over time, all else being equal, you ought to continue to see a strengthening in revenue movement.

If you extrapolate that into the number of customers that we carry, we're among the leaders in the country in terms of the number of business customers that we serve. Arguably, historically, at least last couple of years, we've been the largest. With Delta/Northwest combining and now United/Continental, they will probably outboard us in terms of business customers. So the point is we already serve a whole bunch of business customers. Clearly, we're gaining share. That's an undeniable fact domestically. We're gaining share relative to the last several years. A lot of that share is consumer, but it's also business travelers. So just with the product enhancements we've made, giving the road warriors more choice, we do believe that we're seeing more business customers come Southwest’s way. But there's a variety of things going on in our 16.1% unit revenue improvement. And so there, we've deployed 10 different initiatives or more, and it's hard for us to piece apart what value is being driven by each one. But again, we want to share that with you all when we have more time to do that. But what I hear from business customers is the fact that we've introduced an enhanced boarding process with the Business Select product with enhanced frequent-flyer benefits has caused them to change their flying behavior and bring their business to Southwest. And the fact that we allow for flexibility in changing flights, where we do not charge the change fee, is huge with business customers. The bag fees maybe not so much. I think that's probably more a benefit for consumers. But even the bag fees I think is an attribute that some business customers like. So I think it's a basket of things. Clearly, there's much better revenue management than there was three years ago. There is much better schedule optimization than there was three years ago. We've created itineraries that are more marketable for connecting customers, our connecting passengers are up more than our nonstop passengers. They are not at the expense of nonstops, so we're still carrying the same amount of nonstop passengers. The increase of the load factor has been driven more by carrying more connecting passengers, and so one would infer that, that could be more heavily weighted towards consumers. But I think it's a variety of things and in fact, Mike, with the recession, what you know you always find with a drop in business travel, that's sort of our bread-and-butter, short-haul markets, and they are lagging in the recovery compared to our medium- and longer-haul markets for that reason. So I do think that when the business traveler does come back, we're going to see hopefully a very strong response, especially in our short-haul routes."

One of the things you mentioned in your press release is the Southwest effect and you referred to it earlier. But there is also a countervailing view that AirTran stimulated a lot of demand in Atlanta already with low fares. So how do I reconcile those two that there's this opportunity for you to stimulate in markets where I would have thought they already had some pretty low fares?"

The opportunity for us is twofold, but the easier one to visualize is there are at least two dozen cities in our route system that AirTran does not serve. So those are simple. You go in. We see that the fares are quite high. We know we can come in, lower the fares, stimulate the market. It will be additive, in other words, to the AirTran route system. That is huge. Campbell-Hill came up with an estimate of 2 million incremental O&D passengers. Well, we just looked at that subset of markets. Our number wasn't 2 million, but it was still really big. In addition to that, so I'm moving on to the next argument. In addition to that, the AirTran route system is probably not fully fleshed out. So in other words, even where they do have service, especially if it's service to an existing Southwest city, we see the opportunity to at least consider adding frequencies and tap into the strength that we have on the destination submarket. So we're sort of loathe to tell our competitors our game plan, but an obvious one is Chicago Midway, where we have a lot of customers in Chicago. It's one of our largest cities that we operate from. We may very well have opportunities to add to the AirTran route map and generate a lot more customers. Then there's probably places that we don't serve that AirTran does where they may not have enough frequencies either. And of course, in 2008, they were forced for economic reasons to withdraw a lot of capacity from Atlanta because of high fuel prices. Well some of that could at least in theory be considered for restoration. So I really think it's three basic pools of opportunities there. But according to Campbell-Hill, if you look at all of those three in aggregate, it's an annual opportunity of about 2 million incremental passengers."

So first of all, we thought they were -- we were pleased with the results. In terms of why the sequential trends, I think it maybe goes back to some of the discussion that we had with Mike Linenberg and Gary's response to his question. There seems to be a lot of factors working together out there. Certainly, what we've seen at Southwest is increased loads, record load factors in 14 of the last 15 months. So we're slowly picking up business traffic but at the same time, we seem to be picking up more incremental leisure traffic as well. So it just seems to be a very good combination for us. In terms of the -- I'm not sure I can answer what's driving the overall macro recovery. Anything you want to add, Gary?"

And I think it's possible that the air travel demand and, Gary, you all may have a better sense of this than I do since you look at every airline and you aggregate these things at least faster than we do sometimes. But I mean, there could be a pickup in the air travel demand market. I would predict that over time, there is a gradual return of the business traveler. So that might help support, and that was a point that I made earlier. This is a view that we have, and I don't know that it's shared by all. So it's just a view. But I do think that the economic environment -- I think it's hard to find anybody who thinks that the economy is really strong. So I do think that the environment is such that consumers especially are looking for value. I read all the time about business travelers looking for value and buying in advance to get better ticket prices as an example. And that's an environment where we really shine. And the Bags Fly Free message, of course, just pounds home what a low-fare philosophy that we have at Southwest Airlines. So I continue to believe that we're going to continue to outperform our competitors. These are Laura Wright's comments saying that at Southwest Airlines, we're seeing this escalation seasonally. So I don't know that we're going to find that that's true for the industry. I think that our product is getting better every year, and we're continuing to add new features and functions, and I think that, that's all a plus. And there's just a fair amount of excitement that we feel within the company and I sense that without that we're doing some things. I think the fact that we've added five new cities in the last 18 months is huge because it's not just exciting for the people in Boston, LaGuardia, Minneapolis, Panama City and Milwaukee, it's the rest of our system that has now another flight opportunity on Southwest Airlines. And there aren't any real competitors that are able to offer the same kind of -- I think, it's a wow factor. There are others that might say it's not such of a wow factor. But it's great fun for us to be able to announce yesterday South Carolina as an example."

The fact that we are seeing such strength in October is very material to what we are contemplating for the first quarter. I think we're going to have another record load factor in October. I think we'll have another record load factor in November. I'm not predicting it. I'm just trying to set the stage for why we believe that the capacity plan for next year is appropriate. We see very strong demand for the next 60 to 90 days, which we think will carry through to the first quarter of next year, with an optimized schedule that has new markets in it that, at least in our view, will justify that amount of flight activity. It certainly, and I think Dan made this point earlier that the fact that we can add that capacity at an incremental cost makes the profit opportunity quite handsome for all the obvious reasons. So I'm comfortable with it. And hopefully, that's -- we're not doing it with more airplanes.

So that's just sort of an advance warning on that and something that we'll have to factor into our plans accordingly. Our capacity plans, again, actually help mitigate that to a degree because a lot of those cost increases are fixed. So to the extent that we can add more capacity, it drives down the unit cost. The other point to reiterate with the capacity increase is that we believe we drive more revenue and more profits with that approach as opposed to not. So it's a way of saying, ""What are we going to do about our airport cost pressure?"" One of the answers is, ""Fortunately, we have some opportunities to add some profitable capacity here in the near-term."""

The result is another long list of revenue-related records, including a record third quarter load factor of 80.9%. 
Of course, as many of you know, we've deployed a number of revenue initiatives over the last several years. We've deployed a number of revenue management techniques that are designed to drive revenue per flight. We're continuing to optimize each published flight schedule with an emphasis on optimizing our five relatively new Southwest destinations along with a real emphasis on Denver, which has now become our fifth-largest operation and that in less than five years.
We continue to advertise and promote our low-cost, low-fare competitive advantage in our nationwide low-fare leadership and in particular with our Bags Fly Free campaign. We've added new sources of revenues such as EarlyBird and Pets Onboard. We continue to see strong growth from relatively new sources relating to areas such as Rapid Rewards, Business Select and our Dallas Love Field itineraries. We'll soon launch our marketing and distribution agreement with Volaris to Mexico.
Next year, we'll launch the Rapid Rewards 2.0 product. Yesterday, we announced schedules and fares for a March 13, 2011, launch of Greenville, Spartanburg and Charleston, South Carolina. Soon, we'll announce schedules and fares for a 2011 launch of Newark, New Jersey. And finally and I hope very soon, we'll acquire AirTran Airways, and that will provide a host of route, destination, profit and growth opportunities for Southwest Airlines.
In the meantime, we're evaluating the timing of bringing up a new reservation system, which, among many things, will bring us international capabilities. And then finally, we're in the final evaluation phase of whether to add the 737-800 to our fleet beginning no earlier than 2012. No commitment has been made on the -800s yet. Needless to say, we think we've got a very exciting future. We have a very full agenda for the first half of the next decade. I think we have the leadership team. We've got the people. We've got the financial resources to make all of this happen.
If I wasn't clear at the beginning, I will just say I am extremely happy with where we are with these results. There are always challenges in this very difficult airline business. But I am just glad I'm at Southwest Airlines.
So with that very brief overview, I'd like to turn it over to our tremendous Chief Financial Officer, Ms. Laura Wright."
31726,84500224,93431,"Southwest Airlines Co., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2010",2010-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Southwest Airlines Co.","Executives","Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone, including our webcast listeners. Our third quarter GAAP net income was $205 million or $0.27 per diluted share. Excluding special items, our third quarter net income was $195 million or $0.26 per diluted share,",1861,"Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone, including our webcast listeners. Our third quarter GAAP net income was $205 million or $0.27 per diluted share. Excluding special items, our third quarter net income was $195 million or $0.26 per diluted share, a significant improvement over our third quarter 2009 earnings, excluding special items of $31 million or $0.04 per diluted share. This net income, excluding special items, produced a 6.1% net margin.
These results exceeded Wall Street's mean estimate of $0.25 per diluted share. Our third quarter operating income, excluding special items, was $388 million, resulting in a 12% operating margin, and our pretax income, excluding special items, was $315 million, resulting in a 10% pretax margin.
And on a rolling 12-month basis, our pretax return on invested capital was approximately 10%. Overall, we had a very strong quarterly performance, delivering a record third quarter profit, excluding special items, and I'd like to join Gary in congratulating our employees on these tremendous results.
Our revenue performance was very strong, continuing the momentum that we had in the first half of the year. Our passenger revenues for the quarter increased by nearly $500 million to a record $3 billion, and our other revenues increased nearly 50% or about $40 million, primarily due to $29 million of EarlyBird revenues this quarter.
When combined with our 11% improvement in freight revenues, our total operating revenues for the quarter increased almost 20% to a record $3.2 billion. On a unit basis, our passenger revenues grew 15.3%, and our operating revenues grew 16.1% on a unit basis compared to the third quarter of last year.
Our unit revenue performance in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter produced a sequential trends that was better than historical average change from the second quarter to the third quarter. Further, compared to the third quarter of 2008, our total revenues grew by $266 million on about 3% less available seat miles, resulting in a two-year unit revenue increase of 13.5%. It truly was a phenomenal revenue performance.
Our third quarter traffic levels were high, resulting in record monthly load factors each month throughout the quarter to produce a record third quarter load factor of 80.9%. Besides carrying record loads, our passenger yields were up 13.4% due to an increase in full-fare passengers and less discount in sell fares. Our third quarter full-fare mix was 18%, which is up about a point from the third quarter of last year and down about 1.5 points from the second quarter of 2010.
Demand for our Business Select product remains strong, with 21% more Business Select passengers than a year ago, producing $22 million in incremental revenue, which is up from $18 million in the third quarter of last year. We were also very pleased to see a 40% year-over-year increase in our Wright Amendment revenue with $59 million of revenues in the quarter compared to $42 million a year ago.
Month-to-date, our October passenger unit revenues are up in the 11% range from the respective year ago period. Our October results thus far suggest a sequential change in nominal PRASM for September that, again, exceeds historical sequential average changes for this time period. Bookings thus far for the remainder of October and for November and December also look strong. However, our year-over-year PRASM comparisons may become more difficult in November and December compared to October with the last year's PRASM acceleration as the quarter progressed. Additionally, we have more difficult year-over-year capacity comparisons as we move through the fourth quarter versus what we saw in the third quarter.
So although we are encouraged to begin the fourth quarter with a similar year-over-year run rate as we experienced in September, our year-over-year comparisons for the rest of the quarter should be more difficult. That being said, the good news is that despite the mixed economic data that we read about everyday, our bookings in place and our sequential revenue trends, at least thus far here in October, indicate sustained momentum of our year-to-date revenue results.
Our freight revenues increased 10.7% to $31 million, primarily due to higher average rates, and we expect that our fourth quarter freight revenues will be comparable to the third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, our other revenues increased almost 50% to $129 million, which includes $29 million in EarlyBird revenues and $14 million in revenues from pets, unaccompanied minors and excess bag charges combined, and that's versus $2 million a year ago for EarlyBird and $10 million a year ago for pets, unaccompanied minors and bags.
We expect another year-over-year increase in our other revenues in the fourth quarter but at a much lower rate than experienced in the third quarter, taking into consideration that we had $24 million in ancillary revenues in the fourth quarter of last year from these initiatives versus only $12 million in the third quarter of last year from the same initiatives as they were just being introduced.
Turning to our cost performance. Our third quarter operating expenses, excluding special items, increased to 10.5% year-over-year. The increase was 7.1% on a unit basis, which once again, was due largely to higher fuel costs. Our economic fuel costs increased 11.7% to $2.38 per gallon. The decrease in crude oil during the quarter was essentially offset by an increase in crack spreads.
Based on the fourth quarter fuel hedge, which we provided in our press release this morning, and using the October 15 forward curve, we're currently expecting our fourth quarter economic fuel price to be in the $2.45 to $2.50 per gallon range, including taxes. Premium costs associated with our fourth quarter fuel hedge are estimated to be in the $36 million range. We will also provide a fuel sensitivity table for your reference in our Form 10-Q, which we plan to file soon. And as a reminder, the sensitivity table that we have in the 10-Q factors in the various price points and percentages of our current hedge positions, as well as the lock-in losses from the hedges that were unwound in late 2008.
For 2011, the recent volatility makes it quite difficult to give 2011 fuel guidance with any precision. However, based on the current forward curve, crude is averaging in the mid- to high $80 per barrel range next year. So clearly, if that occurs, that would create a year-over-year headwind for us in terms of price per gallon. Using this forward curve and our existing hedges, our current estimate is about $2.60 per gallon range, which is about $0.10 above the current market price for 2011.
Excluding fuel and special items, our third quarter cost increased 5.1% on a unit basis. Higher salaries, wages and benefits accounted for over three points of the year-over-year increase, a vast majority of which was due to significantly higher profit sharing expense in the third quarter compared to a year ago. We accrued $56 million in profit sharing and $49 million in 401(k) expense, for a total benefit to our employees of $105 million in the third quarter, up from $55 million a year ago.
Excluding fuel, special items and profit-sharing expense, our unit cost increased 2.5% from a year ago. Airport costs, higher revenue-related charges and advertising costs accounted for the remainder of the year-over-year increase. 
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we continue to have inflationary cost pressures, most notably in airport and labor costs. Our labor costs typically increased sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter due to seasonal flying and associated increases with holiday pay. In addition, based on the existing contract we have with our pilots, our pilots are eligible for a profitability-based rate increase effective September 1 of 3%, and that's due to the company's earnings performance for the 12 months ended September 30. As you remember a year ago under the same formula, they did not receive a rate increase.
We also anticipate advertising cost to increase year-over-year in the fourth quarter due to targeted ad campaigns that we have scheduled. And finally, we expect our fourth quarter maintenance unit cost to be similar to third quarter at $0.77, which is higher than last year's fourth quarter maintenance cost at $0.69. Based on these cost trends, we're estimating another year-over-year increase in our fourth quarter nonfuel unit cost currently in the 6% range.
Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. As we reported in this morning's release, we currently have approximately $3.7 billion in core unrestricted cash and short-term investments and our $600 million credit facility remains fully undrawn and available. Our leverage, including aircraft leases, is forecast to be around 40% by year end. We generated $285 million in free cash flow for the quarter, and our year-to-date cash flow from operations are approximately $1.3 billion, with almost $900 million in free cash flow.
We currently expect that our 2010 capital spending will be less than $500 million. And for 2011, we're currently forecasting capital spending to be in the $800 million to $900 million range.
Turning to fleet capacity. During the quarter, we acquired three 700s from Boeing, and we ended the quarter with a fleet of 547 airplanes. We expect to take delivery of one more aircraft from Boeing this year, and we are picking up three lease aircraft in the secondary market, one of which is expected to be delivered by the end of the year and the other two early next year. The three additional aircraft are being leased solely to cover additional maintenance flyings needed for elective maintenance needs that we have opted to accelerate over the next several years.
Based on six planned retirements this year, we expect to end the year with 546 airplanes and for 2011, we have 14 firm orders from Boeing and the two leased aircraft that I just mentioned, and we're going to have 16 retirements. So we will end 2011 with flat fleet. So absent the AirTran acquisition, we are not planning for any fleet growth next year. As far as capacity plans, our fourth quarter capacity is expected to be up approximately 5.3% year-over-year, and our full year 2010 capacity still remains flat with 2009 at 0.4%.
For 2011, as demand has continued to strengthen, we have attracted opportunities to better utilize our existing fleet, and we're currently expecting to increase our capacity in the first quarter of next year in the 8% range and in the second quarter in the 5% range.
In fact, our schedule optimization is allowing us to add three new cities next year, two of which are Charleston and Greenville, which we announced service plans for yesterday. Charleston will have seven daily departures to four cities beginning on March 13. And Greenville, Spartanburg will have seven daily departures to five cities also beginning on March 13. And as previously announced, we are excited to begin service to Newark in March of 2011 pursuant to our lease agreement with Continental for 36 slots. In closing, we continue to closely monitor demand, and we do remain prepared to adjust our schedule accordingly. 
And Tom, with that overview, Gary and I are ready to take questions."

So if you compare fourth quarter '10 to fourth quarter '08, at least with the forecast that I have in my mind, it's going to be a very handsome increase. Obviously, we started to see pretty significant improvement in fourth quarter '09. So that one won't be as good. But I think at least for the fourth quarter of '10 that the two year ago numbers still a decent comparison. We've started looking back at '07. We've started looking back at sort of a basket of years to compare to because you run into such distortions with '09 and even the latter part of '08. But in every way we look at it and Laura, again, I just have to re-emphasize her point, the fact that October appears to us the way it does compared to September, August, July is very meaningful. So it suggests that we are continuing to build momentum. And I think that's logical because you haven't seen the full return of the business traveler. And if one believes that, that is gradually occurring over time, all else being equal, you ought to continue to see a strengthening in revenue movement. Now that's the prediction earlier this year and so far, that's playing out pretty well. But we're not seeing the levels of business traffic at Southwest that we had in '07 and '08. And certainly, what I've heard from counterparts around the industry, no one is representing that the business travel has recovered to that level. So you've got that upside in any event."

Marketing has recently done some surveys to they try to get a sense of what our mix of business travelers is compared to other airlines. If you extrapolate that into the number of customers that we carry, we're among the leaders in the country in terms of the number of business customers that we serve. Arguably, historically, at least last couple of years, we've been the largest. With Delta, Northwest combining and now United, Continental. They will probably outboard us in terms of business customers. So the point is we already serve a whole bunch of business customers. Clearly, we're gaining share. That's an undeniable fact domestically. We're gaining share relative to the last several years. A lot of that share is consumer, but it's also business travelers. So just with the product enhancements we've made, giving the road warriors more choice, we do believe that we're seeing more business customers come Southwest way. But there's a variety of things going on in our 16.1% unit revenue improvement. And so there, we've deployed 10 different initiatives or more, and it's hard for us to piece apart what value is being driven by each one. But again, we want to share that with you all when we have more time to do that. But what I hear from business customers is the fact that we've introduced an enhanced boarding process with the Business Select product, with enhanced frequent-flyer benefits has caused them to change their flying behavior and bring their business to Southwest. And the fact that we allow for flexibility in changing flights, where we do not charge the change fee, is huge with business customers. The bag fees maybe not so much. I think that's probably more benefit for consumers. But even the bag fees I think is an attribute that some business customers like. So I think it's a basket of things. Clearly, there's much better revenue management than there was three years ago. There is much better schedule optimization than there was three years ago. We've created itineraries that are more marketable for connecting customers or connecting passengers are up more than our nonstop passengers. They are not at the expense of nonstop, so we're still carrying the same amount of nonstop passengers. The increase of the load factor has been driven more by carrying more connecting passengers, and so one would infer that, that could be more heavily weighted towards consumers. But I think it's a variety of things and in fact, Mike, with the recession, what you know you always find with a drop in business travel, that's sort of our bread-and-butter short-haul markets, and they are lagging in the recovery compared to our medium and longer haul markets for that reason. So I do think that when the business traveler does come back, we're going to see hopefully a very strong response, especially in our short-haul routes."

The opportunity for us is twofold, but the easier one to visualize is there are at least two dozen cities in our route system that AirTran does not serve. So those are simple. You go in. We see that the fares are quite high. We know we can come in, lower the fares, stimulate the market. It will be additive, in other words, to the AirTran route system. That is huge. Campbell-Hill came up with an estimate of 2 million incremental O&D passengers. Well, we just looked at that subset of markets. Our number wasn't 2 million, but it was still really big. In addition to that, so I'm moving on to the next argument. In addition to that, the AirTran route system is probably not fully fleshed out. So in other words, even where they do have service, especially if it's service to an existing Southwest city, we see the opportunity to at least consider adding frequencies and tap into the strength that we have on the destination submarket. So we're sort of loathe to tell our competitors our game plan, but an obvious one is Chicago Midway, where we have a lot of customers in Chicago. It's one of our largest cities that we operate from. We may very well have opportunities to add to the AirTran route map and generate a lot more customers. Then there's probably places that we don't serve that AirTran does where they may not have enough frequencies either. And of course, in 2008, they were forced for economic reasons to withdraw a lot of capacity from Atlanta because of high fuel prices. Well some of that could at least in theory be considered for restoration. So I really think it's three basic pools of opportunities there. But according to Campbell-Hill, if you look at all of those three in aggregate, it's an annual opportunity of about 2 million incremental passengers."

In terms of why the sequential trends, I think it maybe goes back to some of the discussion that we had with Mike Linenberg on Gary's response to his question. There seems to be a lot of factors working together out there. Certainly, what we've seen at Southwest is increased loads, record load factors in 14 of the last 15 months. So we're slowly picking up business traffic but at the same time, we seem to be picking up more incremental leisure traffic as well. So it just seems to be a very good combination for us.

But I mean, there could be a pickup in the air travel demand market. I would project that over time, there is a gradual return of the business traveler. So that might help support, and that was a point that I made earlier. This is a view that we have, and I don't know that it's shared by all. So it's just a view. But I do think that the economic environment -- I think it's hard to find anybody who thinks that the economy is really strong. So I do think that the environment is such that consumers especially are looking for value. I read all the time about business travelers looking for value and buying in advance to get better ticket prices as an example. And that's an environment where we really shine. And the bags fly free message, of course, just pounds home what a low-fare philosophy that we have at Southwest Airlines. So I continue to believe that we're going to continue to outperform our competitors. These are Laura Wright's comments saying that at Southwest Airlines, we're seeing this escalation seasonally. So I don't know that we're going to find if that's true for the industry. I think that our product is getting better every year, and we're continuing to add new features and functions, and I think that, that's all a plus. And there's just a fair amount of excitement that we feel within the company and I sense that without that we're doing some things. I think the fact that we've added five new cities in the last 18 months is huge because it's not just exciting for the people in Boston, LaGuardia, Minneapolis, Panama City and Milwaukee, it's the rest of our system that has now another flight opportunity on Southwest Airlines.

If you think about the schedule optimization you talked last year at this time, at least I understood is you wanted to get a lot of capacity out of these off-peak periods where revenue wasn't so good. And it just seems like you're kind of coming back to that and you could clearly see it in a way you utilized your network this year. Summer schedules were tight, but they weren't in first quarter. Now it feels like you're going to be much more back to a more sort of level schedule where you're really filling in those off-peaks. Is there some story there that we don't understand that is going to allow you to generate the turn the returns that you couldn't last year at that time?"

But if you look at the current, and you all will get tired of me repeating this, but I think what Laura said earlier is very meaningful. The fact that we are seeing such strength in October is very material to what we are contemplating for the first quarter. I think we're going to have another record load factor in October. I think we'll have another record load factor in November. I'm not predicting it. I'm just trying to set the stage for why we believe that the capacity plan for next year is appropriate. We see very strong demand for the next 60 to 90 days, which we think will carry through to the first quarter of next year, with an optimized schedule that has new markets in it, at least in our view, will justify that amount of flight activity. It certainly, and I think Dan made this point earlier that the fact that we can add that capacity at an incremental cost makes the profit opportunity quite handsome for all the obvious reasons. So I'm comfortable with it. And hopefully, that's -- we're not doing it with more airplanes. So it's just utilizing the assets that we have and the workforce that we have to provide better flights and again, we're confident that the revenues will be there. My concern for next year is more fuel, personally, than it is the capacity plan that we're talking about."

It is interesting with a lot of our -- we're nationwide now. We're very different than we were 25 years ago. And some of our markets peak in the first quarter. So I think that one of the things that schedule planning or network planning is doing is taking advantage of that. Where we do have strength in the quarter, we're putting the capacity there. Where we have more weakness, they're pulling that capacity out. So it's still very active. It's not simply publish something in August and let that carry through for the next six months. They're still very active with their adds and their deletes. But again, we think that given the overall strength in the demand, we think we've got a good schedule out there for next year."

And we all understand how long lived those construction plans and projects and processes are. But that's a fact that's kind of confounded us. So far we've seen very significant increases in our airport costs this year. And the concern is that we'll see another significant increase next year. So that's just sort of an advance warning on that and something that we'll have to factor into our plans accordingly. Our capacity plans, again, actually help mitigate that to a degree because a lot of those cost increases are fixed. So to the extent that we can add more capacity that drives down the unit cost. The other point to reiterate with the capacity increase is that we believe we drive more revenue and more profits with that approach as opposed to not. So it's a way of saying, ""What are we going to do about our airport cost pressure?"" One of the answers is, ""Fortunately, we have some opportunities to add some profitable capacity here in the near term."""

And then all up, I can't imagine that we'll be completely converted to a new reservation system given this new AirTran initiative for three years will be my guess. So we'll probably start that work in earnest in a couple of months. But even that is just a target date.
