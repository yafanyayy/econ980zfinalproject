This morning, CF Industries reported fourth quarter and full year 2009 earnings. For the fourth quarter of 2009, net earnings totaled $51 million or $1.04 per diluted share, down from a record",1025,"Thanks, Terry, and thank you all for joining us this morning. This morning, CF Industries reported fourth quarter and full year 2009 earnings. For the fourth quarter of 2009, net earnings totaled $51 million or $1.04 per diluted share, down from a record $190 million or $3.59 per share in the same period last year. This was a solid performance in an environment that was much weaker than 2008 for both demand and pricing. Results included business combination costs, development costs for our Peru project, a gain on the sale of Terra common shares and the effects of mark-to-market gains on our natural gas derivatives. Tony will go into more detail on these items, as well as similar items from the prior year.Through much of the fourth quarter, domestic fertilizer demand was characterized by buyer reluctance to take inventory positions. But demand came to life in late November, as purchasers began to focus on the spring season with promises to be a strong one. We've been looking forward to the strong market we're now enjoying for some time. Our task in the fourth quarter was to manage the transition from weak domestic demand in most of 2009 to the stronger environment. We were able to do that successfully because of our access to export markets and our flexible approach to forward sales. Because of the late harvest, we knew that we'd need very good weather in order to have a good fall ammonia application season. Well, we didn't get very good weather, and the result was very weak fall application. Some of you have commented that this sets us up for a strong spring for our nitrogen products, which is true. In fact, these effects started to show up late in the fourth quarter.Despite the weak performance for ammonia, our total nitrogen volume was about equal to that of the fourth quarter of 2008. UAN volume was buoyed by exports, and urea volume increased by 46,000 tons compared to the fourth quarter of last year due to restocking and a dearth of imports into the U.S. market. Because domestic demand and prices were weak relative to offshore markets throughout October and November, we saw an export opportunities over this period. In the quarter, we exported 274,000 tons of phosphate and 63,000 tons of UAN. In the case of those nitrogen exports, which were a noteworthy development in 2009, there are two key observations that I think are important. First, in the current natural gas environment, we can earn good margin selling overseas. And second, when product is in demand in domestic markets, we typically can earn better margins by leveraging our transportation and distribution assets to capture premium pricing in the Corn Belt. We were able to access both markets in various times in the fourth quarter, which underscores the value of the flexibility that our Donaldsonville location provides. Phosphate exports enabled us to increase fourth quarter segment volume by 36% year-over-year to 551,000 tons. In addition to contributing fully half of the company's phosphate volume in the quarter, exports by us and our competitors especially to China, left domestic producer inventory somewhat depleted. When domestic buyers observe prices rising and develop a sense of urgency about replenishing their stocks for the spring, they found the product in short supply, which reinforced the upward price movement. In addition, our dynamic approach to forward pricing helped us manage through the fourth quarter transition. We didn't price our nitrogen products just to fill our book. Our forward price offerings reflected our belief that prices would rise and margins would expand. It turned out that prices and margins did increase at the end of the year and continued to do so throughout January, rewarding us for our patient approach.Natural gas prices were higher in the fourth quarter than the third, but that seasonal effect was not surprising. What we found encouraging was the way the quarter was punctuated by brief spikes and spot gas prices followed by pullbacks. This reinforced our view that we're in a period of persistently low gas prices in North America relative to Eastern and Western Europe.During the fourth quarter, our nitrogen production system ran at 92% of capacity, compared to 99% in the fourth quarter of 2008. We performed major scheduled maintenance projects in one ammonium plant, one urea plant and one UAN plant at our Donaldsonville complex. We had some trouble getting those plants back up to full rates primarily because of unusually cold weather. Our Donaldsonville complex is built to withstand the 120-mile per hour winds and even in New Orleans, a Super Bowl victory, but not long durations of below freezing temperatures. We also curtailed operating rates at our Medicine Hat. complex to control ammonia inventory. Our Phosphate complex in Florida operated at 94% of capacity, compared to 85% in the fourth quarter of 2008 when high DAP and MAP inventories forced manufacturing slow downs. This past quarter, inventories and demand supported full production, but we had complications in Florida that were similar to those we experienced in Donaldsonville. We performed two major scheduled maintenance projects and had a difficult restart because of unusually cold weather. Some of these maintenance projects were pulled ahead intentionally to enable us to increase production in the first half of 2010 and we're benefiting from that now.For all of 2009, we had sales of $2.6 billion, and net earnings of $366 million or $7.42 per share. We took advantage of our expanding global reach, exporting nitrogen and phosphate to 21 countries on five continents. And we made significant progress on our proposed nitrogen complex in Peru, including signing the gas supply agreement during the fourth quarter and completing the FEED study.  Unfortunately, the cost estimate provided by that study was higher than we expected, making the business equation more challenging. We're continuing to evaluate a variety of options that may improve the expected returns on the project. So we accomplished a lot in 2009 and prepared ourselves for a strong spring season. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Tony to review our fourth quarter and 2009 financial performance in more detail."

As Steve pointed out, CF's fourth quarter net earnings were $51 million, or $1.04 per diluted share on an after-tax basis, compared to a record of $190 million or $3.59 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008. Fo",1078,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As Steve pointed out, CF's fourth quarter net earnings were $51 million, or $1.04 per diluted share on an after-tax basis, compared to a record of $190 million or $3.59 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008. Fourth quarter results included business combination costs of $0.37 per diluted share after tax, Peru project development costs of $0.21 per share, a gain of $0.15 per share on the sale of Terra shares and the unrealized mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives of $0.03 per share. Results for the fourth quarter of 2008 included phosphate and potash inventory write-downs of $0.70 per diluted share after tax. Unrealized mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives of $0.42 per share, and Peru project development costs of $0.01 per share.Net sales of $507 million included Nitrogen segment sales of $352 million, and Phosphate segment sales of $155 million, which were down 50% and 58%, respectively due to lower prices in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the prior year.  Nitrogen volumes was 1.5 million tons, equal to the volume in the fourth quarter of 2008, with higher urea volumes offsetting lower ammonia volumes. UAN volume was flat in total with exports to Argentina and France offsetting the lower domestic volumes. Ammonia price realizations, excluding sales to the Terra, were 47% lower than in the fourth quarter of 2008 and flat sequentially. Urea price realizations were 43% lower than the fourth quarter of 2008 and slightly higher sequentially. UAN price realizations were 56% lower than the fourth quarter of 2008 and flat sequentially. During the fourth quarter, spot prices for urea and UAN at the Gulf rose by more than 20% and 40%, respectively. Most of that increase occurred in December and should be reflected in our average prices in the first quarter.Phosphate volume was 551,000 tons compared to 404,000 tons in the year-ago quarter. The increase was due primarily to a 100,000-ton increase in exports, including shipments to China, India, Africa, South America, and Mexico. Average DAP realizations for the fourth quarter were 69% lower than the same quarter last year and about flat sequentially. Like UAN pricing, DAP spot prices rose significantly in the second half of the fourth quarter. Gross margin was $126 million, down 65% from the year-earlier quarter. Nitrogen segment gross margin of $110 million was 31% of sales. Phosphate segment gross margin of $16 million was 11% of sales. For the Nitrogen segment, sales under the Forward Pricing Program accounted for 27% of volume compared to 75% in the year-earlier quarter. For Phosphate, FPP sales represented 11% of segment volume, down from 51% in the fourth quarter of 2008. As Steve indicated, our lower FPP volumes reflected the measured approach we took for booking forward sales throughout the second half of 2009 to avoid capping on margins in what we correctly expected to be an expanding margin environment. As the press release mention, remaining bookings under the FPP for 2010 were 1.3 million tons at year end, compared to 1.4 million tons at the same point last year.The average cost of natural gas at the company's Donaldsonville, Louisiana operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $4.41 per MMBtus, compared to $10.11 per MMBtus in the year-earlier quarter. At Medicine Hat, our gas cost was $4.20 per MMBtus, compared to $6.77 per MMBTUs in the fourth quarter of 2008. Lower gas cost was a significant factor in offsetting the impact of lower product prices for both the fourth quarter and the full year when compared to the year ago periods.Selling, general and administrative expense in the quarter was $15.9 million compared to $15 million in the year-earlier quarter. Other operating expenses of $39.1 million included $10 million for food development costs and $26 million for business combination expenses. At December 31, 2009, the company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $882 million, which was $257 million higher than our balance a year ago. The increase was due primarily to cash flow from operations, offset partially by net capital spending, investment in Terra shares and distributions to Terra, our partner in CFF. We also held $134 million in auction rate securities at year end. We received $60 million in redemptions at par over the course of 2009, $7 million of which took place in the fourth quarter. In addition, we held nearly $5 million shares of Terra, which we sold in January for proceeds of $167 million and a gain on sale of $28 million. Altogether, our cash and investments totaled about $1.2 billion at year end.For the full year 2009, the company had net earnings of $366 million or $7.32 per diluted share, compared to a record $685 million or $12.13 per diluted share in 2008. The company's results for the year included unrealized mark-to-market gains on natural gas directives of $1.10 per diluted share after tax, proposed business combination cost of $0.91 per share, Peru project development costs of $0.73 per share and a gain of $0.15 per share on the sale of Terra shares. Results for 2008 included unrealized mark-to-market losses on natural gas derivatives, a $0.73 per diluted share after tax, phosphate and potash inventory write-downs of $0.65 per share and Peru project development cost of $0.02 per share.For 2009, our net sales totaled $2.6 billion on volume of 8.1 million tons. Export volume was a record 1.3 million tons compared to 500,000 tons in 2008. Gross margin for the year was $839 million, down 31% from 2008. Full year Nitrogen segment gross margin of $784 million was 43% of sales. Phosphate gross margin of $55 million was 7% of sales.  Excluding sales of potash, gross margin for the Phosphate segment would've been $89 million, or 13% of sales. SG&A was $63 million for the year, down 8% from 2008. Other operating expenses of $97 million included $36 million for Peru development costs and, $53 million in business combination expenses.Capital expenditures for the year were $236 million reflecting increased investment in our advantage North American assets during a period of high cash flow. Although our outlook for cash flow continues to be strong, we expect capital expenditures to be more in the range of $150 million to $200 million for 2010.So in summary, we delivered another quarter and year of strong financial and operating performance. That leaves us in an excellent position to capitalize on the improving market conditions we see as we move into 2010. Steve?"

In my earlier remarks, I touched on our bullishness on agriculture and fertilizer markets over the upcoming months. I'd like to expand on that a bit. Corn futures prices rose quickly in December.

I'd like to expand on that a bit. Corn futures prices rose quickly in December. It fell back to about $4 per bushel for December 2010, when the Wall Street [ph] report raised yield estimates for 2009. Nevertheless, corn prices remain in a very favorable range, in which planning corn resin, soybean, as a profitable endeavor and so is buying corn to produce ethanol. As a result, we expect corn plantings in 2010 to be higher than in 2009.In addition to favorable farm economics, there are other positive factors affecting fertilizer demand specifically. First, distributor and producer inventories are low and need to be replenished, especially in light of low imports of urea and UAN so far this fertilizer year. Second, the poor fall weather caused under application of nitrogen, which farmers need to make up in the spring. And third, the record crop in 2009 depleted nutrients in the soil. Nitrogen inventories all across the value chain and worldwide are low, with the exception of ammonia in the Midwest. However, we expect carryover demand from the fall season combined with improved industrial demand to result in strong ammonia movement this spring, weather permitting, of course. In the cases of urea and UAN, imports lag significantly in the first half of the fertilizer year compared to prior years. Urea imports began to flow into the U.S. in January in response to stronger domestic pricing relative to other markets. With strong domestic demand, China's export tax rate back up to 110% for the next five months, and India's demand still unmet, we expect the domestic supply demand balance for urea to remain tight. Based on our estimates for February, UAN imports for the first eight months of the fertilizer year will be less than half their five-year average. Imports will have to increase significantly in order to meet expected demand. Furthermore, the increase is going to have to come at a time when strong international demand and production shortfalls in the major exporting countries have dramatically tightened the availability of product into the world market. Our balance among ammonia, urea and UAN puts us in a position to benefit from market strength in all three products in 2010. Our outlook for the spring season is equally strong for phosphate. Pricing got a boost in mid-November when China unexpectedly entered the market as an importer. Production difficulties for some market participants and renewed buying interests in Latin America, we enforced the upward pressure, which is further compounded by resurgent demand in the U.S. domestic market. That left U.S. produced for inventories at extremely low levels with little prospect for rebuilding them through the spring season.In summary, we expect strong volumes and rising prices for all of our products in the first half of the year due to strong agricultural markets and relatively low global nitrogen and phosphate availability due to diminished industry production. We delivered strong performance in 2009 in the face of a turbulent market. We're proud to have provided a total return to shareholders of 85% over that period. In 2010, we are positioned to continue delivering value in an environment of greatly improved industry conditions. With that, let's open the call to your questions. Yvette, please review the Q&A procedure."

Excludin",945,"Thanks, Terry, and thank you, all, for joining us today. For the first quarter of 2010, CF Industries reported a net loss of $4 million or $0.09 per diluted share, down from earnings of $63 million or $1.28 per share in the same period last year. Excluding unusual items, which Tony will discuss later in the call, results were generally in line with our expectations and give us no reason to change our bullish outlook for the spring season. 
The fact that stocking activity was light in the first quarter, set as up for tighter market conditions in the second quarter, which increases the value of our industry-leading storage and distribution capability. That value became evident in April, as ideal planting conditions for corn emerged throughout most of the Midwest. 
The investment case for CF Industries starts with a significant advantage for nitrogen production in North America, due to low natural gas costs relative to the world sling producers. That advantage was visible in the quarter and we expect it to continue to be visible in the second quarter, helped by recent weakness in the natural gas prices in North America. 
The acquisition of Terra Industries, which we completed on April 15, provides us with opportunities to capitalize on the North American natural gas advantage that were not possible previously. Through the acquisition, we have more than doubled our nitrogen capacity; multiplied our logistical options; gain synergy opportunities for costs, capital expenditures and working capital; enhanced our ability to serve our customers; and improved our ability to invest in future growth because of our larger capital base. 
We remain focused on doing an excellent job of serving our customers through the spring and integrating the operations of the two companies. I'm pleased to report that we're off to a very good start in both respects, with key employees engaged in the integration process. After a month of operating the combined company, we've confirmed the major assumptions we made before the acquisition. 
Terra has excellent people throughout the organization, the cultures of the two companies are clearly compatible and the high end of our cost synergy range is achievable. We're very happy to have completed our common stock and unsecured notes offerings, which were substantially oversubscribed. I'd like to welcome our new stockholders and bondholders on board. It was good to be able to meet so many of you on our road shows and we look forward to meeting others as occasion permits. 
At this point, I'll drill down on the business fundamentals for the first quarter in a little more detail, Tony will then take you through our financial results and then I will return to discuss the outlook. During the first quarter, we typically don't see much nitrogen fertilizer going to the ground in the Corn Belt. Buying activity is driven by application in the Southern Plains and channel stocking across the Northern Midwest. 
In the Southern Plains, first quarter activity was slower than normal because of wet conditions and below-normal wheat planting. In the heart of the Corn Belt, we saw a continued reluctance to stock the distribution channel. As a result, our nitrogen sales volume of 1.2 million tons was 5% lower than the first quarter of last year, with all of the reduction coming in urea volume. 
We again exported nitrogen fertilizer from Donaldsonville in the first quarter, sending 53,000 tons of ammonia and UAN to Australia, Chile and Mexico, the ammonia export for the first that anyone here at CF Industries can remember. The current natural gas environment allows us earn good margins by exporting and also gives us another tool to use in managing our inventory balance. With the overwhelming demand we've experience for agricultural ammonia so far this spring, we would not expect to export ammonia again in the near future. 
Realized nitrogen product prices were lower then those of the first quarter 2009 when we were still benefiting from a large book of business that had been placed during the strong pricing environment of 2008. Phosphate sales volume of 480,000 tons was 9% lower than in the first quarter of 2009. The decline was more than explained by lower exports, which in turn were due to lower product availability. 
We mentioned last quarter that inventories of DAP and MAP were low coming into 2010, and that continues to be the case for the industry and for our own operations. Because domestic demand was robust during the first quarter, we sold most of our product here in the U.S., earning better margins than were available by exporting. 
Our domestic sales volume rose by 14% compared to the same period last year. Our average realized price for DAP in the quarter was $361 per ton, a 14% decrease from the average price in the same quarter last year, so much higher sequentially. The average cost of natural gas at our Donaldsonville complex in the first quarter was $5.31 per MMBtu compared to $8.09 per MMBtu in the first quarter of 2009. The average cost at our Medicine Hat complex fell from $5.99 a year ago to $4.70 this year. This reflects our preference to maintain spot exposure to both product prices and natural gas costs. 
During the first quarter, our nitrogen production system ran at 95% of capacity and our Phosphate Complex operated at 84% of capacity. We had significant scheduled maintenance during the quarter but still produced 12% more phosphate products than in the first quarter of 2009, when we ran at reduced rates because of inventory concerns. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Tony to review our first quarter financial performance in more detail."

As Steve indicated, CF Industries had a net loss of $4 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the first quarter compared to earnings of $63 million or $1.28 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2009. First",825,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As Steve indicated, CF Industries had a net loss of $4 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the first quarter compared to earnings of $63 million or $1.28 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2009. 
First quarter results included business combination costs of $136 million before tax, which included the $123 million breakup fee we paid to Yara; Peru project development costs of almost $3 million; a gain of $28 million before tax on the sale of Terra's shares; and unrealized mark-to-market losses on natural gas derivatives of $11 million pretax. 
Nearly all the costs associated with the business combination and the Peru project are non-deductible for income tax purposes. If these two items had not occurred in 2010, the company's annual effective tax rate for the first quarter would have been approximately 35% rather than the 49.6% income tax rate actually applied in the first quarter. 
Similar items affecting earnings in the first quarter of 2009 were unrealized mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives of $49 million pretax, phosphate inventory write-downs of $24 million, business combination costs of $16 million and Peru project development costs of $4 million. These items had a negative global [ph] impact on the 2009 reported tax rate, which was 39.4%. 
In the first quarter of 2010, net sales of $502 million included Nitrogen segment sales of $327 million and Phosphate segment sales of $175 million, which were down 28% and 22%, respectively, due to lower prices compared to the first quarter of 2009. Our average price realization for ammonia was $321 per ton, down 39% from the first quarter of 2009 but up 4% sequentially. Excluding sales by Terra, our average selling price for ammonia was $365 per ton. 
Urea price realizations were 16% lower than the first quarter of 2009 but 13% higher sequentially. UAN price realizations were 31% lower than the first quarter of 2009, and again, 31% higher sequentially. DAP average price realizations for the first quarter were 14% lower than the first quarter of 2009 but 30% higher sequentially. For both UAN and DAP, we told you on our last call that spot prices had increased by 20% to 40% during the fourth quarter and that we expected to see those increases reflected in the first quarter. That's exactly what happened. 
Gross margin was $129 million, down 21% from the year-earlier quarter. Lower gas costs were a significant factor in offsetting the impact of lower product prices compared to the year-ago period. Nitrogen segment gross margin of $97 million was 30% of sales. Phosphate segment gross margin of $32 million was 18% of sales. 
Sales under the Forward Pricing Program accounted for 33% of nitrogen volume compared to 42% in the year-earlier quarter and 54% of phosphate volume compared to 26% in the first quarter of 2009. Phosphate FPP volumes were higher because some customers placed forward orders with short lead times when they saw phosphate prices start to move up in December and January. By contrast, most of our phosphate FPP book ran off in the second half of 2008 as prices collapsed, leaving a relatively small amount to be delivered in the first quarter of 2009. 
We continue to take a measured approach to forward sales to avoid capping our margins in a favorable environment. Remaining bookings under the FPP were 1.1 million tons at the end of the quarter compared to 1.2 million tons at the same point last year. 
Selling, general and administrative expense in the quarter was $16 million. Other operating expenses of $139 million included the business combination expenses and the Peru development costs mentioned earlier. At March 31, 2010, the company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled more than $1 billion. We also held $133 million in auction rate securities. 
Subsequent to the quarter, we borrowed $3.6 billion in bridge and term loans to complete the acquisition of Terra Industries. We later issued common shares and senior notes for net proceeds of $2.7 billion, which are being used to pay off the bridge loan and a portion of the term loans. When the redemption of Terra's outstanding 7.75% bonds is completed later this quarter, we will have $2.6 billion in debt, consisting of $1.6 billion in senior notes and $1 billion in term loans. Our free cash flow this year will be used to reduce the outstanding amount of the term loans, with the goal of reducing leverage to our targeted range of 1 to 1.5x net debt to EBITDA. 
We filed an 8-K yesterday that reported Terra net income of $47 million compared to the $30 million reported in the 2009 first quarter. Terra achieved this improved net income despite a lower nitrogen selling prices due to lower feedstock costs and significantly improved sales volumes, including increase in sales to industrial customers as the overall economy continued to recover. Now let me turn it back to Steve."

While I'm not going to provide financial guidance, it will be a mistake for you to conclude that we're retracting the guidance provided by the two companie",779,"Thanks, Tony. Now I'd like to discuss our outlook for the second quarter and the remainder of 2010. While I'm not going to provide financial guidance, it will be a mistake for you to conclude that we're retracting the guidance provided by the two companies prior the combination, although we are in anyway less confident about our outlook for this year. 
In fact, there are at least three things that make us more confident than we were at the time of our prior forecast. First, North American natural gas prices have fallen meaningfully over the last two months. Our previous forecast assumed an average cost of $5.05 per MMBtu at Henry Hub over the course of 2010. Right now, December is the only month on the NYMEX Strip for the remainder of the year with a price of $5 or more. Second, our confidence has increased that corn planting will meet or exceed the USDA estimate of 88.8 million acres because of favorable farm level economics, excellent planting conditions across the Midwest and the incentive to plant corn in other major growing regions. And third, we have much more confidence around spring nitrogen application rates because of the blockbuster pre-plant anhydrous ammonia season we have in April. 
Our production mix among nitrogen fertilizer products is very balanced and good ammonia pre-plant application plays to our competitive advantage in Corn Belt storage and distribution capability. In April, we delivered more ammonia than in any other month since we became a public company, and over 70% more than the average of the previous five Aprils. Ammonia shipments for the legacy Terra operations also were greater than for any month over the same time period. 
We're working hard to resupply our system for sidedress application and it could be a welcome challenge to restock our terminal system fully by the fall. In addition to rebounding agricultural demand, industrial demand for nitrogen is strengthening, which was evident in Terra's first quarter volumes. While product demand is growing, downstream inventory continues to be tight. 
As of the end of March, fertilizer year-to-date imports of nitrogen products ranged from 13% to 46% below their five-year averages. DAP and MAP inventories are also very low at both the producer and distributor levels, and we currently expect U.S. agricultural demand for phosphate to increase by 15% this year to 4.2 million tons. 
U.S. corn prices have been under scrutiny in recent weeks because of strong plantings and favorable weather. However, corn exports in the U.S. are expected to remain strong this year, as global coarse grain demand rose by 2.8% compared to last year. Recent Chinese purchases of corn have the potential to increase U.S. exports beyond previous expectations. 
Ethanol production in the U.S. also is expected to rise due to the increasing renewable fuel standard and could get a further boost from an increase to blended rate. Despite recent concerns, December corn future's prices continue to be in what we consider to be the optimal range for our business. 
The bottom line is that we continue to be very optimistic about demand and margin opportunities for the second quarter. Consequently, we're pleased to have a substantial amount of unpriced product that will allow us to capture those opportunities. We believe that we and our shareholders will continue to be rewarded for this approach. We also feel great about the things we can accomplish as a result of our acquisition of Terra Industries. 
I'd like to wrap up this morning by articulating the strategic imperatives that will drive us to achieve our vision for the new CF Industries. Our first priority is to deliver a great spring season, as measured by customer service, sales and production volumes, margin management and safety. The second thing we need to do is to execute our detailed integration plan. Through that integration process, we expect to deliver synergies of at least $135 million per year over the next 18 months. 
After we've done the heavy lifting on integration and synergies, there will be other opportunities to optimize the combined company's business. Simultaneously, we will continue to pay down debt to get us to our desired capital structure. Achieving that target leverage range will then allow us to capitalize on organic growth opportunities and eventually on global strategic opportunities in fertilizer manufacturing and distribution. 
All along the way, we intend to continue to engage actively with the investment community. We look forward to seeing many of you at that BMO Agricultural Conference on May 20 and the Goldman Sachs Basic Materials Conference on June 3. 
With that, let's open the call to your questions. Antoine, would you please explain the Q&A procedure."

Now that we've had a very strong ammonia run, it's more likely that urea and UAN supply and demand will be in the somewhat better balance. Although we still think it will be tight, we're expecting a strong season in UAN and ammonia. I think that's our perspective on imports. With respect to inventory levels in our own system, we managed our whole system to meet what we believe are our customers' expectations are. With respect to ammonia, there really isn't any choice. If we want to be in the ammonia business, we need to store the ammonia in our system. And our system is a great system. The benefit of that system was definitely on display in the month of April. Other products, we'll manage our inventory levels consistent with a balance between what we see our customer demand to be and our operating desires at the plant level. We look for a balance there."

And I'm just wondering, if internally your folks have kind of looked at that agreement and have kind of determined what the effect on the competitiveness of the Ukrainian industry might be and their ability to export here? And then also, your comments about what you expect export-wise to come out of China once the higher tariff levels are reduced?"

We are generally in agreement with the price for Ukraine that Ferticon had been using of around 6, 7 million BTUs. That price to the fertilizer producers in the Ukraine was subsidized by the Ukrainian natural gas company using inventories that they had built up in previous periods. I would say that, while we think we know where this is going, it's not a completely transparent situation. What we think's going happen as a result of lower delivered prices from the Russians, the Ukrainians will follow through with their pledge to the IMF to start backing off on subsidies to fertilizer producers. And so the net position after the subsidy has taken off, and you substitute the cheaper Russian gas, it's still probably going to be an increase in the average price coming out of Ukraine. Something like $7 or so. So we think on balance, it's about the same situation net, to possibly slightly higher, which of course decreases the competitiveness of Ukrainian production coming into the international markets."

As we said before, when we buy gas, it's typically related to a forward sale. We've also mentioned in previous calls that because we like the opportunity to potentially capitalize on expanding margins, due to flat to weak gas prices and stronger pricing for our products, we stay sharp into that market. As Steve pointed out on the earnings call, a forward NYMEX curve so far is validating our view for the gas for the rest of the year. And we'll probably continue this current program in this current path because we think it's the optimal one in terms of optimizing margin, which is what we focus on. With respect to locking in, anything separate from an FPP sale, we do have that authority. We typically, in the past, have not used it extensively, locking in extra gas to the extent of seven to 10 days of consumption. If gas popped up on the forward curve at $3.50 or $3, we probably get the committee together and have a serious discussion about it because it's something we want to look at. So we can be pretty flexible about that but basically, we're going to continue the same approach to gas and the pricing and margin management that we've had for the last several quarters."

With respect to the whole global nitrogen situation, I just say from a 50,000 foot level, the nitrogen economics are working as they're supposed to work. Those weakness in European demand, product didn't move there to the extent that it might have otherwise. The natural productions that was headed there was a production that had to ease off in Eastern Europe and so forth. So it's a global industry and world prices are determined globally. However, there can be regional dislocations and we see that, for example, in the ammonia market, Corn Belt ammonia has its own set of economics. One of the reasons we like that business so much."

Terra Nitrogen and Terra Industries, which we acquired after the end of the quarter, reported their results yesterday. On this call, we'll review the CF Industries results in detail and provide brief comments on the results of Terra and Terra Nitrogen. We'll also discuss our outlook for industry and company performance in 2010 and field questions about the combined enterprise. If you have detailed modeling questions regarding the future consolidation of financial results, let me suggest that you address those questions to me after the call.

Excludin",945,"Thanks, Terry, and thank you, all, for joining us today. For the first quarter of 2010, CF Industries reported a net loss of $4 million or $0.09 per diluted share, down from earnings of $63 million or $1.28 per share in the same period last year. Excluding unusual items, which Tony will discuss later in the call, results were generally in line with our expectations and give us no reason to change our bullish outlook for the spring season. 
The fact that stocking activity was light in the first quarter, set as up for tighter market conditions in the second quarter, which increases the value of our industry-leading storage and distribution capability. That value became evident in April, as ideal planting conditions for corn emerged throughout most of the Midwest. 
The investment case for CF Industries starts with a significant advantage for nitrogen production in North America, due to low natural gas costs relative to the world sling producers. That advantage was visible in the quarter and we expect it to continue to be visible in the second quarter, helped by recent weakness in the natural gas prices in North America. 
The acquisition of Terra Industries, which we completed on April 15, provides us with opportunities to capitalize on the North American natural gas advantage that were not possible previously. Through the acquisition, we have more than doubled our nitrogen capacity; multiplied our logistical options; gain synergy opportunities for costs, capital expenditures and working capital; enhanced our ability to serve our customers; and improved our ability to invest in future growth because of our larger capital base. 
We remain focused on doing an excellent job of serving our customers through the spring and integrating the operations of the two companies. I'm pleased to report that we're off to a very good start in both respects, with key employees engaged in the integration process. After a month of operating the combined company, we've confirmed the major assumptions we made before the acquisition. 
Terra has excellent people throughout the organization, the cultures of the two companies are clearly compatible and the high end of our cost synergy range is achievable. We're very happy to have completed our common stock and unsecured notes offerings, which were substantially oversubscribed. I'd like to welcome our new stockholders and bondholders on board. It was good to be able to meet so many of you on our road shows and we look forward to meeting others as occasion permits. 
At this point, I'll drill down on the business fundamentals for the first quarter in a little more detail, Tony will then take you through our financial results and then I will return to discuss the outlook. During the first quarter, we typically don't see much nitrogen fertilizer going to the ground in the Corn Belt. Buying activity is driven by application in the Southern Plains and channel stocking across the Northern Midwest. 
In the Southern Plains, first quarter activity was slower than normal because of wet conditions and below-normal wheat planting. In the heart of the Corn Belt, we saw a continued reluctance to stock the distribution channel. As a result, our nitrogen sales volume of 1.2 million tons was 5% lower than the first quarter of last year, with all of the reduction coming in urea volume. 
We again exported nitrogen fertilizer from Donaldsonville in the first quarter, sending 53,000 tons of ammonia and UAN to Australia, Chile and Mexico, the ammonia export for the first that anyone here at CF Industries can remember. The current natural gas environment allows us earn good margins by exporting and also gives us another tool to use in managing our inventory balance. With the overwhelming demand we've experience for agricultural ammonia so far this spring, we would not expect to export ammonia again in the near future. 
Realized nitrogen product prices were lower then those of the first quarter 2009 when we were still benefiting from a large book of business that had been placed during the strong pricing environment of 2008. Phosphate sales volume of 480,000 tons was 9% lower than in the first quarter of 2009. The decline was more than explained by lower exports, which in turn were due to lower product availability. 
We mentioned last quarter that inventories of DAP and MAP were low coming into 2010, and that continues to be the case for the industry and for our own operations. Because domestic demand was robust during the first quarter, we sold most of our product here in the U.S., earning better margins than were available by exporting. 
Our domestic sales volume rose by 14% compared to the same period last year. Our average realized price for DAP in the quarter was $361 per ton, a 14% decrease from the average price in the same quarter last year, so much higher sequentially. The average cost of natural gas at our Donaldsonville complex in the first quarter was $5.31 per MMBtu compared to $8.09 per MMBtu in the first quarter of 2009. The average cost at our Medicine Hat complex fell from $5.99 a year ago to $4.70 this year. This reflects our preference to maintain spot exposure to both product prices and natural gas costs. 
During the first quarter, our nitrogen production system ran at 95% of capacity and our Phosphate Complex operated at 84% of capacity. We had significant scheduled maintenance during the quarter but still produced 12% more phosphate products than in the first quarter of 2009, when we ran at reduced rates because of inventory concerns. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Tony to review our first quarter financial performance in more detail.

As Steve indicated, CF Industries had a net loss of $4 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the first quarter compared to earnings of $63 million or $1.28 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2009. First",825,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As Steve indicated, CF Industries had a net loss of $4 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the first quarter compared to earnings of $63 million or $1.28 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2009. 
First quarter results included business combination costs of $136 million before tax, which included the $123 million breakup fee we paid to Yara; Peru project development costs of almost $3 million; a gain of $28 million before tax on the sale of Terra's shares; and unrealized mark-to-market losses on natural gas derivatives of $11 million pretax. 
Nearly all the costs associated with the business combination and the Peru project are non-deductible for income tax purposes. If these two items had not occurred in 2010, the company's annual effective tax rate for the first quarter would have been approximately 35% rather than the 49.6% income tax rate actually applied in the first quarter. 
Similar items affecting earnings in the first quarter of 2009 were unrealized mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives of $49 million pretax, phosphate inventory write-downs of $24 million, business combination costs of $16 million and Peru project development costs of $4 million. These items had a negative global [ph] impact on the 2009 reported tax rate, which was 39.4%. 
In the first quarter of 2010, net sales of $502 million included Nitrogen segment sales of $327 million and Phosphate segment sales of $175 million, which were down 28% and 22%, respectively, due to lower prices compared to the first quarter of 2009. Our average price realization for ammonia was $321 per ton, down 39% from the first quarter of 2009 but up 4% sequentially. Excluding sales by Terra, our average selling price for ammonia was $365 per ton. 
Urea price realizations were 16% lower than the first quarter of 2009 but 13% higher sequentially. UAN price realizations were 31% lower than the first quarter of 2009, and again, 31% higher sequentially. DAP average price realizations for the first quarter were 14% lower than the first quarter of 2009 but 30% higher sequentially. For both UAN and DAP, we told you on our last call that spot prices had increased by 20% to 40% during the fourth quarter and that we expected to see those increases reflected in the first quarter. That's exactly what happened. 
Gross margin was $129 million, down 21% from the year-earlier quarter. Lower gas costs were a significant factor in offsetting the impact of lower product prices compared to the year-ago period. Nitrogen segment gross margin of $97 million was 30% of sales. Phosphate segment gross margin of $32 million was 18% of sales. 
Sales under the Forward Pricing Program accounted for 33% of nitrogen volume compared to 42% in the year-earlier quarter and 54% of phosphate volume compared to 26% in the first quarter of 2009. Phosphate FPP volumes were higher because some customers placed forward orders with short lead times when they saw phosphate prices start to move up in December and January. By contrast, most of our phosphate FPP book ran off in the second half of 2008 as prices collapsed, leaving a relatively small amount to be delivered in the first quarter of 2009. 
We continue to take a measured approach to forward sales to avoid capping our margins in a favorable environment. Remaining bookings under the FPP were 1.1 million tons at the end of the quarter compared to 1.2 million tons at the same point last year. 
Selling, general and administrative expense in the quarter was $16 million. Other operating expenses of $139 million included the business combination expenses and the Peru development costs mentioned earlier. At March 31, 2010, the company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled more than $1 billion. We also held $133 million in auction rate securities. 
Subsequent to the quarter, we borrowed $3.6 billion in bridge and term loans to complete the acquisition of Terra Industries. We later issued common shares and senior notes for net proceeds of $2.7 billion, which are being used to pay off the bridge loan and a portion of the term loans. When the redemption of Terra's outstanding 7.75% bonds is completed later this quarter, we will have $2.6 billion in debt, consisting of $1.6 billion in senior notes and $1 billion in term loans. Our free cash flow this year will be used to reduce the outstanding amount of the term loans, with the goal of reducing leverage to our targeted range of 1 to 1.5x net debt to EBITDA. 
We filed an 8-K yesterday that reported Terra net income of $47 million compared to the $30 million reported in the 2009 first quarter. Terra achieved this improved net income despite a lower nitrogen selling prices due to lower feedstock costs and significantly improved sales volumes, including increase in sales to industrial customers as the overall economy continued to recover. Now let me turn it back to Steve.

While I'm not going to provide financial guidance, it will be a mistake for you to conclude that we're retracting the guidance provided by the two companie",779,"Thanks, Tony. Now I'd like to discuss our outlook for the second quarter and the remainder of 2010. While I'm not going to provide financial guidance, it will be a mistake for you to conclude that we're retracting the guidance provided by the two companies prior the combination, although we are in anyway less confident about our outlook for this year. 
In fact, there are at least three things that make us more confident than we were at the time of our prior forecast. First, North American natural gas prices have fallen meaningfully over the last two months. Our previous forecast assumed an average cost of $5.05 per MMBtu at Henry Hub over the course of 2010. Right now, December is the only month on the NYMEX Strip for the remainder of the year with a price of $5 or more. Second, our confidence has increased that corn planting will meet or exceed the USDA estimate of 88.8 million acres because of favorable farm level economics, excellent planting conditions across the Midwest and the incentive to plant corn in other major growing regions. And third, we have much more confidence around spring nitrogen application rates because of the blockbuster pre-plant anhydrous ammonia season we have in April. 
Our production mix among nitrogen fertilizer products is very balanced and good ammonia pre-plant application plays to our competitive advantage in Corn Belt storage and distribution capability. In April, we delivered more ammonia than in any other month since we became a public company, and over 70% more than the average of the previous five Aprils. Ammonia shipments for the legacy Terra operations also were greater than for any month over the same time period. 
We're working hard to resupply our system for sidedress application and it could be a welcome challenge to restock our terminal system fully by the fall. In addition to rebounding agricultural demand, industrial demand for nitrogen is strengthening, which was evident in Terra's first quarter volumes. While product demand is growing, downstream inventory continues to be tight. 
As of the end of March, fertilizer year-to-date imports of nitrogen products ranged from 13% to 46% below their five-year averages. DAP and MAP inventories are also very low at both the producer and distributor levels, and we currently expect U.S. agricultural demand for phosphate to increase by 15% this year to 4.2 million tons. 
U.S. corn prices have been under scrutiny in recent weeks because of strong plantings and favorable weather. However, corn exports in the U.S. are expected to remain strong this year, as global coarse grain demand rose by 2.8% compared to last year. Recent Chinese purchases of corn have the potential to increase U.S. exports beyond previous expectations. 
Ethanol production in the U.S. also is expected to rise due to the increasing renewable fuel standard and could get a further boost from an increase to blended rate. Despite recent concerns, December corn future's prices continue to be in what we consider to be the optimal range for our business. 
The bottom line is that we continue to be very optimistic about demand and margin opportunities for the second quarter. Consequently, we're pleased to have a substantial amount of unpriced product that will allow us to capture those opportunities. We believe that we and our shareholders will continue to be rewarded for this approach. We also feel great about the things we can accomplish as a result of our acquisition of Terra Industries. 
I'd like to wrap up this morning by articulating the strategic imperatives that will drive us to achieve our vision for the new CF Industries. Our first priority is to deliver a great spring season, as measured by customer service, sales and production volumes, margin management and safety. The second thing we need to do is to execute our detailed integration plan. Through that integration process, we expect to deliver synergies of at least $135 million per year over the next 18 months. 
After we've done the heavy lifting on integration and synergies, there will be other opportunities to optimize the combined company's business. Simultaneously, we will continue to pay down debt to get us to our desired capital structure. Achieving that target leverage range will then allow us to capitalize on organic growth opportunities and eventually on global strategic opportunities in fertilizer manufacturing and distribution. 
All along the way, we intend to continue to engage actively with the investment community. We look forward to seeing many of you at that BMO Agricultural Conference on May 20 and the Goldman Sachs Basic Materials Conference on June 3. 
With that, let's open the call to your questions. Antoine, would you please explain the Q&A procedure.

Although we still think it will be tight, we're expecting a strong season in UAN and ammonia. I think that's our perspective on imports. With respect to inventory levels in our own system, we managed our whole system to meet what we believe are our customers' expectations are. With respect to ammonia, there really isn't any choice. If we want to be in the ammonia business, we need to store the ammonia in our system. And our system is a great system. The benefit of that system was definitely on display in the month of April. Other products, we'll manage our inventory levels consistent with a balance between what we see our customer demand to be and our operating desires at the plant level. We look for a balance there.

We are generally in agreement with the price for Ukraine that Ferticon had been using of around 6, 7 million BTUs. That price to the fertilizer producers in the Ukraine was subsidized by the Ukrainian natural gas company using inventories that they had built up in previous periods. I would say that, while we think we know where this is going, it's not a completely transparent situation. What we think's going happen as a result of lower delivered prices from the Russians, the Ukrainians will follow through with their pledge to the IMF to start backing off on subsidies to fertilizer producers. And so the net position after the subsidy has taken off, and you substitute the cheaper Russian gas, it's still probably going to be an increase in the average price coming out of Ukraine. Something like $7 or so. So we think on balance, it's about the same situation net, to possibly slightly higher, which of course decreases the competitiveness of Ukrainian production coming into the international markets.

As we said before, when we buy gas, it's typically related to a forward sale. We've also mentioned in previous calls that because we like the opportunity to potentially capitalize on expanding margins, due to flat to weak gas prices and stronger pricing for our products, we stay sharp into that market. As Steve pointed out on the earnings call, a forward NYMEX curve so far is validating our view for the gas for the rest of the year. And we'll probably continue this current program in this current path because we think it's the optimal one in terms of optimizing margin, which is what we focus on. With respect to locking in, anything separate from an FPP sale, we do have that authority. We typically, in the past, have not used it extensively, locking in extra gas to the extent of seven to 10 days of consumption. If gas popped up on the forward curve at $3.50 or $3, we probably get the committee together and have a serious discussion about it because it's something we want to look at. So we can be pretty flexible about that but basically, we're going to continue the same approach to gas and the pricing and margin management that we've had for the last several quarters.

Those weakness in European demand, product didn't move there to the extent that it might have otherwise. The natural productions that was headed there was a production that had to ease off in Eastern Europe and so forth. So it's a global industry and world prices are determined globally. However, there can be regional dislocations and we see that, for example, in the ammonia market, Corn Belt ammonia has its own set of economics. One of the reasons we like that business so much.

For the first quarter of 2010, CF Industries reported a net loss of $4 million or $0.09 per diluted share, down from earnings of $63 million or $1.28 per share in the same period last year. Excluding unusual items, which Tony will discuss later in the call, results were generally in line with our expectations and give us no reason to change our bullish outlook for the spring season. 
The fact that stocking activity was light in the first quarter set us up for tighter market conditions in the second quarter, which increases the value of our industry-leading storage and distribution capability. That value became evident in April, as ideal planting conditions for corn emerged throughout most of the Midwest. 
The investment case for CF Industries starts with a significant advantage for nitrogen production in North America, due to low natural gas costs relative to the world sling producers. That advantage was visible in the quarter and we expect it to continue to be visible in the second quarter, helped by recent weakness in the natural gas prices in North America. 
The acquisition of Terra Industries, which we completed on April 15, provides us with opportunities to capitalize on the North American natural gas advantage that were not possible previously. Through the acquisition, we have more than doubled our nitrogen capacity; multiplied our logistical options; gained synergy opportunities for cost, capital expenditures and working capital; enhanced our ability to serve our customers; and improved our ability to invest in future growth because of our larger capital base. 
We remain focused on doing an excellent job of serving our customers through the spring and integrating the operations of the two companies. I'm pleased to report that we're off to a very good start in both respects, with key employees engaged in the integration process. After a month of operating the combined company, we've confirmed the major assumptions we made before the acquisition. 
Terra has excellent people throughout the organization. The cultures of the two companies are clearly compatible and the high end of our cost synergy range is achievable. We're very happy to have completed our common stock and unsecured notes offerings, which were substantially oversubscribed. I'd like to welcome our new stockholders and bondholders on board. It was good to be able to meet so many of you on our road shows and we look forward to meeting others as occasion permits. 
At this point, I'll drill down on the business fundamentals for the first quarter in a little more detail, Tony will then take you through our financial results and then I will return to discuss the outlook. During the first quarter, we typically don't see much nitrogen fertilizer going to the ground in the Corn Belt. Buying activity is driven by application in the Southern Plains and channel stocking across the Northern Midwest. 
In the Southern Plains, first quarter activity was slower than normal because of wet conditions and below-normal wheat planting. In the heart of the Corn Belt, we saw a continued reluctance to stock the distribution channel. As a result, our nitrogen sales volume of 1.2 million tons was 5% lower than the first quarter of last year, with all of the reduction coming in urea volume. 
We again exported nitrogen fertilizer from Donaldsonville in the first quarter, sending 53,000 tons of ammonia and UAN to Australia, Chile and Mexico, the ammonia export for the first that anyone here at CF Industries can remember. The current natural gas environment allows us earn good margins by exporting and also gives us another tool to use in managing our inventory balance. With the overwhelming demand we've experience for agricultural ammonia so far this spring, we would not expect to export ammonia again in the near future. 
Realized nitrogen product prices were lower then those of the first quarter 2009 when we were still benefiting from a large book of business that had been placed during the strong pricing environment of 2008. Phosphate sales volume of 480,000 tons was 9% lower than in the first quarter of 2009. The decline was more than explained by lower exports, which in turn were due to lower product availability. 
We mentioned last quarter that inventories of DAP and MAP were low coming into 2010, and that continues to be the case for the industry and for our own operations. Because domestic demand was robust during the first quarter, we sold most of our product here in the U.S., earning better margins than were available by exporting. 
Our domestic sales volume rose by 14% compared to the same period last year. Our average realized price for DAP in the quarter was $361 per ton, a 14% decrease from the average price in the same quarter last year, so much higher sequentially. The average cost of natural gas at our Donaldsonville complex in the first quarter was $5.31 per MMBtu compared to $8.09 per MMBtu in the first quarter of 2009. The average cost at our Medicine Hat complex fell from $5.99 a year ago to $4.70 this year. This reflects our preference to maintain spot exposure to both product prices and natural gas costs. 
During the first quarter, our nitrogen production system ran at 95% of capacity and our Phosphate Complex operated at 84% of capacity. We had significant scheduled maintenance during the quarter but still produced 12% more phosphate products than in the first quarter of 2009, when we ran at reduced rates because of inventory concerns. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Tony to review our first quarter financial performance in more detail."
22357184,102295759,64272,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May-07-2010",2010-05-07,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As Steve indicated, CF Industries had a net loss of $4 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the first quarter compared to earnings of $63 million or $1.28 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2009. First",825,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As Steve indicated, CF Industries had a net loss of $4 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the first quarter compared to earnings of $63 million or $1.28 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2009. 
First quarter results included business combination costs of $136 million before tax, which included the $123 million breakup fee we paid to Yara; Peru project development costs of almost $3 million; a gain of $28 million before tax on the sale of Terra's shares; and unrealized mark-to-market losses on natural gas derivatives of $11 million pretax. 
Nearly all the costs associated with the business combination and the Peru project are non-deductible for income tax purposes. If these two items had not occurred in 2010, the company's annual effective tax rate for the first quarter would have been approximately 35% rather than the 49.6% income tax rate actually applied in the first quarter. 
Similar items affecting earnings in the first quarter of 2009 were unrealized mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives of $49 million pretax, phosphate inventory write-downs of $24 million, business combination costs of $16 million and Peru project development costs of $4 million. These items had a negative global [ph] impact on the 2009 reported tax rate, which was 39.4%. 
In the first quarter of 2010, net sales of $502 million included Nitrogen segment sales of $327 million and Phosphate segment sales of $175 million, which were down 28% and 22%, respectively, due to lower prices compared to the first quarter of 2009. Our average price realization for ammonia was $321 per ton, down 39% from the first quarter of 2009 but up 4% sequentially. Excluding sales by Terra, our average selling price for ammonia was $365 per ton. 
Urea price realizations were 16% lower than the first quarter of 2009 but 13% higher sequentially. UAN price realizations were 31% lower than the first quarter of 2009, and again, 31% higher sequentially. DAP average price realizations for the first quarter were 14% lower than the first quarter of 2009 but 30% higher sequentially. For both UAN and DAP, we told you on our last call that spot prices had increased by 20% to 40% during the fourth quarter and that we expected to see those increases reflected in the first quarter. That's exactly what happened. 
Gross margin was $129 million, down 21% from the year-earlier quarter. Lower gas costs were a significant factor in offsetting the impact of lower product prices compared to the year-ago period. Nitrogen segment gross margin of $97 million was 30% of sales. Phosphate segment gross margin of $32 million was 18% of sales. 
Sales under the Forward Pricing Program accounted for 33% of nitrogen volume compared to 42% in the year-earlier quarter and 54% of phosphate volume compared to 26% in the first quarter of 2009. Phosphate FPP volumes were higher because some customers placed forward orders with short lead times when they saw phosphate prices start to move up in December and January. By contrast, most of our phosphate FPP book ran off in the second half of 2008 as prices collapsed, leaving a relatively small amount to be delivered in the first quarter of 2009. 
We continue to take a measured approach to forward sales to avoid capping our margins in a favorable environment. Remaining bookings under the FPP were 1.1 million tons at the end of the quarter compared to 1.2 million tons at the same point last year. 
Selling, general and administrative expense in the quarter was $16 million. Other operating expenses of $139 million included the business combination expenses and the Peru development costs mentioned earlier. At March 31, 2010, the company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled more than $1 billion. We also held $133 million in auction rate securities. 
Subsequent to the quarter, we borrowed $3.6 billion in bridge and term loans to complete the acquisition of Terra Industries. We later issued common shares and senior notes for net proceeds of $2.7 billion, which are being used to pay off the bridge loan and a portion of the term loans. When the redemption of Terra's outstanding 7.75% bonds is completed later this quarter, we will have $2.6 billion in debt, consisting of $1.6 billion in senior notes and $1 billion in term loans. Our free cash flow this year will be used to reduce the outstanding amount of the term loans, with the goal of reducing leverage to our targeted range of 1 to 1.5x net debt to EBITDA. 
We filed an 8-K yesterday that reported Terra net income of $47 million compared to the $30 million reported in the 2009 first quarter. Terra achieved this improved net income despite lower nitrogen selling prices due to lower feedstock costs and significantly improved sales volumes, including an increase in sales to industrial customers as the overall economy continued to recover. Now let me turn it back to Steve."

While I'm not going to provide financial guidance, it will be a mistake for you to conclude that we're retracting the guidance provided by the two companie",783,"Thanks, Tony. Now I'd like to discuss our outlook for the second quarter and the remainder of 2010. While I'm not going to provide financial guidance, it will be a mistake for you to conclude that we're retracting the guidance provided by the two companies prior to the combination, or that we are in any way less confident about our outlook for this year. 
In fact, there are at least three things that make us more confident than we were at the time of our prior forecast. First, North American natural gas prices have fallen meaningfully over the last two months. Our previous forecast assumed an average cost of $5.05 per MMBtu at Henry Hub over the course of 2010. Right now, December is the only month on the NYMEX Strip for the remainder of the year with a price of $5 or more. Second, our confidence has increased that corn planting will meet or exceed the USDA estimate of 88.8 million acres because of favorable farm level economics, excellent planting conditions across the Midwest and the incentive to plant corn in other major growing regions. And third, we have much more confidence around spring nitrogen application rates because of the blockbuster pre-plant anhydrous ammonia season we had in April. 
Our production mix among nitrogen fertilizer products is very balanced and good ammonia pre-plant application plays to our competitive advantage in Corn Belt storage and distribution capability. In April, we delivered more ammonia than in any other month since we became a public company, and over 70% more than the average of the previous five Aprils. Ammonia shipments for the legacy Terra operations also were greater than for any month over the same time period. 
We're working hard to resupply our system for side-dress application and it could be a welcome challenge to restock our terminal system fully by the fall. In addition to rebounding agricultural demand, industrial demand for nitrogen is strengthening, which was evident in Terra's first quarter volumes. While product demand is growing, downstream inventory continues to be tight. 
As of the end of March, fertilizer year-to-date imports of nitrogen products ranged from 13% to 46% below their five-year averages. DAP and MAP inventories are also very low at both the producer and distributor levels, and we currently expect U.S. agricultural demand for phosphate to increase by 15% this year to 4.2 million tons. 
U.S. corn prices have been under scrutiny in recent weeks because of strong plantings and favorable weather. However, corn exports in the U.S. are expected to remain strong this year, as global coarse grain demand rose by 2.8% compared to last year. Recent Chinese purchases of corn have the potential to increase U.S. exports beyond previous expectations. 
Ethanol production in the U.S. also is expected to rise due to the increasing renewable fuel standard and could get a further boost from an increase to the blend rate. Despite recent concerns, December corn futures prices continue to be in what we consider to be the optimal range for our business. 
The bottom line is that we continue to be very optimistic about demand and margin opportunities for the second quarter. Consequently, we're pleased to have a substantial amount of unpriced product that will allow us to capture those opportunities. We believe that we and our shareholders will continue to be rewarded for this approach. We also feel great about the things we can accomplish as a result of our acquisition of Terra Industries. 
I'd like to wrap up this morning by articulating the strategic imperatives that will drive us to achieve our vision for the new CF Industries. Our first priority is to deliver a great spring season, as measured by customer service, sales and production volumes, margin management and safety. The second thing we need to do is to execute our detailed integration plan. Through that integration process, we expect to deliver synergies of at least $135 million per year over the next 18 months. 
After we've done the heavy lifting on integration and synergies, there will be other opportunities to optimize the combined company's business. Simultaneously, we will continue to pay down debt to get us to our desired capital structure. Achieving that target leverage range will then allow us to capitalize on organic growth opportunities and eventually on global strategic opportunities in fertilizer manufacturing and distribution. 
All along the way, we intend to continue to engage actively with the investment community. We look forward to seeing many of you at that BMO Agricultural Conference on May 20 and the Goldman Sachs Basic Materials Conference on June 3. 
With that, let's open the call to your questions. Antoine, would you please explain the Q&A procedure."

And so other than ammonia, nitrogen products were certainly short in terms of inventory levels. And I think there was actually a lot of building stress coming with respect to urea and UAN because of the shortfall in imports. 
Now that we've had a very strong ammonia run, it's more likely that urea and UAN supply and demand will be in the somewhat better balance. Although we still think it will be tight, we're expecting a strong season in UAN and ammonia. I think that's our perspective on imports. With respect to inventory levels in our own system, we managed our whole system to meet what we believe are our customers' expectations are. With respect to ammonia, there really isn't any choice. If we want to be in the ammonia business, we need to store the ammonia in our system. And our system is a great system. The benefit of that system was definitely on display in the month of April. Other products, we'll manage our inventory levels consistent with a balance between what we see our customer demand to be and our operating desires at the plant level. We look for a balance there."

We are generally in agreement with the price for Ukraine that Ferticon had been using of around $6.70 per MMBTUs. That price to the fertilizer producers in the Ukraine was subsidized by the Ukrainian natural gas company using inventories that they had built up in previous periods. I would say that while we think we know where this is going, it's not a completely transparent situation. What we think's going happen is, as a result of lower delivery prices from the Russians, the Ukrainians will follow through with their pledge to the IMF to start backing off on subsidies to fertilizer producers. And so the net position after the subsidy has taken off and you substitute the cheaper Russian gas is still probably going to be an increase in the average price coming out of the Ukraine to something like $7 or so. So we think on balance, it's about the same situation net to possibly slightly higher, which of course decreases the competitiveness of Ukrainian production coming into the international markets."

As we said before, when we buy gas, it's typically related to a forward sale. We've also mentioned in previous calls that because we like the opportunity to potentially capitalize on expanding margins, due to flat to weak gas prices and stronger pricing for our products, we stay sharp into that market. As Steve pointed out on the earnings call, a forward NYMEX curve so far is validating our view for the gas for the rest of the year. And we'll probably continue this current program in this current path because we think it's the optimal one in terms of optimizing margin, which is what we focus on. With respect to locking in, anything separate from an FPP sale, we do have that authority. We typically, in the past, have not used it extensively, locking in extra gas to the extent of seven to 10 days of consumption. If gas popped up on the forward curve at $3.50 or $3, we probably get the committee together and have a serious discussion about it because it's something we want to look at. So we can be pretty flexible about that but basically, we're going to continue the same approach to gas and the pricing and margin management that we've had for the last several quarters."

With respect to the whole global nitrogen situation, I just say from a 50,000 foot level, the nitrogen economics are working as they're supposed to work. Those weakness in European demand, product didn't move there to the extent that it might have otherwise. The natural productions that was headed there was a production that had to ease off in Eastern Europe and so forth. So it's a global industry and world prices are determined globally. However, there can be regional dislocations and we see that, for example, in the ammonia market, Corn Belt ammonia has its own set of economics. One of the reasons we like that business so much."

For the second quarter of 2010, CF Industries reported net income of $105 million or $1.54 per diluted share, down from earnings of $213 million or $4.33 per share in the same period last yea",1239,"Thanks, Terry, and thank you, all, for joining us this morning. For the second quarter of 2010, CF Industries reported net income of $105 million or $1.54 per diluted share, down from earnings of $213 million or $4.33 per share in the same period last year. The quarter included some significant onetime costs related to our acquisition of Terra Industries and some other unusual items, which Tony will discuss later in the call. 
We came in to this acquisition with a vision of a great company we can build by bringing these two businesses together. Now we have the chance to make that vision a reality, and we like what we're finding every day as we do that. Of course, there's a lot of work to integrate the business practices, systems and organizations of two public companies, and we'll be at it for some time to come. But that effort is energizing those of us who are working on it because we can see the benefits and opportunities available to us. 
Briefly, those benefits and opportunities come in two forms. First is a set of synergies we've outlined in past discussions, which we've targeted at $105 million to $135 million per year. Since April 5, teams of employees with a CF Industries heritage and employees with a Terra heritage have identified scores of individual initiatives that add up to an amount greater than the high end of this targeted range. Over the coming quarters, we'll continue our rigorous process to implement these actions and make sure that these savings and more are realized. 
Second, we've always believed that as the integration proceeds, we'll find that we have better market intelligence and that we'll identify expanded capabilities and a host of new options available to us. While we're far from completely optimizing the combined manufacturing, logistics and sales organizations, we are finding new improvement opportunities and rapid succession. Some of these can be implemented immediately, while others require modifications to business processes and systems. We've focused our attention on the low-hanging fruit now, even while we're finalizing plans for the future state. This allowed us to make some successful tactical moves in the second quarter and into July that wouldn't have been possible for either the legacy companies alone. 
We told you in our first quarter report that our first priority through the spring would be serving our customers without any gaps or missteps. I'm proud of the way our team performed to make sure that this was the case, and I'm happy to report that we didn't drop the ball for any of our customers. 
The extremely strong ammonia season challenged our ability to meet all the demand, and employees from all parts of the company responded, delivering more ammonia to our customers than many of us thought possible in a single quarter. As an example, one of our ammonia terminals, which had extended to 24-hour operations, emptied half of its 30,000-ton ammonia tank in just 3 1/2 days. For the industry, this turned out to be the highest volume of spring for direct-application ammonia volume since 1994, surpassing our industry expectations by approximately 600,000 tons. 
The favorable weather for ammonia application changed more than just the mix among nitrogen products. It also raised the total amount of nitrogen applied in the fertilizer year by a meaningful amount. However, it wasn't until late June or early July that the marketplace fully appreciated this fact and realized its implications for urea and UAN inventories throughout the distribution chain. 
Prices of those two products, and especially of UAN, drifted lower during the second quarter because of the weather-impaired first quarter application season in the Southern Plains and the mix shift toward ammonia. The recent trend of reluctance to hold inventory downstream seemed to peak at the end of the spring season, which kept additional pressure on domestic urea and UAN pricing at the time when global prices also were in decline. 
By the end of June, supply and demand factors collided to spur a global rebound in prices. On the supply side, summer maintenance schedules pulled production off the market in Central Europe and other locations. on the demand side, India and Pakistan came into the market for large nitrogen purchases, which they had deferred relative to past year's buying patterns. 
As global prices moved up, the extent of the destocking in North America became apparent, and price increases here outpaced those in the international market. While that upward move reinforces our confidence about what we can do in the second half of the year, it came too late to help second quarter results for these products. 
Our acquisition of Terra was very timely in helping us respond to somewhat unusual buying patterns. Reluctance by wholesaler to take large positions this spring increased the portion of business transacted in relatively small lots. This pattern favored inland distribution points, including our new plants in Oklahoma and Iowa. We took that opportunity to switch the plant sourcing for some other more distant customers that those plants have served in the past to Donaldsonville. That enabled us to focus Oklahoma and Iowa production to close in regional customers. It's precisely this type of opportunity that we intend to exploit in the months and years ahead to benefit both customers and investors. 
The story for our Phosphate business was very different. I would characterize the sales volume in the quarter as normal, although it suffered by comparison to last year's elevated volume. 2009 phosphate volumes were high because we are working off an excess inventory position after the collapse of the 2008 commodities level, which also led to depressed phosphate prices at the time. Our average selling price for DAP this quarter was $400 per ton, about $100 higher than in the 2009 quarter. 
Gross margin rose to 16% for our Phosphate segment. With more normal industry supply and demand conditions, we focused more on the domestic markets compared to last year. Domestic sales of DAP and MAP were about 4% higher year-over-year, whereas exports were 33% lower. 
Tampa contract sulfur prices decreased from $145 per long ton in the second quarter to $95 per long ton in the third quarter. Ammonia costs for our phosphate operations have risen by $25 per ton for the current period. 
Natural gas prices got below $4 per MMBtu in April with a warm in to winter. Hot summer weather eventually led to rising natural gas cost, as demand for electric power surged and perceived hurricane risk increased. On top of that, the Gulf oil spill presented the possibility that drilling would be curtailed in the Gulf. As a result, natural gas costs rose above $5 before again retrieving. Our average North American realized cost was $4.42 per MMBtu during the quarter. 
As we look back on the second quarter, we feel good about the way we responded to these conditions in natural gas markets. We didn't panic, which could have led us to lock in higher gas costs. We kept an even hand because of our long-term outlook that gas costs will remain advantageous for North American buyer. The one move we did make was to cap our pricing risk again possible hurricane-related spikes over the next three months, which we think was a prudent thing to do. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Tony to review our second quarter financial performance in more detail."
22357184,109689306,72753,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-06-2010",2010-08-06,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As Steve indicated, CF Industries reported net income of $105 million or $1.54 per diluted share in the second quarter, down from earnings of $213 million or $4.33 per share in the same period last year. Second q",604,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As Steve indicated, CF Industries reported net income of $105 million or $1.54 per diluted share in the second quarter, down from earnings of $213 million or $4.33 per share in the same period last year. Second quarter earnings included $114 million of business combination and integration costs, and unrealized mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives of $15 million, and Peru project development costs of almost $2 million. Second quarter EBITDA of $392 million included the $55 million of business combination and integration costs unrelated to accelerated loan amortization, $15 million of unrealized mark-to-market gains and $2 million of Peru project development costs. 
In the second quarter of 2010, net sales of $1.3 billion included Nitrogen segment sales of $1.1 billion and Phosphate segment sales of $185 million. Nitrogen volume for the quarter were 3.9 million tons compared to 1.9 million tons in the year-ago quarter. Nitrogen sales were 49% higher than in the second quarter of 2009. Both segment volumes and sales were, of course, boosted by the acquisition of Terra. Our average price realization for ammonia was $380 per ton, which was up about $60 sequentially but was lower than the average price last year, which benefited from FPP sales booked in the peak of the market. 
Sales volume of 1.2 million tons of ammonia exceeded all expectations. Comparing that to our terminal storage capacity of about 650,000 tons, illustrates how fast product was turning in the quarter. Urea price realizations were about the same as the second quarter of 2009, but down slightly sequentially. UAN price realizations were 30% lower than the second quarter of 2009, but 7% higher sequentially. DAP average price realizations for the second quarter were 32% higher than the second quarter of 2009 and 11% higher sequentially. 
Gross margin of $397 million was down 7% from the year-earlier quarter. Gross margin for the Nitrogen segment was down $36 million, with the inclusion of Terra's results failing to offset the significant year-over-year decrease in average prices for ammonia and UAN. Gross margin for the Phosphate segment was up, largely due to the increase in pricing. 
On June 30, 2010, the company's cash and cash equivalents totaled $600 million. We also held $125 million in auction rate securities. Net debt was $2 billion, and we made good progress in paying down debt. We'll continue to use available cash flow to pay down the bank debt, moving us toward our net debt-to-EBITDA target of 1:1.5. Operating cash flow in the quarter included a seasonal outflow of $378 million for a reduction in customer deposits. We ended the quarter with $11 million in customer deposits. 
Finally, I'd like to announce that we have agreed on the terms of the consent decree with the EPA and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to resolve a notice of violation issued by the EPA in 2005 over phosphate industry water management practices. We've disclosed the enforcement matter in our Securities filings since issuance of the notice of violation, including our ongoing negotiations to resolve it. 
The U.S. government and the State of Florida are filing a consent decree with the Federal District Court in Tampa this morning, and it won't be final until it's approved by the court. Because the settlement is considered confidential by the government until it's lodged with the court, we won't be able to disclose the specific terms on the call this morning. I will say that we anticipated and planned for this outcome, and we're pleased to have resolved this issue through a negotiated settlement. Now let me turn it back to Steve."
22357184,109689306,72753,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-06-2010",2010-08-06,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony.

The conditions in agricultural markets always provide the basis for our outlook, and those conditions remain positive. Global grain prices dipped during the second quarter but have moved up strongly in the third because of drought conditions in the former Soviet Union and parts of Europe. 
We expect to see corn prices well above historical averages through the marketing year, as already tight conditions receive additional support from export demand and the Renewable Fuel Standard. You can see the strength of the demand environment when you consider that despite a forecast for one of the largest U.S. corn crops of all time, the stocks-to-use ratio is still projected to fall. 
Financial markets will watch yield projections for the 2010 and 2011 crop carefully over the coming weeks. Our base forecast assumes that this year's corn yield will be in line with the trend, with some areas producing very good yields but others suffering from excess moisture received in the spring. Farmers should enter planting in 2011 in a strong financial position. Crop budgets continue to favor corn planting next year, with variable returns for corn expected to be at about $100 per acre, greater than for soybean. We expect 2011 to surpass 2010, as the second highest corn planting of all time in the U.S. 
In addition to higher planted area, we expect nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer demand in the U.S. to benefit from higher application rates as well. In the fall, we expect Midwest ammonia shipments to rebound 9% from last year's weak weather-depressed season. That rebound in the very low ammonia inventory position in the Midwest right now should support attractive Corn Belt pricing. Also note that a couple of ammonia upgrading projects was slated to come online, including our own project at Woodward. 
U.S. Gulf urea prices rose by about 15% during July. The global supply-demand balance will depend in part on supply outages, which are difficult to predict. But the tone of the market now is positive. The domestic urea market should be supported by the planting and application outlook I just discussed. U.S. Gulf UAN prices rose by about 40% in July, as customers rushed to restock severely depleted downstream inventory. U.S. phosphate producer shipments are expected to remain strong through the fall, underpinned by continued recovery in the domestic markets and strong offshore demand, mainly from India. 
Many of you probably noticed that we did not specify our forward-order position in our release. We decided to end that practice for several reasons. First, our Forward Pricing Program has served us well during its seven-year history and continues to be an important marketing tool. The original reason for disclosing our FPP position was to provide investors with insight into our risk-mitigation actions in the context of high and volatile natural gas costs. As a new public company, we wanted to assure our investors that we practice margin discipline in this commodity price-driven business. I believe that the need to provide quantitative assurance of that discipline has been diminished over time, as we've compiled a track record of demonstrating it. 
Second, we're now a much larger company with a very different and more stable risk profile. FPP is just one of several tools we have available to manage our margin, and we have decided that highlighting just one tool gives it undue prominence in our discussions with investors. And finally, we simply believe that our forward-order position is competitively sensitive information. Consequently, we've dropped discussion of the FPP order book from our routine disclosures. 
To summarize where we stand for the second half of the year, our outlook for demand and margins is very favorable, which should sustain strong profitability and cash flow and allow us to pay down our bank debt quickly. Beyond the market factors supporting our success, I feel great about where what we've accomplished our integration. We're ahead of our original synergy plan, our team is energized and working effectively to blend the best of both legacy company's approaches to the business. I'm very confident in our ability to optimize North America's largest nitrogen system. 
Next week, we will mark our fifth anniversary as a public company. It's very gratifying to look back at what we've accomplished during those five years, as we made the transition from a Corn Belt co-op to a successful public company and now a much larger enterprise. A lot has changed in those five years, but our team believes that we're just getting started down the path of establishing CF Industries as a global leader in the Nitrogen and Phosphate businesses and building long-term value for investors. 
With that, let's open the call to your questions. Noella, please explain the Q&A procedures."

With respect to natural gas, we maintain our discipline of essentially backing forward orders with committed gas so that we have -- we lock in our margin and we mitigate the risks associated with being exposed on one side or the other. We have the ability under our natural gas policy to take gas positions outside of that. We do that sporadically when we believe the market is in a good place and we're comfortable taking a gas position. We would never get into a gas position that exceeded our physical needs for gas. It's a pretty tightly controlled process, and our policy is board approved.

I guess I would prefer to look at the kind of synergy part that you're referring to as market-based synergies in kind of a broad sense. Revenue would be part of it, but there are also cost synergies that come with taking the kind of actions that we'll take. CF traditionally has had a focus on large wholesale customers, where we've been relationship-driven. We value those relationships. We'll continue to value those relationships in the months and years ahead. They're very important cornerstones to our business. Terra had a different approach. Terra had a substantial number of smaller customers downstream, further than the wholesalers. Those relationships were a set of very, very strong long-standing relationships, and we value those relationships. And so, we will continue to take a position with respect to our customers, where we want to have long-standing good relationships, but we also are making enough product that we like to have, product available to take care of, to respond to opportunities that arise in the marketplace on occasion. So we will be working in the following fashion. We'll be trying to optimize how we serve those customers. We will be working to make sure that we have the right mix of Domestic business and Export business. We have established ourselves quite well in the export market with respect to both phosphate and more recently, nitrogen. And so with Donaldsonville, where it is and the legacy Terra plants where they are, we have a tremendous opportunity on a continuous basis, optimize what business we serve from what locations and take advantage of export opportunities. And then I guess the other leg I would add to that is that Terra had a substantial percentage of its business in the industrial market. We had some of that at legacy CF, but not nearly as much. So as we look at industrial customers, and frankly, all of our customers, we need to be cognizant of the fact that we should be putting our product to its highest and best use, and that's frankly what will drive our whole marketing strategy going forward. We have the full range of nitrogen products now, and we have multiple locations at which to produce them. And we'll be looking to put every ton to its highest and best use."

Certainly, I don't know the details of the case, but I certainly know in general that they seem to have followed all the prescribed procedures and done it in a good-faith way and obtained their permit.

What we did in the second quarter in this area is I would say, a hint at what we can do in the future. It was meaningful to us because we did it, and we were able to move the product where we want to move it out of both legacy systems. And we proved to ourselves that what we believe is a substantial opportunity can be achieved. There will be much more of this kind of activity in the quarters ahead. With respect to Peru, the comment on infrastructure, if I turn it in to a more specific comment, is really focused on the need to construct a pipeline from where the major pipeline comes to the coast from the Camisea gas fields down to our potential plant site, which is a distance of about 120 kilometers. There's been no work on that. And we, obviously, are dependent upon that. We wouldn't make a decision on a project in the absence of that and no one would lend us any money for the project, even if we wanted to make a decision. In addition to that, the Camisea fields continue to be expanded, more gas must come over the Andes to the coast and there's a pipeline expansion that has to happen in order to get sufficient quantity to the coast to feed all the needs that have been promised by the gas producers. So those are two events, two hurdles that have to be overcome. These things have to be put in place before we make a decision. We continue to do work on the cost, the cost profile is moving in the right direction. Of course, part of the reason that's moving in the right direction has been the change in the value of the currencies. The euro has weakened, and we have substantial euro content. That could go the other way and could erase it in short order. So we don't have a definitive cost at this point, and we won't really have a definitive cost until we get to decision day."

For the second quarter of 2010, CF Industries reported net income of $105 million or $1.54 per diluted share, down from earnings of $213 million or $4.33 per share in the same period last year. The quarter included some significant onetime costs related to our acquisition of Terra Industries and some other unusual items, which Tony will discuss later in the call. 
We came in to this acquisition with a vision of a great company we can build by bringing these two businesses together. Now we have the chance to make that vision a reality, and we like what we're finding every day as we do that. Of course, there's a lot of work to integrate the business practices, systems and organizations of two public companies, and we'll be at it for some time to come. But that effort is energizing those of us who are working on it because we can see the benefits and opportunities available to us. 
Briefly, those benefits and opportunities come in two forms. First is a set of synergies we've outlined in past discussions, which we've targeted at $105 million to $135 million per year. Since April 5, teams of employees with a CF Industries heritage and employees with a Terra heritage have identified scores of individual initiatives that add up to an amount greater than the high end of this targeted range. Over the coming quarters, we'll continue our rigorous process to implement these actions and make sure that these savings and more are realized. 
Second, we've always believed that as the integration proceeds, we'll find that we have better market intelligence and that we'll identify expanded capabilities and a host of new options available to us. While we're far from completely optimizing the combined manufacturing, logistics and sales organizations, we are finding new improvement opportunities and rapid succession. Some of these can be implemented immediately, while others require modifications to business processes and systems. We've focused our attention on the low-hanging fruit now, even while we're finalizing plans for the future state. This allowed us to make some successful tactical moves in the second quarter and into July that wouldn't have been possible for either the legacy companies alone. 
We told you in our first quarter report that our first priority through the spring would be serving our customers without any gaps or missteps. I'm proud of the way our team performed to make sure that this was the case, and I'm happy to report that we didn't drop the ball for any of our customers. 
The extremely strong ammonia season challenged our ability to meet all the demand, and employees from all parts of the company responded, delivering more ammonia to our customers than many of us thought possible in a single quarter. As an example, one of our ammonia terminals, which had extended to 24-hour operations, emptied half of its 30,000-ton ammonia tank in just 3 1/2 days. For the industry, this turned out to be the highest volume of spring for direct-application ammonia volume since 1994, surpassing our industry expectations by approximately 600,000 tons. 
The favorable weather for ammonia application changed more than just the mix among nitrogen products. It also raised the total amount of nitrogen applied in the fertilizer year by a meaningful amount. However, it wasn't until late June or early July that the marketplace fully appreciated this fact and realized its implications for urea and UAN inventories throughout the distribution chain. 
Prices of those two products, and especially of UAN, drifted lower during the second quarter because of the weather-impaired first quarter application season in the Southern Plains and the mix shift toward ammonia. The recent trend of reluctance to hold inventory downstream seemed to peak at the end of the spring season, which kept additional pressure on domestic urea and UAN pricing at the time when global prices also were in decline. 
By the end of June, supply and demand factors collided to spur a global rebound in prices. On the supply side, summer maintenance schedules pulled production off the market in Central Europe and other locations. on the demand side, India and Pakistan came into the market for large nitrogen purchases, which they had deferred relative to past year's buying patterns. 
As global prices moved up, the extent of the destocking in North America became apparent, and price increases here outpaced those in the international market. While that upward move reinforces our confidence about what we can do in the second half of the year, it came too late to help second quarter results for these products. 
Our acquisition of Terra was very timely in helping us respond to somewhat unusual buying patterns. Reluctance by wholesaler to take large positions this spring increased the portion of business transacted in relatively small lots. This pattern favored inland distribution points, including our new plants in Oklahoma and Iowa. We took that opportunity to switch the plant sourcing for some other more distant customers that those plants have served in the past to Donaldsonville. That enabled us to focus Oklahoma and Iowa production to close in regional customers. It's precisely this type of opportunity that we intend to exploit in the months and years ahead to benefit both customers and investors. 
The story for our Phosphate business was very different. I would characterize the sales volume in the quarter as normal, although it suffered by comparison to last year's elevated volume. 2009 phosphate volumes were high because we are working off an excess inventory position after the collapse of the 2008 commodities level, which also led to depressed phosphate prices at the time. Our average selling price for DAP this quarter was $400 per ton, about $100 higher than in the 2009 quarter. 
Gross margin rose to 16% for our Phosphate segment. With more normal industry supply and demand conditions, we focused more on the domestic markets compared to last year. Domestic sales of DAP and MAP were about 4% higher year-over-year, whereas exports were 33% lower. 
Tampa contract sulfur prices decreased from $145 per long ton in the second quarter to $95 per long ton in the third quarter. Ammonia costs for our phosphate operations have risen by $25 per ton for the current period. 
Natural gas prices got below $4 per MMBtu in April with a warm in to winter. Hot summer weather eventually led to rising natural gas cost, as demand for electric power surged and perceived hurricane risk increased. On top of that, the Gulf oil spill presented the possibility that drilling would be curtailed in the Gulf. As a result, natural gas costs rose above $5 before again retrieving. Our average North American realized cost was $4.42 per MMBtu during the quarter. 
As we look back on the second quarter, we feel good about the way we responded to these conditions in natural gas markets. We didn't panic, which could have led us to lock in higher gas costs. We kept an even hand because of our long-term outlook that gas costs will remain advantageous for North American buyer. The one move we did make was to cap our pricing risk again possible hurricane-related spikes over the next three months, which we think was a prudent thing to do. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Tony to review our second quarter financial performance in more detail.

As Steve indicated, CF Industries reported net income of $105 million or $1.54 per diluted share in the second quarter, down from earnings of $213 million or $4.33 per share in the same period last year. Second quarter earnings included $114 million of business combination and integration costs, and unrealized mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives of $15 million, and Peru project development costs of almost $2 million. Second quarter EBITDA of $392 million included the $55 million of business combination and integration costs unrelated to accelerated loan amortization, $15 million of unrealized mark-to-market gains and $2 million of Peru project development costs. 
In the second quarter of 2010, net sales of $1.3 billion included Nitrogen segment sales of $1.1 billion and Phosphate segment sales of $185 million. Nitrogen volume for the quarter were 3.9 million tons compared to 1.9 million tons in the year-ago quarter. Nitrogen sales were 49% higher than in the second quarter of 2009. Both segment volumes and sales were, of course, boosted by the acquisition of Terra. Our average price realization for ammonia was $380 per ton, which was up about $60 sequentially but was lower than the average price last year, which benefited from FPP sales booked in the peak of the market. 
Sales volume of 1.2 million tons of ammonia exceeded all expectations. Comparing that to our terminal storage capacity of about 650,000 tons, illustrates how fast product was turning in the quarter. Urea price realizations were about the same as the second quarter of 2009, but down slightly sequentially. UAN price realizations were 30% lower than the second quarter of 2009, but 7% higher sequentially. DAP average price realizations for the second quarter were 32% higher than the second quarter of 2009 and 11% higher sequentially. 
Gross margin of $397 million was down 7% from the year-earlier quarter. Gross margin for the Nitrogen segment was down $36 million, with the inclusion of Terra's results failing to offset the significant year-over-year decrease in average prices for ammonia and UAN. Gross margin for the Phosphate segment was up, largely due to the increase in pricing. 
On June 30, 2010, the company's cash and cash equivalents totaled $600 million. We also held $125 million in auction rate securities. Net debt was $2 billion, and we made good progress in paying down debt. We'll continue to use available cash flow to pay down the bank debt, moving us toward our net debt-to-EBITDA target of 1:1.5. Operating cash flow in the quarter included a seasonal outflow of $378 million for a reduction in customer deposits. We ended the quarter with $11 million in customer deposits. 
Finally, I'd like to announce that we have agreed on the terms of the consent decree with the EPA and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to resolve a notice of violation issued by the EPA in 2005 over phosphate industry water management practices. We've disclosed the enforcement matter in our Securities filings since issuance of the notice of violation, including our ongoing negotiations to resolve it. 
The U.S. government and the State of Florida are filing a consent decree with the Federal District Court in Tampa this morning, and it won't be final until it's approved by the court. Because the settlement is considered confidential by the government until it's lodged with the court, we won't be able to disclose the specific terms on the call this morning. I will say that we anticipated and planned for this outcome, and we're pleased to have resolved this issue through a negotiated settlement. Now let me turn it back to Steve.

The conditions in agricultural markets always provide the basis for our outlook, and those conditions remain positive. Global grain prices dipped during the second quarter but have moved up strongly in the third because of drought conditions in the former Soviet Union and parts of Europe. 
We expect to see corn prices well above historical averages through the marketing year, as already tight conditions receive additional support from export demand and the Renewable Fuel Standard. You can see the strength of the demand environment when you consider that despite a forecast for one of the largest U.S. corn crops of all time, the stocks-to-use ratio is still projected to fall. 
Financial markets will watch yield projections for the 2010 and 2011 crop carefully over the coming weeks. Our base forecast assumes that this year's corn yield will be in line with the trend, with some areas producing very good yields but others suffering from excess moisture received in the spring. Farmers should enter planting in 2011 in a strong financial position. Crop budgets continue to favor corn planting next year, with variable returns for corn expected to be at about $100 per acre, greater than for soybean. We expect 2011 to surpass 2010, as the second highest corn planting of all time in the U.S. 
In addition to higher planted area, we expect nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer demand in the U.S. to benefit from higher application rates as well. In the fall, we expect Midwest ammonia shipments to rebound 9% from last year's weak weather-depressed season. That rebound in the very low ammonia inventory position in the Midwest right now should support attractive Corn Belt pricing. Also note that a couple of ammonia upgrading projects was slated to come online, including our own project at Woodward. 
U.S. Gulf urea prices rose by about 15% during July. The global supply-demand balance will depend in part on supply outages, which are difficult to predict. But the tone of the market now is positive. The domestic urea market should be supported by the planting and application outlook I just discussed. U.S. Gulf UAN prices rose by about 40% in July, as customers rushed to restock severely depleted downstream inventory. U.S. phosphate producer shipments are expected to remain strong through the fall, underpinned by continued recovery in the domestic markets and strong offshore demand, mainly from India. 
Many of you probably noticed that we did not specify our forward-order position in our release. We decided to end that practice for several reasons. First, our Forward Pricing Program has served us well during its seven-year history and continues to be an important marketing tool. The original reason for disclosing our FPP position was to provide investors with insight into our risk-mitigation actions in the context of high and volatile natural gas costs. As a new public company, we wanted to assure our investors that we practice margin discipline in this commodity price-driven business. I believe that the need to provide quantitative assurance of that discipline has been diminished over time, as we've compiled a track record of demonstrating it. 
Second, we're now a much larger company with a very different and more stable risk profile. FPP is just one of several tools we have available to manage our margin, and we have decided that highlighting just one tool gives it undue prominence in our discussions with investors. And finally, we simply believe that our forward-order position is competitively sensitive information. Consequently, we've dropped discussion of the FPP order book from our routine disclosures. 
To summarize where we stand for the second half of the year, our outlook for demand and margins is very favorable, which should sustain strong profitability and cash flow and allow us to pay down our bank debt quickly. Beyond the market factors supporting our success, I feel great about where what we've accomplished our integration. We're ahead of our original synergy plan, our team is energized and working effectively to blend the best of both legacy company's approaches to the business. I'm very confident in our ability to optimize North America's largest nitrogen system. 
Next week, we will mark our fifth anniversary as a public company. It's very gratifying to look back at what we've accomplished during those five years, as we made the transition from a Corn Belt co-op to a successful public company and now a much larger enterprise. A lot has changed in those five years, but our team believes that we're just getting started down the path of establishing CF Industries as a global leader in the Nitrogen and Phosphate businesses and building long-term value for investors. 
With that, let's open the call to your questions. Noella, please explain the Q&A procedures.

I guess I would prefer to look at the kind of synergy part that you're referring to as market-based synergies in kind of a broad sense. Revenue would be part of it, but there are also cost synergies that come with taking the kind of actions that we'll take. CF traditionally has had a focus on large wholesale customers, where we've been relationship-driven. We value those relationships. We'll continue to value those relationships in the months and years ahead. They're very important cornerstones to our business. Terra had a different approach. Terra had a substantial number of smaller customers downstream, further than the wholesalers. Those relationships were a set of very, very strong long-standing relationships, and we value those relationships. And so, we will continue to take a position with respect to our customers, where we want to have long-standing good relationships, but we also are making enough product that we like to have, product available to take care of, to respond to opportunities that arise in the marketplace on occasion. So we will be working in the following fashion. We'll be trying to optimize how we serve those customers. We will be working to make sure that we have the right mix of Domestic business and Export business. We have established ourselves quite well in the export market with respect to both phosphate and more recently, nitrogen. And so with Donaldsonville, where it is and the legacy Terra plants where they are, we have a tremendous opportunity on a continuous basis, optimize what business we serve from what locations and take advantage of export opportunities. And then I guess the other leg I would add to that is that Terra had a substantial percentage of its business in the industrial market. We had some of that at legacy CF, but not nearly as much. So as we look at industrial customers, and frankly, all of our customers, we need to be cognizant of the fact that we should be putting our product to its highest and best use, and that's frankly what will drive our whole marketing strategy going forward. We have the full range of nitrogen products now, and we have multiple locations at which to produce them. And we'll be looking to put every ton to its highest and best use.

I guess I would reinforce comments that we've made, I think, consistently to investors. And that is, we have a pretty much a perfect match between our mine capability, our mine production and the needs of our chemical plant. And we designed it that way. We do not have excess rock production. And certainly, the production that we have right now is earmarked for Plant City and on to our customers. I would like, if I may, just make a comment on the situation that Mosaic has. We don't take any pleasure in watching that happen. We operate in the same state. We operate with the same set of regulators. We operate with the same permitting practices. And we watched that situation over the years. Certainly, I don't know the details of the case, but I certainly know in general that they seem to have followed all the prescribed procedures and done it in a good-faith way and obtained their permit. And I think it's unfortunate that they're not able to mine their property. In respect of our own situation, we do have 12 or 13 years of fully permitted reserves in Hardee County today. But down the road, we have plans to mine some more rock. And so, we look at the experience that Mosaic has had, and we'll certainly learn from that experience and build as many bridges as we can to various constituencies along the way. But it's certainly a troublesome situation.

And we had a spike in wheat prices yesterday and the day before. We have seen good movement up in corn prices. There's a lot of money to be made in growing crops next year. And our model, I think, as I indicated, shows corn leading to about $100 an acre, more value than soybeans. Actually, that spread has probably widened in the last few days. Whether today's corn prices is sustainable is I think open to some question. But corn in the $3.80, $4, $4.20 range is really good for I think everybody in the chain. And at the farm level, I don't think today's nitrogen prices would be an impediment to planting.

I think, Don, is now with 91 million acres for 2011. With respect to DEF, it's clear to us after a few months that Terra has done a great job of positioning this product in the marketplace. They have led this sector in many ways in terms of establishing a flow of product, although I suppose flow might be overstating it. It may be more like a trickle of product so far, as this DEF gets rolled out into the marketplace. But the brand is established, and there's momentum there. We are in the late stages of evaluating that business. Obviously, we were taking a fresh look here, and we haven't come to a conclusion yet. But I will say, Don, from the broadest of perspectives, we have a lot of flexibility in our production and distribution system. We make a lot of nitrogen, and we can do a lot of different things with it. We have more flexibility in that regard than Terra had. So we want to make sure that as we make decisions with respect to DEF, that we are putting our nitrogen to its highest and best use going forward. That will drive the decision, but the market is clearly there for the product.

What we did in the second quarter in this area is I would say, a hint at what we can do in the future. It was meaningful to us because we did it, and we were able to move the product where we want to move it out of both legacy systems. And we proved to ourselves that what we believe is a substantial opportunity can be achieved. There will be much more of this kind of activity in the quarters ahead. With respect to Peru, the comment on infrastructure, if I turn it in to a more specific comment, is really focused on the need to construct a pipeline from where the major pipeline comes to the coast from the Camisea gas fields down to our potential plant site, which is a distance of about 120 kilometers. There's been no work on that. And we, obviously, are dependent upon that. We wouldn't make a decision on a project in the absence of that and no one would lend us any money for the project, even if we wanted to make a decision. In addition to that, the Camisea fields continue to be expanded, more gas must come over the Andes to the coast and there's a pipeline expansion that has to happen in order to get sufficient quantity to the coast to feed all the needs that have been promised by the gas producers. So those are two events, two hurdles that have to be overcome. These things have to be put in place before we make a decision. We continue to do work on the cost, the cost profile is moving in the right direction. Of course, part of the reason that's moving in the right direction has been the change in the value of the currencies. The euro has weakened, and we have substantial euro content. That could go the other way and could erase it in short order. So we don't have a definitive cost at this point, and we won't really have a definitive cost until we get to decision day.

For the third quarter of 2010, CF Industries reported net income of $48 million or $0.67 per diluted share, compared to earnings of about $39 million or $0.78 per share in the same period las",1172,"Thanks, Terry, and thank you, all, for joining us this morning. For the third quarter of 2010, CF Industries reported net income of $48 million or $0.67 per diluted share, compared to earnings of about $39 million or $0.78 per share in the same period last year. 
Our results benefited from our very timely acquisition of Terra Industries. And certainly, we're looking forward to showing how the integrated company can perform when we have the full benefits of the increases in product prices that unfolded throughout the third quarter and have continued into the fourth quarter, as well as the reductions we've seen in natural gas costs.
Our operating earnings were up 52% year-over-year to $137 million. Operating-related cash flow was almost $600 million, which allowed us to repay $350 million of debt during the third quarter and still exit September with $650 million of cash on the balance sheet. 
We're in a great period for fertilizer manufacturers, especially for those located in North America. Industry conditions improved dramatically during the third quarter, driven by the interplay between significantly higher agricultural commodity prices and constrained availability of fertilizer. 
Higher crop prices were prompted first by an intense drought in the former Soviet Union, which led to Russian grain export controls and tightened world grain trade, especially for wheat. This was followed by significantly lower yield prospects for this year's U.S. corn crop, which pushed domestic crop prices to two-year highs. 
The dramatically higher crop prices, coupled with low fertilizer inventories worldwide, stimulated fertilizer product purchasing, which tightened fertilizer balances. At the same time, world production was limited by higher-than-expected plant outages. All of these factors combined to drive fertilizer prices higher during the quarter.
Domestic urea prices followed global markets upward. In the Midwest, ammonia market factors specific to North America added upward pressure on pricing, including limited supply availability after the exceptional spring application season, strong demand for fall application and pipeline maintenance affecting the Western Corn Belt. 
The UAN market also tightened as nitrates were on high demand in Europe, reducing UAN production and available export supplies from the Black Sea region. U.S. Gulf UAN prices yielded lower net backs to European producers that were available to them in other markets, resulting in low U.S. imports and extremely low U.S. inventories.
Phosphate markets also strengthened considerably due to surging international demand. Higher crop prices stimulated purchasing to restock and to meet higher projected farm demand. Export commitments to India continued to underpin the market, and spot purchasing remained strong through the summer.
U.S. demand was particularly strong, which drove NOLA barge prices above Tampa export prices. This set the tone for world market and even resulted in attracting some imports into the U.S. Additional market strength came from reports of delays of Saudi Arabia's modern project and challenges in raw material supply.
With this market backdrop, we found eager customers for all the product we offered for sale. Of course, with the prices rising as much as they did throughout the quarter, we do wish we had more product available now than we do, but we're generally pleased with the way our book of business has evolved. 
Our third quarter prices were significantly lower than average spot prices published during the quarter. Significant differences are not unusual during periods of rapid price movements, whether that be up or down. In this case, there were a few noteworthy factors at work.
We had export shipments of phosphate, urea and UAN that had been priced in the second quarter. Industrial sales represented about half of ammonia sales in the quarter, a seasonally slow quarter for Ag sales of ammonia. And at the beginning of the quarter, customers had very little purchase volume booked. When they realize how tight the market was becoming, they began making commitments, in effect, chasing pricing higher. So the full impact of higher prices won't be felt until the current quarter and beyond.
Throughout the quarter, we have made excellent progress on our post-acquisition integration and related initiatives. We feel very good about where we are operationally. Our internal coordination within and across functional areas is becoming a strength and now will help us capitalize on more opportunities to optimize our production, transportation, distribution and sales. We continue to be on track to deliver more than $135 million in annual savings, the top end of our predicted synergy range with a run rate of about $100 million implemented by year end.
A good example of our improved coordination is the alignment of product managers and sales with their counterparts in logistics. This enables us to take the day-to-day actions that optimize our business for each major product, such as maximizing the value of our ammonia production, transportation and distribution system. We also have shifted more of our business to deliver pricing rather than FOB plant. This provides better visibility to regional market conditions.
Our primary interest in pursuing Terra was expanding our North American production of nitrogen fertilizer. With the integration of that business well in hand, we've been able to focus more attention on the other parts of Terra's portfolio, and familiarity is breeding enthusiasm. 
The GrowHow venture in the U.K. is performing well and is benefiting from extremely strong nitrate market. The Trinidad ammonia plant has become a great partner for our phosphate operations in Florida. And the Diesel Exhaust Fluid business is proceeding the way that the Terra environmental technologies team had planned. 
We recently completed a thorough study of the DEF market and our position in it. This review validated the approach that the legacy Terra team had taken to this great opportunity and answered our questions that were prerequisites for making further commitments of capital to DEF.
Many of you are familiar with the UAN expansion at the Woodward facility, which will add 500,000 tons of annual UAN capacity this quarter. That project also includes modifications that will add 30 million gallons per year of DEF capacity. We expect to embark on projects at other facilities in the future. Our customers know they can count on us for reliable supply and for leadership in this growing market.
To sum up the business conditions in the third quarter, I don't think any of us could have foreseen how the market would unfold when the quarter began. It seems like a distant memory now, but nitrogen prices were somewhat depressed at the end of June, particularly for UAN. Our results in the quarter only began to reflect the impact of very tight grain balances are having on fertilizer demand and prices and the impact of declining natural gas costs in North America.
Now I'd like to ask Rich Hoker to provide more detail on our financial performance in the third quarter. Rich is our Corporate Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. He has played a key role in maintaining coordination and business discipline in the Terra integration process, a role that has taken on added importance as we conduct our internal and external CFO search.

As Steve indicated earlier, CF Industries reported net earnings of $48 million or $0.67 per diluted share, compared to earnings of about $39 million or $0.78 per share in the same period last year. Third quarter earnings included an unrealized mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives of $26 million pretax, $23 million of business combination and integration costs and Perú project development costs of less than $1 million.
In the third quarter of 2010, net sales of $917 million included Nitrogen segment sales of $735 million and Phosphate segment sales of $182 million. Nitrogen volumes for the quarter were 3 million tons compared to 1.2 million tons in the year-ago quarter. Incidentally, on this call and in our filings, the word tons refer to short tons, unless otherwise noted.
Nitrogen sales were 166% higher than in the third quarter of 2009 due to the acquisition of Terra, stronger demand and higher average prices. Our average price realization for ammonia was $394 per ton, which was about $40 higher than the average price last year. 
Ammonia sales volume was strong at 513,000 tons. Urea price realizations were about the same as the third quarter of 2009, but volume of 713,000 tons was much higher. UAN price realizations were 21% higher than the third quarter of 2009, with volume of 1.4 million tons.
DAP and MAP average price realizations for the third quarter were 43% higher year-over-year and volume was 3% higher. Gross margin of $170 million was up 37% from the year-earlier quarter. Gross margin for the Nitrogen segment was up $39 million from the third quarter of 2009, due to much higher volumes from the inclusion of Terra's results and higher average pricing, offset partially by higher natural gas costs, including the impact of mark-to-market adjustments.
Gross margin for DAP and MAP were up 34% year-over-year due to higher average prices. Steve indicated that our cash balance at the end of the quarter was about $650 million. We also held $122 million in auction rate securities, net debt, including the liability for customer advances, but excluding the auction rate securities was $1.9 billion.
Customer advances grew by more than $300 million during the third quarter, as we resumed forward-selling activity. We paid back $350 million of our bank term loan in the third quarter, which resulted in accelerated amortization of previously incurred loans fees, similar to what we saw in the second quarter. 
Also, there are two new tables in the of our press release that show how this accelerated amortization impacted interest expense and DD&A. Approximately $650 million of the original $1.2 billion term loan was outstanding at September 30.
We also mentioned in the press release that we're in a period of strong cash flow. We'll continue to use available cash flow to pay down our bank debt in the fourth quarter. Now let me turn it back to Steve."

I would like to discuss our outlook for the next couple of quarters. The fall fertilizer season is off to a great start.

I would like to discuss our outlook for the next couple of quarters. The fall fertilizer season is off to a great start. As anticipated, the early corn and soybean harvest is providing a long window for fall fieldwork, and farmers are taking advantage of it. The temperature drop we have experienced over the last two weeks allowed agricultural ammonia movement to get underway earlier than normal in the upper Midwest, and we're in the midst of a period of ideal conditions for ammonia applications.
Available supply is expected to remain very thin, although we may have some volume available in the late fall, if the current excellent weather pattern extends the application season. Foreign and wheat crop prospects have both improved over the last few months, with very tight balances suggesting that planting for each could expand by about 4 million acres next year. A tight domestic grain market and the Russian export ban are expected to crop futures and cash prices have historically high levels. With favorable prices, U.S. farmers will enter the 2011 planting season in an excellent financial position, which should encourage complete fertilizer application. 
Longer term, the EPA's announcement in mid-October that E15 blends are approved for model year 2007 cars and newer will provide additional support to corn planting. The EPA is expected to announce this decision with respect to model years 2001 through 2006, sometime this month.
For the 2011 fertilizer year in total, we increased expect increased planted acreage and higher nutrient application rates to lift nitrogen demand to over 13 million nutrient tons, the second highest on record. Urea prices strengthened recently. If reports that China's export tariff position will start at least two months earlier this year prove to be true, global urea supply will be reduced. UAN prices are also expected to be supported by low domestic inventory levels and international availability and should get further support from the increase in urea prices.
In addition to these favorable fertilizer market factors, the outlook for our Nitrogen segment is supported by low forward natural gas prices. 12-month natural gas strip averages about $4.10, and our future financial results also will benefit from prices below $4 in both October and November of 2010. At today's product price, $4 of natural gas supports the a very high margins.
Phosphate demand for fertilizer year 2011 is projected to increase 8% from 2010, which will return it to the 10-year average. Domestic shipments in the fourth quarter are projected to remain strong due to the robust acreage forecast and recovering application rates. Product availability across the U.S. supply chain remains tight, which may limit new export sales.
Indian import commitments continue to underpin international pricing, while favorable crop prices encourage spot prices in other major markets. Global supply is expected to be constrained by a tight domestic Chinese market and potential supply controls there, as well as continuing delay in the modern project start-up. So the outlook for our business is clearly very positive and should sustain strong profitability and cash flow in upcoming periods, assuming weather and other uncontrollable factors are favorable. 
When we embarked upon the Terra initiative in January 2009, we envisioned a stronger and larger but nimble North American fertilizer producer with a skilled team dedicated to serving customers in an effective and profitable fashion. It was just for this type of market that we sought the combination. I believe we're just beginning to realize the earnings potential of CF Industries.
With that, let's open the call to your questions. Regina, please explain the Q&A procedures."

And Elaine, I'll be a little verbose here because this is part of the whole Terra acquisition story. In March of this year, when we stepped up to the plate with our increase in our offer price, it was based upon having done a lot of homework in terms of our financial profile and the amount of debt we'd be taking on. We did a base case analysis, and we did a stress test. And in the stress test, we looked out a prolonged downturn what that impact might be on our cash-generation ability, and so it backed into a capital expenditure number that we believed was appropriate, in light of the stress test case. So the $205 million or so that we have talked about was based upon the stress-test distress case. So now we're seven months into the combination, and there are two obvious factors that have changed the need for that kind of tight discipline. The first is that seven months of have passed, and we haven't been in the stress case. We have generated a lot of cash. And our outlook through the fourth quarter and into the spring is quite robust. And so, the need for that kind of very, very tight control over spending is not necessary. So what are we doing? Well, we're not opening the cash drawer and letting people come in and grab as much as they want at the plant level. We're going through the same disciplined analysis that we always do. So there's some projects that we suspended back in April that we felt was necessary to suspend in order to conserve capital, though some of those have been released for completion. And then some very good projects that we think will provide increased production and/or efficiency, and projects that support the DEF business it was going to be undertaking. So these aren't major projects but they are very attractive projects and very good for the business."

For the third quarter of 2010, CF Industries reported net income of $48 million or $0.67 per diluted share, compared to earnings of about $39 million or $0.78 per share in the same period las",1172,"Thanks, Terry, and thank you, all, for joining us this morning. For the third quarter of 2010, CF Industries reported net income of $48 million or $0.67 per diluted share, compared to earnings of about $39 million or $0.78 per share in the same period last year. 
Our results benefited from our very timely acquisition of Terra Industries. And certainly, we're looking forward to showing how the integrated company can perform when we have the full benefits of the increases in product prices that unfolded throughout the third quarter and have continued into the fourth quarter, as well as the reductions we've seen in natural gas costs.
Our operating earnings were up 52% year-over-year to $137 million. Operating-related cash flow was almost $600 million, which allowed us to repay $350 million of debt during the third quarter and still exit September with $650 million of cash on the balance sheet. 
We're in a great period for fertilizer manufacturers, especially for those located in North America. Industry conditions improved dramatically during the third quarter, driven by the interplay between significantly higher agricultural commodity prices and constrained availability of fertilizer. 
Higher crop prices were prompted first by an intense drought in the former Soviet Union, which led to Russian grain export controls and tightened world grain trade, especially for wheat. This was followed by significantly lower yield prospects for this year's U.S. corn crop, which pushed domestic crop prices to two-year highs. 
The dramatically higher crop prices, coupled with low fertilizer inventories worldwide, stimulated fertilizer product purchasing, which tightened fertilizer balances. At the same time, world production was limited by higher-than-expected plant outages. All of these factors combined to drive fertilizer prices higher during the quarter.
Domestic urea prices followed global markets upward. In the Midwest, ammonia market factors specific to North America added upward pressure on pricing, including limited supply availability after the exceptional spring application season, strong demand for fall application and pipeline maintenance affecting the Western Corn Belt. 
The UAN market also tightened as nitrates were on high demand in Europe, reducing UAN production and available export supplies from the Black Sea region. U.S. Gulf UAN prices yielded lower net backs to European producers that were available to them in other markets, resulting in low U.S. imports and extremely low U.S. inventories.
Phosphate markets also strengthened considerably due to surging international demand. Higher crop prices stimulated purchasing to restock and to meet higher projected farm demand. Export commitments to India continued to underpin the market, and spot purchasing remained strong through the summer.
U.S. demand was particularly strong, which drove NOLA barge prices above Tampa export prices. This set the tone for world market and even resulted in attracting some imports into the U.S. Additional market strength came from reports of delays of Saudi Arabia's modern project and challenges in raw material supply.
With this market backdrop, we found eager customers for all the product we offered for sale. Of course, with the prices rising as much as they did throughout the quarter, we do wish we had more product available now than we do, but we're generally pleased with the way our book of business has evolved. 
Our third quarter prices were significantly lower than average spot prices published during the quarter. Significant differences are not unusual during periods of rapid price movements, whether that be up or down. In this case, there were a few noteworthy factors at work.
We had export shipments of phosphate, urea and UAN that had been priced in the second quarter. Industrial sales represented about half of ammonia sales in the quarter, a seasonally slow quarter for Ag sales of ammonia. And at the beginning of the quarter, customers had very little purchase volume booked. When they realize how tight the market was becoming, they began making commitments, in effect, chasing pricing higher. So the full impact of higher prices won't be felt until the current quarter and beyond.
Throughout the quarter, we have made excellent progress on our post-acquisition integration and related initiatives. We feel very good about where we are operationally. Our internal coordination within and across functional areas is becoming a strength and now will help us capitalize on more opportunities to optimize our production, transportation, distribution and sales. We continue to be on track to deliver more than $135 million in annual savings, the top end of our predicted synergy range with a run rate of about $100 million implemented by year end.
A good example of our improved coordination is the alignment of product managers and sales with their counterparts in logistics. This enables us to take the day-to-day actions that optimize our business for each major product, such as maximizing the value of our ammonia production, transportation and distribution system. We also have shifted more of our business to deliver pricing rather than FOB plant. This provides better visibility to regional market conditions.
Our primary interest in pursuing Terra was expanding our North American production of nitrogen fertilizer. With the integration of that business well in hand, we've been able to focus more attention on the other parts of Terra's portfolio, and familiarity is breeding enthusiasm. 
The GrowHow venture in the U.K. is performing well and is benefiting from extremely strong nitrate market. The Trinidad ammonia plant has become a great partner for our phosphate operations in Florida. And the Diesel Exhaust Fluid business is proceeding the way that the Terra environmental technologies team had planned. 
We recently completed a thorough study of the DEF market and our position in it. This review validated the approach that the legacy Terra team had taken to this great opportunity and answered our questions that were prerequisites for making further commitments of capital to DEF.
Many of you are familiar with the UAN expansion at the Woodward facility, which will add 500,000 tons of annual UAN capacity this quarter. That project also includes modifications that will add 30 million gallons per year of DEF capacity. We expect to embark on projects at other facilities in the future. Our customers know they can count on us for reliable supply and for leadership in this growing market.
To sum up the business conditions in the third quarter, I don't think any of us could have foreseen how the market would unfold when the quarter began. It seems like a distant memory now, but nitrogen prices were somewhat depressed at the end of June, particularly for UAN. Our results in the quarter only began to reflect the impact of very tight grain balances are having on fertilizer demand and prices and the impact of declining natural gas costs in North America.
Now I'd like to ask Rich Hoker to provide more detail on our financial performance in the third quarter. Rich is our Corporate Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. He has played a key role in maintaining coordination and business discipline in the Terra integration process, a role that has taken on added importance as we conduct our internal and external CFO search.

In the third quarter of 2010, net sales of $917 million included Nitrogen segment sales of $735 million and Phosphate segment sales of $182 million. Nitrogen volumes for the quarter were 3 million tons compared to 1.2 million tons in the year-ago quarter. Incidentally, on this call and in our filings, the word tons refer to short tons, unless otherwise noted.
Nitrogen sales were 166% higher than in the third quarter of 2009 due to the acquisition of Terra, stronger demand and higher average prices. Our average price realization for ammonia was $394 per ton, which was about $40 higher than the average price last year. 
Ammonia sales volume was strong at 513,000 tons. Urea price realizations were about the same as the third quarter of 2009, but volume of 713,000 tons was much higher. UAN price realizations were 21% higher than the third quarter of 2009, with volume of 1.4 million tons.
DAP and MAP average price realizations for the third quarter were 43% higher year-over-year and volume was 3% higher. Gross margin of $170 million was up 37% from the year-earlier quarter. Gross margin for the Nitrogen segment was up $39 million from the third quarter of 2009, due to much higher volumes from the inclusion of Terra's results and higher average pricing, offset partially by higher natural gas costs, including the impact of mark-to-market adjustments.
Gross margin for DAP and MAP were up 34% year-over-year due to higher average prices. Steve indicated that our cash balance at the end of the quarter was about $650 million. We also held $122 million in auction rate securities, net debt, including the liability for customer advances, but excluding the auction rate securities was $1.9 billion.
Customer advances grew by more than $300 million during the third quarter, as we resumed forward-selling activity. We paid back $350 million of our bank term loan in the third quarter, which resulted in accelerated amortization of previously incurred loans fees, similar to what we saw in the second quarter. 
Also, there are two new tables in the of our press release that show how this accelerated amortization impacted interest expense and DD&A. Approximately $650 million of the original $1.2 billion term loan was outstanding at September 30.
We also mentioned in the press release that we're in a period of strong cash flow. We'll continue to use available cash flow to pay down our bank debt in the fourth quarter. Now let me turn it back to Steve.

I would like to discuss our outlook for the next couple of quarters. The fall fertilizer season is off to a great start. As anticipated, the early corn and soybean harvest is providing a long window for fall fieldwork, and farmers are taking advantage of it. The temperature drop we have experienced over the last two weeks allowed agricultural ammonia movement to get underway earlier than normal in the upper Midwest, and we're in the midst of a period of ideal conditions for ammonia applications.
Available supply is expected to remain very thin, although we may have some volume available in the late fall, if the current excellent weather pattern extends the application season. Foreign and wheat crop prospects have both improved over the last few months, with very tight balances suggesting that planting for each could expand by about 4 million acres next year. A tight domestic grain market and the Russian export ban are expected to crop futures and cash prices have historically high levels. With favorable prices, U.S. farmers will enter the 2011 planting season in an excellent financial position, which should encourage complete fertilizer application. 
Longer term, the EPA's announcement in mid-October that E15 blends are approved for model year 2007 cars and newer will provide additional support to corn planting. The EPA is expected to announce this decision with respect to model years 2001 through 2006, sometime this month.
For the 2011 fertilizer year in total, we increased expect increased planted acreage and higher nutrient application rates to lift nitrogen demand to over 13 million nutrient tons, the second highest on record. Urea prices strengthened recently. If reports that China's export tariff position will start at least two months earlier this year prove to be true, global urea supply will be reduced. UAN prices are also expected to be supported by low domestic inventory levels and international availability and should get further support from the increase in urea prices.
In addition to these favorable fertilizer market factors, the outlook for our Nitrogen segment is supported by low forward natural gas prices. 12-month natural gas strip averages about $4.10, and our future financial results also will benefit from prices below $4 in both October and November of 2010. At today's product price, $4 of natural gas supports the a very high margins.
Phosphate demand for fertilizer year 2011 is projected to increase 8% from 2010, which will return it to the 10-year average. Domestic shipments in the fourth quarter are projected to remain strong due to the robust acreage forecast and recovering application rates. Product availability across the U.S. supply chain remains tight, which may limit new export sales.
Indian import commitments continue to underpin international pricing, while favorable crop prices encourage spot prices in other major markets. Global supply is expected to be constrained by a tight domestic Chinese market and potential supply controls there, as well as continuing delay in the modern project start-up. So the outlook for our business is clearly very positive and should sustain strong profitability and cash flow in upcoming periods, assuming weather and other uncontrollable factors are favorable. 
When we embarked upon the Terra initiative in January 2009, we envisioned a stronger and larger but nimble North American fertilizer producer with a skilled team dedicated to serving customers in an effective and profitable fashion. It was just for this type of market that we sought the combination. I believe we're just beginning to realize the earnings potential of CF Industries.
With that, let's open the call to your questions. Regina, please explain the Q&A procedures.

What we do is we project out the full year earnings, and what happened in this particular case is that we increased our estimate of full year earnings. So when those extra earnings get built in to our calculation of a tax rate, they come in at a 35% rate. Now the previous rate was higher than 35%, so the 35% reduces the rate down. And then that reduced rate gets reflected in the third quarter. And so the full impact of the lower rate on the year-to-date earnings goes through the third quarter earnings. So if you want to get a feel for what our full-year rate estimate is, just look at our third quarter year-to-date results, and you'll see that, excluding noncontrolling interest from pretax income, it's about a 44% rate.

And Elaine, I'll be a little verbose here because this is part of the whole Terra acquisition story. In March of this year, when we stepped up to the plate with our increase in our offer price, it was based upon having done a lot of homework in terms of our financial profile and the amount of debt we'd be taking on. We did a base case analysis, and we did a stress test. And in the stress test, we looked out a prolonged downturn what that impact might be on our cash-generation ability, and so it backed into a capital expenditure number that we believed was appropriate, in light of the stress test case. So the $205 million or so that we have talked about was based upon the stress-test distress case. So now we're seven months into the combination, and there are two obvious factors that have changed the need for that kind of tight discipline. The first is that seven months of have passed, and we haven't been in the stress case. We have generated a lot of cash. And our outlook through the fourth quarter and into the spring is quite robust. And so, the need for that kind of very, very tight control over spending is not necessary. So what are we doing? Well, we're not opening the cash drawer and letting people come in and grab as much as they want at the plant level. We're going through the same disciplined analysis that we always do. So there's some projects that we suspended back in April that we felt was necessary to suspend in order to conserve capital, though some of those have been released for completion. And then some very good projects that we think will provide increased production and/or efficiency, and projects that support the DEF business it was going to be undertaking. So these aren't major projects but they are very attractive projects and very good for the business.

And to put it in perspective, in the first nine months of 2010, even though sales of DEF have moved up rapidly, it has only consumed the equivalent of 5,000 tons of granular urea. And if you look at our release for the third quarter, we shipped 713 tons of granular urea in the third quarter alone. And almost 2.2 million tons in the first nine months of this year. So the business is a fledgling business. We think it has great potential. And certainly, this business, in general, as it develops in North America and around the world, will help with urea demand.

We can do 13 million tons, roughly annually. We have the ability to shift somewhat between urea and UAN. We actually did that in the quarter, when urea gives us the best margins. We'll do as much urea as we can, and we're certainly willing to shift. I would remind you that if you're looking on a product-ton basis, you may want to actually convert that to equivalent nitrogen-ton basis. Ammonia is 82% nitrogen, urea is 46%, and UAN is 28% to 32% nitrogen. So what we're trying to do is maximize the margin per unit of nitrogen produced. That's our goal, and we have models that look at that. And I think we're nimble enough to be able to shift between urea and UAN. And also, frankly, when ammonia in particular is very attractive, we have the ability to bring them in from offshore and inject it into our system and enhance our margin by doing that.

For the third quarter of 2010, CF Industries reported net income of $48 million or $0.67 per diluted share, compared to earnings of about $39 million or $0.78 per share in the same period last year. 
Our results benefited from our very timely acquisition of Terra Industries. And certainly, we're looking forward to showing how the integrated company can perform when we have the full benefits of the increases in product prices that unfolded throughout the third quarter and have continued into the fourth quarter, as well as the reductions we've seen in natural gas costs.
Our operating earnings were up 52% year-over-year to $137 million. Operating-related cash flow was almost $600 million, which allowed us to repay $350 million of debt during the third quarter and still exit September with $650 million of cash on the balance sheet. 
We're in a great period for fertilizer manufacturers, especially for those located in North America. Industry conditions improved dramatically during the third quarter, driven by the interplay between significantly higher agricultural commodity prices and constrained availability of fertilizer. 
Higher crop prices were prompted first by an intense drought in the former Soviet Union, which led to Russian grain export controls and tightened world grain trade, especially for wheat. This was followed by significantly lower yield prospects for this year's U.S. corn crop, which pushed domestic crop prices to two-year highs. 
The dramatically higher crop prices, coupled with low fertilizer inventories worldwide, stimulated fertilizer product purchasing, which tightened fertilizer balances. At the same time, world production was limited by higher-than-expected plant outages. All of these factors combined to drive fertilizer prices higher during the quarter.
Domestic urea prices followed global markets upward. In the Midwest ammonia market factors specific to North America added upward pressure on pricing, including limited supply availability after the exceptional spring application season, strong demand for fall application and pipeline maintenance affecting the Western Corn Belt. 
The UAN market also tightened as nitrates were in high demand in Europe, reducing UAN production and available export supplies from the Black Sea region. U.S. Gulf UAN prices yielded lower net backs to European producers than were available to them in other markets, resulting in low U.S. imports and extremely low U.S. inventories.
Phosphate markets also strengthened considerably due to surging international demand. Higher crop prices stimulated purchasing to restock and to meet higher projected farm demand. Export commitments to India continued to underpin the market, and spot purchasing remained strong through the summer.
U.S. demand was particularly strong, which drove NOLA barge prices above Tampa export prices. This set the tone for the world market and even resulted in attracting some imports into the U.S. Additional market strength came from reports of delays at Saudi Arabia's Ma'aden project and challenges in raw material supply.
With this market backdrop, we found eager customers for all the product we offered for sale. Of course, with prices rising as much as they did throughout the quarter, we do wish we had more product available now than we do, but we're generally pleased with the way our book of business has evolved. 
Our third quarter prices were significantly lower than average spot prices published during the quarter. Significant differences are not unusual during periods of rapid price movement, whether that be up or down. In this case, there were a few noteworthy factors at work.
We had export shipments of phosphate, urea and UAN that had been priced in the second quarter. Industrial sales represented about half of ammonia sales in the quarter, a seasonally slow quarter for Ag sales of ammonia. And at the beginning of the quarter, customers had very little purchase volume booked. When they realized how tight the market was becoming, they began making commitments, in effect, chasing prices higher. So the full impact of the higher prices won't be felt until the current quarter and beyond.
Throughout the quarter we made excellent progress on our post-acquisition integration and related initiatives. We feel very good about where we are operationally. Our internal coordination within and across functional areas is becoming a strength and now will help us capitalize on more opportunities to optimize our production, transportation, distribution and sales. We continue to be on track to deliver more than $135 million in annual savings, the top end of our predicted synergy range with a run rate of about $100 million implemented by year end.
A good example of our improved coordination is the alignment of product managers and sales with their counterparts in logistics. This enables us to take the day-to-day actions that optimize our business for each major product, such as maximizing the value of our ammonia production, transportation and distribution system. We also have shifted more of our business to deliver pricing rather than FOB plant. This provides better visibility to regional market conditions.
Our primary interest in pursuing Terra was expanding our North American production of nitrogen fertilizer. With the integration of that business well in hand, we've been able to focus more attention on the other parts of Terra's portfolio, and familiarity is breeding enthusiasm. 
The GrowHow venture in the U.K. is performing well and is benefiting from the extremely strong nitrate market. The Trinidad ammonia plant has become a great partner for our phosphate operations in Florida. And the Diesel Exhaust Fluid business is proceeding the way that the Terra environmental technologies team had planned. 
We recently completed a thorough study of the DEF market and our position in it. This review validated the approach that the legacy Terra team had taken to this great opportunity and answered our questions that were prerequisites for making further commitments of capital to DEF.
Many of you are familiar with the UAN expansion at the Woodward facility, which will add 500,000 tons of annual UAN capacity this quarter. That project also includes modifications that will add 30 million gallons per year of DEF capacity. We expect to embark on projects at other facilities in the future. Our customers know they can count on us for reliable supply and for leadership in this growing market.
To sum up the business conditions in the third quarter, I don't think any of us could have foreseen how the market would unfold when the quarter began. It seems like a distant memory now, but nitrogen prices were somewhat depressed at the end of June, particularly for UAN. Our results in the quarter only begin to reflect the impact that very tight grain balances are having on fertilizer demand and prices and the impact of declining natural gas costs in North America.
Now I'd like to ask Rich Hoker to provide more detail on our financial performance in the third quarter. Rich is our Corporate Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. He has played a key role in maintaining coordination and business discipline in the Terra integration process, a role that has taken on added importance as we conduct our internal and external CFO search.

As Steve indicated earlier, CF Industries reported net earnings of $48 million or $0.67 per diluted share, compared to earnings of about $39 million or $0.78 per share in the same period last year. Third quarter earnings included an unrealized mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives of $26 million pretax, $23 million of business combination and integration costs and Perú project development costs of less than $1 million.
In the third quarter of 2010, net sales of $917 million included Nitrogen segment sales of $735 million and Phosphate segment sales of $182 million. Nitrogen volumes for the quarter were 3 million tons compared to 1.2 million tons in the year-ago quarter. Incidentally, on this call and in our filings, the word tons refers to short tons, unless otherwise noted.
Nitrogen sales were 166% higher than in the third quarter of 2009 due to the acquisition of Terra, stronger demand and higher average prices. Our average price realization for ammonia was $394 per ton, which was about $40 higher than the average price last year. 
Ammonia sales volume was strong at 513,000 tons. Urea price realizations were about the same as the third quarter of 2009, but volume of 713,000 tons was much higher. UAN price realizations were 21% higher than the third quarter of 2009, with volume of 1.4 million tons.
DAP and MAP average price realizations for the third quarter were 43% higher year-over-year and volume was 3% higher. Gross margin of $170 million was up 37% from the year-earlier quarter. Gross margin for the Nitrogen segment was up $39 million from the third quarter of 2009, due to much higher volumes from the inclusion of Terra's results and higher average pricing, offset partially by higher natural gas costs, including the impact of mark-to-market adjustments.
Gross margin for DAP and MAP were up 34% year-over-year due to higher average prices. Steve indicated that our cash balance at the end of the quarter was about $650 million. We also held $122 million in auction rate securities, net debt, including the liability for customer advances, but excluding the auction rate securities was $1.9 billion.
Customer advances grew by more than $300 million during the third quarter, as we resumed forward-selling activity. We paid back $350 million of our bank term loan in the third quarter, which resulted in accelerated amortization of previously incurred loan fees, similar to what we saw in the second quarter. 
Also, there are two new tables in the of back our press release that show how this accelerated amortization impacted interest expense and DD&A. Approximately $650 million of the original $1.2 billion term loan was outstanding at September 30.
We also mentioned in the press release that we're in a period of strong cash flow. We'll continue to use available cash flow to pay down our bank debt in the fourth quarter. Now let me turn it back to Steve."

I would like to discuss our outlook for the next couple of quarters. The fall fertilizer season is off to a great start. As anticipated, the early corn and soybean harvest is providing a long window for fall fieldwork, and farmers are taking advantage of it. The temperature drop we have experienced over the last two weeks allowed agricultural ammonia movement to get underway earlier than normal in the upper Midwest, and we're in the midst of a period of ideal conditions for ammonia applications.
Available supply is expected to remain very thin, although we may have some volume available in the late fall, if the current excellent weather pattern extends the application season. Foreign and wheat crop prospects both improved over the last few months, with very tight balances suggesting that planting for each could expand by about 4 million acres next year. A tight domestic grain market and the Russian export ban are expected to support crop futures and cash prices at historically high levels. With favorable prices, U.S. farmers will enter the 2011 planting season in an excellent financial position, which should encourage complete fertilizer application. 
Longer term, the EPA's announcement in mid-October that E15 blends are approved for model year 2007 cars and newer will provide additional support to corn planting. The EPA is expected to announce this decision with respect to model years 2001 through 2006, sometime this month.
For the 2011 fertilizer year in total, we expect increased planted acreage and higher nutrient application rates to lift nitrogen demand to over 13 million nutrient tons, the second highest on record. Urea prices have strengthened recently. If reports that China's high export tariff seasom will start at least two months earlier this year prove to be true, global urea supply will be reduced. UAN prices are also expected to be supported by low domestic inventory levels and international availability and should get further support from the increase in urea prices.
In addition to these favorable fertilizer market factors, the outlook for our Nitrogen segment is supported by low forward natural gas prices. 12-month natural gas strip averages about $4.10, and our future financial results also will benefit from prices below $4 in both October and November of 2010. At today's product price, $4 natural gas supports very high margins.
Phosphate demand for fertilizer year 2011 is projected to increase 8% from 2010, which will return it to the 10-year average. Domestic shipments in the fourth quarter are projected to remain strong due to the robust acreage forecast and recovering application rates. Product availability across the U.S. supply chain remains tight, which may limit new export sales.
Indian import commitments continue to underpin international pricing, while favorable crop prices encourage spot prices in other major markets. Global supply is expected to be constrained by a tight domestic Chinese market and potential supply controls there, as well as continuing delay in the Ma'aden project start-up. So the outlook for our business is clearly very positive and should sustain strong profitability and cash flow in upcoming periods, assuming weather and other uncontrollable factors are favorable. 
When we embarked upon the Terra initiative in January 2009, we envisioned a stronger and larger but nimble North American fertilizer producer with a skilled team dedicated to serving customers in an effective and profitable fashion. It was just for this type of market that we sought the combination. I believe we're just beginning to realize the earnings potential of CF Industries.
With that, let's open the call to your questions. Regina, please explain the Q&A procedures."

What we do is we project out the full year earnings, and what happened in this particular case is that we increased our estimate of full year earnings. So when those extra earnings get built in to our calculation of a tax rate, they come in at a 35% rate. Now the previous rate was higher than 35%, so the 35% reduces the rate down. And then that reduced rate gets reflected in the third quarter. And so the full impact of the lower rate on the year-to-date earnings goes through the third quarter earnings.

That doesn't have enough capacity today to meet the needs of our plant. And then the second need is to build a pipeline from the intersection point with the coast down to our plant site.

And Elaine, I'll be a little verbose here because this is part of the whole Terra acquisition story. In March of this year, when we stepped up to the plate with our increase in our offer price, it was based upon having done a lot of homework in terms of our financial profile and the amount of debt we'd be taking on. We did a base case analysis, and we did a stress test. And in the stress test, we looked at a prolonged downturn, what that impact might be on our cash-generation ability, and sort of backed into a capital expenditure number that we believed was appropriate, in light of the stress test case. So the $205 million or so that we have talked about was based upon the stress-test distress case. So now we're seven months into the combination, and there are two obvious factors that have changed the need for that kind of tight discipline. The first is that seven months have passed, and we haven't been in the stress case. We have generated a lot of cash. And our outlook through the fourth quarter and into the spring is quite robust. And so, the need for that kind of very, very tight control over spending is not necessary. So what are we doing? Well, we're not opening the cash drawer and letting people come in and grab as much as they want at the plant level. We're going through the same disciplined analysis that we always do. There are some projects that we suspended back in April that we felt was necessary to suspend in order to conserve capital, though some of those have been released for completion. And then some very good projects that we think will provide increased production and/or efficiency, and projects that support the DEF business we're going to be undertaking. So these aren't major projects but they are very attractive projects and very good for the business."

And to put it in perspective, in the first nine months of 2010, even though sales of DEF have moved up rapidly, it has only consumed the equivalent of 5,000 tons of granular urea. And if you look at our release for the third quarter, we shipped 713 tons of granular urea in the third quarter alone. And almost 2.2 million tons in the first nine months of this year.

For the third quarter of 2010, CF Industries reported net income of $48 million or $0.67 per diluted share, compared to earnings of about $39 million or $0.78 per share in the same period last year.
 Our results benefited from our very timely acquisition of Terra Industries. And certainly, we're looking forward to showing how the integrated company can perform when we have the full benefits of the increases in product prices that unfolded throughout the third quarter and have continued into the fourth quarter, as well as the reductions we've seen in natural gas costs.
 Our operating earnings were up 52% year-over-year to $137 million. Operating-related cash flow was almost $600 million, which allowed us to repay $350 million of debt during the third quarter and still exit September with $650 million of cash on the balance sheet.
 We're in a great period for fertilizer manufacturers, especially for those located in North America. Industry conditions improved dramatically during the third quarter, driven by the interplay between significantly higher agricultural commodity prices and constrained availability of fertilizer.
 Higher crop prices were prompted first by an intense drought in the former Soviet Union, which led to Russian grain export controls and tightened world grain trade, especially for wheat. This was followed by significantly lower yield prospects for this year's U.S. corn crop, which pushed domestic crop prices to two-year highs.
 The dramatically higher crop prices, coupled with low fertilizer inventories worldwide, stimulated fertilizer product purchasing, which tightened fertilizer balances. At the same time, world production was limited by higher-than-expected plant outages. All of these factors combined to drive fertilizer prices higher during the quarter.
 Domestic urea prices followed global markets upward. In the Midwest, ammonia market factors specific to North America added upward pressure on pricing, including limited supply availability after the exceptional spring application season, strong demand for fall application and pipeline maintenance affecting the Western Corn Belt.
 The UAN market also tightened as nitrates were on high demand in Europe, reducing UAN production and available export supplies from the Black Sea region. U.S. Gulf UAN prices yielded lower net backs to European producers that were available to them in other markets, resulting in low U.S. imports and extremely low U.S. inventories.
 Phosphate markets also strengthened considerably due to surging international demand. Higher crop prices stimulated purchasing to restock and to meet higher projected farm demand. Export commitments to India continued to underpin the market, and spot purchasing remained strong through the summer.
 U.S. demand was particularly strong, which drove NOLA barge prices above Tampa export prices. This set the tone for world market and even resulted in attracting some imports into the U.S. Additional market strength came from reports of delays of Saudi Arabia's modern project and challenges in raw material supply.
 With this market backdrop, we found eager customers for all the product we offered for sale. Of course, with the prices rising as much as they did throughout the quarter, we do wish we had more product available now than we do, but we're generally pleased with the way our book of business has evolved.
 Our third quarter prices were significantly lower than average spot prices published during the quarter. Significant differences are not unusual during periods of rapid price movements, whether that be up or down. In this case, there were a few noteworthy factors at work.
 We had export shipments of phosphate, urea and UAN that had been priced in the second quarter. Industrial sales represented about half of ammonia sales in the quarter, a seasonally slow quarter for Ag sales of ammonia. And at the beginning of the quarter, customers had very little purchase volume booked. When they realize how tight the market was becoming, they began making commitments, in effect, chasing pricing higher. So the full impact of higher prices won't be felt until the current quarter and beyond.
 Throughout the quarter, we have made excellent progress on our post-acquisition integration and related initiatives. We feel very good about where we are operationally. Our internal coordination within and across functional areas is becoming a strength and now will help us capitalize on more opportunities to optimize our production, transportation, distribution and sales. We continue to be on track to deliver more than $135 million in annual savings, the top end of our predicted synergy range with a run rate of about $100 million implemented by year end.
 A good example of our improved coordination is the alignment of product managers and sales with their counterparts in logistics. This enables us to take the day-to-day actions that optimize our business for each major product, such as maximizing the value of our ammonia production, transportation and distribution system. We also have shifted more of our business to deliver pricing rather than FOB plant. This provides better visibility to regional market conditions.
 Our primary interest in pursuing Terra was expanding our North American production of nitrogen fertilizer. With the integration of that business well in hand, we've been able to focus more attention on the other parts of Terra's portfolio, and familiarity is breeding enthusiasm.
 The GrowHow venture in the U.K. is performing well and is benefiting from extremely strong nitrate market. The Trinidad ammonia plant has become a great partner for our phosphate operations in Florida. And the Diesel Exhaust Fluid business is proceeding the way that the Terra environmental technologies team had planned.
 We recently completed a thorough study of the DEF market and our position in it. This review validated the approach that the legacy Terra team had taken to this great opportunity and answered our questions that were prerequisites for making further commitments of capital to DEF.
 Many of you are familiar with the UAN expansion at the Woodward facility, which will add 500,000 tons of annual UAN capacity this quarter. That project also includes modifications that will add 30 million gallons per year of DEF capacity. We expect to embark on projects at other facilities in the future. Our customers know they can count on us for reliable supply and for leadership in this growing market.
 To sum up the business conditions in the third quarter, I don't think any of us could have foreseen how the market would unfold when the quarter began. It seems like a distant memory now, but nitrogen prices were somewhat depressed at the end of June, particularly for UAN. Our results in the quarter only began to reflect the impact of very tight grain balances are having on fertilizer demand and prices and the impact of declining natural gas costs in North America.
 Now I'd like to ask Rich Hoker to provide more detail on our financial performance in the third quarter. Rich is our Corporate Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. He has played a key role in maintaining coordination and business discipline in the Terra integration process, a role that has taken on added importance as we conduct our internal and external CFO search. Rich?

As Steve indicated earlier, CF Industries reported net earnings of $48 million or $0.67 per diluted share, compared to earnings of about $39 million or $0.78 per share in the same period last year. Third quarter earnings included an unrealized mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives of $26 million pretax, $23 million of business combination and integration costs and Perú project development costs of less than $1 million.
 In the third quarter of 2010, net sales of $917 million included Nitrogen segment sales of $735 million and Phosphate segment sales of $182 million. Nitrogen volumes for the quarter were 3 million tons compared to 1.2 million tons in the year-ago quarter. Incidentally, on this call and in our filings, the word tons refer to short tons, unless otherwise noted.
 Nitrogen sales were 166% higher than in the third quarter of 2009 due to the acquisition of Terra, stronger demand and higher average prices. Our average price realization for ammonia was $394 per ton, which was about $40 higher than the average price last year.
 Ammonia sales volume was strong at 513,000 tons. Urea price realizations were about the same as the third quarter of 2009, but volume of 713,000 tons was much higher. UAN price realizations were 21% higher than the third quarter of 2009, with volume of 1.4 million tons.
 DAP and MAP average price realizations for the third quarter were 43% higher year-over-year and volume was 3% higher. Gross margin of $170 million was up 37% from the year-earlier quarter. Gross margin for the Nitrogen segment was up $39 million from the third quarter of 2009, due to much higher volumes from the inclusion of Terra's results and higher average pricing, offset partially by higher natural gas costs, including the impact of mark-to-market adjustments.
 Gross margin for DAP and MAP were up 34% year-over-year due to higher average prices. Steve indicated that our cash balance at the end of the quarter was about $650 million. We also held $122 million in auction rate securities, net debt, including the liability for customer advances, but excluding the auction rate securities was $1.9 billion.
 Customer advances grew by more than $300 million during the third quarter, as we resumed forward-selling activity. We paid back $350 million of our bank term loan in the third quarter, which resulted in accelerated amortization of previously incurred loans fees, similar to what we saw in the second quarter.
 Also, there are two new tables in the of our press release that show how this accelerated amortization impacted interest expense and DD&A. Approximately $650 million of the original $1.2 billion term loan was outstanding at September 30.
 We also mentioned in the press release that we're in a period of strong cash flow. We'll continue to use available cash flow to pay down our bank debt in the fourth quarter. Now let me turn it back to Steve.

I would like to discuss our outlook for the next couple of quarters. The fall fertilizer season is off to a great start. As anticipated, the early corn and soybean harvest is providing a long window for fall fieldwork, and farmers are taking advantage of it. The temperature drop we have experienced over the last two weeks allowed agricultural ammonia movement to get underway earlier than normal in the upper Midwest, and we're in the midst of a period of ideal conditions for ammonia applications.
 Available supply is expected to remain very thin, although we may have some volume available in the late fall, if the current excellent weather pattern extends the application season. Foreign and wheat crop prospects have both improved over the last few months, with very tight balances suggesting that planting for each could expand by about 4 million acres next year. A tight domestic grain market and the Russian export ban are expected to crop futures and cash prices have historically high levels. With favorable prices, U.S. farmers will enter the 2011 planting season in an excellent financial position, which should encourage complete fertilizer application.
 Longer term, the EPA's announcement in mid-October that E15 blends are approved for model year 2007 cars and newer will provide additional support to corn planting. The EPA is expected to announce this decision with respect to model years 2001 through 2006, sometime this month.
 For the 2011 fertilizer year in total, we increased expect increased planted acreage and higher nutrient application rates to lift nitrogen demand to over 13 million nutrient tons, the second highest on record. Urea prices strengthened recently. If reports that China's export tariff position will start at least two months earlier this year prove to be true, global urea supply will be reduced. UAN prices are also expected to be supported by low domestic inventory levels and international availability and should get further support from the increase in urea prices.
 In addition to these favorable fertilizer market factors, the outlook for our Nitrogen segment is supported by low forward natural gas prices. 12-month natural gas strip averages about $4.10, and our future financial results also will benefit from prices below $4 in both October and November of 2010. At today's product price, $4 of natural gas supports the a very high margins.
 Phosphate demand for fertilizer year 2011 is projected to increase 8% from 2010, which will return it to the 10-year average. Domestic shipments in the fourth quarter are projected to remain strong due to the robust acreage forecast and recovering application rates. Product availability across the U.S. supply chain remains tight, which may limit new export sales.
 Indian import commitments continue to underpin international pricing, while favorable crop prices encourage spot prices in other major markets. Global supply is expected to be constrained by a tight domestic Chinese market and potential supply controls there, as well as continuing delay in the modern project start-up. So the outlook for our business is clearly very positive and should sustain strong profitability and cash flow in upcoming periods, assuming weather and other uncontrollable factors are favorable.
 When we embarked upon the Terra initiative in January 2009, we envisioned a stronger and larger but nimble North American fertilizer producer with a skilled team dedicated to serving customers in an effective and profitable fashion. It was just for this type of market that we sought the combination. I believe we're just beginning to realize the earnings potential of CF Industries.
 With that, let's open the call to your questions. Regina, please explain the Q&A procedures.

What we do is we project out the full year earnings, and what happened in this particular case is that we increased our estimate of full year earnings. So when those extra earnings get built in to our calculation of a tax rate, they come in at a 35% rate. Now the previous rate was higher than 35%, so the 35% reduces the rate down. And then that reduced rate gets reflected in the third quarter. And so the full impact of the lower rate on the year-to-date earnings goes through the third quarter earnings. So if you want to get a feel for what our full-year rate estimate is, just look at our third quarter year-to-date results, and you'll see that, excluding noncontrolling interest from pretax income, it's about a 44% rate.

And those are proven to be very successful. We are on track to be at about $100 million per year run rate by the end of the year. We feel more confident about that, of course, than we did three months ago because we're closer to the end of the year.

We have a couple of very important infrastructure issues, two pipeline issues, that need to be resolved before we would be in a position to do our final analysis and come to a conclusion on it.

That doesn't have enough capacity today to meet the needs of our plant. And then the second need is to build a pipeline from the intersection point with the coast down to our plant site. That's about 120 kilometers of pipe. That project has not been started. And so, until those issues are resolved, we certainly wouldn't commit our stockholders' capital and wouldn't be able to find lenders that would finance it.

And Elaine, I'll be a little verbose here because this is part of the whole Terra acquisition story. In March of this year, when we stepped up to the plate with our increase in our offer price, it was based upon having done a lot of homework in terms of our financial profile and the amount of debt we'd be taking on. We did a base case analysis, and we did a stress test. And in the stress test, we looked out a prolonged downturn what that impact might be on our cash-generation ability, and so it backed into a capital expenditure number that we believed was appropriate, in light of the stress test case. So the $205 million or so that we have talked about was based upon the stress-test distress case. So now we're seven months into the combination, and there are two obvious factors that have changed the need for that kind of tight discipline. The first is that seven months of have passed, and we haven't been in the stress case. We have generated a lot of cash. And our outlook through the fourth quarter and into the spring is quite robust. And so, the need for that kind of very, very tight control over spending is not necessary. So what are we doing? Well, we're not opening the cash drawer and letting people come in and grab as much as they want at the plant level. We're going through the same disciplined analysis that we always do. So there's some projects that we suspended back in April that we felt was necessary to suspend in order to conserve capital, though some of those have been released for completion. And then some very good projects that we think will provide increased production and/or efficiency, and projects that support the DEF business it was going to be undertaking. So these aren't major projects but they are very attractive projects and very good for the business.

We'll do as much urea as we can, and we're certainly willing to shift. I would remind you that if you're looking on a product-ton basis, you may want to actually convert that to equivalent nitrogen-ton basis. Ammonia is 82% nitrogen, urea is 46%, and UAN is 28% to 32% nitrogen. So what we're trying to do is maximize the margin per unit of nitrogen produced. That's our goal, and we have models that look at that. And I think we're nimble enough to be able to shift between urea and UAN.

And I guess I'm just wondering, whether you believe that now is an opportune time to consider kind of a major refinance? In other words, you spent $350 million this quarter to pay down relatively low cost debt, whereas, we seem to be in an unusually favorable environment for corporations to raise capital. I mean, wouldn't there be a better bang for the buck by just trying to do a major refinance as opposed to paying down the term loan as cash flow becomes available?

We're looking to get our debt down to a level where the debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 1x to 1.5x. We just did our bond financing back in April. I think we did pretty well. If we were doing it today, will we do better? Yes, but I'm not sure if it would offset the expenses involved in doing it. Frankly, we have not looked at that when we have our next CFO in place. I'm sure that he'll spend a lot of time looking at our capital structure and, along with the rest of our Finance team, advise me and the Board on what we got to do.

But I wanted to ask you another question about maybe your international market intelligence. So one of the issues you raised when you struck the deal with KEYTRADE was that it did give you greater insight into goings-on in international markets. And right now, I was just hoping if you could share your latest thoughts or their latest thoughts on a couple of issues, including the likelihood and the magnitude of China's export tariff decision. And secondly, how delayed it does to you or KEYTRADE believes that the Madden [ph] project is?

They're inside of the markets and they do have a Beijing office. But I think I'd rather go back to the public statements and the industry publications. There's a lot of variations and what will and can happen in China, pulling it to January 12 to December 1 and as early as November 15. And some are expecting that announcement to come today or tomorrow. We're obviously following that, and we do follow that relative to our forward prices of urea, which will have a substantial impact in phosphates. And so, I do not want to speculate today on something that is pure speculation. So we'll say that we're watching that. And relative to the Madden [ph] project, again, there's been reports from other companies that reported their quarterly earnings, and we read the same publications also, they're projecting now that, that will be delayed into fourth quarter of 2011, possibly, even into early 2012. And that also we will watch very closely, as it relates to our phosphate exports.
