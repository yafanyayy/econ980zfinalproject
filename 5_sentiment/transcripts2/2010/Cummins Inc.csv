I want to start today by sharing some thoughts about our performance in 2009, which ended with the most profitable quarter in the company's history. And then give you a high-level look at our expectations for this year.  Pat",1693,"Thank you, Dean. Good morning. I want to start today by sharing some thoughts about our performance in 2009, which ended with the most profitable quarter in the company's history. And then give you a high-level look at our expectations for this year.  Pat Ward will then provide greater detail, on both our fourth quarter results and the 2010 outlook. And Tim Solso will share his thoughts about the company's long-term prospects. As I mentioned, we had an outstanding fourth quarter. All four business segments recorded stronger sales and higher EBIT percentages than in the third quarter, continuing our pattern of sequential quarterly profit improvement throughout 2009. Sales of $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter were 3.4% higher than the fourth quarter of 2008 and increased 34% from the third quarter.Earnings Before Interest and Taxes, before restructuring and other charges, were 11.4% of sales, our best quarterly performance since the peak of the previous economic cycle in the second quarter of 2008. As you will recall, we entered this recession in a very strong financial position and quickly established a plan to manage the business effectively through the downturn. In simple terms, our focus throughout the recessionary period has been to one, reduce cost; two, align manufacturing capacity with real demand; three, earn a solid profit and generate positive cash flow, despite dramatically reduced volumes; four, invest in projects and technologies critical to our growth; and fifth, continue to demonstrate to our customers that we care about their success more than anyone else. I think our results in 2009 speak to our success in managing all these priorities. And I'm proud of the work that Cummins' employees did to make this year a strong one, despite the challenges we faced.Our efforts to lower working capital resulted in a $442 million reduction in inventory in 2009, which contributed significantly to our improved cash position. We also strengthened our supply chain management system, which we expect to yield higher productivity and lower costs in 2010 and beyond. We used our ""rings of defense"" approach to lower costs across our manufacturing systems, quickly moving to reduce capacity and becoming more efficient in our manufacturing processes as volumes dropped. For example, we took advantage of the volume slowdown in the first half of 2009 to better synchronize flows at a number of our plants and distribution centers. That work paid dividends in the fourth quarter, providing significant leverage as volumes increased. While we are talking about our manufacturing operations, I want to take a moment to recognize all the people who work in Cummins' manufacturing plants or in our suppliers' plants around the world. 2009 was a challenging year for our plants and for our suppliers. It began by making deep cuts in our plants to stay in front of rapidly falling demand across most of our markets. Then within a few months of hitting bottom, demand at many of our locations returned to record or near record levels. By working together, we were able to minimize the impact of the steep volume drop early in the year, can take full advantage of the rapid increase late in the year. This was especially true in our U.S. engine and components plants, where we worked nearly non-stop to keep up with the temporary spike in demand during the fourth quarter in advance of the 2010 emissions standards change. For example, production in our Jamestown Engine Plant was at its highest level ever during the fourth quarter. Today, just a month later, volumes have dropped by 75%. We now have more than 400 workers on voluntary temporary leave for most of the first half of 2010. That kind of rapid change is exceedingly disruptive to the business and extremely hard in our people and our suppliers. But we've managed through it successfully in 2009. And we have plans in place to remain profitable in our Engine business in the first half of 2010, despite the very low volumes forecast for North America. Another positive story in 2009 was the value of our strong presence in key emerging markets. Tim will talk more about the impact we expect China, India and Brazil to have on our long-term growth. But these markets continue to play a major role in our current success. All three markets rebounded from the downturn more quickly and more strongly than mature markets, such as the U.S. and Western Europe. Domestic demand in China and India have already returned to pre-recession levels. And our India operations reported their best result ever in the fourth quarter. Our engine joint ventures in China recorded strong improvement in the fourth quarter, leading to an overall increase in JV earnings of 31% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, Cummins' products continue to perform well in 2009, as can be seen by share gains in many markets around the world. For example, we ended 2009 with 50% share of the North American Class A heavy-duty truck engine market, up from 45% at the end of 2008. Our share of the North American medium-duty truck engine market grew to 41% from 38% at the end of 2008. Our industry-leading market share in the Brazilian truck market grew from 33% to 36% in 2009. And our share of the medium and heavy-duty commercial vehicle engine market in India jumped from 33% at the end of 2008 to 47% today, due to greater penetration at Tata Motors and the improved success Tata's having in the market. Finally, we built on our reputation as a technical leader in 2009 by once again being among the first companies in our industry to have the full range of our products certified to the 2010 emissions standards. Our 2010 heavy-duty engines, which are in production today, will provide our customers with a 5% fuel economy improvement over our previous models, with no drop in performance or dependability. Medium-duty customers will see a corresponding 3% improvement in fuel economy. In order to achieve those fuel economy gains, while meeting significantly tougher emission standards, we launched our XPI fuel systems for heavy-duty engines and our Selective Catalytic Reduction Exhaust Aftertreatment System. Those products represent just part of our investment and the largest product launch year in Cummins' history. We also began production of a new light-duty engine in China in 2009, a new line of small commercial generator sets manufactured in India and a revolutionary new fuel filter for use in the Dodge Ram pickup truck. 2010 will be another significant year of new products for Cummins, including the launch of the 11.9-liter ISX engine in the U.S. and a second light-duty engine in China.We are very proud of our performance in 2009. But unfortunately, the downturn is not yet completely behind us. In fact, as you have heard us say before, we expect the first half of 2010 to be at least as challenging as the first six months of 2009. Was [ph] the result of a large run up in engine sales in North America late last year in advance of the emissions changeover, we expect a corresponding drop in engine demand in the first half of 2010. Based on our current orders and forecast for the first part of this year, North American truck and bus engine shipments could fall by as much as 80% in the first half of 2010 compared to the second half of 2009. This translates into a 50% drop in our externally reported revenue for heavy-duty truck and medium-duty truck and bus in the first half of 2010 compared to the second half of 2009. We do expect the North American truck and bus engine markets to improve in the second half of the year. We also expect to see improvement in other engine markets, including Light-Duty Automotive, construction, mining and in truck markets outside the U.S. But we estimate that this temporary drop in North America will result in engine segment revenues being flat for the year when compared to 2009. Our Components businesses, which are closely linked to our engine sales, also will be affected by the large drop in engine volumes in North America. However, higher content on the 2010 engines, improved cost and increased truck sales in emerging markets will more than offset this drop in North American demand and improved profitability in our Components segment. Strengthening economies in China, India and Latin America will offset continued weakness in the U.S. and Western Europe for our Power Generation business, where we are forecasting 2010 to be flat with 2009, in terms of both sales and EBIT. Our Distribution business is expected to continue performing well. Sales are forecast to grow by 20% on higher demand in emerging markets and the company's decision to acquire a greater ownership stake in a large North American distributor. The major area of focus for us this year will be to ensure that our new product introductions are as successful as possible. The early reviews for the 2010 engines and components have been very good. And we are devoting significant resources to assure the best quality launch for these new products. Despite the challenges we expect this year, our strong financial position will allow us to increase our capital investment in critical technologies and new growth opportunities for 2010 and beyond. Our current plans call for us to invest approximately 30% more capital in the business going into 2009. When taken together, we are forecasting 2010 to look a lot like 2009, in terms of sales and profits. Our initial guidance for this year is for sales of $11 billion and EBIT of 7% of sales, with the second half of the year expected to be better than the first half across all of our business segments. We have a lot of work ahead of us this year. But if we continue to manage the business conservatively and execute the strategies we have in place, I'm confident 2010 will be another year of solid financial performance for Cummins. I will now turn over to Pat who will give you more details about our 2009 performance and our plans for this year."
265253,78855781,47954,"Cummins Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2010",2010-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Cummins Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom said, 2009 was a significant challenge given the global economic recession that has impacted every part of our business. We came into 2009 with two financial goals: One, to deliver solid profits; and two,",1546,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom said, 2009 was a significant challenge given the global economic recession that has impacted every part of our business. We came into 2009 with two financial goals: One, to deliver solid profits; and two, to deliver a positive cash flow. And as you can see from the results we reported today, we delivered on our commitments and achieved both of these financial goals. Full-year revenues for the company were $10.8 billion, down 25% from the previous year. Despite this unprecedented drop in demand, EBIT before restructuring and other charges was $774 million or 7.2% of sales compared to $1.26 billion or 8.3% of sales for the previous year. And earnings per share, excluding the restructuring and other charges finished at $2.49. All four business segments were profitable in 2009, despite the severe drop in demand. The company also significantly improved its cash position in the year, which is essential to preserving our ability to pursue profitable growth opportunities in the future. I will talk more on this later.Now let me move on to the fourth quarter and share some more details in our performance. Revenues of $3.4 billion were 34% higher than the prior quarter and 3% higher in the fourth quarter of 2008. Sequentially, gross margins improved from 19.9% in the third quarter to 22.7% in the fourth quarter, as a result of stronger volumes, the benefit of cost reduction actions and lower material costs. We remain focused on managing selling, admin and research and development expenditure. Although it came down as a percent of sales in the quarter, we did see an increase in dollar terms, in part due to increased investment in research and development and the impact of higher compensation accruals.Joint Venture income increased to $67 million, an 18% improvement over the third quarter levels, from improved results in China and in India. EBIT margins before restructuring and other charges improved to 11.4% of sales, marking a fourth consecutive quarter of margin improvement. Earnings per share, excluding restructuring and other charges were $1.37 in the quarter. In our previous call, we guided that a full-year effective tax rate would be 27%. However, one-time tax benefits of $29 million or $0.15 per share more than offset upward pressure from stronger domestic earnings in the fourth quarter, resulting in an effective tax rate of 24.4% for 2009 and 22.5% for the fourth quarter.Turning to each of our four business segments, I would now like to briefly highlight the performance in the fourth quarter under 2010 revenue and profitability outlook. Engine segment revenues of $2.2 billion were 51% higher than the prior quarter, as a result of stronger demand in the emerging markets and from the transition engines in North America ahead of the 2010 emission deadline. This segment also benefited from increased demand for the Dodge Ram engine, higher aftermarket revenues and demand stabilization in industrial and in power generation markets. If you compare to the prior year, revenues were up 12%. Demand for transition engines, market share gains in the North American truck markets and the light-duty automotive production increase more than offset a significant drop in later-cycle engine sales for the industrial and power generation markets. Segment EBIT margins were 9.7% in the quarter compared to the 4.2% EBIT margin delivered in the third quarter. The Engine segment has clearly benefited from the cost-reduction initiatives taken early in the year, as well as from lower material costs. In 2010, we expect another challenging year for the segment. Our on-highway engine shipments were underperformed with drop in bus and recreational vehicle markets in North America due to the transition engine shipped in advance of EPA 10. We forecast production of  [indiscernible] heavy-duty trucks to grow 30% in 2010. However our heavy-duty truck engine revenues will be down 18%. Revenues from the medium-duty truck and bus markets are forecasted to be down 19% for the same reason, despite growth in the North American, Brazilian and European truck production. Revenues to the light-duty automotive and recreational vehicle market are projected to grow 23%, with higher engine shipments for the Ram pickup truck more than offsetting the negative effect of transition engines to the RV market. For the industrial markets, we forecast revenues to increase by 17% in 2010, mainly driven by stronger demand in the mining, oil and gas and construction markets. Higher commodity prices are stimulating OEM capital expenditures from new equipment in mining and oil and gas markets, while infrastructure stimulus programs in China, India and Brazil are supporting domestic OEMs and imports for the construction markets. For the total Engine segment, despite the lower volumes, we expect close to flat revenues in 2010 and EBIT margins in the range of 3% to 4% of sales.Now let me move on to the Components segment, which also had terrific financial performance in the quarter. Revenues were up 24% from prior quarter, driven by the demand for transition engines in North America, global aftermarket recovery and some sequential OEM improvement in China, India and Europe. EBIT margins improved to 10% of sales from the leverage of the higher volumes. Year-over-year, stronger demand in the on-highway markets in North America, China and India more than offset weakness in Europe and drove revenues up 8%. The Components segment EBIT margin benefited from the cost reduction initiatives taken earlier in the year, lower material cost and higher volumes. Despite the true [ph] forward of demand for transition engines in North America into 2009, we expect 2010 components revenues to increase 10% from higher price in technology content on the EPA 2010 products from higher truck production in emerging markets in Europe and from growth in aftermarket demand. We are forecasting EBIT margins for the segment between 6.5% and 7.5% of sales. In the Distribution segment, revenues were up 15% sequentially. EBIT margins were up from 13% in the prior quarter to 13.8% of sales, mainly from higher volumes and favorable currency benefits from a weaker U.S. dollar. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenues were down 13%, as the global slowdown largely impacted demand for new engines and power generation equipment. However, the favorable mix towards aftermarket and service revenues, an effect of cost-reduction initiatives, strengthened EBIT margins, strong Joint Venture income and favorable currency movements also contributed to this performance. In 2010, revenues for the distribution segment are expected to increase by 20%. Half of this growth will come from the consolidation of our Western Canada distributor, in which we increased our ownership from 50% to 80% at the beginning of the year. We are forecasting the segment EBIT margin in the range of 11% to 12% of sales as the consolidation will have a dilutive effect of approximately 1%. And finally, in the Power Generation segment, revenues were up 9% sequentially mainly driven by demand in emerging markets. Higher volumes and cost-reduction initiatives positively impacted EBIT, which improved from 4.2% in the third quarter to 5.7% of sales. Year-over-year, revenues were down 32% with most regions impacted. The lower volumes contributed to the drop in EBIT margins from last year's 8.5% of sales. In 2010, for Power Gen, we flat revenues and EBIT margins between 6.5% and 7.5% of sales. As demand dropped more significantly in the second half of 2009 for this business, we expect the end of channel destocking and continued recovery in the emerging markets to offset continued weakness in North America and Europe in 2010. As Tom just mentioned, we are projecting total Cummins revenues to be $11 billion in 2010, with EBIT margins of 7% of sales. Compared to 2009 results, the temporary impact in volumes of the 2010 emissions standards has a negative impact on EBIT of 1.3%. This is offset by EBIT improvements of 0.5% from stronger Joint Venture income, on the net 0.6% from the combination of placing and cost movements. As was the case in 2009, we expect EBIT to improve sequentially as we move through the year. We are currently projecting the effective tax rate for 2010 to increase to 32%, primarily as a result of the reserves tax credit not yet being extended. And finally, let me turn to the balance sheet and cash flow.Our cash balance improved by over $500 million, more than double the amount at the beginning of the year. We generated more than $1.1 billion in cash from operating activities for the full year, a record for the company. A last part of this was due to the reduction in inventory levels of over $400 million. Debt to capital was 14.9% at the end of the year. Our strong financial position gives us the flexibility to invest in future profitable growth opportunities. As you heard from Tom, we plan to increase capital investments in 2010 to $400 million, up almost 30% from 2009. As mentioned on our last call, we have lifted the temporary suspension of our stock repurchase program that we had in place during most of 2009 and will accelerate our repurchase plans in 2010. We also remain committed to sustainable increases in our dividend and will review this with our Board during the year. Now before we take your questions, Tim would like to say a few words."

And as Tom has already mentioned, we expect the first half of 2010 to be challen",1032,"As you have already heard this morning, we had an outstanding fourth quarter and a very strong 2009, given the difficult economic environment in which we continue to operate. And as Tom has already mentioned, we expect the first half of 2010 to be challenging, especially in the North American truck markets, which will put significant pressure on our Engine and Components businesses. Looking beyond 2010 however, I believe we are positioned for an extended period of significant growth. And a lot of my confidence in our future comes from the way, in which we have performed over the past year. We have talked to you in previous quarters about the impact our early and decisive response to the downturn had on our ability to remain profitable and generate cash during the worst of the recession last year. Those efforts put us in a position to emerge from the recession an even stronger company. We have taken a significant amount of cost out of our manufacturing system, which allows us to fully leverage demand increases, such as those we saw in our Engine and Components businesses in the fourth quarter of 2009. The fact that we are in a position to remain profitable in those businesses in the first half of this year, despite a huge expected downturn swing in volume from the end of last year, also shows just how flexible our manufacturing system has become. We also continue to make heavy use of Six Sigma to drive quality improvements and lower our costs across the company. Our Six Sigma savings in 2009 were nearly $500 million, well above our target. And all our business units exceeded their goals for the year. Also, our performance in large international markets, such as China, India and Brazil contributed significantly to our outstanding performance in the fourth quarter and will play an even larger role in our future success. In particular, the China and India economies have bounced back strongly from their brief downturn late in 2008 and early in 2009. While our business in those two countries fell in 2009 from record levels in 2008, our fourth quarter results were very strong. In fact, the fourth quarter was our best ever in India, where the total size of our business in 2009 was more than $1.3 billion. We expect our business in India to be close to 2008 levels by the end of 2010. And with the Indian economy projected to grow at a rate of 7% or 8% a year for the next several years, this region will be increasingly important to Cummins in the future. The story is similar in China, which was a $1.7 billion business for us in 2009. We expect consolidated and unconsolidated sales in China to grow to well over $2.3 billion this year. The long-term prospects for Cummins in China also are very good, with the Chinese economy expected to grow at 8% to 9% a year from the 2011 through the 2014. As in India, all our business segments are well represented in China.  We are also well-positioned to continue our growth in Brazil, where we are the clear market leader in the truck engine market. Prior to 2009, our business in Brazil had grown at 32% a year since 2003 and it reached $900 million in 2008. After a slight contraction in 2009, the Brazilian economy is expected to return to solid growth rates of 4% to 6% a year for the next several years, starting in 2010. In addition, large international events in Brazil, including the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016 will require significant investment in infrastructure, which plays to Cummins' strengths in that market. Our commitment to these large emerging markets has diversified our business and played a key role in allowing Cummins to remain profitable through the worst global downturn in decades. Given the expected long-term economic growth projected for these markets, the broad reach of our products and our technical advantage when it comes to meeting future emissions standards, China, India and Brazil will play an even larger role in our future success. We will share more details of our plans for sustained long-term growth at our analyst day in March. But I also want to talk a little today about our work to continue to invest in the business throughout the downturn and what it means for our future. Our strong balance sheet coming into the downturn and our performance during 2009 allowed us to generate the cash we needed to invest in the largest product launch in our history. As you heard Tom say, we have received EPA certification for our 2010 on-highway engines, which are in production now. More importantly for our future growth, we improved our cash position by more than $500 million, which will allow us to invest even more heavily in new products, technologies and capacity, going forward. As you heard Pat say, we will spend $400 million on capital expenditures this year. That money will go toward new products and significant investments and facilities to increase capacity and support for our current products. Finally, we will continue to invest in profitable growth opportunities made possible by our technical leadership, especially in the Components businesses, as well by favorable long-term growth trends. These include increased infrastructure spending in many parts of the world and the expected rise in demand for reliable power in emerging markets, such as the Middle East and Africa. As you have heard throughout our remarks this morning, 2009 was an outstanding year given the challenging economic environment. We generated a solid profit, significantly increased our cash position and reduced inventory by more than $400 million. Our performance in 2009, especially in the second half of the year, is an example of what you can expect from Cummins once the recovery takes hold around the world. Our strong position today will allow us to get through a very challenging first half of the year in 2010 and will be the foundation for what I think will be a period of tremendous growth for Cummins beginning next year. Thank you, and we'll be happy to take your questions."

And then emission solutions is -- I think you can think its revenue moving more in sync with what you might be modeling for the various truck OEMs in the market, because they are allowed under the EPA regulations to ship the exhaust systems up to 90 days after the engines. So they're not going to see the precipitous fall off like the Engine business will in the first quarter.

And as you know, Japan, North America and Europe are the ones that are moving to this next emission standards, but the emerging markets will still be lagging behind. There is a significant part of our demand, which will not be affected by Tier 4 Interim at all."

And we worked hard to meet it, as I talked about in my remarks, it was not easy at all. Frankly, we were at the end, stretched as about as thin as we could get, both in terms of our own capacity and our suppliers' capacity to make it. But again, I think what you saw was our plans ramping up very, very quickly as a result of terrific response by our plants and our suppliers that supply those plants. So we were ready, and were wanting to make sure we could capture demand as it came. And so I guess I feel good about how we reacted to that. But it was essentially flexibly adding resources in the plants, adding shifts, working overtime, the normal things you'd expect. Second point is that the EPA has already -- this is not the first time they've had a pre-buy or transition engines purchased. And so they've regularly utilized a rule they have to save people can you [ph] have reasonable transition. And I think that's basically what the rule the industry works to. The EPA went to work on a more specific rule, but it's not released to one. So there is nothing else in play today, except the reasonableness rule. And the way that we view that is that we think we get orders from customers. And as long as a customer gives us a legitimate order, we ship the legitimate order. And then our customers are really responsible for figuring out what they need to transition. And I guess the one thing to keep in mind on that is that it sounds straightforward, but they're transitioning many, many models of vehicles, not just one. So they've got to understand how to get each engine engineered into each model. And it frankly is a bit of a challenge to get all that done, and cut over. And so that's, I think, when a lot of more managing is that the transition, especially in an environment where truck demand has been very low and the engineering costs are high, that's a challenging environment for them. So that's what they're trying to manage through. And I'm sure, the EPA is trying to, if they can do that as well try to make sure people move ahead and get the new engines in, they're both very legitimate concerns."

I want to start today by sharing some thoughts about our performance in 2009, which ended with the most profitable quarter in the company's history. And then give you a high-level look at our expectations for this year.  Pat",1695,"Thank you, Dean. Good morning. I want to start today by sharing some thoughts about our performance in 2009, which ended with the most profitable quarter in the company's history. And then give you a high-level look at our expectations for this year.  Pat Ward will then provide greater detail, on both our fourth quarter results and the 2010 outlook. And Tim Solso will share his thoughts about the company's long-term prospects. As I mentioned, we had an outstanding fourth quarter. All four business segments recorded stronger sales and higher EBIT percentages than in the third quarter, continuing our pattern of sequential quarterly profit improvement throughout 2009. Sales of $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter were 3.4% higher than the fourth quarter of 2008 and increased 34% from the third quarter.Earnings Before Interest and Taxes, before restructuring and other charges, were 11.4% of sales, our best quarterly performance since the peak of the previous economic cycle in the second quarter of 2008. As you will recall, we entered this recession in a very strong financial position and quickly established a plan to manage the business effectively through the downturn. In simple terms, our focus throughout the recessionary period has been to one, reduce costs; two, align manufacturing capacity with real demand; three, earn a solid profit and generate positive cash flow, despite dramatically reduced volumes; four, invest in projects and technologies critical to our growth; and fifth, continue to demonstrate to our customers that we care about their success more than anyone else. I think our results in 2009 speak to our success in managing all these priorities. And I'm proud of the work that Cummins' employees did to make this year a strong one, despite the challenges we faced.Our efforts to lower working capital resulted in a $442 million reduction in inventory in 2009, which contributed significantly to our improved cash position. We also strengthened our supply chain management system, which we expect to yield higher productivity and lower costs in 2010 and beyond. We used our ""rings of defense"" approach to lower costs across our manufacturing system, quickly moving to reduce capacity and becoming more efficient in our manufacturing processes as volumes dropped. For example, we took advantage of the volume slowdown in the first half of 2009 to better synchronize flows at a number of our plants and distribution centers. That work paid dividends in the fourth quarter, providing significant leverage as volumes increased. While we are talking about our manufacturing operations, I want to take a moment to recognize all the people who work in Cummins' manufacturing plants or in our suppliers' plants around the world. 2009 was a challenging year for our plants and for our suppliers. We began by making deep cuts in our plants to stay in front of rapidly falling demand across most of our markets. Then within a few months of hitting bottom, demand at many of our locations returned to record or near record levels. By working together, we were able to minimize the impact of the steep volume drop early in the year, and take full advantage of the rapid increase late in the year. This was especially true in our U.S. engine and components plants, where we worked nearly nonstop to keep up with the temporary spike in demand during the fourth quarter in advance of the 2010 emissions standards change. For example, production in our Jamestown Engine Plant was at its highest level ever during the fourth quarter. Today, just a month later, volumes have dropped by 75%. And we now have more than 400 workers on voluntary temporary leave for most of the first half of 2010. That kind of rapid change is exceedingly disruptive to the business and extremely hard on our people and our suppliers. But we've managed through it successfully in 2009. And we have plans in place to remain profitable in our Engine business in the first half of 2010, despite the very low volumes forecast for North America. Another positive story in 2009 was the value of our strong presence in key emerging markets. Tim will talk more about the impact we expect China, India and Brazil to have on our long-term growth. But these markets continue to play a major role in our current success. All three markets rebounded from the downturn more quickly and more strongly than mature markets, such as the U.S. and Western Europe. Domestic demand in China and India have already returned to pre-recession levels. And our India operations reported their best result ever in the fourth quarter. Our engine joint ventures in China reported strong improvement in the fourth quarter, leading to an overall increase in JV earnings of 31% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, Cummins' products continued to perform well in 2009, as can be seen by share gains in many markets around the world. For example, we ended 2009 with 50% share of the North American Class A heavy-duty truck engine market, up from 45% at the end of 2008. Our share of the North American medium-duty truck engine market grew to 41% from 38% at the end of 2008. Our industry-leading market share in the Brazilian truck market grew from 33% to 36% in 2009. And our share of the medium and heavy-duty commercial vehicle engine markets in India jumped from 33% at the end of 2008 to 47% today, due to greater penetration at Tata Motors and the improved success Tata is having in the market. Finally, we built on our reputation as a technical leader in 2009 by once again being among the first companies in our industry to have the full range of our products certified to the 2010 emissions standards. Our 2010 heavy-duty engines, which are in production today, will provide our customers with a 5% fuel economy improvement over our previous models, with no drop in performance or dependability. Medium-duty customers will see a corresponding 3% improvement in fuel economy. In order to achieve those fuel economy gains, while meeting significantly tougher emission standards, we launched our XPI fuel systems for heavy-duty engines and our Selective Catalytic Reduction Exhaust Aftertreatment System. Those products represent just part of our investment and the largest product launch year in Cummins' history. We also began production of a new light-duty engine in China in 2009, a new line of small commercial generator sets manufactured in India and a revolutionary new fuel filter for use in the Dodge Ram pickup truck. 2010 will be another significant year of new products for Cummins, including the launch of the 11.9-liter ISX engine in the U.S. and a second light-duty engine in China.We are very proud of our performance in 2009. But unfortunately, the downturn is not yet completely behind us. In fact, as you have heard us say before, we expect the first half of 2010 to be at least as challenging as the first six months of 2009. And as a result of a large run up in engine sales in North America late last year in advance of the emissions changeover, we expect a corresponding drop in engine demand in the first half of 2010. Based on our current orders and forecast for the first part of this year, North American truck and bus engine shipments could fall by as much as 80% in the first half of 2010 compared to the second half of 2009. This translates into a 50% drop in our externally reported revenue for heavy-duty truck and medium-duty truck and bus in the first half of 2010 compared to the second half of 2009. We do expect the North American truck and bus engine markets to improve in the second half of the year. We also expect to see improvement in other engine markets, including Light-Duty Automotive, construction, mining and in truck markets outside the U.S. But we estimate that this temporary drop in North America will result in engine segment revenues being flat for the year when compared to 2009. Our Components businesses, which are closely linked to our engine sales, also will be affected by the large drop in engine volumes in North America. However, higher content on the 2010 engines, improved cost and increased truck sales in emerging markets will more than offset this drop in North American demand and improved profitability in our Components segment. Strengthening economies in China, India and Latin America will offset continued weakness in the U.S. and Western Europe for our Power Generation business, where we are forecasting 2010 to be flat with 2009, in terms of both sales and EBIT. Our Distribution business is expected to continue performing well. Sales are forecast to grow by 20% on higher demand in emerging markets and the company's decision to acquire a greater ownership stake in a large North American distributor. The major area of focus for us this year will be to ensure that our new product introductions are as successful as possible. The early reviews for the 2010 engines and components have been very good. And we are devoting significant resources to assure the best quality launch for these new products. Despite the challenges we expect this year, our strong financial position will allow us to increase our capital investment in critical technologies and new growth opportunities for 2010 and beyond. Our current plans call for us to invest approximately 30% more capital in the business going into 2009. When taken together, we are forecasting 2010 to look a lot like 2009, in terms of sales and profits. Our initial guidance for this year is for sales of $11 billion and EBIT of 7% of sales, with the second half of the year expected to be better than the first half across all of our business segments. We have a lot of work ahead of us this year. But if we continue to manage the business conservatively and execute the strategies we have in place, I'm confident 2010 will be another year of solid financial performance for Cummins. I will now turn over to Pat who will give you more details about our 2009 performance and our plans for this year."
265253,78855781,54951,"Cummins Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2010",2010-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Cummins Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom said, 2009 was a significant challenge given the global economic recession that has impacted every part of our business. We came into 2009 with two financial goals: One, to deliver solid profits; and two,",1549,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom said, 2009 was a significant challenge given the global economic recession that has impacted every part of our business. We came into 2009 with two financial goals: One, to deliver solid profits; and two, to deliver a positive cash flow. And as you can see from the results we reported today, we delivered on our commitments and achieved both of these financial goals. Full year revenues for the company were $10.8 billion, down 25% from the previous year. Despite this unprecedented drop in demand, EBIT before restructuring and other charges was $774 million or 7.2% of sales compared to $1.26 billion or 8.3% of sales for the previous year. And earnings per share, excluding the restructuring and other charges finished at $2.49. All four business segments were profitable in 2009, despite the severe drop in demand. The company also significantly improved its cash position in the year, which is essential to preserving our ability to pursue profitable growth opportunities in the future. I will talk more on this later.Now let me move onto the fourth quarter and share some more details on our performance. Revenues of $3.4 billion were 34% higher than the prior quarter and 3% higher than the fourth quarter of 2008. Sequentially, gross margins improved from 19.9% in the third quarter to 22.7% in the fourth quarter, as a result of stronger volumes, the benefit of cost reduction actions and lower material costs. We remain focused on managing selling, admin and research and development expenditure. Although it came down as a percent of sales in the quarter, we did see an increase in dollar terms, in part due to increased investment in research and development and the impact of higher compensation accruals.Joint venture income increased to $67 million, an 18% improvement over the third quarter levels, from improved results in China and in India. EBIT margins before restructuring and other charges improved to 11.4% of sales, marking a fourth consecutive quarter of margin improvement. Earnings per share, excluding restructuring and other charges were $1.37 in the quarter. In our previous call, we guided that our full year effective tax rate would be 27%. However, one-time tax benefits of $29 million or $0.15 per share more than offset upward pressure from stronger domestic earnings in the fourth quarter, resulting in an effective tax rate of 24.4% for 2009 and 22.5% for the fourth quarter.Turning to each of our four business segments, I would now like to briefly highlight the performance in the fourth quarter and our 2010 revenue and profitability outlook. Engine segment revenues of $2.2 billion were 51% higher than the prior quarter, as a result of stronger demand in the emerging markets and from the transition engines in North America ahead of the 2010 emission deadline. This segment also benefited from increased demand for the Dodge Ram engine, higher aftermarket revenues and demand stabilization in industrial and in power generation markets. If you compare to the prior year, revenues were up 12%. Demand for transition engines, market share gains in the North American truck markets and the light-duty automotive production increase more than offset a significant drop in later-cycle engine sales for the industrial and power generation markets. Segment EBIT margins were 9.7% in the quarter compared to the 4.2% EBIT margin delivered in the third quarter. The Engine segment has clearly benefited from the cost-reduction initiatives taken early in the year, as well as from lower material costs. In 2010, we expect another challenging year for the segment. Our on-highway engine shipments were underperformed with drop in bus and recreational vehicle markets in North America due to the transition engine shipped in advance of EPA 10. We forecast production of NAFTA Class 8 heavy-duty trucks to grow 30% in 2010. However our heavy-duty truck engine revenues will be down 18%. Revenues from the medium-duty truck and bus markets are forecasted to be down 19% for the same reason, despite growth in the North American, Brazilian and European truck production. Revenues to the light-duty automotive and recreational vehicle market are projected to grow 23%, with higher engine shipments for the Ram pickup truck more than offsetting the negative effect of transition engines to the RV market. For the industrial markets, we forecast revenues to increase by 17% in 2010, mainly driven by stronger demand in the mining, oil and gas and construction markets. Higher commodity prices are stimulating OEM capital expenditures from new equipment in mining and oil and gas markets, while infrastructure stimulus programs in China, India and Brazil are supporting domestic OEMs and imports for the construction markets. For the total Engine segment, despite the lower volumes, we expect close to flat revenues in 2010 and EBIT margins in the range of 3% to 4% of sales.Now let me move on to the Components segment, which also had terrific financial performance in the quarter. Revenues were up 24% from prior quarter, driven by the demand for transition engines in North America, global aftermarket recovery and some sequential OEM improvement in China, India and Europe. EBIT margins improved to 10% of sales from the leverage of the higher volumes. Year-over-year, stronger demand in the on-highway markets in North America, China and India more than offset weakness in Europe and drove revenues up 8%. The Components segment EBIT margin benefited from the cost reduction initiatives taken earlier in the year, lower material costs and higher volumes. Despite the pull forward of demand for transition engines in North America into 2009, we expect 2010 components revenues to increase 10% from higher price in technology content on the EPA 2010 products from higher truck production in emerging markets in Europe and from growth in aftermarket demand. We are forecasting EBIT margins for the segment between 6.5% and 7.5% of sales. In the Distribution segment, revenues were up 15% sequentially. EBIT margins were up from 13% in the prior quarter to 13.8% of sales, mainly from higher volumes and favorable currency benefits from a weaker U.S. dollar. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenues were down 13%, as the global slowdown largely impacted demand for new engines and power generation equipment. However, the favorable mix towards aftermarket and service revenues, an effect of cost-reduction initiatives, strengthened EBIT margins, strong Joint Venture income and favorable currency movements also contributed to this performance. In 2010, revenues for the distribution segment are expected to increase by 20%. Half of this growth will come from the consolidation of our Western Canada distributor, in which we increased our ownership from 50% to 80% at the beginning of the year. We are forecasting the segment EBIT margin in the range of 11% to 12% of sales as the consolidation will have a dilutive effect of approximately 1%. And finally, in the Power Generation segment, revenues were up 9% sequentially mainly driven by demand in emerging markets. Higher volumes and cost-reduction initiatives positively impacted EBIT, which improved from 4.2% in the third quarter to 5.7% of sales. Year-over-year, revenues were down 32% with most regions impacted. The lower volumes contributed to the drop in EBIT margins from last year's 8.5% of sales. In 2010, for Power Gen, we flat revenues and EBIT margins between 6.5% and 7.5% of sales. As demand dropped more significantly in the second half of 2009 for this business, we expect the end of channel destocking and continued recovery in the emerging markets to offset continued weakness in North America and Europe in 2010. As Tom just mentioned, we are projecting total Cummins revenues to be $11 billion in 2010, with EBIT margins of 7% of sales. Compared to 2009 results, the temporary impact in volumes of the 2010 emissions standards has a negative impact on EBIT of 1.3%. This is offset by EBIT improvements of 0.5% from stronger Joint Venture income, on the net 0.6% from the combination of placing and cost movements. As was the case in 2009, we expect EBIT to improve sequentially as we move through the year. We are currently projecting the effective tax rate for 2010 to increase to 32%, primarily as a result of the reserves tax credit not yet being extended. And finally, let me turn to the balance sheet and cash flow.Our cash balance improved by over $500 million, more than double the amount at the beginning of the year. We generated more than $1.1 billion in cash from operating activities for the full year, a record for the company. A last part of this was due to the reduction in inventory levels of over $400 million. Debt to capital was 14.9% at the end of the year. Our strong financial position gives us the flexibility to invest in future profitable growth opportunities. As you heard from Tom, we plan to increase capital investments in 2010 to $400 million, up almost 30% from 2009. As mentioned on our last call, we have lifted the temporary suspension of our stock repurchase program that we had in place during most of 2009 and will accelerate our repurchase plans in 2010. We also remain committed to sustainable increases in our dividend and will review this with our Board during the year. Now before we take your questions, Tim would like to say a few words."

And as Tom has already mentioned, we expect the first half of 2010 to be challen",1032,"As you have already heard this morning, we had an outstanding fourth quarter and a very strong 2009, given the difficult economic environment in which we continue to operate. And as Tom has already mentioned, we expect the first half of 2010 to be challenging, especially in the North American truck markets, which will put significant pressure on our Engine and Components businesses. Looking beyond 2010 however, I believe we are positioned for an extended period of significant growth. And a lot of my confidence in our future comes from the way, in which we have performed over the past year. We have talked to you in previous quarters about the impact our early and decisive response to the downturn had on our ability to remain profitable and generate cash during the worst of the recession last year. Those efforts put us in a position to emerge from the recession an even stronger company. We have taken a significant amount of cost out of our manufacturing system, which allows us to fully leverage demand increases, such as those we saw in our Engine and Components businesses in the fourth quarter of 2009. The fact that we are in a position to remain profitable in those businesses in the first half of this year, despite a huge expected downturn swing in volume from the end of last year, also shows just how flexible our manufacturing system has become. We also continue to make heavy use of Six Sigma to drive quality improvements and lower our costs across the company. Our Six Sigma savings in 2009 were nearly $500 million, well above our target. And all our business units exceeded their goals for the year. Also, our performance in large international markets, such as China, India and Brazil contributed significantly to our outstanding performance in the fourth quarter and will play an even larger role in our future success. In particular, the China and India economies have bounced back strongly from their brief downturn late in 2008 and early in 2009. While our business in those two countries fell in 2009 from record levels in 2008, our fourth quarter results were very strong. In fact, the fourth quarter was our best ever in India, where the total size of our business in 2009 was more than $1.3 billion. We expect our business in India to be close to 2008 levels by the end of 2010. And with the Indian economy projected to grow at a rate of 7% or 8% a year for the next several years, this region will be increasingly important to Cummins in the future. The story is similar in China, which was a $1.7 billion business for us in 2009. We expect consolidated and unconsolidated sales in China to grow to well over $2.3 billion this year. The long-term prospects for Cummins in China also are very good, with the Chinese economy expected to grow at 8% to 9% a year from the 2011 through the 2014. As in India, all our business segments are well represented in China.  We are also well-positioned to continue our growth in Brazil, where we are the clear market leader in the truck engine market. Prior to 2009, our business in Brazil had grown at 32% a year since 2003 and it reached $900 million in 2008. After a slight contraction in 2009, the Brazilian economy is expected to return to solid growth rates of 4% to 6% a year for the next several years, starting in 2010. In addition, large international events in Brazil, including the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016 will require significant investment in infrastructure, which plays to Cummins' strengths in that market. Our commitment to these large emerging markets has diversified our business and played a key role in allowing Cummins to remain profitable through the worst global downturn in decades. Given the expected long-term economic growth projected for these markets, the broad reach of our products and our technical advantage when it comes to meeting future emissions standards, China, India and Brazil will play an even larger role in our future success. We will share more details of our plans for sustained long-term growth at our analyst day in March. But I also want to talk a little today about our work to continue to invest in the business throughout the downturn and what it means for our future. Our strong balance sheet coming into the downturn and our performance during 2009 allowed us to generate the cash we needed to invest in the largest product launch in our history. As you heard Tom say, we have received EPA certification for our 2010 on-highway engines, which are in production now. More importantly for our future growth, we improved our cash position by more than $500 million, which will allow us to invest even more heavily in new products, technologies and capacity, going forward. As you heard Pat say, we will spend $400 million on capital expenditures this year. That money will go toward new products and significant investments and facilities to increase capacity and support for our current products. Finally, we will continue to invest in profitable growth opportunities made possible by our technical leadership, especially in the Components businesses, as well by favorable long-term growth trends. These include increased infrastructure spending in many parts of the world and the expected rise in demand for reliable power in emerging markets, such as the Middle East and Africa. As you have heard throughout our remarks this morning, 2009 was an outstanding year given the challenging economic environment. We generated a solid profit, significantly increased our cash position and reduced inventory by more than $400 million. Our performance in 2009, especially in the second half of the year, is an example of what you can expect from Cummins once the recovery takes hold around the world. Our strong position today will allow us to get through a very challenging first half of the year in 2010 and will be the foundation for what I think will be a period of tremendous growth for Cummins beginning next year. Thank you, and we'll be happy to take your questions."

I will say that the signs we're seeing on the order boards and that orders have bottomed out. We'll see what that means in terms of actual sales next year.

The way we're thinking of market share is, I think we've said before, our view is that our goal in the business is to serve our customers effectively and earn a good return on capital. So market share is not something we see as an objective. We're pretty pleased with where we are, and it helps, of course, achieve those objectives. But it's not our end goal. And frankly, it's pretty difficult to predict at this stage. We think we're in a great position with leading OEMs in the business. We've increased our share significantly at PACCAR, which is an excellent company, they're leading in the market today. And we expect them to continue their strength, and that will help us a lot. We're also growing our position in Freightliner, we've come into their heavy duty trucks, we're nearly exclusive on medium-duty trucks. And we have a strong position still with Volvo. And we expect to leverage those positions, and frankly, the strength of our engine offering in their strong trucks to gain share. So the share picture is not only a function of where we're released, but a function of how those trucks and engines do in the marketplace. And we feel really good about where we are with those trucks and engines. So I guess best thing to do is just see what happens, but we're feeling really good about where we are."

I think when we're looking at components in 2010, going from 4% for the full year of '09 to guidance of between 6.5% and 7.5% of sales for 2010, there's three or four different factors that's driving that. I think if you look at, they're all pretty much even, the way look at it. So the way things that you apply things should all much be the same. The impact of the increased content and the pricing that we can get for that is clearly one of those factors. Likewise, there will be additional volume, and we expect to see again one-fifth of the improvement come from additional volume. Pricing on existing products will increase by pretty much the same factor. And then between cost reduction and material cost, we also expect those to contribute each of them a fifth of the improvement year-over-year. So if we're going to go from four to, say, the midpoint of our guidance of seven, you can look at those five factors and apply an equal weighting to each of the five of them to figure out how we get there."

And it's partly because of the different mix that each of the four businesses within Components has to the EPA 10 emission standards.

Turbochargers, at least, has exposure to a lot of the emerging markets, where we've talked about earlier, where we do see strength in the truck markets in China and in India and in Brazil. And that will help their side of the business there, but the U.S. side of their business will feel a similar fall off in demand, much like the Medium-duty Truck and Heavy-duty Truck businesses will feel. And then emission solutions is -- I think you can think its revenue moving more in sync with what you might be modeling for the various truck OEMs in the market, because they are allowed under the EPA regulations to ship the exhaust systems up to 90 days after the engines. So they're not going to see the precipitous fall off like the Engine business will in the first quarter.

And we worked hard to meet it, as I talked about in my remarks, it was not easy at all. Frankly, we were at the end, stretched as about as thin as we could get, both in terms of our own capacity and our suppliers' capacity to make it. But again, I think what you saw was our plans ramping up very, very quickly as a result of terrific response by our plants and our suppliers that supply those plants. So we were ready, and were wanting to make sure we could capture demand as it came. And so I guess I feel good about how we reacted to that. But it was essentially flexibly adding resources in the plants, adding shifts, working overtime, the normal things you'd expect. Second point is that the EPA has already -- this is not the first time they've had a pre-buy or transition engines purchased. And so they've regularly utilized a rule they have to save people can you [ph] have reasonable transition. And I think that's basically what the rule the industry works to. The EPA went to work on a more specific rule, but it's not released to one. So there is nothing else in play today, except the reasonableness rule. And the way that we view that is that we think we get orders from customers. And as long as a customer gives us a legitimate order, we ship the legitimate order. And then our customers are really responsible for figuring out what they need to transition. And I guess the one thing to keep in mind on that is that it sounds straightforward, but they're transitioning many, many models of vehicles, not just one. So they've got to understand how to get each engine engineered into each model. And it frankly is a bit of a challenge to get all that done, and cut over. And so that's, I think, when a lot of more managing is that the transition, especially in an environment where truck demand has been very low and the engineering costs are high, that's a challenging environment for them. So that's what they're trying to manage through. And I'm sure, the EPA is trying to, if they can do that as well try to make sure people move ahead and get the new engines in, they're both very legitimate concerns."

I want to start today by sharing some thoughts about our performance in 2009, which ended with the most profitable quarter in the company's history. And then give you a high level look at our expectations for this year.  Pat",1693,"Thank you, Dean. Good morning. I want to start today by sharing some thoughts about our performance in 2009, which ended with the most profitable quarter in the company's history. And then give you a high level look at our expectations for this year.  Pat Ward will then provide greater detail, on both our fourth quarter results and the 2010 outlook. And Tim Solso will share his thoughts about the company's long-term prospects. As I mentioned, we had an outstanding fourth quarter. All four business segments recorded stronger sales and higher EBIT percentages than in the third quarter, continuing our pattern of sequential quarterly profit improvement throughout 2009. Sales of $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter were 3.4% higher than the fourth quarter of 2008 and increased 34% from the third quarter.Earnings Before Interest and Taxes, before restructuring and other charges, were 11.4% of sales, our best quarterly performance since the peak of the previous economic cycle in the second quarter of 2008. As you will recall, we entered this recession in a very strong financial position and quickly established a plan to manage the business effectively through the downturn. In simple terms, our focus throughout the recessionary period has been to one, reduce cost; two, align manufacturing capacity with real demand; three, earn a solid profit and generate positive cash flow despite dramatically reduced volumes; four, invest in projects and technologies critical to our growth; and fifth, continue to demonstrate to our customers that we care about their success more than anyone else. I think our results in 2009 speak to our success in managing all these priorities. And I'm proud of the work that Cummins' employees did to make this year a strong one, despite the challenges we faced.Our efforts to lower working capital resulted in a $442 million reduction in inventory in 2009, which contributed significantly to our improved cash position. We also strengthened our supply chain management system, which we expect to yield higher productivity and lower costs in 2010 and beyond. We used our ""rings of defense"" approach to lower costs across our manufacturing systems, quickly moving to reduce capacity and becoming more efficient in our manufacturing processes as volumes dropped. For example, we took advantage of the volume slowdown in the first half of 2009 to better synchronize flows at a number of our plants and distribution centers. That work paid dividends in the fourth quarter, providing significant leverage as volumes increased. While we are talking about our manufacturing operations, I want to take a moment to recognize all the people who work in Cummins' manufacturing plants or in our suppliers' plants around the world. 2009 was a challenging year for our plants and for our suppliers. We began by making deep cuts in our plants to stay in front of rapidly falling demand across most of our markets. Then within a few months of hitting bottom, demand at many of our locations returned to record or near record levels. By working together, we were able to minimize the impact of the steep volume drop early in the year to take full advantage of the rapid increase late in the year. This was especially true in our U.S. engine and components plants, where we worked nearly non-stop to keep up with the temporary spike in demand during the fourth quarter in advance of the 2010 emissions standards change. For example, production in our Jamestown Engine Plant was at its highest level ever during the fourth quarter. Today, just a month later, volumes have dropped by 75%. We now have more than 400 workers on voluntary temporary leave for most of the first half of 2010. That kind of rapid change is exceedingly disruptive to the business and extremely hard on our people and our suppliers. But we've managed through it successfully in 2009. And we have plans in place to remain profitable in our Engine business in the first half of 2010, despite the very low volumes forecast for North America. Another positive story in 2009 was the value of our strong presence in key emerging markets. Tim will talk more about the impact we expect China, India and Brazil to have on our long-term growth. But these markets continue to play a major role in our current success. All three markets rebounded from the downturn more quickly and more strongly than mature markets, such as the U.S. and Western Europe. Domestic demand in China and India have already returned to pre-recession levels. And our India operations reported their best result ever in the fourth quarter. Our engine joint ventures in China recorded strong improvement in the fourth quarter, leading to an overall increase in JV earnings of 31% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, Cummins' products continue to perform well in 2009, as can be seen by share gains in many markets around the world. For example, we ended 2009 with 50% share of the North American Class A heavy-duty truck engine market, up from 45% at the end of 2008. Our share of the North American medium-duty truck engine market grew to 41% from 38% at the end of 2008. Our industry-leading market share in the Brazilian truck market grew from 33% to 36% in 2009. And our share of the medium and heavy-duty commercial vehicle engine market in India jumped from 33% at the end of 2008 to 47% today, due to greater penetration at Tata Motors and the improved success Tata's having in the market. Finally, we built on our reputation as a technical leader in 2009 by once again being among the first companies in our industry to have the full range of our products certified to the 2010 emissions standards. Our 2010 heavy-duty engines, which are in production today, will provide our customers with a 5% fuel economy improvement over our previous models, with no drop in performance or dependability. Medium-duty customers will see a corresponding 3% improvement in fuel economy. In order to achieve those fuel economy gains, while meeting significantly tougher emission standards, we launched our XPI fuel systems for heavy-duty engines and our Selective Catalytic Reduction Exhaust Aftertreatment System. Those products represent just part of our investment and the largest product launch year in Cummins' history. We also began production of a new light-duty engine in China in 2009, a new line of small commercial generator sets manufactured in India and a revolutionary new fuel filter for use in the Dodge Ram pickup truck. 2010 will be another significant year of new products for Cummins, including the launch of the 11.9-liter ISX engine in the U.S. and a second light-duty engine in China.We are very proud of our performance in 2009. But unfortunately, the downturn is not yet completely behind us. In fact, as you have heard us say before, we expect the first half of 2010 to be at least as challenging as the first six months of 2009. As a result of a large run up in engine sales in North America late last year in advance of the emissions changeover, we expect a corresponding drop in engine demand in the first half of 2010. Based on our current orders and forecast for the first part of this year, North American truck and bus engine shipments could fall by as much as 80% in the first half of 2010 compared to the second half of 2009. This translates into a 50% drop in our externally reported revenue for heavy-duty truck and medium-duty truck and bus in the first half of 2010 compared to the second half of 2009. We do expect the North American truck and bus engine markets to improve in the second half of the year. We also expect to see improvement in other engine markets, including Light-Duty Automotive, construction, mining and in truck markets outside the U.S. But we estimate that this temporary drop in North America will result in engine segment revenues being flat for the year when compared to 2009. Our Components businesses, which are closely linked to our engine sales, also will be affected by the large drop in engine volumes in North America. However, higher content on the 2010 engines, improved cost and increased truck sales in emerging markets will more than offset this drop in North American demand and improved profitability in our Components segment. Strengthening economies in China, India and Latin America will offset continued weakness in the U.S. and Western Europe for our Power Generation business, where we are forecasting 2010 to be flat with 2009, in terms of both sales and EBIT. Our Distribution business is expected to continue performing well. Sales are forecast to grow by 20% on higher demand in emerging markets and the company's decision to acquire a greater ownership stake in a large North American distributor. The major area of focus for us this year will be to ensure that our new product introductions are as successful as possible. The early reviews for the 2010 engines and components have been very good. And we are devoting significant resources to assure the best quality launch for these new products. Despite the challenges we expect this year, our strong financial position will allow us to increase our capital investment in critical technologies and new growth opportunities for 2010 and beyond. Our current plans call for us to invest approximately 30% more capital in the business going into 2009. When taken together, we are forecasting 2010 to look a lot like 2009, in terms of sales and profits. Our initial guidance for this year is for sales of $11 billion and EBIT of 7% of sales, with the second half of the year expected to be better than the first half across all of our business segments. We have a lot of work ahead of us this year, but if we continue to manage the business conservatively and execute the strategies we have in place, I'm confident 2010 will be another year of solid financial performance for Cummins. I will now turn over to Pat who will give you more details about our 2009 performance and our plans for this year."

We came into 2009 with two financial goals: One, to deliver solid profits; and two,",1548,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom said, 2009 was a significant challenge given the global economic recession that has impacted every part of our business. We came into 2009 with two financial goals: One, to deliver solid profits; and two, to deliver a positive cash flow. And as you can see from the results we reported today, we delivered on our commitments and achieved both of these financial goals. Full-year revenues for the company were $10.8 billion, down 25% from the previous year. Despite this unprecedented drop in demand, EBIT before restructuring and other charges was $774 million or 7.2% of sales compared to $1.26 billion or 8.3% of sales for the previous year. And earnings per share, excluding the restructuring and other charges finished at $2.49. All four business segments were profitable in 2009, despite the severe drop in demand. The company also significantly improved its cash position in the year, which is essential to preserving our ability to pursue profitable growth opportunities in the future. I will talk more on this later.Now let me move on to the fourth quarter and share some more details on our performance. Revenues of $3.4 billion were 34% higher than the prior quarter and 3% higher in the fourth quarter of 2008. Sequentially, gross margins improved from 19.9% in the third quarter to 22.7% in the fourth quarter as a result of stronger volumes, the benefit of cost reduction actions and lower material costs. We remain focused on managing selling, admin and research and development expenditure. Although it came down as a percent of sales in the quarter, we did see an increase in dollar terms, in part due to increased investment in research and development and the impact of higher compensation accruals.Joint Venture income increased to $67 million, an 18% improvement over the third quarter levels, from improved results in China and in India. EBIT margins before restructuring and other charges improved to 11.4% of sales, marking a fourth consecutive quarter of margin improvement. Earnings per share, excluding restructuring and other charges were $1.37 in the quarter. In our previous call, we guided that a full-year effective tax rate would be 27%. However, one-time tax benefits of $29 million or $0.15 per share more than offset upward pressure from stronger domestic earnings in the fourth quarter, resulting in an effective tax rate of 24.4% for 2009 and 22.5% for the fourth quarter.Turning to each of our four business segments, I would now like to briefly highlight the performance in the fourth quarter under 2010 revenue and profitability outlook. Engine segment revenues of $2.2 billion were 51% higher than the prior quarter, as a result of stronger demand in the emerging markets and from the transition engines in North America ahead of the 2010 emission deadline. This segment also benefited from increased demand for the Dodge Ram engine, higher aftermarket revenues and demand stabilization in industrial and in power generation markets. If you compare to the prior year, revenues were up 12%. Demand for transition engines, market share gains in the North American truck markets and the light-duty automotive production increase more than offset a significant drop in later-cycle engine sales for the industrial and power generation markets. Segment EBIT margins were 9.7% in the quarter compared to the 4.2% EBIT margin delivered in the third quarter. The Engine segment has clearly benefited from the cost-reduction initiatives taken early in the year, as well as from lower material costs. In 2010, we expect another challenging year for the segment. Our on-highway engine shipments were underperformed with drop in bus and recreational vehicle markets in North America due to the transition engine shipped in advance of EPA 10. We forecast production of Navistar[ph] Class 8 heavy-duty trucks to grow 30% in 2010. However our heavy-duty truck engine revenues will be down 18%. Revenues from the medium-duty truck and bus markets are forecasted to be down 19% for the same reason, despite growth in the North American, Brazilian and European truck production. Revenues to the light-duty automotive and recreational vehicle market are projected to grow 23%, with higher engine shipments for the Ram pickup truck more than offsetting the negative effect of transition engines to the RV market. For the industrial markets, we forecast revenues to increase by 17% in 2010, mainly driven by stronger demand in the mining, oil and gas and construction markets. Higher commodity prices are stimulating OEM capital expenditures from new equipment in mining and oil and gas markets, while infrastructure stimulus programs in China, India and Brazil are supporting domestic OEMs and imports for the construction markets. For the total Engine segment, despite the lower volumes, we expect close to flat revenues in 2010 and EBIT margins in the range of 3% to 4% of sales.Now let me move on to the Components segment, which also had terrific financial performance in the quarter. Revenues were up 24% from prior quarter, driven by the demand for transition engines in North America, global aftermarket recovery and some sequential OEM improvement in China, India and Europe. EBIT margins improved to 10% of sales on the leverage of the higher volumes. Year-over-year, stronger demand in the on-highway markets in North America, China and India more than offset weakness in Europe and drove revenues up 8%. The Components segment EBIT margin benefited from the cost reduction initiatives taken earlier in the year, lower material cost and higher volumes. Despite the pull forward of demand for transition engines in North America into 2009, we expect 2010 components revenues to increase 10% from higher price in technology content on the EPA 2010 products from higher truck production in emerging markets in Europe and from growth in aftermarket demand. We are forecasting EBIT margins for the segment between 6.5% and 7.5% of sales. In the Distribution segment, revenues were up 15% sequentially. EBIT margins were up from 13% in the prior quarter to 13.8% of sales, mainly from higher volumes and favorable currency benefits from a weaker U.S. dollar. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenues were down 13%, as the global slowdown largely impacted demand for new engines and power generation equipment. However, the favorable mix towards aftermarket and service revenues, an effect of cost-reduction initiatives, strengthened EBIT margins, strong Joint Venture income and favorable currency movements also contributed to this performance. In 2010, revenues for the distribution segment are expected to increase by 20%. Half of this growth will come from the consolidation of our Western Canada distributor, in which we increased our ownership from 50% to 80% at the beginning of the year. We are forecasting the segment EBIT margin in the range of 11% to 12% of sales as the consolidation will have a dilutive effect of approximately 1%. And finally, in the Power Generation segment, revenues were up 9% sequentially mainly driven by demand in emerging markets. Higher volumes and cost-reduction initiatives positively impacted EBIT, which improved from 4.2% in the third quarter to 5.7% of sales. Year-over-year, revenues were down 32% with most regions impacted. The lower volumes contributed to the drop in EBIT margins from last year's 8.5% of sales. In 2010, for Power Gen, we flat revenues and EBIT margins between 6.5% and 7.5% of sales. As demand dropped more significantly in the second half of 2009 for this business, we expect the end of channel destocking and continued recovery in the emerging markets to offset continued weakness in North America and Europe in 2010. As Tom just mentioned, we are projecting total Cummins revenues to be $11 billion in 2010, with EBIT margins of 7% of sales. Compared to 2009 results, the temporary impact in volumes of the 2010 emissions standards has a negative impact on EBIT of 1.3%. This is offset by EBIT improvements of 0.5% from stronger Joint Venture income, and the net 0.6% from the combination of placing and cost movements. As was the case in 2009, we expect EBIT to improve sequentially as we move through the year. We are currently projecting the effective tax rate for 2010 to increase to 32%, primarily as a result of the reserves tax credit not yet being extended. And finally, let me turn to the balance sheet and cash flow.  Our cash balance improved by over $500 million, more than double the amount at the beginning of the year. We generated more than $1.1 billion in cash from operating activities for the full year, a record for the company. A last part of this was due to the reduction in inventory levels of over $400 million. Debt to capital was 14.9% at the end of the year. Our strong financial position gives us the flexibility to invest in future profitable growth opportunities. As you heard from Tom, we plan to increase capital investments in 2010 to $400 million, up almost 30% from 2009. As mentioned on our last call, we have lifted the temporary suspension of our stock repurchase program that we had in place during most of 2009 and will accelerate our repurchase plans in 2010. We also remain committed to sustainable increases in our dividend and will review this with our Board during the year. Now before we take your questions, Tim would like to say a few words."

Those efforts put us in a position to emerge from the recession an even stronger company. We have taken a significant amount of cost out of our manufacturing system, which allows us to fully leverage demand increases such as those we saw in our Engine and Components businesses in the fourth quarter of 2009. The fact that we are in a position to remain profitable in those businesses in the first half of this year, despite a huge expected downturn swing in volume from the end of last year, also shows just how flexible our manufacturing system has become. We also continue to make heavy use of Six Sigma to drive quality improvements and lower our costs across the company. Our Six Sigma savings in 2009 were nearly $500 million well above our target. And all our business units exceeded their goals for the year. Also our performance in large international markets, such as China, India and Brazil contributed significantly to our outstanding performance in the fourth quarter and will play an even larger role in our future success. In particular, the China and India economies have bounced back strongly from their brief downturn late in 2008 and early in 2009. While our business in those two countries fell in 2009 from record levels in 2008, our fourth quarter results were very strong. In fact, the fourth quarter was our best ever in India, where the total size of our business in 2009 was more than $1.3 billion. We expect our business in India to be close to 2008 levels by the end of 2010. And with the Indian economy projected to grow at a rate of 7% or 8% a year for the next several years, this region will be increasingly important to Cummins in the future. The story is similar in China, which was a $1.7 billion business for us in 2009. We expect consolidated and unconsolidated sales in China to grow to well over $2.3 billion this year. The long-term prospects for Cummins in China also are very good, with the Chinese economy expected to grow at 8% to 9% a year from the 2011 through the 2014. As in India, all our business segments are well represented in China.  We are also well positioned to continue our growth in Brazil, where we are the clear market leader in the truck engine market. Prior to 2009, our business in Brazil had grown at 32% a year since 2003 and it reached $900 million in 2008. After a slight contraction in 2009, the Brazilian economy is expected to return to solid growth rates of 4% to 6% a year for the next several years, starting in 2010. In addition, large international events in Brazil, including the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016 will require significant investment in infrastructure, which plays to Cummins' strengths in that market. Our commitment to these large emerging markets has diversified our business and played a key role in allowing Cummins to remain profitable through the worst global downturn in decades. Given the expected long-term economic growth projected for these markets, the broad reach of our products and our technical advantage when it comes to meeting future emissions standards, China, India and Brazil will play an even larger role in our future success. We will share more details of our plans for sustained long-term growth at our analyst day in March. But I also want to talk a little today about our work to continue to invest in the business throughout the downturn and what it means for our future. Our strong balance sheet coming into the downturn and our performance during 2009 allowed us to generate the cash we needed to invest in the largest product launch in our history. As you heard Tom say, we have received EPA certification for our 2010 on-highway engines, which are in production now. More importantly for our future growth, we improved our cash position by more than $500 million, which will allow us to invest even more heavily in new products, technologies and capacity, going forward. As you heard Pat say, we will spend $400 million on capital expenditures this year. That money will go toward new products and significant investments and facilities to increase capacity and support for our current products. Finally, we will continue to invest in profitable growth opportunities made possible by our technical leadership, especially in the Components businesses, as well by favorable long-term growth trends. These include increased infrastructure spending in many parts of the world and the expected rise in demand for reliable power in emerging markets such as the Middle East and Africa. As you have heard throughout our remarks this morning, 2009 was an outstanding year given the challenging economic environment. We generated a solid profit, significantly increased our cash position and reduced inventory by more than $400 million. Our performance in 2009, especially in the second half of the year, is an example of what you can expect from Cummins once the recovery takes hold around the world. Our strong position today will allow us to get through a very challenging first half of the year in 2010 and will be the foundation for what I think will be a period of tremendous growth for Cummins beginning next year. Thank you, and we'll be happy to take your questions."

The impact of the increased content and the pricing that we can get for that is clearly one of those factors. Likewise, there will be additional volume, and we expect to see again 1/5 of the improvement come from additional volume. Pricing on existing products will increase by pretty much the same factor.

Turbochargers, at least, has exposure to a lot of the emerging markets where we've talked about earlier, where we do see strength in the truck markets in China and in India and in Brazil.

And then emission solutions is -- I think you can think about its revenue moving more in sync with what you might be modeling for the various truck OEMs in the market, because they are allowed under the EPA regulations to ship the exhaust systems up to 90 days after the engines. So they're not going to see the precipitous fall off like the Engine business will in the first quarter.

We have our opinion and we have a view, but we don't know the answer. And so I think -- what I don't want you to get is the idea that we don't notice that Navistar -- we know that Navistar won't be buying our 2010 engines, we're clear about that. We're also clear that we'll be adding some share at Freightliner versus previous. And we think -- and we've been adding share regularly at PACCAR. And we believe the offering we have with those customers will do really, really well in the market. Again, it remains to be seen. So it's hard to predict exactly what it is. We have an assumption, as you guessed. And right now, what, I guess, our projections for the business reflect what we think is going to happen, both in terms of the market and what position will operate in the market, what this market share will have."

And we worked hard to meet it, as I talked about in my remarks, it was not easy at all. Frankly, we were at the end, stretched just as about as thin as we could get, both in terms of our own capacity and our suppliers' capacity to make it. But again, I think what you saw was our plans ramping up very, very quickly as a result of terrific response by our plants and our suppliers that supply those plants. So we were ready, and were wanting to make sure we could capture demand as it came. And so I guess I feel good about how we reacted to that. But it was essentially flexibly adding resources in the plants, adding shifts, working overtime, the normal things you'd expect. Second point is that the EPA has already -- this is not the first time they've had a pre-buy or transition engines purchased. And so they've regularly utilized a rule they have to save people can you [ph] have reasonable transition. And I think that's basically what the rule the industry works to. The EPA went to work on a more specific rule, but has not released one. So there is nothing else in play today except the reasonableness rule. And the way that we view that is that we think we get orders from customers. And as long as a customer gives us a legitimate order, we ship the legitimate order. And then our customers are really responsible for figuring out what they need to transition. And I guess the one thing to keep in mind on that is that it sounds straightforward, but they're transitioning many, many models of vehicles, not just one. So they've got to understand how to get each engine engineered into each model. And it frankly is a bit of a challenge to get all that done, and cut over. And so that's, I think, when a lot of them are managing is that the transition, especially in an environment where truck demand has been very low and the engineering costs are high, that's a challenging environment for them. So that's what they're trying to manage through. And I'm sure, the EPA is thinking through that as well as try to make sure people move ahead and get the new engines in. They're both -- both are legitimate concerns."

I’ll start today by sharing some thoughts on our performance in the first quarter.

I’ll start today by sharing some thoughts on our performance in the first quarter. Pat will then provide greater detail on the quarter and our updated 2010 outlook, and Tim will build on the comments we made at last month’s analyst day regarding our long-term prospects. 
Clearly it was a very strong quarter despite the weakness in key U.S. and European markets. Sales at $2.5 billion in the first quarter were 2% higher than the same period a year ago with gains in our distribution and components businesses offsetting declines in the engine and power generation segments. Despite the modest revenue growth from last year, our earnings before interest in taxes improved significantly to $266 million or 10.7% of sales compared to $94 million or just under 4% of sales. 
In terms of the first quarter volumes, the North American truck market turned out as we had expected. As you know we experienced strong demand in the final month of 2009 in advance of the U.S. emissions change reducing demand in the first half of this year. Our shipments fell by approximately 90% from fourth quarter levels in the heavy and medium duty trucks, bus and RV markets and we’re down about 80% in the same market compared to the first quarter of 2009. 
On the other hand, our business improved significantly in several markets outside the U.S. in the quarter particularly in China, India and Brazil where their economies are recovering quickly from the recession. Our strong global position has enabled us to quickly capture the growth now occurring in these regions. 
Cummins’ first quarter results represent a continuation of our strong performance throughout the downturn. We have generated consecutively higher margins in relatively weak revenue environments by lowering our cost structure and improving the productivity of our manufacturing operations. As mentioned in previous quarters we have worked hard to align our manufacturing capacity with the real demand for our products. Our employees have done an outstanding job executing the company’s strategies for dealing with the volatility in our markets during the recession. We also took advantage of the downturn in the first half of last year to better synchronize the flow of products through our plants making heavy use of six sigma. 
The improved efficiency in our manufacturing operations is the most evidence in the performance of our engine and components segment in the first quarter. For example, our high horsepower engine plant in Daventry, England instituted operational improvements last year that have allowed us to manufacture almost the same number of engines in a single shift that took three shifts to complete a year ago. We have also seen productivity gains at our other high horsepower plants around the world, which will be crucial to meeting expected future demand in this market. 
Engine production per hour at our mid range engine plants in Columbus and Rocky Mountain, North Carolina improved 13% and 10% respectively from the same period a year ago. Productivity has also improved at our turbo charger manufacturing facilities around the world. For example, the per person equivalent production rate at our turbo charger plant in Huddersfield, England has improved by 67% from the first quarter of last year and 27% in our plant in Dewas, India. And production of exhaust after-treatment devices at our mission solutions plant in Mineral Point, Wisconsin increased 31% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year with only a modest increase in head count. This productivity improvement comes at a time when the plant has transitioned to manufacturing the more complex 2010 products. 
These are just a few examples of the tremendous work our people have done in our manufacturing plants to improve productivity and operating leverage. Such improvements have helped us to keep our first quarter EBIT at similar levels to what we deliver in the fourth quarter despite a 27% sales drop. 
From a geographic perspective, our strength in China, India and Brazil continues to be an advantage as the economies in those countries were even stronger than we expected in the first quarter. We are seeing an improving demand in the truck, construction, mining, and distributed power generation markets in all three countries. In addition, business has increased with OEM customers in Europe and Korea that export to China, India and the Middle East. Tim will talk in greater detail about the importance of these markets to our future success. 
So let me give a few examples of the current strength in these countries. China’s commercial truck and industrial markets continue their strong recovery. Compared to the first quarter of 2009, our truck engine sales in China grew by more than four times, and we’re up nearly 10% from the strong fourth quarter levels. Sales to the industrial engine markets increased 74% from the first quarter of 2009 and 24% from the fourth quarter. 
In India our truck engine sales more than tripled compared to the same period a year ago and increased 26% from the fourth quarter of 2009. Industrial engine sales increased 41% compared to the first quarter of 2009. 
We also continued to benefit from the strength in the Brazil truck and construction markets. Our truck engine shipments in the first quarter improved 81% from the first quarter in 2009 and 14% from the fourth quarter of 2009. 
As we look ahead to the rest of 2010, our priorities and outlook have not changed. We remain well positioned to take advantage of the continued strong economic growth we are forecasting for China, India and Brazil. We expect revenue in the U.S. this year to be flat to 2009 levels with some improvement coming in the second half of the year. In Europe we do expect modest improvement in demand year over year. 
We will continue to focus on cost reduction, productivity improvements, working capital management, and investment in new products and critical technologies. We are positioning the company to take advantage of growth opportunities that we are seeing already in some markets and expect to see in others once the economic recovery takes hold. 
Finally we are committed to serving our customers better than anyone else every time. In particular we are working hard to ensure that our 2010 product introductions are successful as possible for our customers. As of mid April we have shifted 3500 2010 compliant engines and the early reviews have been very positive. We logged more than 8 million test miles on the 2010 engines before putting them into production, and the feedback from that work is being confirmed by our customers in the field today. 
We are seeing the type of fuel economy improvements that we expected; a 5% improvement from our 2007 heavy duty engine and a 3% gain our medium duty engines. Many customers are seeing even larger fuel economy gains and some have even reported double-digit percentage improvements. 
I believe we are well on our way toward delivering on our promise to produce a better performing, more reliable and more fuel efficient engine in 2010. We are devoting significant resources to supporting these products during the launch period to ensure that our customers are able to realize the benefits of these improvements in their businesses. We are very pleased with how the company has weathered the downturn and the first quarter of 2010 is no exception. We still have significant challenges ahead of us in many of our major markets, but I’m confident that we are focused on the right thing and have solid plans in place to build on our performance in the first quarter. I will now turn it over to Pat who will give you some additional details about the first quarter.
Pat Ward
Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. First quarter revenues of $2.5 billion were relatively flat from the year ago but the geographic mix was significantly different. Revenues in our international markets increased by 28% due to stronger demand in China, India and Brazil which offset a drop of 23% in our North American markets. Compared to the prior quarter total revenues were down 27% with sales in the US down almost 50% mostly due to the transition to the 2010 emission standards in the US. 
EBIT margins of 10.7% were significantly better than a year ago and remains strong compared to the prior quarter on much lower revenues. The main reasons for the strong EBIT margin performance were the operational improvements as mentioned by Tom, more material cost compared to the first quarter of last year, pricing increases, stronger joint venture income particularly engine joint ventures in China and India and lower warranty costs. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 34% which was 3% higher than our projected full year tax rate due to a $7 million discreet items related to the sales tax rate burn as a result of the recent tax changes in federal healthcare laws. 
Earnings per share was $0.75 in the quarter. 
Now turning to each of our four business segments I will highlight the performance in the first quarter and updated 2010 revenue and profitability for each of them. Starting with the engine segment, revenues of $1.4 billion were 34% lower than the prior quarter. Engine shipments to the truck, bus and RV markets in North America were down 90% as expected due to the effect of EPA on highway emission changes. This (big) volume was slightly offset by demand improvement in most industrial markets particularly in mining and construction. Compared to  the prior year, revenues were then 5%. The drop in North America truck and bus markets were offset by stronger truck markets outside of North America by improvement in demand in construction and mining market and by increased shipments (inaudible). 
Segment EBIT margin of 9.3% was slightly down from a 9.7% reported in the prior quarter on revenues which were 34% lower. Margins were much better in the first quarter of 2009 when the segment reported a loss of $16 million. The improvement in margins were mainly driven by operational improvements in our manufacturing plants, stronger joint venture income, more material costs, benefits from pricing actions, a favorable aftermarket mix and lower warranty cost. 
For the full year we now expect revenues to grow 10%. Heavy duty truck revenue will decline 19% in 2010. We continue to forecast production of (inaudible) class 8 heavy duty trucks to grow 30% this year. Well, as a result of EPA 2010 transition, our global heavy duty truck engine shipments will drop 35%. 
Revenues from the medium duty truck and bus markets will be 10% higher this year. Strong demand in Brazil and the recovery of OEM truck production in Europe will more than offset the drop in North America due to the EPA ‘10 transition. Light duty automotive and recreational vehicle revenues are projected to grow 31% due to the ramp pickup truck recovery in North America and strong demand for (school) pickup trucks in Brazil. We are now forecasting industrial revenues to increase 40% this year, less stronger demand from mining and oil and gas markets, driving by rising commodity and oil prices and the recovery in construction markets in emerging economies supported by infrastructure projects and economic growth. 
Our engine joint ventures are expected to perform at record levels of production this year. Our Dongfeng-Cummins joint venture in China and our Tata-Cummins joint venture in India were both running at record levels in the first quarter where volumes in our joint venture with Komatsu in Japan supporting global industrial markets are recovering nearly by about 2008 levels after declining 60% in 2009. 
We now project full year engine segment EBIT margins in the range of 7.5% to 8.5% of sales. Margins in the second half of the year will face some challenges from the production ramp up of new EPA 2010 engines, which initially will carry a high advantage from higher research and development investment and the reinstatement of (inaudible) increases with the potential slowing of demand in China and India as a result of government efforts to control economic growth and rising commodity costs as we see metal market prices are increasing and do expect some impact on that in the second half of the year. 
In the components segment, revenues were down 14% from the prior quarter driven by the EPA ’10 transition in North America on highway markets particularly embarking the turbo charger and fuel system businesses. Compared to the prior year, revenues were up 19% as a result of strong orders from top OEMs in China and India, global after market demand improvement, production recovery from European truck OEMs and favorable currency movements. Even margins of 9% of sales this quarter compares well both for the 10% EBIT margins in the prior quarter given the 14% drop in revenue onto the breakeven performance a year ago. Compared to the first quarter of 2009, margins improved due to stronger volumes and operational improvement arising from the restructuring actions taken last year.  
For the full-year, we are now forecasting revenues for component segment to increase 20% as a result of higher price in technology transparent on EPA 2010 products, recovering global aftermarket demand and stronger demand from OEMs in China, India and Europe. Component EBIT margins for the year are now expected to be between 8 and 9% of sales. Revenues for the distribution segment was slightly low sequentially and up 15% from the prior year.  
The consolidation of rest from Canada distributor added $54 million in revenue and favorably impacting the profitability of the segment due to a onetime gain of $12 million in the quarter. Excluding the consolidation on product, sales were relatively flat from a year ago. Year-over-year excluding the distributing and consolidation revenues for aftermarket parts and services improved by 17%, well also a revenue of power generation and engines declined by 16%.  
The EBIT margin of 15% of sales this quarter includes $12 million onetime gain and that makes exclude the segment with a reported 12.5% margins. For the full-year, we forecast revenues to be up 25% with about half of the growth coming from the recent (inaudible) consolidation. EBIT margins are now projected at between 12 and 15% of sales. And finally revenues for our power generation segment were down 21% from the first quarter of last year and down 14% from the prior quarter, which wasn’t away with our expectations.  
Compared to the first quarter of last year, we are seeing much lower demand in Western Europe, the Middle East and North America partially offset by stronger demand in China and India. Sequential EBIT margins for the power gen segment improved from 5.7 to 6.6% of sales this quarter despite lower revenues, with cost reduction initiatives, operational improvements and lower material costs more than offsetting the sales volume decline.  
For the year, revenues for the power gen segment are now expected to grow 10% from the recovery in most markets to say of North America and Western Europe. All does particularly for larger gensets were increasingly but by infrastructure projects and economic growth in the emerging economies as well as some benefit from the channel inventory correction in the prior year. Segment EBIT margins are now projected to be in the range of 7.5 to 8.5% of sales for the year. As a result of the improved outlook for all four operating segments, we now expect the company to deliver $12 billion in revenue and EBIT margins of 10% of sales in 2010, compared to our previous guidance of $11 billion in revenue and 7% EBIT margins.
Finally, let me turn to the balance sheet and cash flow. Working capital levels were lower in the first quarter mainly due to strong collections from receivables. This was partly offset by an increase in inventory levels as we began to ramp up to meet stronger demand. Cash balance have remained a strong even after contributing $111 million into the pension fund and our debt-to-capital ratio was 15.8% at the end of the quarter.  
For the full-year, we do expect further investment in working capital to support the increasing demand that we now project, we will invest $400 million in capital expenditure, a 30% increase over 2009 levels in order to support capacity expansion and new product introductions. We will continue to focus on returning value to our shareholders through for the stock repurchases and we remained committed to sustainable increases in our dividends and we would have viewed as a work over the next few months.  
As Tom said, it has been a very good start to the year particularly given the challenges we face in our North American markets. On the increasing in guidance reflects a confidence that we will continue to see further improvements in the months to come. Now before we take your questions, Tim would like to say a few words.  
"
265253,78855782,57884,"Cummins Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-27-2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Cummins Inc.","Executives","Thanks Pat and good morning. I would like to start by reinforcing a couple of things you already have heard from Tom and Pat this morning. Our first quarter performance was good. Our leadership position in the emerging markets particularly in China, India",1093,"Thanks Pat and good morning. I would like to start by reinforcing a couple of things you already have heard from Tom and Pat this morning. Our first quarter performance was good. Our leadership position in the emerging markets particularly in China, India and Brazil enabled us to take advantage of the strong growth in these economies. The first quarter results illustrate a success of our geographic diversification strategy over the past two years. Especially considering a significant slowdown in the North American heavy and medium duty trucks.  
Remember what Tom and Pat said, our North American heavy duty truck, medium duty truck and RVs were down 90% in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter last year. That’s the biggest drop I can remember. As I said, during our last quarterly call our ability to handle the volatility in demand over the past several months is an indicator or a type of performance you can expect from us in the future. The actions we have taken before and during this recession have resulted in excellent performance through the economic cycle and also will service well for what we think will be an extended period of profitable growth over the next several years.  
As you may recall, from our recent analyst day presentation, Cummins has identified all long term macro trends working in our favor. Let me quickly recap them because they will have a significant positive impact on the performance of the company over the next few years. The first is price and availability of energy. Over the long term, fuel prices are almost certain to increase which is driving our research and development to dramatically improve fuel economy. As you’ve heard Tom already say, our 2010 engines are delivering 5% better fuel economy than our 2007 engines.  
We have ongoing technology projects that will further improve fuel efficiency. Over the long run, we expect this to result in dramatic improvement in the efficiency of our customers products. At the same time, demand for electrical power is expected to increase by as much as 8% a year in developing regions and 4% overall. This will increase the gap between supply and demand offering great opportunities for our power generation business.  
The second trend is the implementation of more stringent emission standards around the world. We talked a lot about 2010 emission changes in the United States, but that has really just the start of a broad wave of new and tougher emission regulations around the world over the next few years. Every major economy in the world is going to be adopting tighter emission standards over the next five years for both on-highway and off-highway applications. Thos standards are going to require our OEM customers to adapt new technologies which Cummins is well positioned to provide.  
That means more engine sales for Cummins, an increased use of our components on our own engines as well as by our OEM customer who make their own engines. This will also continue to draw our key partners to Cummins who want technical help in meeting these standards. The third trend is the increase in infrastructure spending around the world. An estimated $35 trillion is forecasted to be spent on infrastructure development such as for roads, bridges, power supply and telecommunication facilities over the next 20 years. These are all markets in which Cummins has a leadership position. In fact the increased infrastructure spending in China and India as part of economic stimulus packages implemented last year was a primary reason for our increased sales and profits in the first quarter.  
In China, the total construction equipment market grew 55% in the first two months of the year compared to the same period last year. We are also seeing increased demand in key power generation segments supporting transportation and data center investment. The story is similar in India. Road construction has increased across the country, approaching an average of 20 kilometers of new highways being built every day. In addition, the Indian government said it expects $20 billion worth of highway construction contracts to be awarded this year.  
The final trend is the globalization of our business, especially as it relates to our strength in the large emerging markets at China, India and Brazil. All of these economies are expected to grow faster than the more developed markets of US and Europe for the foreseeable future. Annual GDP growth in China is expected to average between 8.5 and 9.5% percent over the next five years, between 7 and 8% in India and between 4.5 and 5.5% in Brazil. In addition to the infrastructure investments , I’ve already mentioned, all three countries have a large and growing middle class which is increasing demand for a wide range of products and services.  
Also our OEM customers in these countries are beginning to export from their domestic markets. This is especially true in China and India where core companies are aggressively looking to export their products as these customers become more global, they’re demand for our products and distribution is support and effort both increase.  
As Thomas said, we are already seeing strong demand increases in China, India and Brazil as those countries have rebounded quickly from the downturn. We expect that growth to continue well into the future and we are making necessary investments to capture the additional demand in our plans and distribution channel as well with our joint venture partners.  
As we’ve been saying for more than a year now, our emphasize is earning a solid profit, generating cash, investing in critical technologies and providing outstanding support for our customers. As the economic recovery takes hold, we have some significant growth opportunities in front of us. Our market share is strong in most markets around the world, giving us a solid foundation from which to grow. We also have developed excellent relationships with our key OEMs and joint venture partners with whom we are growing.  
We have demonstrated technology leadership not in just meeting emission standards on time every time but also providing the most reliable and best performing products for our customers. As we have said, our long term plan is to grow revenues to $20 billion in 2014 and earn an average EBIT margin of 10% across the next business cycle. Given our current strong financial condition, the outstanding performance of our employees during the recent global downturn and the opportunities we have in front of us, I am confident that we are well positioned for just that kind of growth long term.

We did anticipate improved material cost. We knew we were going to get some benefits for on the cost restructuring actions we took a year ago. So really joint venture income and the fact our plans really did so well in the engines segment, the components segment and the power gen segment.

Warranty costs were 1.7% of sales in the first quarter. Our previous guidance when the question came up three months ago, we said we will be running at 4% and that is going to be closer to 3.5%, but they will increase.
Commodity costs are going to be higher in the second half of the year. We still expect overall material cost to be favorable year-over-year, but we have already seen much of that benefit in the first quarter. And our projection just now as a commodity cost could be as high in Q3 and Q4 by as much as $20 million, $25 million higher a quarter than what we’ve seen in the first quarter.

But as we stand now, what I think what we feel good about is if you just compare this first quarter to fourth quarter what you see is a continuation. 
It looks very dramatic compared to Q1. But compared to fourth quarter, what we said is we are doing a whole bunch of work in our plants, in our engineering areas, even in our overhead areas to try to improve productivity, keep costs down. So even in a relatively weak recessionary revenue environment, we can continue to improve margins, and I think that's what you really see in Q1. And as Pat said, China, India, and Brazil markets definitely went faster than we thought, we knew they would recover, they recovered faster, and we really benefit from that, because we were positioned to capture them.

But I guess what I want to say about Tier 4 both interim and Tier 4 final is that's another part of the overwhelming trend Tim talked about emissions spreading across the world. And Tier 4 interim and final and their equipments will affect both European and US manufacturers in significant ways. And it's unlike the US EPA think we just went to; it's not going to be a cliff event. 
There are requirements by horse power range that begin to hit at different phases. There is also this complex T-PAM (ph) arrangement where people can sort of do sort of fleet mixing and figure out how they wanted to deploy which level of emissions. So we expect manufacturers to get on the bus if you will at different points in time and we are working with all our major OEMs on this. We have made announcements with Camaro (ph) for example. But many of the other OEMs are actually still figuring out exactly what they want to do and how they want to do. We are actively talking with all of them and we are in fact doing more than talking; we are working on emissions releases with them, but they haven't announced theirs, and I don't want to get ahead of them on that. 
But in terms of specific product announcements, we can definitely get back to you on specific ones that we announced BAMA for example if there are any. But what you should expect from Cummins is this is our strength, this is where we are good, we are good in emissions both in terms of the engines and the component, we will see increased business as a result of Tier 4 interim and final by the end, and we will see expansion of OEM partnerships that we have as well as some new piece of equipment. But in terms of how it's going to play out between now and 2014, there is a lot ground and cover, and the OEMs are still doing a lot of planning about how they want to manage it.

I don't think there was significant share moves during the quarter for example. Over time our expectation is we will continue to expand share in China primarily by - because we are entering now in the light commercial vehicle market which is a new area for us. And so we will continue to expand share in the truck market by entering in a different parts of the market. But with regard to the primary truck market that we have been in for sometime, there we were not significant share movements and we really don't expect significant share movements in the near term anyway. Over the long run of course, we are trying to pursue with our customers gaining share, but I think it's not a short term issue. 
And with India, I mentioned before as well, the truck share movements are not so dramatic. What we have done is grown share with Tata. And really over the last 18 months, I would say is a better comparison period, we have increased the share of our engines in their trucks by making our engines more and more competitive from a cost point of view as well as improving the quality of those engines, and they are finding that more and more customers are ready to pay a little bit more for engines with newer technology as the roads develop in India, that's part of building on the thing that Tim talked about is as infrastructure improves and wealth grows in those countries, the willingness to pay for technology is increasing. So I guess from a share point of view that's driving up our share, but mostly as we think about our share at Tata.
And then Brazil which I did not mention yet is again relatively level from a total market point of view. We are with some leading customers there in Ford and Volkswagen MAN, where their share is about even, but we are seeing very, very good volume as the market grows there. So, I think all the quarter one stories are market stories, but our position has grown over the years and remains strong.

There is a high price hurdle and so it's going to take some folks time to get used to that and figure out how they want to utilize this particularly in this still difficult freight environment. But we are seeing in people putting orders in, we are seeing people try it much more aggressively across the market, and some of buying making larger orders.

Those comments I made, we had a couple of fleet customers who actually saw very, very large benefits. And as I think about that, it was situational of them. I think the way they were using their engines and the way they had them setup in their trucks, we were able to do a lot with them, but the new ones that really made a big benefit. 
So I think it’s - the intent is to just to say that we think the engines are offering very good fuel economy improvements and we want to help customers realize those to maximum benefits. So we did see those were customer-specific as opposed to application-specific kind of improvements. So right now, there is too few out there to say which ones are going to see the best. 
I think the important technical point though and that with our - with the SCR technology, the copper zeolite that we are deploying, we see a very wide map that people can operate in and still capture this fuel economy benefit. That’s been a kind of a challenge for the industry before you find a good fuel economy point, but as soon as a different driver drives it or they do a different road, they don’t realize those fuel economy benefits.
On the real positives of this technology is the map they can operate in this wider and still get the benefit. So we think we are going to see more customers realizing the full benefit of the fuel economy and with this technology, which again we think as we kind of finish the deployment, the industry is really going to be pleased with what’s out there.

So we are, of course, we recognize that our 15 liter will compete with 13 liters on the road. A whole bunch of them have loads that a 15 liter just handles better and that - in fact that trend has been going more that way for many years. And so our view is the whole bunch of customers that have got used to the 15 liters and seen what they can do for them are reluctant frankly to switch. They have got a lot of benefits after moving to 15 liter. 
Second thing is that if we continue to produce engines with leading fuel economy and including being competitive 13 liters on fuel economy, it’s going to reduce the number of reasons to switch. There is no question that a good 13-liter engine will do well in the market, but we also think there is going to be a place both short run and the long run for 15 liters, again provided that we continue to make the offering competitive and that’s really the thing we said all along that the gain here is try to introduce technology reliably and with - working closely with your customers, so the integration goes well. And as long as we continue to do that, we think we will have a place for the 15 liter.

What we said is we think we have a very good partnership with PACO, we will continue to work with them to make sure they have good trucks to sell. 
We are also working closely with Freightliner and Volvo that their offerings were competitive. And what our view is that those three truck manufacturers that use our engine will then be competing with Navistar with their engine offerings. And our view is that our truck customers are pretty well positioned with our technology and their own technology to compete and we will be hoping them every place we can to compete in the market. And so I think that’s what we will find drive share. Whether or not we fully recover every percentage point or not is not clear. There is a lot of ground to play. We just think we have a good offering and good partners and we are going to go out there and fight it out in the market.

Clearly, it was a very strong quarter, despite the weakness in key U.S. and European markets. Sales of $2.5 billion in the first quarter were 2% higher than the same period a year ago, with gains in our Distribution and Components businesses offsetting declines in the Engine and Power Generation segments. Despite the modest revenue growth from last year, our earnings before interest and taxes improved significantly to $266 million or 10.7% of sales, compared to $94 million or just under 4% of sales. 
In terms of the first quarter volumes, the North American truck market turned out as we had expected. As you know, we experienced strong demand in the final months of 2009, in advance of the U.S. emissions change, reducing demand in the first half of this year. Our shipments fell by approximately 90% from fourth quarter levels in the heavy- and medium-duty trucks, bus and RV markets, and we're down about 80% in the same markets compared to the first quarter of 2009. 
On the other hand, our business improved significantly in several markets outside the U.S. in the quarter, particularly in China, India and Brazil, where their economies are recovering quickly from the recession. Our strong global position has enabled us to quickly capture the growth now occurring in these region. 
Cummins' first quarter results represent a continuation of our strong performance throughout the downturn. We have generated consecutively higher margins and relatively weak revenue environment, by lowering our cost structure and improving the productivity of our manufacturing operations. As mentioned in previous quarters, we worked hard to align our manufacturing capacity with the real demand for our products. Our employees have done an outstanding job executing the company's strategies for dealing with the volatility in our market during the recession. 
We also took advantage of the downturn in the first half of last year to better synchronize the flow of products to our plants, making heavy use of Six Sigma. The improved efficiency in our manufacturing operations is most evidenced in the performance of our Engine and Components segments in the first quarter. For example, our high horsepower engine plant in Daventry, England instituted operational improvements last year, that have allowed us to manufacture almost the same number of engines in a single shift that took three shifts to complete a year ago. 
We have also seen productivity gains at our other high horsepower plants around the world, which will be crucial to meeting expected future demand in this market. Engine production per hour at our mid-range engine plants in Columbus and Rocky Mount, North Carolina improved 13% and 10%, respectively, from the same period a year ago. Productivity has also improved at our turbocharger manufacturing facilities around the world. 
For example, the per person equivalent production rate at our turbocharger plants in Huddersfield, England has improved by 67% from the first quarter last year and 27% in our plants in Dewas, India. And production of exhaust after-treatment devices at our emission solutions plant in Mineral Point, Wisconsin increased 31% in the first quarter, compared to the same period last year, with only a modest increase in headcount. 
This productivity improvement comes at a time when the plant has transitioned to manufacturing the more complex 2010 products. These are just a few examples of the tremendous work our people have done in our manufacturing plants to improve productivity and operating leverage. Such improvements have helped us to keep our first quarter EBIT at similar levels to what we delivered in the fourth quarter, despite a 27% sales drop.
From a geographic perspective, our strength in China, India and Brazil continues to be an advantage, as the economies in those countries were even stronger than we expected in the first quarter. We are seeing improving demand in the truck, construction, mining and distributed power generation markets in all three countries. In addition, business has increased with OEM customers in Europe and Korea that export to China, India and the Middle East. Tim will talk in greater detail about the importance of these markets to our future success, but let me give you a few examples of the current strength in these countries.
China's commercial truck and industrial markets continue their strong recovery. Compared to the first quarter of 2009, our truck engine sales in China grew by more than 4x, and were up nearly 10% from the strong fourth quarter levels. Sales to the industrial engine markets increased 74% from the first quarter of 2009 and 24% from the fourth quarter. 
In India, our truck engine sales more than tripled, compared to the same period a year ago, and increased 26% from the fourth quarter of 2009. Industrial engine sales increased 41%, compared to the first quarter of 2009. We also continued to benefit from the strength in the Brazil truck and construction markets. Our truck engine shipments in the first quarter improved 81% from the first quarter in 2009, and 14% from the fourth quarter of 2009. 
As we look ahead to the rest of 2010, our priorities and outlook have not changed. We remain well positioned to take advantage of the continued strong economic growth we are forecasting for China, India and Brazil. We expect revenue in the U.S. this year to be flat to 2009 levels, with some improvement coming in the second half of the year. In Europe, we do expect modest improvement in demand year-over-year.
We will continue to focus on cost reduction, productivity improvements, working capital management and investment in new products and critical technologies. We are positioning the company to take advantage of growth opportunities that we are seeing already in some markets, and expect to see in others once the economic recovery takes hold. 
Finally, we are committed to serving our customers better than anyone else every time. In particular, we are working hard to ensure that our 2010 product introductions are as successful as possible for our customers. As of mid-April, we have shipped 3,500 2010-compliant engines and the early reviews have been very positive. We logged more than 8 miles on the 2010 engines before putting them into production, and the feedback from that work is being confirmed by our customers in the field today. 
We are seeing the type of fuel economy improvements we expected, a 5% improvement from our 2007 heavy-duty engine and a 3% gain on medium-duty engine. Many customers are seeing even larger fuel economy gains, and some have even reported double-digit percentage improvements. I believe we are well on our way towards delivering on our promise to produce a better-performing, more reliable and more fuel-efficient engine in 2010. We are devoting significant resources to supporting these products during the launch period, to ensure that our customers are able to realize the benefits of these improvements in their businesses. 
We are very pleased with how the company has weathered the downturn, and the first quarter of 2010 is no exception. We still have some significant challenges ahead of us in many of our major markets, but I'm confident that we are focused on the right things and have solid plans in place to build on our performance in the first quarter. I will now turn it over to Pat, who will give you some additional details about the first quarter."
265253,78855782,58028,"Cummins Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-27-2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Cummins Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. First quarter revenues of $2.5 billion were relatively flat from a year ago, but the geographic mix was significantly different. Revenues in our international markets increased by 28% due to stronger demand in C",1524,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. First quarter revenues of $2.5 billion were relatively flat from a year ago, but the geographic mix was significantly different. Revenues in our international markets increased by 28% due to stronger demand in China, India and Brazil, which offset the drop of 23% in our North American markets.
Compared to the prior quarter, total revenues were down 27%, with sales in the U.S. down almost 50%, mostly due to the transition for the 2010 emission standards in the U.S. EBIT margins of 10.7% was significantly better than a year ago, and remains strong, compared to the prior quarter, on much lower revenues. The main reasons for the strong EBIT margin performance were the operational improvements, as mentioned by Tom; more material costs, compared to the first quarter of last year; pricing increases; stronger joint venture income, particularly, engine joint ventures in China and India; and lower warranty costs.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 34%, which was 3% higher than our projected full year tax rate, due to a $7 million discrete item related to a deferred tax rate burn, as a result of recent tax changes in federal healthcare laws. Earnings per share were $0.75 in the quarter. 
Now turning to each of our four business segments, I will highlight their performance in the first quarter and updated 2010 revenue and profitability for each of them. Starting with the Engine segment, the revenues of $1.4 billion were 34% lower than the prior quarter. Engine shipments in the truck, bus and RV markets in North America were down 90%, as expected, due to the effect of EPA on-highway emission changes. 
This decline was slightly offset by demand improvement in most industrial markets, particularly in mining and construction. Compared to the prior year, revenues were down 5%. The drop in North America truck and bus markets was offset by stronger truck markets outside of North America, by improvement in demand in construction and mining markets and by increased shipments to Chrysler. 
Segment EBIT margin of 9.3% was slightly down from the 9.7% reported in the prior quarter on revenues which were 34% lower. Margins were much better than the first quarter of 2009, when the segment reported a loss of $16 million. The improvement in margins were mainly driven by operational improvements in our manufacturing plants, stronger joint venture income, more material cost, benefits from pricing actions, a favorable aftermarket mix and the warranty costs.
For the full year, we now expect revenues to grow 10%. Heavy-duty truck revenue will decline 19% in 2010. We continue to forecast production of Navistar Class 8 heavy-duty trucks to grow 30% this year, while as a result of EPA 2010 transition, our global heavy-duty truck engine shipments will drop 35%.  Revenues from the medium-duty truck and bus markets will be 10% higher this year. Strong demand in Brazil and the recovery of OEM truck production in Europe will more than offset the drop in North America, due to the EPA '10 transition. Light-duty automotive and recreational vehicle revenues are projected to grow 31%, due to the Ram pickup truck recovery in North America and strong demand for Ford pickup trucks in Brazil.
We are now forecasting industrial revenues to increase 40% this year versus stronger demand from mining and oil and gas markets, driven by rising commodity and oil prices, and the recovery in construction markets in emerging economies, supported by infrastructure projects and economic growth. Our engine joint ventures are expected to perform at record levels of production this year. Our Dongfeng Cummins joint venture in China and the Tata Cummins joint venture in India were both running at record levels in the first quarter, while volumes in our joint venture with Komatsu in Japan, supporting global industrial markets, are recovering nearly about the 2008 levels, after declining 60% in 2009. 
We now project full year Engine segment EBIT margins in the range of 7.5% to 8.5% of sales. Margins in the second half of the year will face some challenges from the production ramp-up of new EPA 2010 engines, which initially will carry higher warranty rates from higher research and development investment on the reinstatement of merit increases, with potential slowing of demand in China and India, as a result of government efforts to control economic growth and rising commodity costs, as we see metal market prices increasing and do expect some impact from that in the second half of the year.
In this important segment, revenues were down 14% from the prior quarter, driven by the EPA '10 transition in North America on-highway markets, particularly impacting the Turbocharger and Fuel Systems businesses. Compared to the prior year, revenues were up 19%, as a result of strong orders from truck OEMs in China and India, global aftermarket demand improvement, production recovery from European truck OEMs and favorable currency movements. 
EBIT margins of 9% of sales this quarter compares well, both to the 10% EBIT margins in the prior quarter, given the 14% drop in revenue, and to the break-even performance of a year ago. Compared to the first quarter of 2009, margins improved due to stronger volumes and operational improvements arising from the restructuring actions taken last year. For the full year, we are now forecasting revenues for the Components segment to increase 20%, as a result of higher price and technology content on EPA 2010 products, recovery in global aftermarket demand and stronger demand from OEMs in China, India and Europe. Component EBIT margins for the year are now expected to be between 8% and 9% of sales.
Revenues for our Distribution segment was slightly down sequentially, and up 15% from the prior year. The consolidation of our Western Canada distributor added $54 million in revenue, and favorably impacted the profitability of the segment due to a one-time gain of $12 million in the quarter. Excluding the consolidation impact, sales were relatively flat from a year ago. 
Year-over-year, excluding the distributor consolidation, the revenues for aftermarket parts and services improved by 17%, while wholesale revenue of Power Generation and Engines declined by 16%. The EBIT margin of 15% of sales this quarter includes the $12 million one-time gain, and if we exclude this, the segment would've reported 12.5% margins. For the full year, we forecast revenues to be up 25%, with over half of the growth coming from the recent distributor consolidation. EBIT margins are now projected at between 12% and 13% of sales.
And finally, revenues for our Power Generation segment were down 21% from the first quarter of last year and down 14% from the prior quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Compared to the first quarter of last year, we are seeing much more demand in Western Europe, the Middle East and North America, partially offset by stronger demand in China and India. Sequential EBIT margins for the Power Gen segment improved from 5.7% to 6.6% of sales this quarter despite lower revenues, with cost-reduction initiatives, operational improvements and lower material costs more than offsetting the sales volume decline. 
For the year, revenues for the Power Gen segment are now expected to grow 10% from the recovery in most markets outside of North America and Western Europe. All of those, particularly for larger gensets, are increasing, backed by infrastructure projects and economic growth in emerging economies, as well as some benefit from the channel inventory production in the prior year. Segment EBIT margins are now projected to be in the range of 7.5% to 8.5% of sales for the year. As a result of the improved outlook for all four operating segments, we now expect the company to deliver $12 billion in revenue and EBIT margins of 10% of sales in 2010, compared to our previous guidance of $11 billion in revenue and 7% EBIT margins. 
Finally, let me turn to the balance sheet and cash flow. Working capital levels were lower in the first quarter, mainly due to strong collections from receivables. This was partly offset by an increase in inventory levels, as we begin to ramp up to meet stronger demand. Cash balances remain strong, even after contributing $111 million into a pension fund, and our debt-to-capital ratio was 15.8% at the end of the quarter. 
For the full year, we do expect further investment and working capital to support the increase in demand that we now project. We will invest $400 million in capital expenditure, a 30% increase over 2009 levels, in order to support capacity expansion and new product introductions. We will continue to focus on returning value to our shareholders through further stock repurchases, and we remain committed to sustainable increases in our dividend and we will review this with our board over the next few months. As Tom said, it has been a very good start to the year, particularly given the challenges we faced in our North American markets, and the increase in guidance reflects our confidence that we will continue to see further improvement in the months to come. Now before we take your questions, Tim would like to say a few words."
265253,78855782,58028,"Cummins Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-27-2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Cummins Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Pat, and good morning. I would like to start by reinforcing a couple of things you already have heard from Tom and Pat this morning. Our first quarter performance was good. Our leadership position in the emerging markets, particularly in China, In",1090,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning. I would like to start by reinforcing a couple of things you already have heard from Tom and Pat this morning. Our first quarter performance was good. Our leadership position in the emerging markets, particularly in China, India and Brazil, enabled us to take advantage of the strong growth in these economies.  The first quarter results illustrate the success of our geographic diversification strategy over the past two years, especially considering the significant slowdown in the North American heavy- and medium-duty trucks. 
Remember what Tom and Pat said, our North American heavy-duty truck, medium-duty truck and RVs were down 90% in the first quarter, compared to the fourth quarter last year. That's the biggest drop I can remember. So I said during our last quarterly call, our ability to handle the volatility in demand over the past several months is an indicator of the type of performance you can expect from us in the future. The actions we have taken before and during this recession have resulted in excellent performance through the economic cycle, and also will serve us well for what we think will be an extended period of profitable growth over the next several years. 
As you may recall from our recent analyst day presentation, Cummins has identified four long-term macro trends working in our favor. Let me quickly recap them because they will have a significant positive impact on the performance of the company over the next few years. The first is price and availability of energy. Over the long term, fuel prices are almost certain to increase, which is driving our research and development to dramatically improve fuel economy. And as you've heard Tom already say, our 2010 engines are delivering 5% better fuel economy than our 2007 engines. 
We have ongoing technology projects that will further improve fuel efficiency. Over the long run, we expect this to result in dramatic improvements in the efficiency of our customers' products. At the same time, demand for electrical power is expected to increase by as much as 8% a year in developing regions and 4% overall. This will increase the gap between supply and demand, offering great opportunities for our Power Generation business.
The second trend is the implementation of more stringent emission standards around the world. We talked a lot about 2010 emission changes in the United States, but that is really just the start of a broad wave of new and tougher emission regulations around the world, over the next few years. Every major economy in the world is going to be adopting tighter emissions standards over the next five years, for both on-highway and off-highway applications. Those standards are going to require our OEM customers to adopt new technologies, which Cummins is well positioned to provide. That means more engine sales for Cummins and increased use of our components on our own engines, as well as by our OEM customers who make their own engines. This will also continue to draw key partners to Cummins who want technical help in meeting these standards.
The third trend is the increase in infrastructure spending around the world. An estimated $35 trillion is forecast to be spent on infrastructure development, such as for roads, bridges, power supply and telecommunication facilities over the next 20 years. These are all markets in which Cummins has a leadership position. In fact, the increased infrastructure spending in China and India is part of economic stimulus packages implemented last year was a primary reason for our increased sales and profits in the first quarter. 
In China, the total construction equipment market grew 55% in the first two months of the year, compared to the same period last year. We are also seeing increased demand in key Power Generation segments supporting transportation and data center investment. The story is similar in India. Road construction has increased across the country, approaching an average of 20 kilometers of new highways being built everyday. In addition, the Indian government said it expects $20 billion worth of highway construction contracts to be awarded this year. 
The final trend is the globalization of our business, especially as it relates to our strength in the large emerging markets of China, India and Brazil. All of these economies are expected to grow faster than the more developed markets of U.S. and Europe for the foreseeable future. Annual GDP growth in China is expected to average between 8 1/2% and 9 1/2% over the next five years, between 7% and 8% in India and between 4 1/2% and 5 1/2% in Brazil. 
In addition to the infrastructure investments I've already mentioned, all three countries have a large and growing middle class, which is increasing demand for a wide range of products and services. Also, our OEM customers in these countries are beginning to export from their domestic markets. This is especially true in China and India, where companies are aggressively looking to export their products. As these customers become more global, their demand for our products and our distribution and support network will increase.
As Tom has said, we are already seeing strong demand increases in China, India and Brazil, as those countries have rebounded quickly from the downturn. We expect that growth to continue well into the future and we are making the necessary investments that capture the additional demand in our plants and distribution channel, as well with our joint venture partners. As we've been saying for more than a year now, our emphasis is earning a solid profit, generating cash, investing in critical technologies and providing outstanding support for our customers.  As the economic recovery takes hold, we have some significant growth opportunities in front of us. Our market share is strong in most markets around the world, giving us a solid foundation from which to grow. 
We also have developed excellent relationships with our key OEMs and joint venture partners, with whom we are growing. We have demonstrated technology leadership, not in just meeting emission standards on time, every time, but also providing the most reliable and best-performing products for our customers. As we have said, our long-term plan is to grow revenues to $20 billion in 2014 and earn an average EBIT margin of 10% across the next business cycle. Given our current strong financial condition, the outstanding performance of our employers during the recent global downturn and the opportunities we have in front of us, I am confident that we are well positioned for just that kind of growth, long term."

I have a hard time believing your Engine margin target for 2010 and your Engine margin target for 2014 that you provided at your analyst day, given we haven't even really seen a huge recovery in volumes on the truck side, and I would assume some of the emerging markets or commodity markets sort of remain strong.

Warranty costs are 1.7% of sales in the first quarter. Our previous guidance, when the question came up three months ago, we said will be lying at 4% and now that's going to be closer to 3.5%, but they will increase. Commodity costs are going to be higher in the second half of the year. We still expect overall material costs to be favorable year-over-year but we already see much of that benefit in the first quarter.

But as we stand now, what I think we feel good about is, if you just compare this first quarter to fourth quarter, what you see is a continuation. It looks very dramatic compared to Q1, but compared to fourth quarter, what we said is we are doing a whole bunch of work in our plants, in our engineering areas, even in our overhead areas to try to improve productivity, keep costs down. So even in a relatively weak recessionary revenue environment, we can continue to improve margins. And I think that's what you really see in Q1.

Let me give broad answer and then we can follow-up with you with specific pieces of equipment. But I guess, what I want to say about Tier 4, both Interim and Tier 4, is that's another part of the overwhelming trend Tim talked about, about emissions spreading across the world. And Tier 4 Interim and final and their equivalents will affect both European and U.S. manufacturers in significant ways. And it's unlike the U.S. EPA thing we just went through, it's not going to be a cliff of that. There are requirements by horsepower range that begin to hit at different phases. There's also this complex TPAN [ph](45:07) arrangement, where people can sort of do fleet mixing and figure out how they want to deploy, which level of emissions. So we expect manufacturers to get on the bus, if you will, at different points in time and we are working with all our major OEMs on this. We've made announcements with Komatsu, for example, but many of the other OEMs are actually still figuring out exactly what they want to do and how they want to do. We are actively talking with all of them and we are, in fact, doing more than talking, we're working on the emissions releases with them. But they haven't announced there, so I don't want to get ahead of them on that. But in terms of specific product announcements, we can definitely get back to you on specific ones, and we announced BAMA [ph](45:47) for example, if there are any. But what you should expect from Cummins is, this is our strength. This is where we're good. We are good in emissions, both in terms of the engines and the components. We will see increased business as a result of Tier 4 Interim and final by the end and we will see expansion of OEM partnerships that we have as well as some new piece of equipment. But in terms of how it's going to play out between now and 2014, there's a lot of ground to cover and the OEMs are still doing a lot of planning about how they want to manage it."

I don't think there was significant share moves during the quarter, for example. Over time, our expectation is we will continue with the expand share in China primarily by, because we are entering now in the light commercial vehicle market, which is a new area for us. So we will continue to expand share in the truck market by entering into different parts of the market. But with regard to the primary truck market that we've been in for some time, there were not significant share movements and we really don't expect significant share movements in the near-term anyway. Over the long run, of course, we're trying to pursue with our customers gaining share, but I think it's not a short-term issue. And with India, I mentioned before, while the truck share movements are not so dramatic, what we have done is grown share with Tata. And really over last 18 months, I'd say, it's a better comparison period. We have increased the share of our engines in their trucks by making our engines more and more competitive from a cost point of view, as well as improving the quality of those engine. And they are finding that more and more customers are ready to pay a little bit more for engines with newer technology as the roads developed in India. That's the part of the thing that Tim talked about, as the infrastructure improves and wealth grows in those countries, their willingness to pay for technology is increasing. So I guess from a share point of view, that's driving up our share, but mostly as we think about our share at Tata. And then Brazil, which I did not mention yet, is again relatively leveled from a total market point of view. We are, with some leading customers there in Ford and Volkswagen MAN, where their share is about even but we're seeing very, very good volume as the market grows there. So really I think all of the quarter one stories are market stories but our position has grown over the years and remains strong."

So I think, the intent is to just to say that we think the engines are offering very good fuel economy improvements and we want to help customers realize those the maximum benefits so we did see those customer-specific as opposed to application-specific kind of improvement. So right now, there's too few out there to say which ones are going to see the best. I think the important technical point though, and with this SCR [Selective Catalytic Reduction], the copper zeolite that we're deploying, we see a very wide map that people can operate in and still capture this fuel economy benefit. That's been kind of a challenge for the industry before. You find a good fuel economy point but as soon as a different driver drives it or do a different road, they don't realize these fuel economy benefits. One of the real positive of this technology is the map they can operate in this wider and still get the benefit. So we think we're going to see more customers realizing the full benefit of the fuel economy with this technology, which again, we think as we kind of finish the deployment, the industry is really going to be pleased with what's out there.

I will start today by sharing some thoughts on our performance in the second quarter. Pat will then provide greater detail on the quarter and our updated 2010 outlook, and Tim will talk about our longer-term priorities. 
The second quarter was very strong in terms of our sales and even more importantly, our ability to convert those sales into profits. Sales of $3.2 billion were 32% higher than the same period in 2009. All four business segments reported significantly higher sales led by our Engine and Components segments, which increased by 45% each. 
Earnings before interest and taxes increased significantly from second quarter of 2009 to $401 million or 12.5% of sales. That compares to 4.5% of sales during the same period in 2009 and 10.7% of sales during our strong first quarter this year. For the first time, all four business segments reported quarterly EBIT above 10% of sales. 
Strong markets in China, India and Brazil continue to drive large sales increases as those economies have now fully recovered from the global recession and are growing robustly. Our sales growth in those countries was even better than we had anticipated for the second quarter, and we expect continued strong results from those markets in the second half of the year. 
As you know, our leadership in markets outside the U.S. has played a large role in our success in recent years. Our geographic diversification has reduced the impact of economic cycles on our business as evidenced by our performance in the current economic downturn. In addition, our growth rates have increased as a result of our strong position in the fastest-growing markets in the world. 
In the first half of this year, 64% of our consolidated sales have come from outside the U.S., the highest percentage ever. During that period, sales in China have increased 99% from the same period last year, while sales in India are up 45% and sales in Brazil have risen 94%. And as you know, our consolidated sales picture understates the true impact of our International business because of our joint ventures in countries such as China and India. JV sales in China were up 105% compared to the same period last year and 64% in India. 
Our Dongfeng Cummins joint venture produced a record 63,000 engines in the second quarter. It's expected to be a $1.3 billion business this year. The second major driver of our strong financial performance in the second quarter and really throughout the downturn has been improved productivity across our manufacturing operations worldwide. 
As we have highlighted in previous earnings calls, we worked very hard in the early days of the recession to quickly align capacity with real demand for our products. At the same time, we took advantage of the slowdown in volumes in the first half of last year to implement significant improvements in many of our manufacturing plants and our supply chain. That work has resulted in improving efficiency and allowed us to leverage higher engineering components demand to increase gross margins in both business units. We have also benefited from increased efficiencies in our Power Generation and Distribution businesses. 
Here are just a few examples of improved productivity in our manufacturing plants. Productivity, as measured in turbochargers produced per engine per day at our Huddersfield, England plant, in the second quarter was nearly double the rate from the same period last year. Using the same productivity measure, our turbocharger plants in Charleston, South Carolina, China and India all increased productivity between 20% and 25% compared to the second quarter of 2009. 
Our MidRange Engine business produced approximately the same number of engines in the second quarter as during the third quarter of 2008 with 900 fewer people. Our high-horsepower engine plant in Daventry, England has nearly tripled its daily output over the last five quarters, while we have doubled our output at our high-horsepower plant in Pune, India. Critical to those gains has been our work to coordinate the shared-supply base between these two plants. 
Also, despite the increased production, managing expenses at Daventry have been reduced by 20% since the peak of the last cycle in 2008. At our heavy-duty engine plant in Jamestown, New York, our direct labor cost per unit produced was flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 despite a 58% drop in volumes. Across our Power Generation business, generator set revenue per factory employee per day is up 28% from the same period in 2009. 
Now I will speak in detail about how each of these business segments performed during the quarter. But before I turn it over to him, I wanted to offer a few high-level of thoughts on our performance in each of the businesses.
The Components segment has turned the corner, is now placed to consistently deliver the kind of results that we have been telling you to expect from this business. Growth prospects are also very robust for this business unit. EBIT margin for this segment was at an all-time high during the second quarter. Our productivity improvement has taken hold more quickly than we had expected especially in the Turbocharger and Filtration businesses. We also are seeing volumes outside the U.S. return faster than we had anticipated and are beginning to see the impact of increased component content on our engines. 
Our Power Generation segment, which is a later-cycle business for us, seems to have bottomed out late in 2009 and has started to rebound. Compared to the same period last year, we experienced gains across all lines of business within the segment. In particular, demand for Commercial Products was much stronger in all four BRIC countries as well as generator set assemblers in the U.K. who export to emerging markets. 
Our Engine business had an outstanding quarter, reporting its best quarterly EBIT percentage ever. What makes the results even more impressive is the fact that the North American heavy-duty truck engine market remained soft in the second quarter as we projected. That weakness has been more than offset, however, by strong gains in many of our industrial markets as well as in medium-duty truck markets outside the U.S. and for engine parts and kits. 
Sales to the construction and mining industries outside the U.S. to medium-duty truck markets in Brazil and our DCEC joint venture in China was significantly better than the same period last year. We also saw a rebound in sales to Chrysler compared to last year when Chrysler stopped truck production for several weeks during its reorganization.
Our 2010 engine launch in North America has been very successful. We now have 14,000 new medium- and heavy-duty engines in the field, and they are performing extremely well and delivering the type of fuel economy improvements that we expected. 
Based on 60,000 hours of testing at our technical center and more than 5 million miles of customer fuel test, we're confident that our 2010 15-liter ISX engine operating with an SCR system is providing 5% to 6% better fuel economy over our EPA '07 engine. Also, we estimate that our new engine is 5% to 8% better than the 2010 EGR-only engine, even including the use of diesel emissions fluid in the SCR system. 
As I said, the new engines are performing well, and we are seeing orders start to pick up. For example, we already have more than 30 fleets who will each take delivery of at least 20 ISX15 engines in the third quarter. We've also heard from customers that are pleased with their new Cummins engine. One such customer is Frost Trucking located near Chattanooga. Frost regularly runs Cummins-powered Peterbilt trucks to and from the West Coast averaging 5,000 miles a week. The owner told us recently he already has two Cummins ISX engines with more than 65,000 miles on them. It makes me extremely happy with the overall performance and fuel economy of the new engine. In particular, Frost drivers have been very pleased with the improved acceleration and quieter ride as a result of using the new ISX15. 
The Distribution business continues to perform extremely well as it has throughout the downturn. Sales rose significantly from the same period last year, and the business produced EBIT margins in line with our expectations. 
We are pleased with how our performance has continued to improve despite the fact that some of our key product and geographic markets have yet to fully recover from the recession. As a result, we are increasing our guidance for 2010 to reflect that performance and our expectations for the rest of the year. We now expect to earn 12% EBIT on sales of $13 billion for 2010. 
I will now turn it over to Pat who will give you some additional details about the second quarter."
265253,78855783,69610,"Cummins Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-27-2010",2010-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Cummins Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter revenues of $3.2 billion were up 32% in the same quarter last year, with revenues in our international markets increasing by 51% led by stronger demand in China, India and Brazil, while sales in t",1617,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter revenues of $3.2 billion were up 32% in the same quarter last year, with revenues in our international markets increasing by 51% led by stronger demand in China, India and Brazil, while sales in the United States were up by 8%. 
Compared to the prior quarter, revenues were up 29% with similar growth across all major regions. The emerging markets continue to trend a sequential growth, while European and North American markets started to recover. Earnings before interest and taxes were 12.5% of sales in the quarter, significantly better than a year ago as well as last quarter's performance. In fact, this is the best EBIT percentage we have recorded over the last 25 years. 
The main reasons for the strong EBIT margin performance were the productivity improvements in our manufacturing plants just mentioned by Tom, increased demand for products across all four segments, lower material cost compared to last year and placing increases in certain markets, the record joint venture income particularly from engine joint ventures in China and India and lower warranty costs, earnings per share of $1.25 in the quarter. Now let me turn to each business and give you some details of their performance in the second quarter, as well as an update for 2010 revenue and profitability outlook for each of them.
Starting with the Engine segment. Revenues of $1.9 billion were up 45% from last year. Revenues to the on-highway markets grew 35% due to stronger demand in the RAM Pickup and Medium-Duty Truck segments, while shipments from North American heavy-duty truck engines were 38% below previous year levels. 
Revenues to off-highway industrial markets grew 49% year-over-year led by stronger demand in construction and in mining. Compared to the prior quarter, revenues increased 33%. Sales to on-highway markets were up 43%, with medium-duty truck and bus revenues up 63%, light-duty automotive and recreational vehicle revenues up 43% and heavy-duty truck sales up 35%. Industrial revenues were up 14% mainly due to strength in the construction, mining and oil and gas markets. 
Segment EBIT margin of 10.4% of sales this quarter improved significantly from the near breakeven level of a year ago. The improvement in EBIT margins was driven by the productivity improvements in our manufacturing plants and the benefit from increased volumes, stronger joint venture income, lower material costs, benefits from pricing actions and lower warranty costs. 
EBIT margins also increased from the relatively strong prior quarter mainly by leveraging on operating cost and higher sales. For the full year, we now expect Engine segment revenues to grow 25%. 
For heavy-duty trucks, we continue to forecast NAFTA truck production to grow 30% in 2010. However, Cummins revenues are expected to decline 11%, as the recovery in aftermarket and international markets will only partially offset the decline in engine shipments due to the EPA '10 transition. 
Revenues from the medium-duty truck and bus markets will be 12% higher this year. Strong demand in Brazil, the recovery of OEM truck production in Europe and market share increases in North America will more than offset the drop in engine demand in North America due to the EPA '10 transition. 
Light-duty automotive and recreational vehicle revenues are projected to grow 42% due to the RAM pickup truck recovery in North America and strong demand for Ford pickup trucks in Brazil. We are now forecasting industrial revenues to increase 55% this year with stronger demand from the mining, construction and oil and gas markets. 
As I mentioned in our previous call, our engine joint ventures are expected to perform at record levels of production this year. Our Dongfeng Cummins joint venture in China and our Tata Cummins joint venture in India were both earning at record levels in the second quarter. We now project full year Engine segment EBIT margins of 10% of sales, which imply profitability in the second half of the year will remain strong. 
The leverage from higher sales volumes in the second half will offset some of the challenges that we cited last quarter such as the production ramp up of new EPA '10 engines which initially will carry high warranty rates from higher research and development investment and the reinstatement of merit increases from rising commodity costs early in the quarter are now beginning to flow through our spending with suppliers and from the slowing of demand in China as a result of government efforts to control economic growth, although the amount of the slowdown was less severe than what we thought three months ago.
In the Components segment, revenues increased 45% from the prior year and 16% from the prior quarter. Both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter improvement in revenues were driven by strong orders from truck OEMs in China and India, global aftermarket demand improvements, production recovery from European truck OEMs and higher technology content on our EPA 2010 engines. 
EBIT margins of 10.3% of sales this quarter was a record for the segment and a significant improvement from the prior year as a result of operational improvements and volume leverage from higher sales. Profitability also improved from the strong first quarter performance due to the higher sales volume. 
For the full year, we are now forecasting revenues for the Components segment to increase 30% over 2009 levels. EBIT margins in the second half of the year will continue to improve, and full year EBIT margins are now expected to be 10% of sales. 
Revenues from the Power Generation segment were up 16% from last year as a result of stronger demand in Latin America, China and India. Compared to the fourth quarter, revenues were up 37% with recovery in most regions. Although we are beginning to see increase in orders in North America, second quarter sales from North America were down from the prior year and up almost slightly from the prior quarter. 
EBIT margins of 10.7% of sales improved both from the prior year and from the prior quarter. Year-over-year profitability was positively impacted by higher sales and productivity improvements, while improvement compared to last quarter was driven by sales growth and strong operating leverage. 
The outlook for the full year has also improved. We are seeing better order activity in all regions driven by data centers in North America and Western Europe and strong economic activity in Latin America and Asia, as well as some recovery in the Middle East and Russia. We now expect Power Generation revenues to grow 20% in 2010 and deliver full year EBIT margins of 10% of sales. 
And finally, the Distribution segment delivered another excellent quarter. Sales were up 24% from the prior year with a consolidation of the Western Canada distributor accounting for 13% of that growth. Compared to the prior quarter, revenues were up 21%. Most regions were up sequentially due to seasonality and recovery in demand for industrial engines in Europe and Power Generation in both Europe and the Middle East. 
EBIT margins were 12% of sales and were in line with prior year results. Profitability was also in line with the previous quarter if the onetime gain from the consolidation of the Western Canada distributor is excluded from the first quarter results. 
For the full year, we continue to forecast revenues to be up 25% with about half of that growth coming from the recent distributor consolidation. EBIT margins are now projected at 12.5% of sales.
As a result of the improved outlook for all four operating segments, we now expect the company to deliver $13 billion in revenue, up 20% from last year and EBIT margins of 12% of sales in 2010 compared to our previous guidance of $12 billion in revenue and 10% EBIT margins. 
While first half profitability levels have been very good, we expect profitability to improve further in the second half of the year. The leverage from higher sales volumes in the second half will offset some of the headwinds we expect to face over the next six months including the higher warranty rates as we ramp up production of new EPA '10 engines from higher research and development investment and the reinstatement of merit increases, some slowing of demand in China and from rising commodity cost in the quarter that are now coming through from our suppliers.
Now before I turn it over to Tim, let me say a few words about our balance sheet and cash flow and also reinforce what we said last quarter. Our cash position remains strong. In the first half of the year, we have reinvested $130 million back into the business in the form of working capital, particularly inventory as we respond to increasing demand for our products. We invested over $100 million in capital expenditure projects and software investments. We contributed over $150 million into our pension funds, and we have repurchased $162 million of common shares. 
For the remainder of the year, we expect further investment in working capital to support growth. Our capital investment plan remains at $400 million for the year, which means that spending will accelerate in the second half to support capacity expansion and new product introductions, and we will continue to return value to our shareholders through our stock repurchase program and sustainable growth in our dividend, as evidenced by the recent announcement to increase the dividend by 50%. 
Finally, we just completed the renegotiation of our revolving credit facility, which was due to expire next year. The new $1.2 billion facility extends through July 2014, and along with internal cash from the operations gives us adequate liquidity to meet the future growth needs of the company. 
Now before we address your questions, let me turn it over to Tim."

I want to start by adding just a few thoughts on our outstanding second quarter results. Our performance is the latest indication that our work to manage the business conservatively during the recession while continuing to invest in critical",1094,"Good morning. I want to start by adding just a few thoughts on our outstanding second quarter results. Our performance is the latest indication that our work to manage the business conservatively during the recession while continuing to invest in critical technologies has paid off. Our EBIT margin has improved from 2.8% in the fourth quarter of 2008 to 12.5% in the most recent quarter on similar level of sales. 
Our second quarter EBIT percentage was the best in more than 25 years. As you heard Tom discuss, our manufacturing plants around the world are working more efficiently than ever. I would add that Tom, Pat and I have visited manufacturing operations around the world over the past several months, and we can say they are all performing better now from a productivity standpoint than they did at the peak of the last economic cycle. As a result, we are earning very strong margins as our volumes start to return. We expect even better results as our U.S. and European markets continue to recover. 
In March, we shared our long-term growth projections, which calls for Cummins to be a $20 billion company that will earn 12% EBIT in 2014. Based on our current performance and our plans for the future, I have every reason to believe we will deliver on that commitment, perhaps even earlier than expected. 
As we look beyond 2010, we see significant growth opportunities across our businesses, and we are already started to plan to take advantage of those opportunities. For example, we are investing heavily in our High-Horsepower Engine business. We announced this month that we are investing $100 million in capital and another $200 million in R&D in our high-horsepower plant in Seymour, Indiana over the next five years. This will allow us to expand into even larger displacement engines that take advantage of long-term opportunities in markets such as oil and gas, mining and commercial marine, while helping customers in these markets meet future emission standards. 
We have started production for our second light-duty diesel engine in China at our Foton joint venture. Our forecast call for our Foton joint venture to generate more than $1 billion in revenue in 2014, making it the same size as our Dongfeng Cummins JV today. 
As emission standards tighten around the world, the demand for Cummins engine components will increase, both on our engines and on those engines produced by our customers and competitors. That type of growth can already be seen in our 2010 guidance for the Components segment, which is expected to grow faster than any other part of the company. We expect that to continue into the future as well. 
We also are increasing capacity for current products to meet growing demand in key international markets. For example, by the end of this year, we will have expanded capacity at our Tata Cummins Engine JV in India by 50% and have plans to expand future in 2011. 
We are strengthening our presence in newly emerging global markets such as Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, much as we did in the 1960s and 70s in China, India and Brazil. Africa, in particular, holds significant potential as the next large emerging market for Cummins. We already have manufacturing presence in South Africa, and we are strengthening our distribution network across the continent. Our leadership team has spent considerable time in Africa over the past year learning about the different markets for our products. 
These opportunities and others are consistent with the four key long-term trends that we expect to drive much of the growth over the next several years. I won't go into detail on each one again, but as a reminder, they are: One, the price and availability of energy, especially as it pertains to the power needs of newly emerging markets such as the Middle East and Africa; the second is more stringent emission standards around the world, which Cummins is uniquely positioned to meet and which provides us with competitive advantage; the third trend is increasing infrastructure spending around the world; and the fourth trend is the globalization of our business and continued growth in large international markets such as China, India and Brazil, where we already hold leadership positions. I also want to say just a few words to reinforce Tom's comments on our 2010 engine launch.
Just as we did in 2002 and 2007, we have met the new EPA emission requirements with products that have met our customer expectations. Our 2010 SCR engines are meeting fuel economy requirements and are performing to high standards on our customers' demand. We are already working toward the next big challenge in emissions, which is the regulation of carbon emissions expected midway through this decade. This translates into the need for fuel efficiency improvements of between 15% and 30% from today's standards. We expect SCR to be a part of the recipe that helps us achieve this type of improvement, but we're also exploring new technologies such as waste heat recovery systems that have considerable potential. In fact, Cummins and PACCAR are teaming up on a SuperTruck project to explore ways to improve fuel economy in heavy-duty trucks, which we see the large Department of Energy grant this year. This is just one way we are committed to working with our customers who will always have the final say over which products best meet their needs.
We work with some of the best companies in the world, and we recognize that to be successful, we need to care about our customers' success more than anyone else in the industry. Increasingly, we are using tools such as Six Sigma to help us better understand our customers' business, so we can fully leverage our skills to their benefit. 
Finally, I want to recognize the work of our people throughout the recession. Our employees around the world have done a terrific job staying focused on the job at hand, often succeeding under very challenging circumstances. Keeping the company strong over the past two years has required a lot of hard work and discipline from employees around the world. As our business continues to improve, we now are facing the challenge of taking that work ethic and discipline and applying it to the significant growth opportunities ahead of us. I am confident that we have the right people and leadership in place to take maximum advantage of these growth opportunities that will lead to a period of continued and sustained long-term growth. 
Thank you, and we'll now take your questions."

So certainly, really since the last quarter of '09, we've been in the process, and we got -- I think we were more ahead of it that we've been in previous recessions preparing our supply base. So for the large number of suppliers, we're feeling pretty good about where they are in terms of their ramp up. And certainly, in the Components segment, that's true. We are facing some constraints that have driven some temporary lengthening lead times, but we expect those to be resolved relatively shortly. And really, they are mostly around foundries and forges. Some of the foundries and forges are a little bit slower to ramp up. We've worked extensively with them to help them, make sure they can get capacity in place and most are doing a really good job on that and some are a little behind. But as a general matter, I'd say we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of ramping up the supply chain and see our way clear  to working that through 2011. I think it won't be too long from now before the worst part of the ramp up is behind us. The first part of turning the gas on is harder than making the next incremental steps."

We've met our expectations, with regard to fuel economy improvement, which is no small feat. We worked on those engines for four, five years. We worked on the SCR technology for a decade. We were able to get them launched at the fuel economy deltas we're hoping for, so we feel really, really good about that. This is always the period during a launch where the fuel economy stuff is kind of in up in the air because essentially, people that don't have roots that they are able to run and compare on, they have new tires, they have all these other confounding factors. We're, of course, all over it trying to figure out where we stand, trying to get as much data as we can. Our own view is that our 15-liter is going to compare on fuel economy very well to 13 liters. Some cases we expect to be better than a 13-liter, in other cases, maybe we'll be even, but we expect to compare quite favorably to 13. And I think the other point to make there is that you know a 15-liter offers other advantages besides just fuel, it also offers power and torque, which people will like for specific applications. And over the last decade, the number of customers that buy 15 versus 13 or smaller has grown, and a part of that is because the other performance factors, durability, reliability, resale, torque and power that the 15 offers. So our view is we'll be competitive with 13 and sometimes better, but we'll offer all those other advantages as well. But I guess the answer to your question will be sometime before we'll know exactly how we're doing against each engine, but we'll be checking. And we're making sure that customers are able to compare fairly because we think we'll do pretty well in those comparisons."

And really, although there's been a lot of focus recently on the euro and on the pound, year-over-year, when you look at the average for the second quarter of last year to the second quarter of this year, they haven't moved an awful lot. When you compare second quarter to the first quarter, our sales were negatively impacted by about $20 million in future currency movements, and that's all really the pound and the euro. The pound was down about 6% from what the average rate was in the first quarter, and the euro's down about 7%. The impact on the bottom line was negligible just given the mix of business that we do around the world."

Here's what, I guess, I'd like to say about that, because there's a lot of stuff out now, of course, about their press release and some of the other comments they're making about FCR technology. And if you wouldn't mind, I just want to say a few things about that. Well, none of them will surprise you, we've been talking about this for a while. But we've been working on FCR technology for about a decade and EGR technology for another five years before that. We used both technologies extensively, we have been for some time. We produced a lot of FCR engines and components in Europe, even prior to the 2010 launch. And now of course, we have quite a few in the field now operating, and they're working really well. The FCR technology is not only good but getting better as the improvements in technology we've seen for the zeolites, the catalysts themselves and then of course, the robustness of the system. So my own view is FCR technology is here to stay and will be in place for sometime, because it's going to help on the carbon requirements because of its improvements in fuel efficiency. So our view is that FCR is kind of doing everything we expected, and that's terrific and that doesn't surprise us. We spent thousands of hours of development and tens of millions of dollars making sure we had it right, and we feel good about that. I guess the second point I'd say is our products are doing really well. They met the standards that we expected with regard to fuel economy. And what's more is, in our typical launch, we'll continue to make improvements on the engine that we've launched from here. So we're already looking at ways to improve calibrations and other things to drive better than the 5% to 6% we've already seen. We'll continue to work on that. I'm confident we'll even improve that further. So all that stuff came out the way we expected. We will definitely be encouraging our customers and helping our customers run head-to-head in tests. We're doing our own tests to make sure that we're, relative to others, we're as good as we think we are, and we think we're going to be in a good position on those. And our customers, of course, will be the end judge of that, not press releases we put out or anybody else puts out. And so far, again, our feedback has been really good on that. We haven't had the opportunity to run head-to-head tests with Navistar engines. We just haven't been able to get one and put them together and do one. But over time, we'll compare with all competitors and we'll be able to talk to you about that, David (sic)[Ann]. Just now, we don't have those comparisons. And I feel very good about the position we're in. And I guess that's the way we're talking to our customers about it. I think a lot of those comments and press releases, frankly, are just kind of a distraction from what really matters, which is making sure we're meeting the emissions requirements, which we definitely are, and that we're meeting customer requirements on improving fuel economy, which we are. So I guess my general answer is, tech for tat [ph](48:02) with their press release is not our action. Our action is trying to help our customers succeed by selling better products."

There's some experience associated with this, is that when there's a diversion in technology and two companies or two groups of companies go certain ways and you're at the introduction phase, there can be aggressive claims. And the marketplace, including the analyst community, loves to see these kinds of disputes and fights. I can go back to the last one was the Caterpillar ACERT engine versus the EGR, and there was at least two or three years of debate and claims and studies and so for forth. And I think where Cummins' position is that we want to stay away from some of the behavior in the marketplace that isn't necessarily constructive. And I think what Tom's talking about and what I agree with is that you'll see over a period of time which technology prevails. And the fact that we've had as much experience as we've had, both in Europe and here, we're very, very confident, we're on the right path. And I think over six months, over a year, over a year and a half, the marketplace will determine which technology will prevail. And I agree with Tom, as I think, I like where we are and I like where the position is that we have with certain customers, and we're getting a lot of confirmation from the marketplace that we're on the right track.

And I think our market results were in very good condition there. I was in Europe with Dean six weeks ago, five or six weeks ago, at a time where there was probably most concern about the euro. Back then, the euro was down at $1.20, $1.22, and everyone was getting a little bit nervous about. The euro was back to close to $1.30 now, which is actually better than what the 10-year average, and we've done pretty well over the last 10 years. My sense of the European markets, we're definitely starting to see them come back. We expressed some of that in our remarks with the truck market, in particular. And supporting the Engine segment, our Component segment coming back strongly. We'll see an increased demand in Power Gen. And our Distribution business has seen an uptick in demand industrial engines too. I don't have a skeptical outlook for Europe as some of the experts do. So obviously, they're far more expert in this than I am. But when I talk to people over there, I think Europe's going to be okay. It's not going to be as much difficult as a think, some people are speculating a number of months ago. You're not going to see significant growth rates in Europe, but I do expect to see somewhere between 1% to 2% over the next couple of years as we go forward."

I will start today by sharing some thoughts on our performance in the second quarter. Pat will then provide greater detail on the quarter and our updated 2010 outlook, and Tim will talk about our longer-term priorities. 
The second quarter was very strong in terms of our sales and even more importantly, our ability to convert those sales into profits. Sales of $3.2 billion were 32% higher than the same period in 2009. All four business segments reported significantly higher sales led by our Engine and Components segments, which increased by 45% each. 
Earnings before interest and taxes increased significantly from second quarter of 2009 to $401 million or 12.5% of sales. That compares to 4.5% of sales during the same period in 2009 and 10.7% of sales during our strong first quarter this year. For the first time, all four business segments reported quarterly EBIT above 10% of sales. 
Strong markets in China, India and Brazil continue to drive large sales increases as those economies have now fully recovered from the global recession and are growing robustly. Our sales growth in those countries was even better than we had anticipated for the second quarter, and we expect continued strong results from those markets in the second half of the year. 
As you know, our leadership in markets outside the U.S. has played a large role in our success in recent years. Our geographic diversification has reduced the impact of economic cycles on our business as evidenced by our performance in the current economic downturn. In addition, our growth rates have increased as a result of our strong position in the fastest-growing markets in the world. 
In the first half of this year, 64% of our consolidated sales have come from outside the U.S., the highest percentage ever. During that period, sales in China have increased 99% from the same period last year, while sales in India are up 45% and sales in Brazil have risen 94%. And as you know, our consolidated sales picture understates the true impact of our International business because of our joint ventures in countries such as China and India. JV sales in China were up 105% compared to the same period last year and 64% in India. 
Our Dongfeng Cummins joint venture produced a record 63,000 engines in the second quarter. It's expected to be a $1.3 billion business this year. The second major driver of our strong financial performance in the second quarter and really throughout the downturn has been improved productivity across our manufacturing operations worldwide. 
As we have highlighted in previous earnings calls, we worked very hard in the early days of the recession to quickly align capacity with real demand for our products. At the same time, we took advantage of the slowdown in volumes in the first half of last year to implement significant improvements in many of our manufacturing plants and our supply chain. That work has resulted in improving efficiency and allowed us to leverage higher engineering components demand to increase gross margins in both business units. We have also benefited from increased efficiencies in our Power Generation and Distribution businesses. 
Here are just a few examples of improved productivity in our manufacturing plants. Productivity, as measured in turbochargers produced per engine per day at our Huddersfield, England plant, in the second quarter was nearly double the rate from the same period last year. Using the same productivity measure, our turbocharger plants in Charleston, South Carolina, China and India all increased productivity between 20% and 25% compared to the second quarter of 2009. 
Our MidRange Engine business produced approximately the same number of engines in the second quarter as during the third quarter of 2008 with 900 fewer people. Our high-horsepower engine plant in Daventry, England has nearly tripled its daily output over the last five quarters, while we have doubled our output at our high-horsepower plant in Pune, India. Critical to those gains has been our work to coordinate the shared-supply base between these two plants. 
Also, despite the increased production, managing expenses at Daventry have been reduced by 20% since the peak of the last cycle in 2008. At our heavy-duty engine plant in Jamestown, New York, our direct labor cost per unit produced was flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 despite a 58% drop in volumes. Across our Power Generation business, generator set revenue per factory employee per day is up 28% from the same period in 2009. 
Now I will speak in detail about how each of these business segments performed during the quarter. But before I turn it over to him, I wanted to offer a few high-level of thoughts on our performance in each of the businesses.
The Components segment has turned the corner, is now placed to consistently deliver the kind of results that we have been telling you to expect from this business. Growth prospects are also very robust for this business unit. EBIT margin for this segment was at an all-time high during the second quarter. Our productivity improvement has taken hold more quickly than we had expected especially in the Turbocharger and Filtration businesses. We also are seeing volumes outside the U.S. return faster than we had anticipated and are beginning to see the impact of increased component content on our engines. 
Our Power Generation segment, which is a later-cycle business for us, seems to have bottomed out late in 2009 and has started to rebound. Compared to the same period last year, we experienced gains across all lines of business within the segment. In particular, demand for Commercial Products was much stronger in all four BRIC countries as well as generator set assemblers in the U.K. who export to emerging markets. 
Our Engine business had an outstanding quarter, reporting its best quarterly EBIT percentage ever. What makes the results even more impressive is the fact that the North American heavy-duty truck engine market remained soft in the second quarter as we projected. That weakness has been more than offset, however, by strong gains in many of our industrial markets as well as in medium-duty truck markets outside the U.S. and for engine parts and kits. 
Sales to the construction and mining industries outside the U.S. to medium-duty truck markets in Brazil and our DCEC joint venture in China was significantly better than the same period last year. We also saw a rebound in sales to Chrysler compared to last year when Chrysler stopped truck production for several weeks during its reorganization.
Our 2010 engine launch in North America has been very successful. We now have 14,000 new medium- and heavy-duty engines in the field, and they are performing extremely well and delivering the type of fuel economy improvements that we expected. 
Based on 60,000 hours of testing at our technical center and more than 5 million miles of customer fuel test, we're confident that our 2010 15-liter ISX engine operating with an SCR system is providing 5% to 6% better fuel economy over our EPA '07 engine. Also, we estimate that our new engine is 5% to 8% better than the 2010 EGR-only engine, even including the use of diesel emissions fluid in the SCR system. 
As I said, the new engines are performing well, and we are seeing orders start to pick up. For example, we already have more than 30 fleets who will each take delivery of at least 20 ISX15 engines in the third quarter. We've also heard from customers that are pleased with their new Cummins engine. One such customer is Frost Trucking located near Chattanooga. Frost regularly runs Cummins-powered Peterbilt trucks to and from the West Coast averaging 5,000 miles a week. The owner told us recently he already has two Cummins ISX engines with more than 65,000 miles on them. It makes me extremely happy with the overall performance and fuel economy of the new engine. In particular, Frost drivers have been very pleased with the improved acceleration and quieter ride as a result of using the new ISX15. 
The Distribution business continues to perform extremely well as it has throughout the downturn. Sales rose significantly from the same period last year, and the business produced EBIT margins in line with our expectations. 
We are pleased with how our performance has continued to improve despite the fact that some of our key product and geographic markets have yet to fully recover from the recession. As a result, we are increasing our guidance for 2010 to reflect that performance and our expectations for the rest of the year. We now expect to earn 12% EBIT on sales of $13 billion for 2010. 
I will now turn it over to Pat who will give you some additional details about the second quarter.

Second quarter revenues of $3.2 billion were up 32% in the same quarter last year, with revenues in our international markets increasing by 51% led by stronger demand in China, India and Brazil, while sales in the United States were up by 8%. 
Compared to the prior quarter, revenues were up 29% with similar growth across all major regions. The emerging markets continue to trend a sequential growth, while European and North American markets started to recover. Earnings before interest and taxes were 12.5% of sales in the quarter, significantly better than a year ago as well as last quarter's performance. In fact, this is the best EBIT percentage we have recorded over the last 25 years. 
The main reasons for the strong EBIT margin performance were the productivity improvements in our manufacturing plants just mentioned by Tom, increased demand for products across all four segments, lower material cost compared to last year and placing increases in certain markets, the record joint venture income particularly from engine joint ventures in China and India and lower warranty costs, earnings per share of $1.25 in the quarter. Now let me turn to each business and give you some details of their performance in the second quarter, as well as an update for 2010 revenue and profitability outlook for each of them.
Starting with the Engine segment. Revenues of $1.9 billion were up 45% from last year. Revenues to the on-highway markets grew 35% due to stronger demand in the RAM Pickup and Medium-Duty Truck segments, while shipments from North American heavy-duty truck engines were 38% below previous year levels. 
Revenues to off-highway industrial markets grew 49% year-over-year led by stronger demand in construction and in mining. Compared to the prior quarter, revenues increased 33%. Sales to on-highway markets were up 43%, with medium-duty truck and bus revenues up 63%, light-duty automotive and recreational vehicle revenues up 43% and heavy-duty truck sales up 35%. Industrial revenues were up 14% mainly due to strength in the construction, mining and oil and gas markets. 
Segment EBIT margin of 10.4% of sales this quarter improved significantly from the near breakeven level of a year ago. The improvement in EBIT margins was driven by the productivity improvements in our manufacturing plants and the benefit from increased volumes, stronger joint venture income, lower material costs, benefits from pricing actions and lower warranty costs. 
EBIT margins also increased from the relatively strong prior quarter mainly by leveraging on operating cost and higher sales. For the full year, we now expect Engine segment revenues to grow 25%. 
For heavy-duty trucks, we continue to forecast NAFTA truck production to grow 30% in 2010. However, Cummins revenues are expected to decline 11%, as the recovery in aftermarket and international markets will only partially offset the decline in engine shipments due to the EPA '10 transition. 
Revenues from the medium-duty truck and bus markets will be 12% higher this year. Strong demand in Brazil, the recovery of OEM truck production in Europe and market share increases in North America will more than offset the drop in engine demand in North America due to the EPA '10 transition. 
Light-duty automotive and recreational vehicle revenues are projected to grow 42% due to the RAM pickup truck recovery in North America and strong demand for Ford pickup trucks in Brazil. We are now forecasting industrial revenues to increase 55% this year with stronger demand from the mining, construction and oil and gas markets. 
As I mentioned in our previous call, our engine joint ventures are expected to perform at record levels of production this year. Our Dongfeng Cummins joint venture in China and our Tata Cummins joint venture in India were both earning at record levels in the second quarter. We now project full year Engine segment EBIT margins of 10% of sales, which imply profitability in the second half of the year will remain strong. 
The leverage from higher sales volumes in the second half will offset some of the challenges that we cited last quarter such as the production ramp up of new EPA '10 engines which initially will carry high warranty rates from higher research and development investment and the reinstatement of merit increases from rising commodity costs early in the quarter are now beginning to flow through our spending with suppliers and from the slowing of demand in China as a result of government efforts to control economic growth, although the amount of the slowdown was less severe than what we thought three months ago.
In the Components segment, revenues increased 45% from the prior year and 16% from the prior quarter. Both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter improvement in revenues were driven by strong orders from truck OEMs in China and India, global aftermarket demand improvements, production recovery from European truck OEMs and higher technology content on our EPA 2010 engines. 
EBIT margins of 10.3% of sales this quarter was a record for the segment and a significant improvement from the prior year as a result of operational improvements and volume leverage from higher sales. Profitability also improved from the strong first quarter performance due to the higher sales volume. 
For the full year, we are now forecasting revenues for the Components segment to increase 30% over 2009 levels. EBIT margins in the second half of the year will continue to improve, and full year EBIT margins are now expected to be 10% of sales. 
Revenues from the Power Generation segment were up 16% from last year as a result of stronger demand in Latin America, China and India. Compared to the fourth quarter, revenues were up 37% with recovery in most regions. Although we are beginning to see increase in orders in North America, second quarter sales from North America were down from the prior year and up almost slightly from the prior quarter. 
EBIT margins of 10.7% of sales improved both from the prior year and from the prior quarter. Year-over-year profitability was positively impacted by higher sales and productivity improvements, while improvement compared to last quarter was driven by sales growth and strong operating leverage. 
The outlook for the full year has also improved. We are seeing better order activity in all regions driven by data centers in North America and Western Europe and strong economic activity in Latin America and Asia, as well as some recovery in the Middle East and Russia. We now expect Power Generation revenues to grow 20% in 2010 and deliver full year EBIT margins of 10% of sales. 
And finally, the Distribution segment delivered another excellent quarter. Sales were up 24% from the prior year with a consolidation of the Western Canada distributor accounting for 13% of that growth. Compared to the prior quarter, revenues were up 21%. Most regions were up sequentially due to seasonality and recovery in demand for industrial engines in Europe and Power Generation in both Europe and the Middle East. 
EBIT margins were 12% of sales and were in line with prior year results. Profitability was also in line with the previous quarter if the onetime gain from the consolidation of the Western Canada distributor is excluded from the first quarter results. 
For the full year, we continue to forecast revenues to be up 25% with about half of that growth coming from the recent distributor consolidation. EBIT margins are now projected at 12.5% of sales.
As a result of the improved outlook for all four operating segments, we now expect the company to deliver $13 billion in revenue, up 20% from last year and EBIT margins of 12% of sales in 2010 compared to our previous guidance of $12 billion in revenue and 10% EBIT margins. 
While first half profitability levels have been very good, we expect profitability to improve further in the second half of the year. The leverage from higher sales volumes in the second half will offset some of the headwinds we expect to face over the next six months including the higher warranty rates as we ramp up production of new EPA '10 engines from higher research and development investment and the reinstatement of merit increases, some slowing of demand in China and from rising commodity cost in the quarter that are now coming through from our suppliers.
Now before I turn it over to Tim, let me say a few words about our balance sheet and cash flow and also reinforce what we said last quarter. Our cash position remains strong. In the first half of the year, we have reinvested $130 million back into the business in the form of working capital, particularly inventory as we respond to increasing demand for our products. We invested over $100 million in capital expenditure projects and software investments. We contributed over $150 million into our pension funds, and we have repurchased $162 million of common shares. 
For the remainder of the year, we expect further investment in working capital to support growth. Our capital investment plan remains at $400 million for the year, which means that spending will accelerate in the second half to support capacity expansion and new product introductions, and we will continue to return value to our shareholders through our stock repurchase program and sustainable growth in our dividend, as evidenced by the recent announcement to increase the dividend by 50%. 
Finally, we just completed the renegotiation of our revolving credit facility, which was due to expire next year. The new $1.2 billion facility extends through July 2014, and along with internal cash from the operations gives us adequate liquidity to meet the future growth needs of the company. 
Now before we address your questions, let me turn it over to Tim.

I want to start by adding just a few thoughts on our outstanding second quarter results. Our performance is the latest indication that our work to manage the business conservatively during the recession while continuing to invest in critical technologies has paid off. Our EBIT margin has improved from 2.8% in the fourth quarter of 2008 to 12.5% in the most recent quarter on similar level of sales. 
Our second quarter EBIT percentage was the best in more than 25 years. As you heard Tom discuss, our manufacturing plants around the world are working more efficiently than ever. I would add that Tom, Pat and I have visited manufacturing operations around the world over the past several months, and we can say they are all performing better now from a productivity standpoint than they did at the peak of the last economic cycle. As a result, we are earning very strong margins as our volumes start to return. We expect even better results as our U.S. and European markets continue to recover. 
In March, we shared our long-term growth projections, which calls for Cummins to be a $20 billion company that will earn 12% EBIT in 2014. Based on our current performance and our plans for the future, I have every reason to believe we will deliver on that commitment, perhaps even earlier than expected. 
As we look beyond 2010, we see significant growth opportunities across our businesses, and we are already started to plan to take advantage of those opportunities. For example, we are investing heavily in our High-Horsepower Engine business. We announced this month that we are investing $100 million in capital and another $200 million in R&D in our high-horsepower plant in Seymour, Indiana over the next five years. This will allow us to expand into even larger displacement engines that take advantage of long-term opportunities in markets such as oil and gas, mining and commercial marine, while helping customers in these markets meet future emission standards. 
We have started production for our second light-duty diesel engine in China at our Foton joint venture. Our forecast call for our Foton joint venture to generate more than $1 billion in revenue in 2014, making it the same size as our Dongfeng Cummins JV today. 
As emission standards tighten around the world, the demand for Cummins engine components will increase, both on our engines and on those engines produced by our customers and competitors. That type of growth can already be seen in our 2010 guidance for the Components segment, which is expected to grow faster than any other part of the company. We expect that to continue into the future as well. 
We also are increasing capacity for current products to meet growing demand in key international markets. For example, by the end of this year, we will have expanded capacity at our Tata Cummins Engine JV in India by 50% and have plans to expand future in 2011. 
We are strengthening our presence in newly emerging global markets such as Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, much as we did in the 1960s and 70s in China, India and Brazil. Africa, in particular, holds significant potential as the next large emerging market for Cummins. We already have manufacturing presence in South Africa, and we are strengthening our distribution network across the continent. Our leadership team has spent considerable time in Africa over the past year learning about the different markets for our products. 
These opportunities and others are consistent with the four key long-term trends that we expect to drive much of the growth over the next several years. I won't go into detail on each one again, but as a reminder, they are: One, the price and availability of energy, especially as it pertains to the power needs of newly emerging markets such as the Middle East and Africa; the second is more stringent emission standards around the world, which Cummins is uniquely positioned to meet and which provides us with competitive advantage; the third trend is increasing infrastructure spending around the world; and the fourth trend is the globalization of our business and continued growth in large international markets such as China, India and Brazil, where we already hold leadership positions. I also want to say just a few words to reinforce Tom's comments on our 2010 engine launch.
Just as we did in 2002 and 2007, we have met the new EPA emission requirements with products that have met our customer expectations. Our 2010 SCR engines are meeting fuel economy requirements and are performing to high standards on our customers' demand. We are already working toward the next big challenge in emissions, which is the regulation of carbon emissions expected midway through this decade. This translates into the need for fuel efficiency improvements of between 15% and 30% from today's standards. We expect SCR to be a part of the recipe that helps us achieve this type of improvement, but we're also exploring new technologies such as waste heat recovery systems that have considerable potential. In fact, Cummins and PACCAR are teaming up on a SuperTruck project to explore ways to improve fuel economy in heavy-duty trucks, which we see the large Department of Energy grant this year. This is just one way we are committed to working with our customers who will always have the final say over which products best meet their needs.
We work with some of the best companies in the world, and we recognize that to be successful, we need to care about our customers' success more than anyone else in the industry. Increasingly, we are using tools such as Six Sigma to help us better understand our customers' business, so we can fully leverage our skills to their benefit. 
Finally, I want to recognize the work of our people throughout the recession. Our employees around the world have done a terrific job staying focused on the job at hand, often succeeding under very challenging circumstances. Keeping the company strong over the past two years has required a lot of hard work and discipline from employees around the world. As our business continues to improve, we now are facing the challenge of taking that work ethic and discipline and applying it to the significant growth opportunities ahead of us. I am confident that we have the right people and leadership in place to take maximum advantage of these growth opportunities that will lead to a period of continued and sustained long-term growth. 
Thank you, and we'll now take your questions.

So certainly, really since the last quarter of '09, we've been in the process, and we got -- I think we were more ahead of it that we've been in previous recessions preparing our supply base. So for the large number of suppliers, we're feeling pretty good about where they are in terms of their ramp up. And certainly, in the Components segment, that's true. We are facing some constraints that have driven some temporary lengthening lead times, but we expect those to be resolved relatively shortly. And really, they are mostly around foundries and forges. Some of the foundries and forges are a little bit slower to ramp up. We've worked extensively with them to help them, make sure they can get capacity in place and most are doing a really good job on that and some are a little behind. But as a general matter, I'd say we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of ramping up the supply chain and see our way clear  to working that through 2011. I think it won't be too long from now before the worst part of the ramp up is behind us. The first part of turning the gas on is harder than making the next incremental steps.

We've met our expectations, with regard to fuel economy improvement, which is no small feat. We worked on those engines for four, five years. We worked on the SCR technology for a decade. We were able to get them launched at the fuel economy deltas we're hoping for, so we feel really, really good about that. This is always the period during a launch where the fuel economy stuff is kind of in up in the air because essentially, people that don't have roots that they are able to run and compare on, they have new tires, they have all these other confounding factors. We're, of course, all over it trying to figure out where we stand, trying to get as much data as we can. Our own view is that our 15-liter is going to compare on fuel economy very well to 13 liters. Some cases we expect to be better than a 13-liter, in other cases, maybe we'll be even, but we expect to compare quite favorably to 13. And I think the other point to make there is that you know a 15-liter offers other advantages besides just fuel, it also offers power and torque, which people will like for specific applications. And over the last decade, the number of customers that buy 15 versus 13 or smaller has grown, and a part of that is because the other performance factors, durability, reliability, resale, torque and power that the 15 offers. So our view is we'll be competitive with 13 and sometimes better, but we'll offer all those other advantages as well. But I guess the answer to your question will be sometime before we'll know exactly how we're doing against each engine, but we'll be checking. And we're making sure that customers are able to compare fairly because we think we'll do pretty well in those comparisons.

But year-over-year, Q2 to Q3, at a higher-level, had about a $68 million, $65 million favorable impact on sales, just under 3% of a tailwind I guess on sales. And the bottom line, it was about a $25 million benefit, that would include some remeasurement improvement from last year when we took a hit in the second quarter of last year. Then the currencies that we paid most attention to are the pound, the euro, the Australian dollar, the Brazilian real and the Indian rupee. And when you compare the second quarter of this year to the second quarter of last year, the Aussie dollar's up 20%, real in Brazil's up 23%, the rupee's up 8%. And really, although there's been a lot of focus recently on the euro and on the pound, year-over-year, when you look at the average for the second quarter of last year to the second quarter of this year, they haven't moved an awful lot. When you compare second quarter to the first quarter, our sales were negatively impacted by about $20 million in future currency movements, and that's all really the pound and the euro. The pound was down about 6% from what the average rate was in the first quarter, and the euro's down about 7%.

Here's what, I guess, I'd like to say about that, because there's a lot of stuff out now, of course, about their press release and some of the other comments they're making about FCR technology. And if you wouldn't mind, I just want to say a few things about that. Well, none of them will surprise you, we've been talking about this for a while. But we've been working on FCR technology for about a decade and EGR technology for another five years before that. We used both technologies extensively, we have been for some time. We produced a lot of FCR engines and components in Europe, even prior to the 2010 launch. And now of course, we have quite a few in the field now operating, and they're working really well. The FCR technology is not only good but getting better as the improvements in technology we've seen for the zeolites, the catalysts themselves and then of course, the robustness of the system. So my own view is FCR technology is here to stay and will be in place for sometime, because it's going to help on the carbon requirements because of its improvements in fuel efficiency. So our view is that FCR is kind of doing everything we expected, and that's terrific and that doesn't surprise us. We spent thousands of hours of development and tens of millions of dollars making sure we had it right, and we feel good about that. I guess the second point I'd say is our products are doing really well. They met the standards that we expected with regard to fuel economy. And what's more is, in our typical launch, we'll continue to make improvements on the engine that we've launched from here. So we're already looking at ways to improve calibrations and other things to drive better than the 5% to 6% we've already seen. We'll continue to work on that. I'm confident we'll even improve that further. So all that stuff came out the way we expected. We will definitely be encouraging our customers and helping our customers run head-to-head in tests. We're doing our own tests to make sure that we're, relative to others, we're as good as we think we are, and we think we're going to be in a good position on those. And our customers, of course, will be the end judge of that, not press releases we put out or anybody else puts out. And so far, again, our feedback has been really good on that. We haven't had the opportunity to run head-to-head tests with Navistar engines. We just haven't been able to get one and put them together and do one. But over time, we'll compare with all competitors and we'll be able to talk to you about that, David (sic)[Ann]. Just now, we don't have those comparisons. And I feel very good about the position we're in. And I guess that's the way we're talking to our customers about it. I think a lot of those comments and press releases, frankly, are just kind of a distraction from what really matters, which is making sure we're meeting the emissions requirements, which we definitely are, and that we're meeting customer requirements on improving fuel economy, which we are. So I guess my general answer is, tech for tat [ph](48:02) with their press release is not our action. Our action is trying to help our customers succeed by selling better products.

There's some experience associated with this, is that when there's a diversion in technology and two companies or two groups of companies go certain ways and you're at the introduction phase, there can be aggressive claims. And the marketplace, including the analyst community, loves to see these kinds of disputes and fights. I can go back to the last one was the Caterpillar ACERT engine versus the EGR, and there was at least two or three years of debate and claims and studies and so for forth. And I think where Cummins' position is that we want to stay away from some of the behavior in the marketplace that isn't necessarily constructive. And I think what Tom's talking about and what I agree with is that you'll see over a period of time which technology prevails. And the fact that we've had as much experience as we've had, both in Europe and here, we're very, very confident, we're on the right path. And I think over six months, over a year, over a year and a half, the marketplace will determine which technology will prevail. And I agree with Tom, as I think, I like where we are and I like where the position is that we have with certain customers, and we're getting a lot of confirmation from the marketplace that we're on the right track.

And I'm thinking the second half of the year is going to be just under 4%. So it's going to increase as more of our EPA '10 engines come in. Again, keep in mind the comments I made initially in the first number of quarters, in particular, after we launched the engine, we will occur higher rates. We started the year off indicating there's going to be close to 4% this year. And now I think we're going to be much closer to 3% given the performance of our engines and products are out there in the field already. But the floor question, rates are going to increase in the second of the year and probably stay high through most of 2011.

You can expect us to try to make steady headway towards what our long-term objectives are for 2014 and 2015 from here, and we're ahead of the game in nearly every segment towards where we're headed. So I think as you get to talk about 2011 now, there's more variables than we could we can really address. So what I'd say is, we're going to continue to make steady progress. We'll have mix issues, we'll have growth in different regions, all those will affect the mix.

What's going on in Power Gen is that sales in the Brit countries, as I mentioned, are ramping up more quickly than we expected in-line with general economic recovery in those areas, especially in large units. We've seen a lot of large unit demand in those regions. In addition, there's a bunch of other -- we're selling components in the Gen side business to other assemblers who are shipped, we think, mostly into those regions, both those are happening. The second factor that's affecting the second half is that we're seeing order rates pickup for the U.S. So they're not -- shipment rates haven't picked up so much, but order rates have, mostly for shipment in the second half, which is a good sign. I mean, that's kind of the first we're seeing, really. The U.S. may be starting to come back to some reasonable level, not to its speak, but back to some level that's a good deal. On the industrial side, really, throughout this year, we've been pleasantly surprised by the strength of the industrial markets. We talked about mining already, construction and again, in mostly, in the construction markets and those markets that we've been talking about, Brazil, India, China just really taking off for construction equipment. So all that is really what's driving that. Tier 4 interim, which will be a driver for our technology for increased content for our components, the pre-buy concept there is it's not really a big driver for volumes this year.

Our company and others in our industry contributed to developing those rules for some time. First, they have to stand for at least three years and there's a comment period before that, and even before that, all the measurement technologies out there. So again, really interesting point is that 2010 emission standards are a huge win for the environment. And these are -- is a massive reduction in air pollutants that's achieved in this 2010. And it turns out now with darn good products, products that work, that have good fuel economy, and it's a great win for the industry and the environment and took a lot of work. And what I'd say is, that these are kind of tweaks that people are talking about, but in fact, the rules were set for many years. And so they're kind of after-the-fact debates about the rules. And anybody -- is we're fine if there are some adjustment to them. I think our engines are ready to do it. But it is kind of looking backwards at a process that took, remember, five plus years to develop and is a huge achievement by the industry. So again, we're just feeling really good about where we are. We think the rules are sound and measurable on a good place. And so, we'll react and obviously participate in any process that's there, but we're already feeling pretty good about where the engines are.

Let me start with China, since there is some concern, now that I think is they just -- how severe the slowdown is going to be. It's certainly not shaping up and if, and like what we thought three months ago. Three months ago, you'll recall, I gave guidance that total revenues in China were going to be in the range of $2.6 billion or $2.7 billion for the company, and now we're revising up to north of $3 billion. So not only are the markets improving in China but we're getting market share pretty much in every segment that we participate in there. And although the growth rate is going to come down from 10% to 11%, it's going to bottom out 8% to 9% which is still pretty attractive to us. And I don't see any slowdown on our performance and our growth in China as we look forward over the next two or three years. Same story in India, business is growing very nicely. I think we're going to be close to $1.9 billion total revenue this year when you include the joint ventures, which is up about 45%, 48% from a year ago. And all the macroeconomic factors, the government actions that are in infrastructure investment continue to make India a very attractive growth market for us. And I think our market results were in very good condition there. I was in Europe with Dean six weeks ago, five or six weeks ago, at a time where there was probably most concern about the euro. Back then, the euro was down at $1.20, $1.22, and everyone was getting a little bit nervous about. The euro was back to close to $1.30 now, which is actually better than what the 10-year average, and we've done pretty well over the last 10 years. My sense of the European markets, we're definitely starting to see them come back. We expressed some of that in our remarks with the truck market, in particular. And supporting the Engine segment, our Component segment coming back strongly. We'll see an increased demand in Power Gen. And our Distribution business has seen an uptick in demand industrial engines too. I don't have a skeptical outlook for Europe as some of the experts do. So obviously, they're far more expert in this than I am. But when I talk to people over there, I think Europe's going to be okay. It's not going to be as much difficult as a think, some people are speculating a number of months ago. You're not going to see significant growth rates in Europe, but I do expect to see somewhere between 1% to 2% over the next couple of years as we go forward.

Obviously, just the growth with the economy, there's been a lot of infrastructure development that's helping to fuel some of the construction.

That compares to 7% of sales, excluding restructuring charges, during the same period in 2009.
To further illustrate our improved profitability, consider that in the second and third quarters of this year, we produced the same EBIT as we did during the second and third quarters of 2008 at the height of our business before the recession on $1 billion lower in sales. 
Our Engine business reported record quarterly EBIT of 10.8% of sales despite continued weakness in the North American truck market. The Power Generation business has rebounded strongly from its low point of the downturn during the third quarter last year and matched its best-ever quarterly EBIT percentage at 12.3%. Our Distribution businesses set a quarterly record by earning EBIT of $74 million. And our Components group continued to perform well during the quarter as EBIT doubled from the same period in 2009.
As has been the case all year, strong markets in China, India and Brazil continues to drive large sales increases in the third quarter. Consolidated sales in China rose 72% from the third quarter of last year, while sales in Brazil increased 90%, and sales in India were up 49%. Overall, sales outside the U.S. increased 56% from the same period last year, accounting for 63% of our total consolidated revenues in the quarter.
For example, international sales of engines to the industrial markets increased 96% compared to the same quarter last year, led by sharply higher demand for construction engines in emerging markets. Sales to the mining market doubled in the third quarter, due to stronger demand for coal and other commodities. And Power Generation sales to international markets increased 65% compared to last year. Many of our U.S. markets remain weak as a result of the slow recovery in the U.S. economy. We are well positioned for the recovery in these markets but don't expect to see any meaningful improvement until 2011.
While we're on the topic of our U.S. business, I want to provide an update on our 2010 engine launch, which continues to go extremely well. To the end of September, we have shipped nearly 37,000 medium- and heavy-duty engines to North American truck and bus customers equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction aftertreatment devices. The feedback we have received from our customers has been very positive and confirms that the new engines are performing as expected in terms of both reliability and fuel economy. Many of our heavy-duty customers say they are experiencing a 5% to 6% improvement in fuel economy compared to our EPA 2007 engines, with some reporting even greater improvement.
More than ever, we are confident that SCR is the right choice to meet current and future emission standards in this market while helping us to achieve the fuel economy our customers demand. In addition to our leadership positions in several growing international markets, we continue to benefit from our efforts to become low-cost producer around the world. We have talked in recent quarters about productivity improvements in our manufacturing operations, which have allowed us to respond quickly to demand fluctuations, to gain market share and to improve our profitability. Today, I want to share a few thoughts about a broad effort we have launched to strengthen our global supply chain. 
The growth we have seen in recent years has made us a stronger company but has also significantly increased the complexity of our global supply chain. Our ability to become the low-cost producer in our industry will depend to a great degree on the competitiveness of our supply chain. We have been studying ways to manage our global supply chains to that it better meets our customers' needs for responsiveness at a lower cost.
As an important next step in that process, we have created a new senior leadership role to direct our global supply chain work, reporting directly to me. Lisa Yoder, a long-time operations and supply chain leader at Cummins, will lead a multi-year initiative that will focus on improving the performance of all elements of our supply chain, including cost, lead time, reliability, responsiveness and optimizing flows from different supply points. Part of the answer to achieving these improvements is integration and alignment between our businesses, increasing our investment in supply chain capability and tailoring our supply chains to meet customer needs.
As one small example of the type of change we're talking about, we have recently started work to reduce the number of our parts distribution centers around the world from 61 to 35 over the next five years while improving the availability of parts for our customers. Before I turn it over to Pat to discuss details of the third quarter, I want to say a few words about our long-term financial targets and our planning for 2011, both of which I know are of interest to all of you.
Our performance this year has clearly been better than we had anticipated. Our business, especially in the emerging markets, has come back much faster than we had forecasted. And we are also seeing stronger margins on the increased sales as a result of improved productivity in our manufacturing operations. As a result, we are ahead of where we expected to be at this point relative to the targets we communicated in March. We will be revisiting those targets in the near future, but first, we are focused on finishing 2010 as strongly as possible and preparing our 2011 plan. We will provide our 2011 outlook, including details by business segment and end markets, when we report fourth quarter earnings next February. But I can offer you a few thoughts on some market trends that will be influencing our planning.
In North America, we expect significant growth in engine shipments and components to the truck market for two reasons. First, we expect the NAFTA Class 8 truck markets to grow nearly 60% next year to near-replacement levels. And second, our shipments will grow faster than the overall market. As you know, we underproduce relative to the truck OEMs during the first half of 2010 as they consume transition engines. And this phenomenon will not repeat, of course, in 2011. 
We expect continued growth in our markets in China, India and Brazil in 2011. But we will not see nearly the same year-over-year growth rates we have been this year, though we expect our sales growth to exceed the GDP growth rate in all three countries.
Once we have completed our 2011 plan, we will then revisit our long-term targets, this time looking out to 2016. When that work is complete, we will share our new long-term targets with the investment community. Let me close by saying that we are very optimistic about our future prospects in both the short term and the long term. As I have said, the first three quarters of this year have exceeded our initial expectations. And the longer-term growth trends, that we have discussed on several occasions, continue to look extremely promising.
I'll now turn it over to Pat, who will give you additional details about the third quarter as well as our updated guidance for 2010."

As Tom said, demand for our products continued to improve in the third quarter with revenues reaching $3.4 billion. Compared to the same quarter of last year, revenues were up $871 million or 34% with significan",1494,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom said, demand for our products continued to improve in the third quarter with revenues reaching $3.4 billion. Compared to the same quarter of last year, revenues were up $871 million or 34% with significant growth from all regions outside of the U.S. Revenue in both China and Latin America grew in excess of 70%, while sales in India and Europe were up 49% and 45%, respectively. Compared to the second quarter, revenues were up $193 million or 6%, led by stronger demand in India, in Latin America and some recovery in North America.
Earnings before interest and taxes were $449 million, 13.2% of sales, significantly better than the 7% reported a year ago, excluding restructuring charges.
The third quarter results included a $32 million pretax benefit in the gross margin from a favorable legal ruling in Brazil on the tax treatment of imports during the period 2004 through to 2008. Excluding this one-time benefit, EBIT was 12.3% of sales, but it was in line with the guidance we gave for the second half of the year on our previous call in July.
Joint venture income of $88 million was up significantly from last year, mainly driven by the strength of the Chinese and Indian truck markets but down 9% from the prior quarter as a result of slightly lower volumes in China and India following a record second quarter. Our profitability improvements from the third quarter of last year are driven from our ability to leverage higher sales volumes, the productivity improvements in our manufacturing plants, strong joint venture income, more warranty cost and favorable pricing.
Net income almost tripled, from $95 million a year ago to $283 million in the third quarter of 2010. So earnings per share improved to $1.44 in the quarter compared to $0.48 per share a year ago. Now let me give you some details for each operating segment.
The Engine segment delivered $2.1 billion in revenue. It was up 44% from last year despite the 54% drop in shipments to the North American heavy-duty truck market. Shipments to the construction, mining and power generation markets, as well to truck markets outside of North America, drove significant revenue growth year-over-year. Compared to the second quarter, Engine segment revenues were up 9% as we began to see higher shipments to the North American on-highway markets as well as continued growth in mining, oil and gas and construction markets.
EBIT of $223 million or 10.8% of sales was a record for the Engine segment and significantly better than the $61 million or 4.2% of sales reported last year. Compared to last year, this improved performance came from increased volumes and productivity improvements in our manufacturing plants, stronger joint venture income, benefits from pricing in certain markets and more warranty costs.
Compared to the performance in the second quarter, EBIT margins improved as a result of higher sales volume and strong operating leverage. This sequential revenue improvement will continue for the Engine business next quarter, led by strength in global industrial markets, particularly construction, mining and oil and gas and also recovery in engine demand for heavy-duty trucks in North America. We now expect full year revenues to be close to $7.8 billion, up 21% in 2010, which is slightly below our previous guidance due to the slow recovery of the U.S. heavy-duty truck market than we had previously anticipated.
Engine joint ventures will continue to deliver strong results on a record year for shipments in China and in India. We continue to forecast the Engine segment EBIT margins at 10% of sales for the full year, which is significantly better than the 3.9% we reported last year.
The Power Generation segment also delivered a very strong quarter. Revenues were up 44% compared to the prior year, with strong recovery in all markets outside of North America. Compared to the second quarter, revenues were up 12%, led by Commercial product sales in India, Latin America, the U.K. and in the Middle East. Power Generation profits of $97 million sharply increased from the $23 million we reported in the third quarter of 2009. EBIT margins were 12.3% of sales in the quarter compared to 4.2% last year, a performance that is comparable to the record level achieved at the peak of the last cycle in the second quarter of 2008. Most of the improvement came from strong operating leverage off the higher sales volume.
We expect demand to remain strong in emerging markets and slower recovery in North America and Europe. For the full year, we are now forecasting 18% revenue growth to over $2.8 billion and segment EBIT margins of 10.5% of sales compared to 6.9% last year. In our Components segment, revenues were up 30% from the same period last year, driven by a higher technology content on EPA '10 engines, production recovery from European truck OEMs, improved global aftermarket demand and strength in emerging markets. Revenues were up 5% when compared to the second quarter, with almost all of the growth coming in, first, from OEM sales as a result of the increased shipments of EPA '10 products in North America.
Components segment profitability of $63 million was more than double the profit from a year ago. EBIT came in at 8.2% of sales compared to 5.2% of sales in the third quarter of 2009 as a result of volume leverage from higher sales and operational improvements. Compared to the second quarter, EBIT margins were down two percentage points due to some warranty adjustments on legacy products, higher investment spending in research and development and some increased expense related to manufacturing operations in our Filtration and Turbocharger businesses. 
For 2010, we now expect full year revenues of just below $3 billion, an increase of 26% over 2009, which is slightly lower than our previous guidance, due to the slower recovery of the U.S. truck market. We are forecasting the Components segment EBIT margin to finish the year at 9% of sales compared to 4% last year and remain very confident that we will continue to see further margin improvement in our Components segment as we move into 2011.
In the Distribution segment, revenues were up 36% from a year ago. The Western Canada consolidation accounted for 16% of the growth, while the remaining 20% organic growth came from higher engine shipments in Europe, power generation recovery in the Middle East and improved service revenues in the South Pacific region. Revenues were essentially flat with the second quarter.
Segment EBIT of $74 million was a record for this division. The EBIT margin of 12.9% of sales was essentially flat from last year as a result of the dilutive impact of the consolidation of the Western Canada distributor in the early 2010. Compared to the second quarter, favorable product mix and currency movements as well as higher joint venture income helped to improve the segment EBIT margin by almost one percentage point. We are now forecasting Distribution revenues to be up 28% in 2010 to almost $2.3 billion and deliver segment EBIT margins of 13%, which is essentially at the same level as 2009 despite the dilutive impact of the Western Canada consolidation.
As a result of the stronger performance in the Power Generation and Distribution segments, we are now raising the full year financial guidance for the company to an EBIT of 12.5% on revenues of $13 billion. This represents a 20% growth in revenues and over 100% growth in profits compared to 2009. Finally, we now project the effective tax rate for the year to be 30%, slightly lower than our previous guidance.
Looking at the balance sheet and cash flow statement, we continue to perform well. Our balance sheet has probably never been stronger. And in the third quarter, our credit rating was upgraded by both Moody’s and Standard & Poor's. In the first nine months of the year, we have invested $385 million in working capital to support the increasing demand for our products. While working capital dollars have increased compared to the third quarter of last year, our inventory turns are higher, our receivable days sales outstanding and past dues are lower, and in total, working capital is lower as a percent of sales. We have invested $170 million in capital expenditure so far this year and expect an outflow of between $375 million and $400 million for the full year. We have several capacity expansion and new product introduction projects to be completed in the fourth quarter. 
In addition to increasing the dividend in the third quarter by 50%, we have repurchased over 1 million shares this quarter bringing our total this year to 3.5 million shares at the cost of $241 million. We will continue to return value to our shareholders in the form of sustainable dividend growth and share repurchases.
Let me turn over now to Tim for his remarks before we take your questions."

Our performance in the quarter is further confirmation that we are on a path towards sustained long-term profitable growth. As Tom said, we are ahead of the growth",1024,"I want to start by repeating just a few thoughts on our outstanding third quarter results. Our performance in the quarter is further confirmation that we are on a path towards sustained long-term profitable growth. As Tom said, we are ahead of the growth pace we shared with you during our Analyst Day in March. Our EBIT margin has improved steadily over the past seven quarters, and all of our businesses are operating at or near all-time highs in terms of EBIT margins. We continue to see strong margins as our volumes grow as a result of the improvements we made across our manufacturing operations over the past two years.
As you heard Tom discuss, our 2010 product launch is going extremely well. And we are more convinced than ever that our choice of FCRs, the technology to meet new emission standards, was the correct one for now and in the future. As we look ahead to 2011 and beyond, the picture is probably even brighter than what we thought at the beginning of the year. In addition to a number of favorable long-term trends that we have discussed over the past year, we are preparing for growth in many of our markets outside the United States next year, both in our consolidated businesses and at our joint ventures. We plan to invest significantly across all business segments in 2011. Much of that investment will go to increase capacity or to launch new products in international markets, where we already hold leadership positions. For example, in India, we are opening a second facility for our mid-range engines and our Tata Cummins joint venture to expand capacity by 50% by the end of this year and are investing more to further increase capacity in 2012.
Work also continues on our mega site location in Phaltan, India, which will house a number of operations across all our business segments in a single location when it's complete. A remanufacturing operation is scheduled to be completed there by end of this year, and a parts distribution center will open in the first quarter of 2011. The mega site investment will strengthen our ability to serve the Indian market and also provide a base for exporting even more products, such as generators, out of India.
In China, we plan to expand MidRange Engine capacity by 25% at Dongfeng Cummins joint venture and investing capacity expansion and new products at our High-Horsepower engine joint venture in Chongqing. We also have capacity expansion projects planned across all of our Component businesses in China. In Brazil, we will significantly increase our capital spending in order to prepare for the Euro 5 product launch in 2012. We will also make investments to improve processes and facilities across all our operations in the country.
And here in the U.S., we are investing heavily in our High-Horsepower Engine business to meet expected demand both in this country and in international markets. Work has begun on the $100 million expansion in our High-Horsepower plant in Seymour, Indiana that will allow us to produce larger displacement engines to take advantage of long-term opportunities in markets such as power generation, oil and gas, mining and commercial marine.
In addition to the capital investment in the plant, we expect to spend $200 million to develop the new engine platform over the next few years. These new larger displacement engines will use both diesel and natural gas fuels. I want to remind you that our success this year has come despite continued economic weakness in the U.S. and Western Europe. And while much of our future growth will continue to come from emerging markets, we do expect to see a return to meaningful growth in our developed markets starting next year. Our market share in North America in medium-duty truck engine markets is over 50%, and we currently have more than 40% of the heavy-duty truck engine market. Because of that, we are well positioned to take advantage of the industry growth expected in 2011 and beyond.
This benefits our Engine businesses as well as our Components businesses, which are producing significantly greater content for the EPA 2010 engines than for previous engine models. We expect additional growth for our Components segment in Europe as Europe and other parts of the world adopt tougher emission standards for both on-highway and off-highway markets, both over the next several years. While I'm speaking of growth opportunities, I wanted to talk a little bit about Mexico. I, along with the rest of Cummins' Board of Directors and several senior Cummins leaders, visited our operations in Mexico last week and returned excited about our operations and leadership position in Mexico. We have been in San Luis Potosi and Juarez, Mexico for than 25 years and have developed a strong manufacturing base for Engines and Components products.
We are the leading producer of heavy-duty truck engines in the country, with an 85% market share. Cummins total sales in Mexico through the first three quarters of this year are up 60% compared to the same period last year. We currently employ about 3,600 people in Mexico, and our presence will continue to grow. For example, our low-cost filtration plant in San Luis Potosi is in the final stages of an expansion that will allow us to serve the majority of our North American market from a single location, allowing us to remain competitive in an extremely price-sensitive market.
Let me close by saying that our people have done an outstanding job over the past two years, first, by taking quick and decisive action in the early days of the recession to keep the company strong and then in managing the business very conservatively through the downturn. The results have been a quick return to growth and a very bright future for Cummins. We are well positioned to capture growth opportunities for next year and beyond and continue to make investments in people, facilities and technologies around the world in order to capture those opportunities. In fact, I've never been more optimistic about our future than I am right now. Thank you, and we'll take your questions."

And then also to the point that Pat made, the ramp up is not enough yet to cross the break-even line of the joint venture. So both are happening at the same time. So prospects for the joint venture look even brighter, because we've added more products to the list, and we're doing more work together. But it's obviously behind where we'd hoped in terms of ramp up. And that's primarily as a result of the implementation of the Euro 3 standard in China being delayed by some degree and also having different kinds of enforcement by region, which has slowed down Foton's implementation of the engine into their vehicles. So as that implementation continues to happen, then volumes will increase."

It's a little bit behind where it should be in the ramp up, so that's going to cost us a little bit more expense than what we had anticipated and what we've seen in the second quarter. In our Turbocharger business, we had some system issues. So we upgraded some systems at the start of the year and for the first quarter, and we're recovering from that.

On the operational issues in Turbos and Filtration -- the other issue in Filtration, it was much less of a dollar impact. But you asked if there was any mix issues going on. All the growth in the third quarter was really through across the OEMs. So the aftermarket business did not really increase much at all in Q3 over Q2.

Sure, I do, but their plants across the world are doing very well. Our business is improving.

And as the 2010 ramp up continues, we'll see further improvement in that business. The Turbocharger business is now doing very well globally. We just launched a new light-duty turbocharger that'll be manufactured first in China and that will go on these Foton Cummins engines as well as a number of other people's engines. So all those businesses are performing incredibly well. What you've seen, of course, because we've come off two years where we had the two of them not going so well, is I think there's questions about what the potential is of those companies.

The stimulus package ended to a large degree, and the government did try to produce money to supply. And we have seen some impact on the economy. But really, the joint ventures that we're involved, with Dongfeng, Foton and Chongqing, all have seen their demand tail off much less than we originally planned, which just, I think, in part demonstrate the fact that there was more demand than there was capacity. So while the economy may have come off its torrential growth rate to just growing really fast, in fact, there were some pent-up demand. And so the second half is not much weaker. It is weaker, as Pat said, but not much. In India, on the other hand, we are kind of capacity paced in TCL.

And again, we expect to continue to do well in that competitive arena. So we don't think we've won them all. And as you maybe were hinting out there, in the off-highway markets, definitely, the cost of transitions relative to the volume of sales is more difficult for them. They're talking about lots of variety of equipment, lots of changes to make and maybe not nearly as much volume as a highway manufacturer might have. So for them, these transitions are complicated and difficult, and they take them time to figure out how to manage it most effectively. So again, there's still a lot of decisions being made, I guess, is what I'm getting on with that."

But that's kind of where we're headed for 2011 and beyond. With regard to the guidance, the only thing I'm allowed to respond to in your question -- it looks like I'm getting shoved into guidance one way or the other. But let me see if I can avoid that dance by saying that we don't see a whole bunch of big headwinds. There are obviously -- there's obviously a bunch of uncertainty about U.S. markets and European markets, and you read about as much about that as I do. But the developing economies looks strong, as I mentioned in the my comments. There are some sectors that look like they're poised to recover. We talked about the heavy-duty truck. We do think commodity costs are likely to continue to increase. That's the one front. On the other hand, we saw a lot of equipment into commodity-generating markets. So on balance, I think that's a good thing, not a bad thing, but it will be a headwind to some degree in cost. But there's really nothing big that I would highlight to you as saying this really has a big offsetting push to what we're trying to do. But we're still rolling together all the growth rates and making sure we've got a good balance between investing for long-term and generating returns in the short run.

I think that's our experience that we were involved for a significant period of time. The EPA made a really big effort to try to get input from a wide range of people in the industry repeated times. So there were several different forms by which they did that. And that includes all of our industry trucks, engines, et cetera, as well as truckers, American truck associations, et cetera, we we're all asked for input over the writing of that rule, not just now that that's in the comment period. So I think there was a lot of the industry involvement and to-ing and fro-ing before they got to the rule. Another positive about the rule is that what we've got is several agencies, who each could have taken a separate path, actually working together on one rule. And that's the principle for -- if you're going to have regulation, having one enforced one way is a huge benefit. Second thing they did well is they have lead time between the time they're introducing the rule and the time it actually hits. And third is that they're trying to get technology introduced that can both meet the standard and perform well for customers at reasonable cost. And so they're growing in technology, and they've got a couple of funding mechanisms through the DOE, like the SuperTruck program we talked about, to kind of push technology forward. So those three elements, I think, make it, on balance, a relatively good regulation in terms of as regulations go. Now we still have to read the details of the rule. They're just out for public comment. Reviewing those is a really important thing to do, so we're going to do that in some detail and give comments as we see necessary. But in general, I would say that the process was relatively robust."

Pat will then provide greater detail on the quarter and our updated 2010 outlook. And Tim will talk about our longer-term priorities. 
The third quarter was a continuation of our strong performance throughout 2010. Sales and profits rose sharply from the same period last year, led by strength in our international markets and the significant improvements we have made in manufacturing productivity during the downturn. Sales of $3.4 billion were 34% higher than the same period in 2009. All four business segments reported significantly higher sales, led by our Engine and Power Generation segment, which increased by 44% each. Earnings before interest and taxes also increased from the third quarter of 2009 to $449 million or 13.2% of sales. That compares to 7% of sales, excluding restructuring charges, during the same period in 2009.
To further illustrate our improved profitability, consider that in the second and third quarters of this year, we produced the same EBIT as we did during the second and third quarters of 2008 at the height of our business before the recession on $1 billion lower in sales. 
Our Engine business reported record quarterly EBIT of 10.8% of sales despite continued weakness in the North American truck market. The Power Generation business has rebounded strongly from its low point of the downturn during the third quarter last year and matched its best-ever quarterly EBIT percentage at 12.3%. Our Distribution businesses set a quarterly record by earning EBIT of $74 million. And our Components group continued to perform well during the quarter as EBIT doubled from the same period in 2009.
As has been the case all year, strong markets in China, India and Brazil continues to drive large sales increases in the third quarter. Consolidated sales in China rose 72% from the third quarter of last year, while sales in Brazil increased 90%, and sales in India were up 49%. Overall, sales outside the U.S. increased 56% from the same period last year, accounting for 63% of our total consolidated revenues in the quarter.
For example, international sales of engines to the industrial markets increased 96% compared to the same quarter last year, led by sharply higher demand for construction engines in emerging markets. Sales to the mining market doubled in the third quarter, due to stronger demand for coal and other commodities. And Power Generation sales to international markets increased 65% compared to last year. Many of our U.S. markets remain weak as a result of the slow recovery in the U.S. economy. We are well positioned for the recovery in these markets but don't expect to see any meaningful improvement until 2011.
While we're on the topic of our U.S. business, I want to provide an update on our 2010 engine launch, which continues to go extremely well. To the end of September, we have shipped nearly 37,000 medium- and heavy-duty engines to North American truck and bus customers equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction aftertreatment devices. The feedback we have received from our customers has been very positive and confirms that the new engines are performing as expected in terms of both reliability and fuel economy. Many of our heavy-duty customers say they are experiencing a 5% to 6% improvement in fuel economy compared to our EPA 2007 engines, with some reporting even greater improvement.
More than ever, we are confident that SCR is the right choice to meet current and future emission standards in this market while helping us to achieve the fuel economy our customers demand. In addition to our leadership positions in several growing international markets, we continue to benefit from our efforts to become low-cost producer around the world. We have talked in recent quarters about productivity improvements in our manufacturing operations, which have allowed us to respond quickly to demand fluctuations, to gain market share and to improve our profitability. Today, I want to share a few thoughts about a broad effort we have launched to strengthen our global supply chain. 
The growth we have seen in recent years has made us a stronger company but has also significantly increased the complexity of our global supply chain. Our ability to become the low-cost producer in our industry will depend to a great degree on the competitiveness of our supply chain. We have been studying ways to manage our global supply chains to that it better meets our customers' needs for responsiveness at a lower cost.
As an important next step in that process, we have created a new senior leadership role to direct our global supply chain work, reporting directly to me. Lisa Yoder, a long-time operations and supply chain leader at Cummins, will lead a multi-year initiative that will focus on improving the performance of all elements of our supply chain, including cost, lead time, reliability, responsiveness and optimizing flows from different supply points. Part of the answer to achieving these improvements is integration and alignment between our businesses, increasing our investment in supply chain capability and tailoring our supply chains to meet customer needs.
As one small example of the type of change we're talking about, we have recently started work to reduce the number of our parts distribution centers around the world from 61 to 35 over the next five years while improving the availability of parts for our customers. Before I turn it over to Pat to discuss details of the third quarter, I want to say a few words about our long-term financial targets and our planning for 2011, both of which I know are of interest to all of you.
Our performance this year has clearly been better than we had anticipated. Our business, especially in the emerging markets, has come back much faster than we had forecasted. And we are also seeing stronger margins on the increased sales as a result of improved productivity in our manufacturing operations. As a result, we are ahead of where we expected to be at this point relative to the targets we communicated in March. We will be revisiting those targets in the near future, but first, we are focused on finishing 2010 as strongly as possible and preparing our 2011 plan. We will provide our 2011 outlook, including details by business segment and end markets, when we report fourth quarter earnings next February. But I can offer you a few thoughts on some market trends that will be influencing our planning.
In North America, we expect significant growth in engine shipments and components to the truck market for two reasons. First, we expect the NAFTA Class 8 truck markets to grow nearly 60% next year to near-replacement levels. And second, our shipments will grow faster than the overall market. As you know, we underproduce relative to the truck OEMs during the first half of 2010 as they consume transition engines. And this phenomenon will not repeat, of course, in 2011. 
We expect continued growth in our markets in China, India and Brazil in 2011. But we will not see nearly the same year-over-year growth rates we have been this year, though we expect our sales growth to exceed the GDP growth rate in all three countries.
Once we have completed our 2011 plan, we will then revisit our long-term targets, this time looking out to 2016. When that work is complete, we will share our new long-term targets with the investment community. Let me close by saying that we are very optimistic about our future prospects in both the short term and the long term. As I have said, the first three quarters of this year have exceeded our initial expectations. And the longer-term growth trends, that we have discussed on several occasions, continue to look extremely promising.
I'll now turn it over to Pat, who will give you additional details about the third quarter as well as our updated guidance for 2010.

As Tom said, demand for our products continued to improve in the third quarter with revenues reaching $3.4 billion. Compared to the same quarter of last year, revenues were up $871 million or 34% with significant growth from all regions outside of the U.S. Revenue in both China and Latin America grew in excess of 70%, while sales in India and Europe were up 49% and 45%, respectively. Compared to the second quarter, revenues were up $193 million or 6%, led by stronger demand in India, in Latin America and some recovery in North America.
Earnings before interest and taxes were $449 million, 13.2% of sales, significantly better than the 7% reported a year ago, excluding restructuring charges.
The third quarter results included a $32 million pretax benefit in the gross margin from a favorable legal ruling in Brazil on the tax treatment of imports during the period 2004 through to 2008. Excluding this one-time benefit, EBIT was 12.3% of sales, but it was in line with the guidance we gave for the second half of the year on our previous call in July.
Joint venture income of $88 million was up significantly from last year, mainly driven by the strength of the Chinese and Indian truck markets but down 9% from the prior quarter as a result of slightly lower volumes in China and India following a record second quarter. Our profitability improvements from the third quarter of last year are driven from our ability to leverage higher sales volumes, the productivity improvements in our manufacturing plants, strong joint venture income, more warranty cost and favorable pricing.
Net income almost tripled, from $95 million a year ago to $283 million in the third quarter of 2010. So earnings per share improved to $1.44 in the quarter compared to $0.48 per share a year ago. Now let me give you some details for each operating segment.
The Engine segment delivered $2.1 billion in revenue. It was up 44% from last year despite the 54% drop in shipments to the North American heavy-duty truck market. Shipments to the construction, mining and power generation markets, as well to truck markets outside of North America, drove significant revenue growth year-over-year. Compared to the second quarter, Engine segment revenues were up 9% as we began to see higher shipments to the North American on-highway markets as well as continued growth in mining, oil and gas and construction markets.
EBIT of $223 million or 10.8% of sales was a record for the Engine segment and significantly better than the $61 million or 4.2% of sales reported last year. Compared to last year, this improved performance came from increased volumes and productivity improvements in our manufacturing plants, stronger joint venture income, benefits from pricing in certain markets and more warranty costs.
Compared to the performance in the second quarter, EBIT margins improved as a result of higher sales volume and strong operating leverage. This sequential revenue improvement will continue for the Engine business next quarter, led by strength in global industrial markets, particularly construction, mining and oil and gas and also recovery in engine demand for heavy-duty trucks in North America. We now expect full year revenues to be close to $7.8 billion, up 21% in 2010, which is slightly below our previous guidance due to the slow recovery of the U.S. heavy-duty truck market than we had previously anticipated.
Engine joint ventures will continue to deliver strong results on a record year for shipments in China and in India. We continue to forecast the Engine segment EBIT margins at 10% of sales for the full year, which is significantly better than the 3.9% we reported last year.
The Power Generation segment also delivered a very strong quarter. Revenues were up 44% compared to the prior year, with strong recovery in all markets outside of North America. Compared to the second quarter, revenues were up 12%, led by Commercial product sales in India, Latin America, the U.K. and in the Middle East. Power Generation profits of $97 million sharply increased from the $23 million we reported in the third quarter of 2009. EBIT margins were 12.3% of sales in the quarter compared to 4.2% last year, a performance that is comparable to the record level achieved at the peak of the last cycle in the second quarter of 2008. Most of the improvement came from strong operating leverage off the higher sales volume.
We expect demand to remain strong in emerging markets and slower recovery in North America and Europe. For the full year, we are now forecasting 18% revenue growth to over $2.8 billion and segment EBIT margins of 10.5% of sales compared to 6.9% last year. In our Components segment, revenues were up 30% from the same period last year, driven by a higher technology content on EPA '10 engines, production recovery from European truck OEMs, improved global aftermarket demand and strength in emerging markets. Revenues were up 5% when compared to the second quarter, with almost all of the growth coming in, first, from OEM sales as a result of the increased shipments of EPA '10 products in North America.
Components segment profitability of $63 million was more than double the profit from a year ago. EBIT came in at 8.2% of sales compared to 5.2% of sales in the third quarter of 2009 as a result of volume leverage from higher sales and operational improvements. Compared to the second quarter, EBIT margins were down two percentage points due to some warranty adjustments on legacy products, higher investment spending in research and development and some increased expense related to manufacturing operations in our Filtration and Turbocharger businesses. 
For 2010, we now expect full year revenues of just below $3 billion, an increase of 26% over 2009, which is slightly lower than our previous guidance, due to the slower recovery of the U.S. truck market. We are forecasting the Components segment EBIT margin to finish the year at 9% of sales compared to 4% last year and remain very confident that we will continue to see further margin improvement in our Components segment as we move into 2011.
In the Distribution segment, revenues were up 36% from a year ago. The Western Canada consolidation accounted for 16% of the growth, while the remaining 20% organic growth came from higher engine shipments in Europe, power generation recovery in the Middle East and improved service revenues in the South Pacific region. Revenues were essentially flat with the second quarter.
Segment EBIT of $74 million was a record for this division. The EBIT margin of 12.9% of sales was essentially flat from last year as a result of the dilutive impact of the consolidation of the Western Canada distributor in the early 2010. Compared to the second quarter, favorable product mix and currency movements as well as higher joint venture income helped to improve the segment EBIT margin by almost one percentage point. We are now forecasting Distribution revenues to be up 28% in 2010 to almost $2.3 billion and deliver segment EBIT margins of 13%, which is essentially at the same level as 2009 despite the dilutive impact of the Western Canada consolidation.
As a result of the stronger performance in the Power Generation and Distribution segments, we are now raising the full year financial guidance for the company to an EBIT of 12.5% on revenues of $13 billion. This represents a 20% growth in revenues and over 100% growth in profits compared to 2009. Finally, we now project the effective tax rate for the year to be 30%, slightly lower than our previous guidance.
Looking at the balance sheet and cash flow statement, we continue to perform well. Our balance sheet has probably never been stronger. And in the third quarter, our credit rating was upgraded by both Moody’s and Standard & Poor's. In the first nine months of the year, we have invested $385 million in working capital to support the increasing demand for our products. While working capital dollars have increased compared to the third quarter of last year, our inventory turns are higher, our receivable days sales outstanding and past dues are lower, and in total, working capital is lower as a percent of sales. We have invested $170 million in capital expenditure so far this year and expect an outflow of between $375 million and $400 million for the full year. We have several capacity expansion and new product introduction projects to be completed in the fourth quarter. 
In addition to increasing the dividend in the third quarter by 50%, we have repurchased over 1 million shares this quarter bringing our total this year to 3.5 million shares at the cost of $241 million. We will continue to return value to our shareholders in the form of sustainable dividend growth and share repurchases.
Let me turn over now to Tim for his remarks before we take your questions.

265253,78855784,81759,"Cummins Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Cummins Inc.","Executives","I want to start by repeating just a few thoughts on our outstanding third quarter results. Our performance in the quarter is further confirmation that we are on a path towards sustained long-term profitable growth. As Tom said, we are ahead of the growth",1024,"I want to start by repeating just a few thoughts on our outstanding third quarter results. Our performance in the quarter is further confirmation that we are on a path towards sustained long-term profitable growth. As Tom said, we are ahead of the growth pace we shared with you during our Analyst Day in March. Our EBIT margin has improved steadily over the past seven quarters, and all of our businesses are operating at or near all-time highs in terms of EBIT margins. We continue to see strong margins as our volumes grow as a result of the improvements we made across our manufacturing operations over the past two years.
As you heard Tom discuss, our 2010 product launch is going extremely well. And we are more convinced than ever that our choice of FCRs, the technology to meet new emission standards, was the correct one for now and in the future. As we look ahead to 2011 and beyond, the picture is probably even brighter than what we thought at the beginning of the year. In addition to a number of favorable long-term trends that we have discussed over the past year, we are preparing for growth in many of our markets outside the United States next year, both in our consolidated businesses and at our joint ventures. We plan to invest significantly across all business segments in 2011. Much of that investment will go to increase capacity or to launch new products in international markets, where we already hold leadership positions. For example, in India, we are opening a second facility for our mid-range engines and our Tata Cummins joint venture to expand capacity by 50% by the end of this year and are investing more to further increase capacity in 2012.
Work also continues on our mega site location in Phaltan, India, which will house a number of operations across all our business segments in a single location when it's complete. A remanufacturing operation is scheduled to be completed there by end of this year, and a parts distribution center will open in the first quarter of 2011. The mega site investment will strengthen our ability to serve the Indian market and also provide a base for exporting even more products, such as generators, out of India.
In China, we plan to expand MidRange Engine capacity by 25% at Dongfeng Cummins joint venture and investing capacity expansion and new products at our High-Horsepower engine joint venture in Chongqing. We also have capacity expansion projects planned across all of our Component businesses in China. In Brazil, we will significantly increase our capital spending in order to prepare for the Euro 5 product launch in 2012. We will also make investments to improve processes and facilities across all our operations in the country.
And here in the U.S., we are investing heavily in our High-Horsepower Engine business to meet expected demand both in this country and in international markets. Work has begun on the $100 million expansion in our High-Horsepower plant in Seymour, Indiana that will allow us to produce larger displacement engines to take advantage of long-term opportunities in markets such as power generation, oil and gas, mining and commercial marine.
In addition to the capital investment in the plant, we expect to spend $200 million to develop the new engine platform over the next few years. These new larger displacement engines will use both diesel and natural gas fuels. I want to remind you that our success this year has come despite continued economic weakness in the U.S. and Western Europe. And while much of our future growth will continue to come from emerging markets, we do expect to see a return to meaningful growth in our developed markets starting next year. Our market share in North America in medium-duty truck engine markets is over 50%, and we currently have more than 40% of the heavy-duty truck engine market. Because of that, we are well positioned to take advantage of the industry growth expected in 2011 and beyond.
This benefits our Engine businesses as well as our Components businesses, which are producing significantly greater content for the EPA 2010 engines than for previous engine models. We expect additional growth for our Components segment in Europe as Europe and other parts of the world adopt tougher emission standards for both on-highway and off-highway markets, both over the next several years. While I'm speaking of growth opportunities, I wanted to talk a little bit about Mexico. I, along with the rest of Cummins' Board of Directors and several senior Cummins leaders, visited our operations in Mexico last week and returned excited about our operations and leadership position in Mexico. We have been in San Luis Potosi and Juarez, Mexico for than 25 years and have developed a strong manufacturing base for Engines and Components products.
We are the leading producer of heavy-duty truck engines in the country, with an 85% market share. Cummins total sales in Mexico through the first three quarters of this year are up 60% compared to the same period last year. We currently employ about 3,600 people in Mexico, and our presence will continue to grow. For example, our low-cost filtration plant in San Luis Potosi is in the final stages of an expansion that will allow us to serve the majority of our North American market from a single location, allowing us to remain competitive in an extremely price-sensitive market.
Let me close by saying that our people have done an outstanding job over the past two years, first, by taking quick and decisive action in the early days of the recession to keep the company strong and then in managing the business very conservatively through the downturn. The results have been a quick return to growth and a very bright future for Cummins. We are well positioned to capture growth opportunities for next year and beyond and continue to make investments in people, facilities and technologies around the world in order to capture those opportunities. In fact, I've never been more optimistic about our future than I am right now. Thank you, and we'll take your questions.

But it's obviously behind where we'd hoped in terms of ramp up.

As you noted, in each different joint venture or different operation, as we add capacity or we ramp up engineering spending for investments, there are definitely impacts, at least on the short run, on profitability. But if you kind of look across all of them, while one's a little bit down -- we talked about the Foton joint venture already, then the other's doing well. So DCEC this year, for example, had a tremendous year. So Foton was a little bit lower. DCEC was a little bit higher. So if you kind of looked across all of them, even with growth rates coming off there in sort of a torrential pace this year, they'll still be good growth rates. So we're not going to have any absorption issues or anything. We're out of capacity and adding, as you know. In Tata Cummins, for example, we'll be adding more capacity in Dongfeng. So we're still operating at very efficient kind of levels in both China and India. So we still expect to be able to maintain profitability. And our final planning really isn't done for those regions. I tried to get some indication that growth rates will still be decent. Because I mean there's a little bit of concern that after these kind of growth rates, are you expecting it to be down or something, and we don't expect that at all. How good they'll be, we still have to figure out. But we've said -- as I've said to you in my remarks, they'll be better than GDP, and we think they could be significantly better. We just have to go through all the planning and seeing country by country and see where we're going to come out.

I think it somewhat was highlighted as a more significant factor than what it could've been, because warranty was also up and has some of the production issues in a couple of those plants. On the operational issues in Turbos and Filtration -- the other issue in Filtration, it was much less of a dollar impact. But you asked if there was any mix issues going on. All the growth in the third quarter was really through across the OEMs. So the aftermarket business did not really increase much at all in Q3 over Q2. In Turbo, there wasn't much of a mix issue at all sequentially. Outside those two businesses, I think CES are performing very well, CES being our Emission Solutions business, and that we are seeing very strong margins as we expected in that business as it continues to ramp up. And I would think this is the opportunity for them to grow further as we go into next year.

The Filtration business is operating now at margins that are up near its historical highs again. So it's operating incredibly well. Do I wish we kind of got our consolidation there in Mexico? Sure, I do, but their plants across the world are doing very well. Our business is improving. We're adding new technology to our fuel filtration, other Filtration businesses, which is driving up premiums on our products. On CES, Emissions Solutions, we've had this delay in the 2010 truck market. But despite that, we've ramped up both volumes and margins very, very well in that business, and it's now meeting target margins. And as the 2010 ramp up continues, we'll see further improvement in that business. The Turbocharger business is now doing very well globally. We just launched a new light-duty turbocharger that'll be manufactured first in China and that will go on these Foton Cummins engines as well as a number of other people's engines. So all those businesses are performing incredibly well. What you've seen, of course, because we've come off two years where we had the two of them not going so well, is I think there's questions about what the potential is of those companies. But we, inside the company, see the Components business as both our fastest-growing segment and one which will -- we're highly confident will meet target margins and will be a significant engine for growth in the company. So we're very optimistic about it. And I recognize that when we have these blips, it's hard for people to be sure. But we feel very confident about in each of those businesses have seen improvement in productivity and quality and in margin over the period. So I think you can look forward to continued improvement there.

The stimulus package ended to a large degree, and the government did try to produce money to supply. And we have seen some impact on the economy. But really, the joint ventures that we're involved, with Dongfeng, Foton and Chongqing, all have seen their demand tail off much less than we originally planned, which just, I think, in part demonstrate the fact that there was more demand than there was capacity. So while the economy may have come off its torrential growth rate to just growing really fast, in fact, there were some pent-up demand. And so the second half is not much weaker. It is weaker, as Pat said, but not much. In India, on the other hand, we are kind of capacity paced in TCL. So we don't expect the second half to be weaker than the first half from a production or a revenue point of view. And in fact, we're really anxious to get our second TCL joint venture on stream at the end of the first quarter so that we can begin to ramp up production and revenue.

So that affects timing to a large degree. But having said that, we will be implementing on time. And we do expect, just like with automotive, it will drive up the content of our components and our engines. It positions us well competitively compared to other folks as we have good solutions for those Tier 4 products. And we've seen some wins with OEMs as a result of the fact that we're ready and have the right technologies ready to go. So I guess, overall, we're seeing it as continued positive messages, because, again, we're prepared for those and the OEMs like that.

There are obviously -- there's obviously a bunch of uncertainty about U.S. markets and European markets, and you read about as much about that as I do. But the developing economies looks strong, as I mentioned in the my comments. There are some sectors that look like they're poised to recover. We talked about the heavy-duty truck. We do think commodity costs are likely to continue to increase. That's the one front. On the other hand, we saw a lot of equipment into commodity-generating markets. So on balance, I think that's a good thing, not a bad thing, but it will be a headwind to some degree in cost. But there's really nothing big that I would highlight to you as saying this really has a big offsetting push to what we're trying to do. But we're still rolling together all the growth rates and making sure we've got a good balance between investing for long-term and generating returns in the short run.

I spoke to some industry folks yesterday at the Defense convention in DC, and the impression I got was that the industry was very much involved with these such decision and therefore, not a huge negative reaction to the press release yesterday. However, there were some people at the show who thought that it might lead to a significant pre-buy in 2012 and 2013. Could you just comment on each of those perspectives that we got in both, not a big surprise? And then might we see a pre-buy on the back of this announcement?

I think that's our experience that we were involved for a significant period of time. The EPA made a really big effort to try to get input from a wide range of people in the industry repeated times. So there were several different forms by which they did that. And that includes all of our industry trucks, engines, et cetera, as well as truckers, American truck associations, et cetera, we we're all asked for input over the writing of that rule, not just now that that's in the comment period. So I think there was a lot of the industry involvement and to-ing and fro-ing before they got to the rule. Another positive about the rule is that what we've got is several agencies, who each could have taken a separate path, actually working together on one rule. And that's the principle for -- if you're going to have regulation, having one enforced one way is a huge benefit. Second thing they did well is they have lead time between the time they're introducing the rule and the time it actually hits. And third is that they're trying to get technology introduced that can both meet the standard and perform well for customers at reasonable cost. And so they're growing in technology, and they've got a couple of funding mechanisms through the DOE, like the SuperTruck program we talked about, to kind of push technology forward. So those three elements, I think, make it, on balance, a relatively good regulation in terms of as regulations go. Now we still have to read the details of the rule. They're just out for public comment. Reviewing those is a really important thing to do, so we're going to do that in some detail and give comments as we see necessary. But in general, I would say that the process was relatively robust.

We were at the White House when the memo of understanding was signed between CARB, the DOT and EPA as were Navistar, Freightliner and Volvo. So the industry is supportive of it, but Tom's correct when he says that we need to see the details. And we'll be working, again, closely with both the EPA and CARB on it.

So again, the better the industry is at introducing proven technologies that are well field tested at reasonable cost, the better we'll do on reducing pre-buy.

Pat will then provide greater detail on the quarter and our updated 2010 outlook. And Tim will talk about our longer-term priorities. 
The third quarter was a continuation of our strong performance throughout 2010. Sales and profits rose sharply from the same period last year, led by strength in our international markets and the significant improvements we have made in manufacturing productivity during the downturn. Sales of $3.4 billion were 34% higher than the same period in 2009. All four business segments reported significantly higher sales, led by our Engine and Power Generation segments, which increased by 44% each. Earnings before interest and taxes also increased from the third quarter of 2009 to $449 million or 13.2% of sales. That compares to 7% of sales, excluding restructuring charges, during the same period in 2009.
To further illustrate our improved profitability, consider that in the second and third quarters of this year, we produced the same EBIT as we did during the second and third quarters of 2008, at the height of our business before the recession, on $1 billion lower in sales. 
Our Engine business reported record quarterly EBIT of 10.8% of sales despite continued weakness in the North American truck market. The Power Generation business has rebounded strongly from its low point of the downturn during the third quarter last year and matched its best-ever quarterly EBIT percentage at 12.3%. Our Distribution businesses set a quarterly record by earning EBIT of $74 million. And our Components group continued to perform well during the quarter as EBIT doubled from the same period in 2009.
As has been the case all year, strong markets in China, India and Brazil continue to drive large sales increases in the third quarter. Consolidated sales in China rose 72% from the third quarter of last year, while sales in Brazil increased 90%, and sales in India were up 49%. Overall, sales outside the U.S. increased 56% from the same period last year, accounting for 63% of our total consolidated revenues in the quarter.
For example, international sales of engines to the industrial markets increased 96% compared to the same quarter last year, led by sharply higher demand for construction engines in emerging markets. Sales to the mining market doubled in the third quarter, due to stronger demand for coal and other commodities. And Power Generation sales to international markets increased 65% compared to last year. Many of our U.S. markets remain weak as a result of the slow recovery in the U.S. economy. We are well positioned for the recovery in these markets, but don't expect to see any meaningful improvement until 2011.
While we're on the topic of our U.S. business, I want to provide an update on our 2010 engine launch, which continues to go extremely well. Through the end of September, we have shipped nearly 37,000 medium- and heavy-duty engines to North American truck and bus customers equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction aftertreatment devices. The feedback we have received from our customers has been very positive and confirms that the new engines are performing as expected in terms of both reliability and fuel economy. Many of our heavy-duty customers say they are experiencing a 5% to 6% improvement in fuel economy compared to our EPA 2007 engines, with some reporting even greater improvement.
More than ever, we are confident that SCR is the right choice to meet current and future emission standards in this market while helping us to achieve the fuel economy our customers demand. In addition to our leadership positions in several growing international markets, we continue to benefit from our efforts to become low-cost producer around the world. We have talked in recent quarters about productivity improvements in our manufacturing operations, which have allowed us to respond quickly to demand fluctuations, to gain market share and to improve our profitability. Today, I wanted to share a few thoughts about a broad effort we have launched to strengthen our global supply chain. 
The growth we have seen in recent years has made us a stronger company, but has also significantly increased the complexity of our global supply chain. Our ability to become the low-cost producer in our industry will depend to a great degree on the competitiveness of our supply chain. We have been studying ways to manage our global supply chain so that it better meets our customers' needs for responsiveness at a lower cost.
As an important next step in that process, we have created a new senior leadership role to direct our global supply chain work, reporting directly to me. Lisa Yoder, a long-time operations and supply chain leader at Cummins, will lead a multi-year initiative that will focus on improving the performance of all elements of our supply chain, including cost, lead time, reliability, responsiveness and optimizing flows from different supply points. Part of the answer to achieving these improvements is integration and alignment between our businesses, increasing our investment in supply chain capability and tailoring our supply chains to meet customer needs.
As one small example of the type of change we're talking about, we have recently started work to reduce the number of our parts distribution centers around the world from 61 to 35 over the next five years, while improving the availability of parts for our customers. 
Before I turn it over to Pat to discuss details of the third quarter, I want to say a few words about our long-term financial targets and our planning for 2011, both of which I know are of interest to all of you.
Our performance this year has clearly been better than we had anticipated. Our business, especially in the emerging markets, has come back much faster than we had forecasted. And we are also seeing stronger margins on the increased sales as a result of improved productivity in our manufacturing operations. As a result, we are ahead of where we expected to be at this point relative to the targets we communicated in March. We will be revisiting those targets in the near future, but first, we are focused on finishing 2010 as strongly as possible and preparing our 2011 plan. We will provide our 2011 outlook, including details by business segment and end markets, when we report fourth quarter earnings next February. But I can offer you a few thoughts on some market trends that will be influencing our planning.
In North America, we expect significant growth in engine shipments and components to the truck market for two reasons. First, we expect the NAFTA Class 8 truck market to grow nearly 60% next year to near-replacement levels. And second, our shipments will grow faster than the overall market. As you know, we underproduced relative to the truck OEMs during the first half of 2010 as they consume transition engines. And this phenomenon will not repeat, of course, in 2011. 
We expect continued growth in our markets in China, India and Brazil in 2011. But we will not see nearly the same year-over-year growth rates we have been this year, though we expect our sales growth to exceed the GDP growth rate in all three countries.
Once we have completed our 2011 plan, we will then revisit our long-term targets, this time looking out to 2016. When that work is complete, we will share our new long-term targets with the investment community. Let me close by saying that we are very optimistic about our future prospects in both the short term and the long term. As I have said, the first three quarters of this year have exceeded our initial expectations. And the longer-term growth trends, that we have discussed on several occasions, continue to look extremely promising.
I'll now turn it over to Pat, who will give you additional details about the third quarter as well as our updated guidance for 2010."

As Tom said, demand for our products continued to improve in the third quarter with revenues reaching $3.4 billion. Compared to the same quarter of last year, revenues were up $871 million or 34% with significant growth from all regions outside of the U.S. Revenue in both China and Latin America grew in excess of 70%, while sales in India and Europe were up 49% and 45%, respectively. Compared to the second quarter, revenues were up $193 million or 6%, led by stronger demand in India, in Latin America and some recovery in North America.
Earnings before interest and taxes were $449 million, 13.2% of sales, significantly better than the 7% reported a year ago, excluding restructuring charges.
The third quarter results included a $32 million pretax benefit in the gross margin from a favorable legal ruling in Brazil on the tax treatment of imports during the period 2004 through to 2008. Excluding this one-time benefit, EBIT was 12.3% of sales, which was in line with the guidance we gave for the second half of the year on our previous call in July.
Joint venture income of $88 million was up significantly from last year, mainly driven by the strength of the Chinese and Indian truck markets, but down 9% from the prior quarter as a result of slightly lower volumes in China and India following our record second quarter. Our profitability improvements from the third quarter of last year are driven from our ability to leverage higher sales volumes, the productivity improvements in our manufacturing plants, strong joint venture income, more warranty costs and favorable pricing.
Net income almost tripled, from $95 million a year ago to $283 million in the third quarter of 2010. So earnings per share improved to $1.44 in the quarter compared to $0.48 per share a year ago. Now let me give you some details for each operating segment.
The Engine segment delivered $2.1 billion in revenue. It was up 44% from last year despite the 54% drop in shipments to the North American heavy-duty truck market. Shipments to the construction, mining and power generation markets, as well as to truck markets outside of North America, drove significant revenue growth year-over-year. Compared to the second quarter, Engine segment revenues were up 9% as we began to see higher shipments to the North American on-highway markets as well as continued growth in mining, oil and gas and construction markets.
EBIT of $223 million or 10.8% of sales was a record for the Engine segment and significantly better than the $61 million or 4.2% of sales reported last year. Compared to last year, this improved performance came from increased volumes and productivity improvements in our manufacturing plants, stronger joint venture income, benefits from pricing in certain markets and more warranty costs.
Compared to the performance in the second quarter, EBIT margins improved as a result of higher sales volume and strong operating leverage. This sequential revenue improvement will continue for the Engine business next quarter, led by strength in global industrial markets, particularly construction, mining and oil and gas and also recovery in engine demand for heavy-duty trucks in North America. We now expect full year revenues to be close to $7.8 billion, up 21% in 2010, which is slightly below our previous guidance due to the slow recovery of the U.S. heavy-duty truck market than we had previously anticipated.
Engine joint ventures will continue to deliver strong results on a record year for shipments in China and in India. We continue to forecast the Engine segment EBIT margins at 10% of sales for the full year, which is significantly better than the 3.9% we reported last year.
The Power Generation segment also delivered a very strong quarter. Revenues were up 44% compared to the prior year, with strong recovery in all markets outside of North America. Compared to the second quarter, revenues were up 12%, led by Commercial product sales in India, Latin America, the U.K. and the Middle East. Power Generation profits of $97 million sharply increased from the $23 million we reported in the third quarter of 2009. EBIT margins were 12.3% of sales in the quarter compared to 4.2% last year, a performance that is comparable to the record level achieved at the peak of the last cycle in the second quarter of 2008. Most of the improvement came from strong operating leverage off the higher sales volume.
We expect demand to remain strong in emerging markets and slower recovery in North America and Europe. For the full year, we are now forecasting 18% revenue growth to over $2.8 billion and segment EBIT margins of 10.5% of sales compared to 6.9% last year. In our Components segment, revenues were up 30% from the same period last year, driven by a higher technology content on EPA '10 engines, production recovery from European truck OEMs, improved global aftermarket demand and strength in emerging markets. Revenues were up 5% when compared to the second quarter, with almost all of the growth coming in first-fit OEM sales as a result of the increased shipments of EPA '10 products in North America.
Components segment profitability of $63 million was more than double the profit from a year ago. EBIT came in at 8.2% of sales compared to 5.2% of sales in the third quarter of 2009 as a result of volume leverage from higher sales and operational improvements. Compared to the second quarter, EBIT margins were down two percentage points due to some warranty adjustments on legacy products, higher investment spending in research and development and some increased expense related to manufacturing operations in our filtration and turbocharger businesses. 
For 2010, we now expect full year revenues of just below $3 billion, an increase of 26% over 2009, which is slightly lower than our previous guidance, due to the slower recovery of the U.S. truck market. We are forecasting the Components segment EBIT margin to finish the year at 9% of sales compared to 4% last year, and remain very confident that we will continue to see further margin improvement in our Components segment as we move into 2011.
In the Distribution segment, revenues were up 36% from a year ago. The Western Canada consolidation accounted for 16% of the growth, while the remaining 20% organic growth came from higher engine shipments in Europe, power generation recovery in the Middle East and improved service revenues in the South Pacific region. Revenues were essentially flat with the second quarter.
Segment EBIT of $74 million was a record for this division. The EBIT margin of 12.9% of sales was essentially flat from last year as a result of the dilutive impact of the consolidation of the Western Canada distributor in early 2010. Compared to the second quarter, favorable product mix and currency movements, as well as higher joint venture income, helped to improve the segment EBIT margin by almost one percentage point. We are now forecasting Distribution revenues to be up 28% in 2010 to almost $2.3 billion and deliver segment EBIT margins of 13%, which is essentially at the same level as 2009 despite the dilutive impact of the Western Canada consolidation.
As a result of the stronger performance in the Power Generation and Distribution segments, we are now raising the full year financial guidance for the company to an EBIT of 12.5% on revenues of $13 billion. This represents a 20% growth in revenues and over 100% growth in profits compared to 2009. Finally, we now project the effective tax rate for the year to be 30%, slightly lower than our previous guidance.
Looking at the balance sheet and cash flow statement, we continued to perform well. Our balance sheet has probably never been stronger. And in the third quarter, our credit rating was upgraded by both Moody’s and Standard & Poor's. In the first nine months of the year, we have invested $385 million in working capital to support the increasing demand for our products. While working capital dollars have increased compared to the third quarter of last year, our inventory turns are higher, our receivable days sales outstanding and past dues are lower, and in total, working capital is lower as a percent of sales. We have invested $170 million in capital expenditure so far this year and expect an outflow of between $375 million and $400 million for the full year. We have several capacity expansion and new product introduction projects to be completed in the fourth quarter. 
In addition to increasing the dividend in the third quarter by 50%, we have repurchased over 1 million shares this quarter, bringing our total this year to 3.5 million shares at the cost of $241 million. We will continue to return value to our shareholders in the form of sustainable dividend growth and share repurchases.
Let me turn over now to Tim for his remarks before we take your questions."

Our performance in the quarter is further confirmation that we are on a path towards sustained long-term profitable growth. As Tom said, we are ahead of the growth",1024,"I want to start by repeating just a few thoughts on our outstanding third quarter results. Our performance in the quarter is further confirmation that we are on a path towards sustained long-term profitable growth. As Tom said, we are ahead of the growth pace we shared with you during our Analyst Day in March. Our EBIT margin has improved steadily over the past seven quarters, and all of our businesses are operating at or near all-time highs in terms of EBIT margins. We continue to see strong margins as our volumes grow as a result of the improvements we made across our manufacturing operations over the past two years.
As you heard Tom discuss, our 2010 product launch is going extremely well. And we are more convinced than ever that our choice of FCRs, the technology to meet new emission standards, was the correct one for now and in the future. As we look ahead to 2011 and beyond, the picture is probably even brighter than what we thought at the beginning of the year. In addition to a number of favorable long-term trends that we have discussed over the past year, we are preparing for growth in many of our markets outside the United States next year, both in our consolidated businesses and at our joint ventures. We plan to invest significantly across all business segments in 2011. Much of that investment will go to increase capacity or to launch new products in international markets where we already hold leadership positions. For example, in India, we are opening a second facility for our mid-range engines and our Tata Cummins joint venture to expand capacity by 50% by the end of this year and are investing more to further increase capacity in 2012.
Work also continues on our mega site location in Phaltan, India, which will house a number of operations across all our business segments in a single location when it's complete. A remanufacturing operation is scheduled to be completed there by end of this year, and a parts distribution center will open in the first quarter of 2011. The mega site investment will strengthen our ability to serve the Indian market and also provide a base for exporting even more products, such as generators, out of India.
In China, we plan to expand mid-range engine capacity by 25% at Dongfeng Cummins joint venture and investing capacity expansion and new products at our high-horsepower engine joint venture in Chongqing. We also have capacity expansion projects planned across all of our Component businesses in China. In Brazil, we will significantly increase our capital spending in order to prepare for the Euro 5 product launch in 2012. We will also make investments to improve processes and facilities across all our operations in the country.
And here in the U.S., we are investing heavily in our high-horsepower engine business to meet expected demand both in this country and in international markets. Work has begun on the $100 million expansion in our high-horsepower plant in Seymour, Indiana, that will allow us to produce larger displacement engines to take advantage of long-term opportunities in markets such as power generation, oil and gas, mining and commercial marine.
In addition to the capital investment in the plant, we expect to spend $200 million to develop the new engine platform over the next few years. These new larger displacement engines will use both diesel and natural gas fuels. I want to remind you that our success this year has come despite continued economic weakness in the U.S. and Western Europe. And while much of our future growth will continue to come from emerging markets, we do expect to see a return to meaningful growth in our developed markets starting next year. Our market share in North America in medium-duty truck engine markets is over 50%, and we currently have more than 40% of the heavy-duty truck engine market. Because of that, we are well positioned to take advantage of the industry growth expected in 2011 and beyond.
This benefits our Engine businesses as well as our Components businesses, which are producing significantly greater content for the EPA 2010 engines than for previous engine models. We expect additional growth for our Components segment in Europe, as Europe and other parts of the world adopt tougher emission standards for both on-highway and off-highway markets, both over the next several years. While I'm speaking of growth opportunities, I wanted to talk a little bit about Mexico. I, along with the rest of Cummins' Board of Directors and several senior Cummins leaders, visited our operations in Mexico last week and returned excited about our operations and leadership position in Mexico. We have been in San Luis Potosi and Juarez, Mexico, for than 25 years and have developed a strong manufacturing base for Engines and Components products.
We are the leading producer of heavy-duty truck engines in the country, with an 85% market share. Cummins' total sales in Mexico through the first three quarters of this year are up 60% compared to the same period last year. We currently employ about 3,600 people in Mexico, and our presence will continue to grow. For example, our low-cost filtration plant in San Luis Potosi is in the final stages of an expansion that will allow us to serve the majority of our North American market from a single location, allowing us to remain competitive in an extremely price-sensitive market.
Let me close by saying that our people have done an outstanding job over the past two years, first, by taking quick and decisive actions in the early days of the recession to keep the company strong, and then in managing the business very conservatively through the downturn. The results have been a quick return to growth and a very bright future for Cummins. We are well positioned to capture growth opportunities for next year and beyond and continue to make investments in people, facilities and technologies around the world in order to capture those opportunities. In fact, I've never been more optimistic about our future than I am right now. Thank you, and we'll take your questions."

On the operational issues in turbos and filtration -- the other issue in filtration, it was much less of a dollar impact. But you asked if there was any mix issues going on.

So we're very optimistic about it. And I recognize that when we have these blips, it's hard for people to be sure. But we feel very confident about it. And each of those businesses have seen improvement in productivity and quality and in margin over the period. So I think you can look forward to continued improvement there."

The stimulus package ended to a large degree, and the government did try to reduce money supply. And we have seen some impact on the economy. But really, the joint ventures that we're involved with, Dongfeng, Foton and Chongqing, all have seen their demand tail off much less than we originally planned. Which just, I think, in part demonstrates the fact that there was more demand than there was capacity. So while the economy may have come off its torrential growth rate to just growing really fast, in fact, there was some pent-up demand. And so the second half is not much weaker. It is weaker, as Pat said, but not much. In India, on the other hand, we are kind of capacity-paced in TCL. So we don't expect the second half to be weaker than the first half from a production or a revenue point of view.

So that affects timing to a large degree. But having said that, we will be implementing on time. And we do expect, just like with automotive, it will drive up the content of our components and our engines. It positions us well competitively compared to other folks because we have good solutions for those Tier 4 products.

There are obviously -- there's obviously a bunch of uncertainty about U.S. markets and European markets, and you read about as much about that as I do. But the developing economies look strong, as I mentioned in my comments. There are some sectors that look like they're poised to recover. We talked about the heavy-duty truck. We do think commodity costs are likely to continue to increase. That's the one front. On the other hand, we sell a lot of equipment into commodity-generating markets. So on balance, I think that's a good thing, not a bad thing, but it will be a headwind to some degree in costs. But there's really nothing big that I would highlight to you as saying this really has a big offsetting push to what we're trying to do.

At least that's our experience, that we were involved for a significant period of time. The EPA made a really big effort to try to get input from a wide range of people in the industry repeated times. So there were several different forms by which they did that. And that includes all of our industry, trucks, engines, et cetera, as well as truckers, American truck associations, et cetera, were all asked for input over the writing of the rule, not just now in the comment period. So I think there was a lot of the industry involvement and to-ing and fro-ing before they got to the rule. Another positive about the rule is that what we've got is several agencies, who each could have taken a separate path, actually working together on one rule. And that's the principle for -- if you're going to have regulation, having one rule enforced one way is a huge benefit. Second thing they did well is they have lead time between the time they're introducing the rule and the time it actually hits. And third is that they're trying to get technology introduced that can both meet the standard and perform well for customers at reasonable cost. And so they're drawing in technology, and they've got a couple of funding mechanisms through the DOE, like the SuperTruck program we talked about, to kind of push technology forward. So those three elements, I think, make it, on balance, a relatively good regulation in terms of as regulations go. Now we still have to read the details of the rule. They're just out for public comment. Reviewing those is a really important thing to do, so we're going to do that in some detail and give comments as we see necessary.

I will start today by sharing some thoughts on our performance in the third quarter. Pat will then provide greater detail on the quarter and our updated 2010 outlook. And Tim will talk about our longer-term priorities. The third quarter wa",1325,"Good morning. I will start today by sharing some thoughts on our performance in the third quarter. Pat will then provide greater detail on the quarter and our updated 2010 outlook. And Tim will talk about our longer-term priorities. 
The third quarter was a continuation of our strong performance throughout 2010. Sales and profits rose sharply from the same period last year, led by strength in our international markets and the significant improvements we have made in manufacturing productivity during the downturn. Sales of $3.4 billion were 34% higher than the same period in 2009. All four business segments reported significantly higher sales, led by our Engine and Power Generation segment, which increased by 44% each. Earnings before interest and taxes also increased from the third quarter of 2009 to $449 million or 13.2% of sales. That compares to 7% of sales, excluding restructuring charges, during the same period in 2009.
To further illustrate our improved profitability, consider that in the second and third quarters of this year, we produced the same EBIT as we did during the second and third quarters of 2008 at the height of our business before the recession on $1 billion lower in sales. 
Our Engine business reported record quarterly EBIT of 10.8% of sales despite continued weakness in the North American truck market. The Power Generation business has rebounded strongly from its low point of the downturn during the third quarter last year and matched its best-ever quarterly EBIT percentage at 12.3%. Our Distribution businesses set a quarterly record by earning EBIT of $74 million. And our Components group continued to perform well during the quarter as EBIT doubled from the same period in 2009.
As has been the case all year, strong markets in China, India and Brazil continues to drive large sales increases in the third quarter. Consolidated sales in China rose 72% from the third quarter of last year, while sales in Brazil increased 90%, and sales in India were up 49%. Overall, sales outside the U.S. increased 56% from the same period last year, accounting for 63% of our total consolidated revenues in the quarter.
For example, international sales of engines to the industrial markets increased 96% compared to the same quarter last year, led by sharply higher demand for construction engines in emerging markets. Sales to the mining market doubled in the third quarter, due to stronger demand for coal and other commodities. And Power Generation sales to international markets increased 65% compared to last year. Many of our U.S. markets remain weak as a result of the slow recovery in the U.S. economy. We are well positioned for the recovery in these markets but don't expect to see any meaningful improvement until 2011.
While we're on the topic of our U.S. business, I want to provide an update on our 2010 engine launch, which continues to go extremely well. To the end of September, we have shipped nearly 37,000 medium- and heavy-duty engines to North American truck and bus customers equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction aftertreatment devices. The feedback we have received from our customers has been very positive and confirms that the new engines are performing as expected in terms of both reliability and fuel economy. Many of our heavy-duty customers say they are experiencing a 5% to 6% improvement in fuel economy compared to our EPA 2007 engines, with some reporting even greater improvement.
More than ever, we are confident that SCR is the right choice to meet current and future emission standards in this market while helping us to achieve the fuel economy our customers demand. In addition to our leadership positions in several growing international markets, we continue to benefit from our efforts to become low-cost producer around the world. We have talked in recent quarters about productivity improvements in our manufacturing operations, which have allowed us to respond quickly to demand fluctuations, to gain market share and to improve our profitability. Today, I want to share a few thoughts about a broad effort we have launched to strengthen our global supply chain. 
The growth we have seen in recent years has made us a stronger company but has also significantly increased the complexity of our global supply chain. Our ability to become the low-cost producer in our industry will depend to a great degree on the competitiveness of our supply chain. We have been studying ways to manage our global supply chains to that it better meets our customers' needs for responsiveness at a lower cost.
As an important next step in that process, we have created a new senior leadership role to direct our global supply chain work, reporting directly to me. Lisa Yoder, a long-time operations and supply chain leader at Cummins, will lead a multi-year initiative that will focus on improving the performance of all elements of our supply chain, including cost, lead time, reliability, responsiveness and optimizing flows from different supply points. Part of the answer to achieving these improvements is integration and alignment between our businesses, increasing our investment in supply chain capability and tailoring our supply chains to meet customer needs.
As one small example of the type of change we're talking about, we have recently started work to reduce the number of our parts distribution centers around the world from 61 to 35 over the next five years while improving the availability of parts for our customers. Before I turn it over to Pat to discuss details of the third quarter, I want to say a few words about our long-term financial targets and our planning for 2011, both of which I know are of interest to all of you.
Our performance this year has clearly been better than we had anticipated. Our business, especially in the emerging markets, has come back much faster than we had forecasted. And we are also seeing stronger margins on the increased sales as a result of improved productivity in our manufacturing operations. As a result, we are ahead of where we expected to be at this point relative to the targets we communicated in March. We will be revisiting those targets in the near future, but first, we are focused on finishing 2010 as strongly as possible and preparing our 2011 plan. We will provide our 2011 outlook, including details by business segment and end markets, when we report fourth quarter earnings next February. But I can offer you a few thoughts on some market trends that will be influencing our planning.
In North America, we expect significant growth in engine shipments and components to the truck market for two reasons. First, we expect the NAFTA Class 8 truck markets to grow nearly 60% next year to near-replacement levels. And second, our shipments will grow faster than the overall market. As you know, we underproduce relative to the truck OEMs during the first half of 2010 as they consume transition engines. And this phenomenon will not repeat, of course, in 2011. 
We expect continued growth in our markets in China, India and Brazil in 2011. But we will not see nearly the same year-over-year growth rates we have been this year, though we expect our sales growth to exceed the GDP growth rate in all three countries.
Once we have completed our 2011 plan, we will then revisit our long-term targets, this time looking out to 2016. When that work is complete, we will share our new long-term targets with the investment community. Let me close by saying that we are very optimistic about our future prospects in both the short term and the long term. As I have said, the first three quarters of this year have exceeded our initial expectations. And the longer-term growth trends, that we have discussed on several occasions, continue to look extremely promising.
I'll now turn it over to Pat, who will give you additional details about the third quarter as well as our updated guidance for 2010."

As Tom said, demand for our products continued to improve in the third quarter with revenues reaching $3.4 billion. Compared to the same quarter of last year, revenues were up $871 million or 34% with significant growth from all regions outside of the U.S. Revenue in both China and Latin America grew in excess of 70%, while sales in India and Europe were up 49% and 45%, respectively. Compared to the second quarter, revenues were up $193 million or 6%, led by stronger demand in India, in Latin America and some recovery in North America.
Earnings before interest and taxes were $449 million, 13.2% of sales, significantly better than the 7% reported a year ago, excluding restructuring charges.
The third quarter results included a $32 million pretax benefit in the gross margin from a favorable legal ruling in Brazil on the tax treatment of imports during the period 2004 through to 2008. Excluding this one-time benefit, EBIT was 12.3% of sales, but it was in line with the guidance we gave for the second half of the year on our previous call in July.
Joint venture income of $88 million was up significantly from last year, mainly driven by the strength of the Chinese and Indian truck markets but down 9% from the prior quarter as a result of slightly lower volumes in China and India following a record second quarter. Our profitability improvements from the third quarter of last year are driven from our ability to leverage higher sales volumes, the productivity improvements in our manufacturing plants, strong joint venture income, more warranty cost and favorable pricing.
Net income almost tripled, from $95 million a year ago to $283 million in the third quarter of 2010. So earnings per share improved to $1.44 in the quarter compared to $0.48 per share a year ago. Now let me give you some details for each operating segment.
The Engine segment delivered $2.1 billion in revenue. It was up 44% from last year despite the 54% drop in shipments to the North American heavy-duty truck market. Shipments to the construction, mining and power generation markets, as well to truck markets outside of North America, drove significant revenue growth year-over-year. Compared to the second quarter, Engine segment revenues were up 9% as we began to see higher shipments to the North American on-highway markets as well as continued growth in mining, oil and gas and construction markets.
EBIT of $223 million or 10.8% of sales was a record for the Engine segment and significantly better than the $61 million or 4.2% of sales reported last year. Compared to last year, this improved performance came from increased volumes and productivity improvements in our manufacturing plants, stronger joint venture income, benefits from pricing in certain markets and more warranty costs.
Compared to the performance in the second quarter, EBIT margins improved as a result of higher sales volume and strong operating leverage. This sequential revenue improvement will continue for the Engine business next quarter, led by strength in global industrial markets, particularly construction, mining and oil and gas and also recovery in engine demand for heavy-duty trucks in North America. We now expect full year revenues to be close to $7.8 billion, up 21% in 2010, which is slightly below our previous guidance due to the slow recovery of the U.S. heavy-duty truck market than we had previously anticipated.
Engine joint ventures will continue to deliver strong results on a record year for shipments in China and in India. We continue to forecast the Engine segment EBIT margins at 10% of sales for the full year, which is significantly better than the 3.9% we reported last year.
The Power Generation segment also delivered a very strong quarter. Revenues were up 44% compared to the prior year, with strong recovery in all markets outside of North America. Compared to the second quarter, revenues were up 12%, led by Commercial product sales in India, Latin America, the U.K. and in the Middle East. Power Generation profits of $97 million sharply increased from the $23 million we reported in the third quarter of 2009. EBIT margins were 12.3% of sales in the quarter compared to 4.2% last year, a performance that is comparable to the record level achieved at the peak of the last cycle in the second quarter of 2008. Most of the improvement came from strong operating leverage off the higher sales volume.
We expect demand to remain strong in emerging markets and slower recovery in North America and Europe. For the full year, we are now forecasting 18% revenue growth to over $2.8 billion and segment EBIT margins of 10.5% of sales compared to 6.9% last year. In our Components segment, revenues were up 30% from the same period last year, driven by a higher technology content on EPA '10 engines, production recovery from European truck OEMs, improved global aftermarket demand and strength in emerging markets. Revenues were up 5% when compared to the second quarter, with almost all of the growth coming in, first, from OEM sales as a result of the increased shipments of EPA '10 products in North America.
Components segment profitability of $63 million was more than double the profit from a year ago. EBIT came in at 8.2% of sales compared to 5.2% of sales in the third quarter of 2009 as a result of volume leverage from higher sales and operational improvements. Compared to the second quarter, EBIT margins were down two percentage points due to some warranty adjustments on legacy products, higher investment spending in research and development and some increased expense related to manufacturing operations in our Filtration and Turbocharger businesses. 
For 2010, we now expect full year revenues of just below $3 billion, an increase of 26% over 2009, which is slightly lower than our previous guidance, due to the slower recovery of the U.S. truck market. We are forecasting the Components segment EBIT margin to finish the year at 9% of sales compared to 4% last year and remain very confident that we will continue to see further margin improvement in our Components segment as we move into 2011.
In the Distribution segment, revenues were up 36% from a year ago. The Western Canada consolidation accounted for 16% of the growth, while the remaining 20% organic growth came from higher engine shipments in Europe, power generation recovery in the Middle East and improved service revenues in the South Pacific region. Revenues were essentially flat with the second quarter.
Segment EBIT of $74 million was a record for this division. The EBIT margin of 12.9% of sales was essentially flat from last year as a result of the dilutive impact of the consolidation of the Western Canada distributor in the early 2010. Compared to the second quarter, favorable product mix and currency movements as well as higher joint venture income helped to improve the segment EBIT margin by almost one percentage point. We are now forecasting Distribution revenues to be up 28% in 2010 to almost $2.3 billion and deliver segment EBIT margins of 13%, which is essentially at the same level as 2009 despite the dilutive impact of the Western Canada consolidation.
As a result of the stronger performance in the Power Generation and Distribution segments, we are now raising the full year financial guidance for the company to an EBIT of 12.5% on revenues of $13 billion. This represents a 20% growth in revenues and over 100% growth in profits compared to 2009. Finally, we now project the effective tax rate for the year to be 30%, slightly lower than our previous guidance.
Looking at the balance sheet and cash flow statement, we continue to perform well. Our balance sheet has probably never been stronger. And in the third quarter, our credit rating was upgraded by both Moody’s and Standard & Poor's. In the first nine months of the year, we have invested $385 million in working capital to support the increasing demand for our products. While working capital dollars have increased compared to the third quarter of last year, our inventory turns are higher, our receivable days sales outstanding and past dues are lower, and in total, working capital is lower as a percent of sales. We have invested $170 million in capital expenditure so far this year and expect an outflow of between $375 million and $400 million for the full year. We have several capacity expansion and new product introduction projects to be completed in the fourth quarter. 
In addition to increasing the dividend in the third quarter by 50%, we have repurchased over 1 million shares this quarter bringing our total this year to 3.5 million shares at the cost of $241 million. We will continue to return value to our shareholders in the form of sustainable dividend growth and share repurchases.
Let me turn over now to Tim for his remarks before we take your questions."

Our performance in the quarter is further confirmation that we are on a path towards sustained long-term profitable growth. As Tom said, we are ahead of the growth",1024,"I want to start by repeating just a few thoughts on our outstanding third quarter results. Our performance in the quarter is further confirmation that we are on a path towards sustained long-term profitable growth. As Tom said, we are ahead of the growth pace we shared with you during our Analyst Day in March. Our EBIT margin has improved steadily over the past seven quarters, and all of our businesses are operating at or near all-time highs in terms of EBIT margins. We continue to see strong margins as our volumes grow as a result of the improvements we made across our manufacturing operations over the past two years.
As you heard Tom discuss, our 2010 product launch is going extremely well. And we are more convinced than ever that our choice of FCRs, the technology to meet new emission standards, was the correct one for now and in the future. As we look ahead to 2011 and beyond, the picture is probably even brighter than what we thought at the beginning of the year. In addition to a number of favorable long-term trends that we have discussed over the past year, we are preparing for growth in many of our markets outside the United States next year, both in our consolidated businesses and at our joint ventures. We plan to invest significantly across all business segments in 2011. Much of that investment will go to increase capacity or to launch new products in international markets, where we already hold leadership positions. For example, in India, we are opening a second facility for our mid-range engines and our Tata Cummins joint venture to expand capacity by 50% by the end of this year and are investing more to further increase capacity in 2012.
Work also continues on our mega site location in Phaltan, India, which will house a number of operations across all our business segments in a single location when it's complete. A remanufacturing operation is scheduled to be completed there by end of this year, and a parts distribution center will open in the first quarter of 2011. The mega site investment will strengthen our ability to serve the Indian market and also provide a base for exporting even more products, such as generators, out of India.
In China, we plan to expand MidRange Engine capacity by 25% at Dongfeng Cummins joint venture and investing capacity expansion and new products at our High-Horsepower engine joint venture in Chongqing. We also have capacity expansion projects planned across all of our Component businesses in China. In Brazil, we will significantly increase our capital spending in order to prepare for the Euro 5 product launch in 2012. We will also make investments to improve processes and facilities across all our operations in the country.
And here in the U.S., we are investing heavily in our High-Horsepower Engine business to meet expected demand both in this country and in international markets. Work has begun on the $100 million expansion in our High-Horsepower plant in Seymour, Indiana that will allow us to produce larger displacement engines to take advantage of long-term opportunities in markets such as power generation, oil and gas, mining and commercial marine.
In addition to the capital investment in the plant, we expect to spend $200 million to develop the new engine platform over the next few years. These new larger displacement engines will use both diesel and natural gas fuels. I want to remind you that our success this year has come despite continued economic weakness in the U.S. and Western Europe. And while much of our future growth will continue to come from emerging markets, we do expect to see a return to meaningful growth in our developed markets starting next year. Our market share in North America in medium-duty truck engine markets is over 50%, and we currently have more than 40% of the heavy-duty truck engine market. Because of that, we are well positioned to take advantage of the industry growth expected in 2011 and beyond.
This benefits our Engine businesses as well as our Components businesses, which are producing significantly greater content for the EPA 2010 engines than for previous engine models. We expect additional growth for our Components segment in Europe as Europe and other parts of the world adopt tougher emission standards for both on-highway and off-highway markets, both over the next several years. While I'm speaking of growth opportunities, I wanted to talk a little bit about Mexico. I, along with the rest of Cummins' Board of Directors and several senior Cummins leaders, visited our operations in Mexico last week and returned excited about our operations and leadership position in Mexico. We have been in San Luis Potosi and Juarez, Mexico for than 25 years and have developed a strong manufacturing base for Engines and Components products.
We are the leading producer of heavy-duty truck engines in the country, with an 85% market share. Cummins total sales in Mexico through the first three quarters of this year are up 60% compared to the same period last year. We currently employ about 3,600 people in Mexico, and our presence will continue to grow. For example, our low-cost filtration plant in San Luis Potosi is in the final stages of an expansion that will allow us to serve the majority of our North American market from a single location, allowing us to remain competitive in an extremely price-sensitive market.
Let me close by saying that our people have done an outstanding job over the past two years, first, by taking quick and decisive action in the early days of the recession to keep the company strong and then in managing the business very conservatively through the downturn. The results have been a quick return to growth and a very bright future for Cummins. We are well positioned to capture growth opportunities for next year and beyond and continue to make investments in people, facilities and technologies around the world in order to capture those opportunities. In fact, I've never been more optimistic about our future than I am right now. Thank you, and we'll take your questions."

But really, the joint ventures that we're involved, with Dongfeng, Foton and Chongqing, all have seen their demand tail off much less than we originally planned, which just, I think, in part demonstrate the fact that there was more demand than there was capacity. So while the economy may have come off its torrential growth rate to just growing really fast, in fact, there were some pent-up demand. And so the second half is not much weaker. It is weaker, as Pat said, but not much. In India, on the other hand, we are kind of capacity paced in TCL.

And as you maybe were hinting out there, in the off-highway markets, definitely, the cost of transitions relative to the volume of sales is more difficult for them. They're talking about lots of variety of equipment, lots of changes to make and maybe not nearly as much volume as a highway manufacturer might have. So for them, these transitions are complicated and difficult, and they take them time to figure out how to manage it most effectively. So again, there's still a lot of decisions being made, I guess, is what I'm getting on with that."

So they'll definitely be promoting their engine, and they expect us to see a certain amount of share with that. We've talked before about what we think's going to happen. We're expecting to end this year around 40% market share. And we think, over time, as international stops using our engines and PACCAR introduces their engines, that we'll sort of settle in in this 35% to high-30s kind of market share. That's kind of what we're targeting to do, and we think that'll be a good and profitable place for us to operate. So that's where we're headed. And what that -- you can do your own kind of calculations on what you think that means on mix versus 15, versus 13 on that, just see how that works out. But that's kind of where we're headed for 2011 and beyond. With regard to the guidance, the only thing I'm allowed to respond to in your question -- it looks like I'm getting shoved into guidance one way or the other. But let me see if I can avoid that dance by saying that we don't see a whole bunch of big headwinds. There are obviously -- there's obviously a bunch of uncertainty about U.S. markets and European markets, and you read about as much about that as I do. But the developing economies looks strong, as I mentioned in the my comments. There are some sectors that look like they're poised to recover. We talked about the heavy-duty truck. We do think commodity costs are likely to continue to increase. That's the one front. On the other hand, we saw a lot of equipment into commodity-generating markets. So on balance, I think that's a good thing, not a bad thing, but it will be a headwind to some degree in cost. But there's really nothing big that I would highlight to you as saying this really has a big offsetting push to what we're trying to do. But we're still rolling together all the growth rates and making sure we've got a good balance between investing for long-term and generating returns in the short run. That's a big part of our we're going to generate the new long-term growth targets that you're waiting for us to produce for you."

I think that's our experience that we were involved for a significant period of time. The EPA made a really big effort to try to get input from a wide range of people in the industry repeated times. So there were several different forms by which they did that. And that includes all of our industry trucks, engines, et cetera, as well as truckers, American truck associations, et cetera, we we're all asked for input over the writing of that rule, not just now that that's in the comment period. So I think there was a lot of the industry involvement and to-ing and fro-ing before they got to the rule. Another positive about the rule is that what we've got is several agencies, who each could have taken a separate path, actually working together on one rule. And that's the principle for -- if you're going to have regulation, having one enforced one way is a huge benefit. Second thing they did well is they have lead time between the time they're introducing the rule and the time it actually hits. And third is that they're trying to get technology introduced that can both meet the standard and perform well for customers at reasonable cost. And so they're growing in technology, and they've got a couple of funding mechanisms through the DOE, like the SuperTruck program we talked about, to kind of push technology forward. So those three elements, I think, make it, on balance, a relatively good regulation in terms of as regulations go. Now we still have to read the details of the rule. They're just out for public comment. Reviewing those is a really important thing to do, so we're going to do that in some detail and give comments as we see necessary. But in general, I would say that the process was relatively robust."
