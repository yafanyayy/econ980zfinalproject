Thank you for joining our call today to discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2009 results for Frontier Communications Corporation. Today, I am going to provide you with an update on the business environment in our markets, our top priorities for 2010, a review of 2009 results and an update on our transformational Verizon acquisition. As a company, we are fully aware of the challenges and opportunities in the marketplace. At Frontier, we've always been a fierce competitor, and we continue to improve our position everywhere we do business. Our 2009 results show that growth of new products and our constant focus on High-Speed Internet penetration continue to reduce access line pressure. We're succeeding because of our proven local engagement model where we are active in all of our communities. This, coupled with a robust product portfolio for businesses and consumers, results in a strong market leadership position. Our broadband Internet networks keeps getting faster. Our online computer backup and tech support is more widely used, and we are the choice for cell site fiber backhaul, just a few examples of why Frontier is the best technology choice in our market.We're also succeeding because our strategies are targeted to sell in a sluggish economy. The new normal is reduced spending and personal household deleveraging. Every American is searching for value at better price points. Our double-play and triple-play products help us capture wallet shares through these bundled discounts that we provide, and we're currently having about a third of our primary access lines in these bundles. Our price protection plans give customers certainty of price. On the residential side, Frontier has contracts on 79% of residential High-Speed customers and 53% of residential voice customers. We help customers budget and save while the cable operators keep increasing prices. Customers also appreciate the consistency of our broadband speeds, which gives them the ability to do what they want, when they want without degrading the network when more users come online.  We're giving customers innovative new products like my fitv. my fitv launched February 9 and is a groundbreaking website with free access to online video content but with a guide that makes it easy to find TV shows and movies online, just like your television guide experience. my fitv allows the TV viewer to make the switch and become a broadband TV viewer. Our tagline says it well, search less and watch more for free with my fitv. We expect my fitv to improve High-Speed retention and help us grow shares since this website will be part of our basic High-Speed service. We also will generate advertising revenue, search revenue and video-on-demand revenue from a national and local perspective. The commercial market contributes nearly half of our current customer revenue. We see upside potential across all Commercial business segments. Today, we have evenly-split revenue mix from telecom carrier clients, medium and large enterprises and small and home-office customers. We segment our offers and utilize different distribution channels to sell and service our business customers. We touch all business customers live every 90 to 120 days.Our business product portfolio has expanded to include more CPE [customer premises equipment] choices, postings services, specialized broadband products and fiber backhaul. Local sales account executives work closely with our general managers to service businesses and in our markets.For 2010, we're staying the course with a primary focus on: Increasing our broadband capacity and speed; expanding our Peace of Mind services into our installation repair appointment windows; pushing a higher percentage of sales through alternate channels; using our call centers and local initiatives to attract and retain customers; launching new products and driving penetration of all products and bundles; and enhancing the customer experience with more value at competitive prices. We have and will continue to launch segmented promotions in our market. For example, we have just launched a free netbook offer in 32 markets where we see low PC penetration and attractive High-Speed growth potential.Fourth quarter 2009 results showed a consistency of our execution in a competitive marketplace with a tough economy. Revenues were $521 million with adjusted operating cash flow or EBITDA of $285 million. This 55% quarterly margin continues to lead the industry. Frontier generated free cash flow of $124 million in the fourth quarter and paid 63% of this to our shareholders as dividends. Frontier's fourth quarter operating metrics clearly show the strategic focus and business philosophy that I described earlier. Our Q4 revenue decline was better than the three previous quarters in 2009. This was driven in part by residential and business line loss rate that were the lowest in over a year and also by the sale of additional products to our customers.We aggressively promoted our broadband network and drove fourth quarter High-Speed Internet additions to 14,600 units, which is a 72% growth rate over Q4 2008 net adds. Total 2009 High-Speed net adds were 56,000. We now have 636,000 broadband subscribers or 30% penetration of our total access line.  Our DISH bundles were also strong in the fourth quarter. We added approximately 8,400 net subscribers to bring our penetration to 12.8% of residential lines, up from 8.2% in Q4 2008.Digital voice product bundles are up 13% from last year and now represents 51% of primary lines. This strong metric performance helped push up Q4 average monthly customer revenue per access line to $67.16 from $66.08 in Q4 '08, a 1.6% improvement.Now I'll switch gears and give you an update on the Verizon transaction. We announced this transaction last May, and we've achieved several critical milestones. These include DOJ approval in September, a resounding shareholder vote of approval in October, three state approvals in October and two more state approvals in Ohio and Arizona this month. We've also received all 41 necessary local franchise area video approvals. The remaining steps to close include approvals in four more states. All the required hearings and testimony in these states are completed, and we anticipate approvals in the very near future. In addition to the remaining state approvals, we anticipate FCC approval in the same timeframe. On the operational front, our West Virginia conversion is on track and we are working with Verizon to oversee their testing of the Spinco entity. We will commence formal testing of this 13-state Spinco entity in April to make sure all systems work well and the business runs smoothly on a stand-alone basis.Finally, we plan to go to market in the near future to raise financing for the transaction. We believe we can pre-fund a good percentage of the $3.3 billion of debt that is required to close the acquisition. We expect the acquisition to close in late second quarter.  The integration of these Verizon markets will give our investors a new Frontier, with leverage approaching investment grade, more scale, a great platform for improved product penetration, revenue growth, significant cost-savings opportunities and an attractive and sustainable dividend. All of these factors will also benefit our employees and our customers.In summary, we delivered good results in the fourth quarter of 2009 and for the year. Our team's solid and consistent execution is one of the critical factors that will drive success in the Verizon acquisition market. We remain confident in our ability to improve results in these new markets and look forward to close so we can get started. Let me now hand the call over to Don Shassian, our Chief Financial Officer, who will give you the financial overview for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for the full year. Don?"

Today, I'd like to walk you through the business as usual results, introduce and discuss some operating metrics we use internally to run the business, discuss our 2010 outlook and provide an update on the Verizon transaction.For the year ending December 31, 2009, we delivered free cash flow of $491 million, which is just above the top end of our guidance. Operating cash flow or EBITDA margins, as adjusted, were 54.2% for 2009, which is within the guidance range of 53% to 56%. This year's performance continues our philosophy of say what we're going to do and do what we say. The ability to deliver these results in a challenging economic environment, and as we move along in our Verizon acquisition, demonstrate the entire company's focus on the customer, on our revenues and on our cost.Our Q4 EBITDA margin was 50% and when adjusted to exclude acquisition-related costs, severance on all the retirement cost and non-cash pension expense, the margin was 54.7%, a very strong quarter and consistent with the results we have delivered every quarter for the past few years.Network access expenses declined in the fourth quarter, as compared to last year's fourth quarter due to less aspirational gifting [ph] cost in 2009 and other operating expenses, excluding the adjustments were 35.4% of revenue in Q4 '09, a level that is fairly consistent with past several quarters. This discipline on the expense side carried down to free cash flow, which was $124 million for the quarter, of which $78 million or 63% was paid out as dividends. Our payout ratio for the year was 64%On the revenue side, Q4 results overall represented a lower year-over-year decline in any other quarter in '09 and saw stable trends that included positive results in data and Internet and a lower contribution from regulatory revenues. Data revenues for the quarter grew 4% over Q4 '08 and now represent 31% of our revenues compared to 28% at this point last year. We saw a strength here in our Broadband business, which delivered 14,600 High-Speed net adds, up 72% over Q4 '08 High-Speed net adds. And for the year, High-Speed net adds were 56,000. Access service revenues, or what we call regulatory revenues, for the quarter declined 5.6% compared to the fourth quarter of '08. Switched minutes of use were down 11.5% compared to Q4 '08. We continue to see a lower reliance on access revenues which were 17.4% of revenues in Q4 and 17% for all of 2009, compared to 18.1% in fiscal '08.  Please note that Verizon's Spinco's access revenues in 2008 were only 10.4% of revenues. So on a pro forma basis, assuming the Verizon transaction closes, the new Frontier is expected to have a lower reliance on access revenues. Customer revenue, which is all non-regulatory revenue, was $430 million for Q4 or 1.3% decline sequentially. We continue to sell more and more products to our customers to increase wallet share. Our average monthly customer revenue per access line for the quarter, which includes both residential and business, was $67.16, which is up 1.6% over last year's fourth quarter.In addition to selling more products, our access line losses also improved. Our Q4 2009 results in both residential and business showed the lowest year-over-year declines and a market improvement over Q4 '08. Overall, our total access lines were down 6.1% year-over-year in Q4 '09. This compares to a decrease of 7.2% in Q4 '08. This improvement can be attributed to the increase in penetration of bundles, fewer home moves, fewer business losses and a lessening impact of cable telephony competition which exists in 73 % of our footprint.Our residential access lines declined by 25,300 during the quarter. This is an improvement on a sequential and year-over-year basis as we're seeing solid improvement in our East and West regions. Our total residential line count  was down 7.2% from Q4 '08. Business line losses were 8,900, which is up over Q3, but much better than the Q4 2008 losses. On a year-over-year basis, business lines are down 4% compared to 4.9% in Q4 2008.I'd like to take a moment to introduce some new reporting metrics that we use internally, and we'll begin to report externally. Today, we're pleased to introduce some new metrics on our earnings release to give you more transparency and a better understanding of the key drivers of our business. Our previous releases and SEC filings have disclosed product counts like access lines, High-Speed Internet and video. We will continue to report those product counts, but the important measure we believe is the customer, both in numbers of customers, numbers of the products they buy from us, their average monthly revenue and the strength of our customer retention. We're introducing a Page 2 of the attachments to today's release, new residential metrics, with business metrics to follow in the near future.In addition to reporting access lines, we're reporting residential customers. We're taking a step further by showing products for residential customer, residential customer churn, residential customer average revenue and percentage of residential customers on price protection plans. We will continue to report on traditional metrics until we have published a year's trend of the new metrics, and we also plan to expand this customer reporting to our Business segment in 2010. Under the new metrics, our Q4 2009 residential customer base is down 6.9% compared to Q4 '08. This is lower than our reported residential access line decline of 7.2%. We've also driven a 10-basis point reduction in customer churn, from 1.5% for Q4 '08 to 1.4% for Q4 '09. Churn on customer bundled offerings is considerably lower than on unbundled products, which is why we remain very focused on bundling HSI and DISH services into our customer base. You can see part of this focus in the 7.2% increase in the products per customer in Q4 '09 versus Q4 '08, which help drive a corresponding 1.5% lift in our customer average revenue over the same periods.Now turning back to our financial statements, our capital expenditures were $69 million for the fourth quarter, excluding integration CapEx. This was up sequentially as the fourth quarter is generally our largest quarter for spending. However, for all of 2009, CapEx, excluding integration, was $231 million, below the low end of our guidance. While we continue to spend money on broadband and other strategic initiatives, other capital spending like municipal road construction work was lower because of the economy. As for 2010 expectations for the legacy Frontier business, we believe that our capital expenditures will be between $220 million and $240 million, and our adjusted free cash flow will be between $450 million and $475 million. Please note that this guidance excludes all Verizon-related integration and acquisition spending and its associated tax benefits.Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio at quarter end remain at 3.9x. In addition to $359 million of cash on the balance sheet, our liquidity is enhanced by an undrawn $250 million revolving credit facility. During the fourth quarter, we issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a nine-year offering, with net proceeds of the company of approximately $579 million. To reduce near-term maturities in advance of our Verizon financing, we repurchased in aggregate $648 million principal amount of our 9.25 notes due 2011 and our 6.25 notes due 2013. Schedule you see in the press release graphically illustrate the improvements on our maturity schedule from September 30 to December 31 after reflecting the successful financing and tender. We're also moving forward on raising a portion of the estimated $3 billion debt financing for the Verizon acquisition. I would now like to give a brief financial update as relates to the pending Verizon transaction. During the fourth quarter, we incurred integration expenses of $13.9 million and integration capital expenditures of $22.4 million, all spent in connection with the integration of the networks, as well as for the conversion of the West Virginia systems. Our guidance for integration spending in 2010 is approximately $100 million of expenses and approximately $75 million of capital expenditures. These numbers are excluded from the Legacy business forecast I just gave you.Our integration spending is higher than our original estimates of approximately $192 million due to higher spending than anticipated on the West Virginia conversions, to set up FiOS in the three FiOS markets and to be ready to take over the other 13 states. While those cost in aggregate are estimated at approximately $230 million, and we continue to quantify all the integration spending, we are so confident in our ability to achieve the $500 million in cost savings by 1/1/2013.We have received December 31, 2009, operating unit results from Verizon, which I'd like to share with you. Please note that we have not received the December 31, 2009 financial statements. Therefore, I will limit my discussion to only the key operating metrics.  Access lines as of December 31, 2009, were 4,215,000, down 127,000. This represents a 2.9% sequential decline and an 11.6% decline year-over-year. High-Speed Internet subscribers, representing both DSL and FiOS technologies, were 1,061,000 with net adds for Q4 of 6,000. FiOS TV subscribers were 111,000 with net adds of 4,000 for Q4. These results are overall where we expected the business to be when we went into this transaction last May. We continue to be very excited about putting our local go-to-market strategy to work in these properties to close the gap between their metrics and the way we run the business.2010 is going to be a very big year for Frontier. And operationally and financially, we're working very hard on all fronts. There are four primary areas of focus for us in the first half of 2010. First, continue to deliver strong operating results in the legacy Frontier business. Secondly, obtain the four remaining state approvals plus the FCC's approval. Third, complete the Spinco financing to establish the balance sheet structure on liquidity at the close of the Verizon acquisition. And fourth, focus on making sure the West Virginia systems are converted at closing with minimal customer impact, and that the 13-state systems being set up by Verizon are thoroughly tested and also working with minimal customer impact.Together, these focus areas will get us over the goal line in Q2 2010 when we expect to close. And when that day arrives, all of our stakeholders and employees can look forward to Frontier putting our business and financial execution into markets, will be happy to see us come to town. With that, let me pass the call back to Lisa to open up the call to questions."

We completed four days of testimony with the Public Service Commission in West Virginia just a couple of weeks ago. And we are basically in negotiation with all of the parties down in West Virginia. We feel very good about bringing this to closure. I think as many of you know, West Virginia will be the largest state where we do business after this acquisition, and we will be the phone company in that state. So they are more cautious than some of the other states where we are not as big as a player. But we feel very good with the outcome for West Virginia, and we're going to continue to work that over the next several weeks. With regard to the East and West operations, we are optimistic. Central is doing fine as well, but we have no signs of improvement really in any the region. What we see is more stability. And some of that stability in the improvement area is really in 2008. We had a number of large businesses that did a substantial amount of downsizing, and we've seen some of that downsizing work through the system. So there is a little bit more stability from the business customer perspective as well. But the net net is, I think we're all holding our own in these markets, but we're not seeing economic improvement."

I think, they've also, are running into some very high penetrations in certain areas of the build, and move that far is quite, a little more challenging. The results however, I do want to point out, are very, very similar to Q3. So it's a stable environment, which is the most important, and from our standpoint, is making sure that we did see the drop-off from Q2 to Q3, we really got into that to understand it. But we're now seeing a stability as we see it. We're hoping to sort of stay at that kind of level, so we can get into so we can do our thing. So I'll leave it in that macro perspective."

And part of that has to do with building out more broadband. They're only at an average 60% broadband penetration level buildout. We're at 92%. So we think the sooner that we start operating in those markets, we can aggressively start to change the paradigm on the results that we'll see. But I think, to Don's point, we're not surprised in what we're seeing. It's stable. It's what we expected. And from that perspective, we think that the markets are holding their own. With regard to FiOS, we do have FiOS in four states, of which three states have rolled out video on the platform. We have been working very diligently to replicate the FiOS system in Indiana, in Oregon and Washington for the customers that have video in those states. We are committed based upon the franchises that we have in those locations. And we're planning on making sure that when we launch in those markets, we will have a very minimal customer impact. But keep in mind, it's about 110,000 customers that are on the FiOS video platform out of the 4.2 million that we're going to be inheriting here, and we also have DirecTV in those markets. So we are looking overall, at a video strategy for the new Frontier. And we do think that we have a great opportunity to learn about on that video, by running these FiOS markets and really getting a sense for what that takes and the profitability associated with that in the market."

So the 60 days starts about that time period, Frank. And I think we'll use the whole time period."

So it's just a matter of those states taking the process through what they have to at the Public Utility Commission level. With regard to the FCC, our shot clock has been running. It's basically -- finishes this week. We've seen no material issues. There have been questions back and forth. We continue to meet with the FCC and reinforce our commitment to deliver great products and services in these markets. And I think from the FCC perspective, they are very focused on broadband, I think as we all know. And they are pretty excited about us taking over these markets and accelerating broadband to rural America. So we don't foresee any major issues there. We're going to continue to work with the staff and with the commissioners. And I think part of it is, they like to see the state approvals take place. So it's sort of this balancing act.

So we're constantly trying to segment [ph] the customer base on a residential basis, whether it's demographics, whether it's geographic or the like, and continue to find ways to target customers. One of the biggest challenges is continue to move customers from left to right. How do you move a customer that is simply one residential line and get them into more products and services, more bundles, because the churn does drop there. And as where we continue to put our time and attention, we continue to find, as we move customers further to the right on that and I mean to more products and services into the triple play and other services, churn really drops off significantly. So I think our strategy has been, and we continue to execute on, I think we'll be successful, we'll get [ph] more to do, is continue to get to those customers that are sometimes difficult to get to, to get more products and services, to win them over with our products, with our services, with our dependability and reliability and really push on that.

The National Broadband Plan, we have been working closely with the FCC, we have met with the Broadband team several times to give them input, not just on the needs for reach for broadband and capacity in the markets for broadband, but also about access in the home. Because I think there's been several studies that have come out over the last couple of weeks that show that there are many Americans that just choose not to use broadband, because either they don't see the value of it or they don't have a piece of equipment like a PC or a netbook to actually hook to broadband. So we have been very active with the FCC as they're going through their process. What they will do is a report to Congress in March. And that report is not lawmaking. It's making recommendations to Congress on certain things that Congress might take up from a broadband-initiative perspective. The Congress will then take that report and probably deliberate on it. And then they might make some decisions on certain bills that they would put in place on broadband, which would then in turn, give the FCC authority to do something on broadband differently than what they're doing today. So we see this as a fairly lengthy procedural process. But I think, for our focus, we believe broadband is the future for our business. We are continuing to upgrade speeds and capacity in our current Frontier markets. We look forward to doing that in the Verizon markets, in addition to expanding reach. And we think that there's lots of opportunities, both on the business side for broadband and on the consumer side. So I think the fundamental of broadband is good, and more reach and more expansion is going to be important. I think we've also been very proactive with the FCC on the ability to manage networks, as they look at net neutrality as well. And that it's important that everyone has a good experience with broadband. And that the high-end users should not put the lower-end users in a situation where they're subsidizing high-end usage. So I think there's a lot of moving pieces here, but I feel good that the Commission's listening. And I think what we will see come out of this broadband report will be a starting point for more dialogue, both for with Congress and the FCC."

So I perceive that you're the largest long-distance provider to your customers in your region, and I presume that you pay switched access cost for those customers. And I guess, I'm suspecting that if there's reform to rates, while you're rates, your receipts, go down from that, your cost for the long-distance service that you offer your customers go down as well. And so what I'm curious about is how to think about the net amount that you actually receive for switched access. Recognizing that yes, you receive this high margin revenue coming in from other carriers, but you also pace some out. And so I'm just trying to think of the totality of how, over form of switched access, could affect your business model?"

Our provision to long-distance services for our customers is, in residential basis, well over 70% of the customers use us for long-distance calling and the like. So there is a reduction that does occur with that. But I think the important aspect to understand is that switched access minutes of use are declining and continue to decline. So the revenue's declining and the cost for paying two underlying carriers is also declining. I don't have a good number to give you as a relationship and what percentage of switched access revenue are we, in turn, paying long-distance carriers for cost of access. I'll think about a way of communicating that to you all. Let me just think about the right way to phrase that. Because there are some carriers that we pay originating, terminating and carriage to, others have a different framework. So it all has a different complexity to it."

In terms of the counter of competitive offers, Verizon, I think, is running these markets from a business-as-usual perspective, and they have basic promotions in the marketplace.

We haven't seen any over-the-top offers that are specialized on a market-by-market basis, because that's really not how they run their business today. It's really more national offers that they do, which is another reason why we think there's huge opportunity for us.

We've done some things in terms of how we've marketed, how we service, we've looked at some credit statistics. We've done a variety of different things over the years, and we've continued to try to refine that. But we continue to do these because we see them as beneficial.

Thank you for joining our call today to discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2009 results for Frontier Communications Corporation. Today, I am going to provide you with an update on the business environment in our markets, our top priorities for 2010, a review of 2009 results and an update on our transformational Verizon acquisition. 
As a company, we are fully aware of the challenges and opportunities in the marketplace. At Frontier, we've always been a fierce competitor, and we continue to improve our position everywhere we do business. Our 2009 results show that growth of new products and our constant focus on High-Speed Internet penetration continue to reduce access line pressure. We're succeeding because of our proven local engagement model where we are active in all of our communities. This, coupled with a robust product portfolio for businesses and consumers, results in a strong market leadership position. Our broadband Internet networks keeps getting faster. Our online computer backup and tech support is more widely used, and we are the choice for cell site fiber backhaul, just a few examples of why Frontier is the best technology choice in our market.
We're also succeeding because our strategies are targeted to sell in a sluggish economy. The new normal is reduced spending and personal household deleveraging. Every American is searching for value at better price points. Our double-play and triple-play products help us capture wallet shares through these bundled discounts that we provide, and we're currently having about a third of our primary access lines in these bundles. Our price protection plans give customers certainty of price. 
On the residential side, Frontier has contracts on 79% of residential High-Speed customers and 53% of residential voice customers. We help customers budget and save while the cable operators keep increasing prices. Customers also appreciate the consistency of our broadband speeds, which gives them the ability to do what they want, when they want without degrading the network when more users come online.  
We're giving customers innovative new products like my fitv. my fitv launched February 9 and is a groundbreaking website with free access to online video content but with a guide that makes it easy to find TV shows and movies online, just like your television guide experience. my fitv allows the TV viewer to make the switch and become a broadband TV viewer. Our tagline says it well, search less and watch more for free with my fitv. We expect my fitv to improve High-Speed retention and help us grow shares since this website will be part of our basic High-Speed service. We also will generate advertising revenue, search revenue and video-on-demand revenue from a national and local perspective. 
The commercial market contributes nearly half of our current customer revenue. We see upside potential across all Commercial business segments. Today, we have evenly-split revenue mix from telecom carrier clients, medium and large enterprises and small and home-office customers. We segment our offers and utilize different distribution channels to sell and service our business customers. We touch all business customers live every 90 to 120 days.
Our business product portfolio has expanded to include more CPE [customer premises equipment] choices, postings services, specialized broadband products and fiber backhaul. Local sales account executives work closely with our general managers to service businesses and in our markets.
For 2010, we're staying the course with a primary focus on: Increasing our broadband capacity and speed; expanding our Peace of Mind services into our installation repair appointment windows; pushing a higher percentage of sales through alternate channels; using our call centers and local initiatives to attract and retain customers; launching new products and driving penetration of all products and bundles; and enhancing the customer experience with more value at competitive prices. We have and will continue to launch segmented promotions in our market. For example, we have just launched a free netbook offer in 32 markets where we see low PC penetration and attractive High-Speed growth potential.
Fourth quarter 2009 results showed a consistency of our execution in a competitive marketplace with a tough economy. Revenues were $521 million with adjusted operating cash flow or EBITDA of $285 million. This 55% quarterly margin continues to lead the industry. Frontier generated free cash flow of $124 million in the fourth quarter and paid 63% of this to our shareholders as dividends. Frontier's fourth quarter operating metrics clearly show the strategic focus and business philosophy that I described earlier. Our Q4 revenue decline was better than the three previous quarters in 2009. This was driven in part by residential and business line loss rate that were the lowest in over a year and also by the sale of additional products to our customers.
We aggressively promoted our broadband network and drove fourth quarter High-Speed Internet additions to 14,600 units, which is a 72% growth rate over Q4 2008 net adds. Total 2009 High-Speed net adds were 56,000. We now have 636,000 broadband subscribers or 30% penetration of our total access line.  Our DISH bundles were also strong in the fourth quarter. We added approximately 8,400 net subscribers to bring our penetration to 12.8% of residential lines, up from 8.2% in Q4 2008.
Digital voice product bundles are up 13% from last year and now represents 51% of primary lines. This strong metric performance helped push up Q4 average monthly customer revenue per access line to $67.16 from $66.08 in Q4 '08, a 1.6% improvement.
Now I'll switch gears and give you an update on the Verizon transaction. We announced this transaction last May, and we've achieved several critical milestones. These include DOJ approval in September, a resounding shareholder vote of approval in October, three state approvals in October and two more state approvals in Ohio and Arizona this month. We've also received all 41 necessary local franchise area video approvals. The remaining steps to close include approvals in four more states. All the required hearings and testimony in these states are completed, and we anticipate approvals in the very near future. In addition to the remaining state approvals, we anticipate FCC approval in the same timeframe. 
On the operational front, our West Virginia conversion is on track and we are working with Verizon to oversee their testing of the Spinco entity. We will commence formal testing of this 13-state Spinco entity in April to make sure all systems work well and the business runs smoothly on a stand-alone basis.
Finally, we plan to go to market in the near future to raise financing for the transaction. We believe we can pre-fund a good percentage of the $3.3 billion of debt that is required to close the acquisition. We expect the acquisition to close in late second quarter.  The integration of these Verizon markets will give our investors a new Frontier, with leverage approaching investment grade, more scale, a great platform for improved product penetration, revenue growth, significant cost-savings opportunities and an attractive and sustainable dividend. All of these factors will also benefit our employees and our customers.
In summary, we delivered good results in the fourth quarter of 2009 and for the year. Our team's solid and consistent execution is one of the critical factors that will drive success in the Verizon acquisition market. We remain confident in our ability to improve results in these new markets and look forward to close so we can get started. Let me now hand the call over to Don Shassian, our Chief Financial Officer, who will give you the financial overview for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for the full year. Don?"

Today, I'd like to walk you through the business as usual results, introduce and discuss some operating metrics we use internally to run the business, discuss our 2010 outlook and provide an update on the Verizon transaction.
For the year ending December 31, 2009, we delivered free cash flow of $491 million, which is just above the top end of our guidance. Operating cash flow or EBITDA margins, as adjusted, were 54.2% for 2009, which is within the guidance range of 53% to 56%. This year's performance continues our philosophy of say what we're going to do and do what we say. The ability to deliver these results in a challenging economic environment, and as we move along in our Verizon acquisition, demonstrate the entire company's focus on the customer, on our revenues and on our cost.
Our Q4 EBITDA margin was 50% and when adjusted to exclude acquisition-related costs, severance on all the retirement cost and non-cash pension expense, the margin was 54.7%, a very strong quarter and consistent with the results we have delivered every quarter for the past few years.
Network access expenses declined in the fourth quarter, as compared to last year's fourth quarter due to less aspirational gifting cost in 2009 and other operating expenses, excluding the adjustments were 35.4% of revenue in Q4 '09, a level that has been fairly consistent with past several quarters. This discipline on the expense side carry down to free cash flow, which was $124 million for the quarter, of which $78 million or 63% was paid out as dividends. Our payout ratio for the year was 64%.
On the revenue side, Q4 results overall represented a lower year-over-year decline than any other quarter in '09 and saw stable trends that included positive results in data and Internet and a lower contribution from regulatory revenues. Data revenues for the quarter grew 4% over Q4 '08 and now represent 31% of our revenues compared to 28% at this point last year. We saw a strength here in our Broadband business, which delivered 14,600 of High-Speed net adds, up 72% over Q4 '08, High-Speed net adds. And for the year, High-Speed net adds were 56,000. 
Access service revenues, or what we call regulatory revenues, for the quarter declined 5.6% compared to the fourth quarter of '08. Switched minutes of use were down 11.5% compared to Q4 '08. We continue to see a lower reliance on access revenues which were 17.4% of revenues in Q4 and 17% for all of 2009, compared to 18.1% in fiscal '08.  Please note that Verizon's Spinco's access revenues in 2008 were only 10.4% of revenues. So on a pro forma basis, assuming the Verizon transaction closes, the new Frontier is expected to have a lower reliance on access revenues. 
Customer revenue, which is all non-regulatory revenue, was $430 million for Q4, a 1.3% decline sequentially. We continue to sell more and more products to our customers to increase wallet share. Our average monthly customer revenue per access line for the quarter, which includes both residential and business, was $67.16, which is up 1.6% over last year's fourth quarter.
In addition to selling more products, our access line losses also improved. Our Q4 2009 results, in both residential and business, showed the lowest year-over-year declines and a market improvement over Q4 '08. Overall, our total access lines were down 6.1% year-over-year in Q4 '09. This compares to a decrease of 7.2% in Q4 '08. This improvement can be attributed to the increase in penetration of bundles, fewer home moves, fewer business losses and a lessening impact of cable telephony competition, which exists in 73 % of our footprint.
Our residential access lines declined by 25,300 during the quarter. This is an improvement on a sequential and year-over-year basis as we're seeing solid improvement in our East and West regions. Our total residential line count was down 7.2% from Q4 '08. Business line losses were 8,900, which is up over Q3, but much better than the Q4 2008 losses. On a year-over-year basis, business lines are down 4% compared to 4.9% in Q4 2008.
I'd like to take a moment to introduce some new reporting metrics that we use internally, and we'll begin to report externally. Today, we're pleased to introduce some new metrics on our earnings release to give you more transparency and a better understanding of the key drivers of our business. Our previous releases and SEC filings have disclosed product counts like access lines, High-Speed Internet and video. We will continue to report those product counts, but the important measure we believe is the customer, both in numbers of customers, numbers of the products they buy from us, their average monthly revenue and the strength of our customer retention. We're introducing on Page 2 of the attachments to today's release, new residential metrics, with business metrics to follow in the near future.
In addition to reporting access lines, we're reporting residential customers. We're taking a step further by showing products for residential customer, residential customer churn, residential customer average revenue and percentage of residential customers on price protection plans. We will continue to report our traditional metrics until we have published a year's trend of the new metrics, and we also plan to expand this customer reporting to our business segment in 2010. 
Under the new metrics, our Q4 2009 residential customer base is down 6.9% compared to Q4 '08. This is lower than our reported residential access line decline of 7.2%. We've also driven a 10-basis point reduction in customer churn, from 1.5% for Q4 '08 to 1.4% for Q4 '09. Churn on customer bundled offerings is considerably lower than on unbundled products, which is why we remain very focused on bundling HSI and DISH services into our customer base. You can see part of this focus in the 7.2% increase in the products per customer in Q4 '09 versus Q4 '08, which help drive a corresponding 1.5% lift in our customer average revenue over the same periods.
Now turning back to our financial statements, our capital expenditures were $69 million for the fourth quarter, excluding integration CapEx. This was up sequentially as the fourth quarter is generally our largest quarter for spending. However, for all of 2009, CapEx, excluding integration, was $231 million below the low end of our guidance. While we continue to spend money on broadband and other strategic initiatives, other capital spending, like municipal road construction work, was lower because of the economy. 
As for 2010 expectations for the legacy Frontier business, we believe that our capital expenditures will be between $220 million and $240 million, and our adjusted free cash flow will be between $450 million and $475 million. Please note that this guidance excludes all Verizon-related integration and acquisition spending and its associated tax benefits.
Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio at quarter end remained 3.9x. In addition to $359 million of cash on the balance sheet, our liquidity is enhanced by an undrawn $250 million revolving credit facility. During the fourth quarter, we issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a nine-year offering, with net proceeds of the company of approximately $579 million. 
To reduce near-term maturities in advance of our Verizon financing, we repurchased in aggregate $648 million principal amount of our 9¼% notes due 2011 and our 6¼% notes due 2013. Schedule you see in the press release graphically illustrate the improvements on a maturity schedule from September 30 to December 31, after reflecting the successful financing and tender. We're also moving forward on raising a portion of the estimated $3 billion debt financing for the Verizon acquisition. 
I would now like to give a brief financial update as it relates to the pending Verizon transaction. During the fourth quarter, we incurred integration expenses of $13.9 million and integration capital expenditures of $22.4 million, all spent in connection with the integration of the networks, as well as for the conversion of the West Virginia systems. Our guidance for integration spending in 2010 is approximately $100 million of expenses and approximately $75 million of capital expenditures. These numbers are excluded from the legacy business forecast I just gave you.
Our integration spending is higher than our original estimates of approximately $192 million due to higher spending than anticipated on the West Virginia conversions, to set up FiOS in the three FiOS markets and to be ready to take over the other 13 states. While those costs in aggregate are estimated at approximately $230 million and we continue to quantify all the integration spending, we are so confident in our ability to achieve the $500 million in cost savings by 1/1/2013.
We have received December 31, 2009, operating unit results from Verizon, which I like to share with you. Please note that we have not received the December 31, 2009, financial statements. Therefore, I will limit my discussion to only the key operating metrics.  
Access lines as of December 31, 2009, were 4,215,000, down 127,000. This represents a 2.9% sequential decline and an 11.6% decline year-over-year. High-Speed Internet subscribers, representing both DSL and FiOS technologies, were 1,061,000 with net adds for Q4 of 6,000. FiOS TV subscribers were 111,000 with net adds of 4,000 for Q4. 
These results are overall where we expected the business to be when we went into this transaction last May. We continue to be very excited about putting our local go-to-market strategy to work in these properties to close the gap between their metrics and the way we run the business.
2010 is going to be a very big year for Frontier. And operationally and financially, we're working very hard on all fronts. There are four primary areas of focus for us in the first half of 2010. First, continue to deliver strong operating results in the legacy Frontier business. Secondly, obtain the four remaining state approvals plus the FCC's approval. Third, complete the Spinco financing to establish the balance sheet structure on liquidity at the close of the Verizon acquisition. And fourth, focus on making sure the West Virginia systems are converted at closing with minimal customer impact, and that the 13-state systems being set up by Verizon are thoroughly tested and also working with minimal customer impact.
Together, these focus areas will get us over the goal line in Q2 2010 when we expect to close. And when that day arrives, all of our stakeholders and employees can look forward to Frontier putting our business and financial execution into markets, they'll be happy to see us come to town. 
With that, let me pass the call back to Lisa to open up the call to questions."

We completed four days of testimony with the Public Service Commission in West Virginia just a couple of weeks ago. And we are basically in negotiation with all of the parties down in West Virginia. We feel very good about bringing this to closure. I think as many of you know, West Virginia will be the largest state where we do business after this acquisition, and we will be the phone company in that state. So they are more cautious than some of the other states where we are not as big as a player. But we feel very good with the outcome for West Virginia, and we're going to continue to work that over the next several weeks. With regard to the East and West operations, we are optimistic. Central is doing fine as well, but we have no signs of improvement really in any the region. What we see is more stability. And some of that stability in the improvement area is really in 2008. We had a number of large businesses that did a substantial amount of downsizing, and we've seen some of that downsizing work through the system. So there is a little bit more stability from the business customer perspective as well. But the net net is, I think we're all holding our own in these markets, but we're not seeing economic improvement."

And part of that has to do with building out more broadband. They're only at an average 60% broadband penetration level buildout. We're at 92%. So we think the sooner that we start operating in those markets, we can aggressively start to change the paradigm on the results that we'll see. But I think, to Don's point, we're not surprised in what we're seeing. It's stable. It's what we expected. And from that perspective, we think that the markets are holding their own. With regard to FiOS, we do have FiOS in four states, of which three states have rolled out video on the platform. We have been working very diligently to replicate the FiOS system in Indiana, in Oregon and Washington for the customers that have video in those states. We are committed based upon the franchises that we have in those locations. And we're planning on making sure that when we launch in those markets, we will have a very minimal customer impact. But keep in mind, it's about 110,000 customers that are on the FiOS video platform out of the 4.2 million that we're going to be inheriting here, and we also have DirecTV in those markets. So we are looking overall, at a video strategy for the new Frontier. And we do think that we have a great opportunity to learn about on that video, by running these FiOS markets and really getting a sense for what that takes and the profitability associated with that in the market."

So we're constantly trying to segment [ph] the customer base on a residential basis, whether it's demographics, whether it's geographic or the like, and continue to find ways to target customers.

So I think our strategy has been, and we continue to execute on, I think we'd be successful, what we have more to do is continue to get to those customers that are sometimes difficult to get to, to get more products and services, to win them over with our products, with our services, with our dependability and reliability and really push on that.

The National Broadband Plan, we have been working closely with the FCC, we have met with the Broadband team several times to give them input, not just on the needs for reach for broadband and capacity in the markets for broadband, but also about access in the home. Because I think there's been several studies that have come out over the last couple of weeks that show that there are many Americans that just choose not to use broadband, because either they don't see the value of it or they don't have a piece of equipment like a PC or a netbook to actually hook to broadband. So we have been very active with the FCC as they're going through their process. What they will do is a report to Congress in March. And that report is not lawmaking. It's making recommendations to Congress on certain things that Congress might take up from a broadband-initiative perspective. The Congress will then take that report and probably deliberate on it. And then they might make some decisions on certain bills that they would put in place on broadband, which would then in turn, give the FCC authority to do something on broadband differently than what they're doing today. So we see this as a fairly lengthy procedural process. But I think, for our focus, we believe broadband is the future for our business. We are continuing to upgrade speeds and capacity in our current Frontier markets. We look forward to doing that in the Verizon markets, in addition to expanding reach. And we think that there's lots of opportunities, both on the business side for broadband and on the consumer side. So I think the fundamental of broadband is good, and more reach and more expansion is going to be important. I think we've also been very proactive with the FCC on the ability to manage networks, as they look at net neutrality as well. And that it's important that everyone has a good experience with broadband. And that the high-end users should not put the lower-end users in a situation where they're subsidizing high-end usage. So I think there's a lot of moving pieces here, but I feel good that the Commission's listening. And I think what we will see come out of this broadband report will be a starting point for more dialogue, both for with Congress and the FCC."

And so we're anticipating that we're going to need to contribute $10 million evenly spread over the quarters during the year."

So both federal and states developed mechanisms for other products and services to subsidize it, whether it was higher long-distance rates, the Bell breakup, changes, and all of a sudden it ends up being switched -- you have access charges being paid to the local system. As a result of being a subsidy, therefore, it is 100% margin. There are no real costs associated to that. I mean it is subsidizing a cost to deliver local service, that is costing us more than we bill our customers for local service revenues. That's the nature of the system. And it's trying to rebalance that over time in a variety of different ways that the people have been trying to do for a number of years. So if there's reform that occurs, switched access, we've got to find the ways to be able to deal with that. But it is not something that we've got immediate variable cost that are going to fall away."

So there is a reduction that does occur with that. But I think the important aspect to understand is that switched access minutes of use are declining and continue to decline. So the revenue's declining and the cost for paying two underlying carriers is also declining. I don't have a good number to give you as a relationship and what percentage of switched access revenue are we, in turn, paying long-distance carriers for cost of access. I'll think about a way of communicating that to you all. Let me just think about the right way to phrase that. Because there are some carriers that we pay originating, terminating and carriage to, others have a different framework. So it all has a different complexity to it."

Thank you for joining our call today to discuss first quarter 2010 results for Frontier Communications Corporation. I'll begin with a review of our first quarter results, followed by an update on our Verizon acquisition.
First quarter 2010 results, demonstrate our ability to perform well in a difficult marketplace. Revenues were $520 million and adjusted operating cash flow, or EBITDA, was $281 million which is at the top of the industry with a 54% margin. Frontier generated free cash flow of $152 million in the first quarter and paid 52% of this to our shareholders as dividends.
These results reflect a lot of fundamental blocking and tackling. We did not run any major new marketing program like our aggressive Rolling Thunder campaign in Q1 2009. Instead, we stayed the course with sustaining campaigns in limited markets. Despite the absence of a major marketing push, our Q1 revenue decline at 3.4% year-over-year was the lowest loss rate in more than a year. 
We achieved this by a consistent focus on up selling multiple products and services to our residential and business customers. This helps retention and expands revenue. More importantly, we did this in an economy where we have not seen any material improvement and where consumers are still watching what they spend. 
For example, 75% of our total high-speed Internet customers and 55% of our residential voice customers are on a one-, two- or three-year Price Protection Plan. These plans let our customers control spending in the face of rising cost from our competitors. Another popular offering from Frontier is our Peace of Mind off-site data storage and tech-support product suite which continues to gain traction with our customers. 
In Q1 2010, we saw a 7% increase in the subscriber counts of the product's two most popular options: Hard Drive Backup and Hard Drive Backup with unlimited tech-support. Overall, Peace of Mind services generated an average revenue per user of $11, up 10% over Q4 2009.
Our voice performance continues to be very good. We have reduced churn levels, raised our average revenue per customer and have more upside ahead of us by moving customers to unlimited long distance. Despite the competitive pressures in the marketplace, our customer value and our quality and reliability is the number one product set for Frontier Wireline products in the markets that we serve. 
High-speed Internet broadband net additions were 8,100 units, a solid performance based on our relatively low levels of promotional activity compared to the first and fourth quarters of 2009. Our High-Speed Internet churn continues at historically low levels of 1.5%, that's a strong indication that consumers are happy with the consistency of our speed and the increasing availability of three and six megabit per second tiers. 
Our DISH video growth in quarter was 2,800 net adds. Video remains important to us, and our triple-play bundled video units have increased 14% since Q1 2009, and more than 75% of our video subscribers are in a triple-play bundle.
Another new Frontier product is myfitv.com which launched last quarter with the goal of helping broadband users spend less time searching for online television programming and more time watching it. In the first 60 days, the number of visits and the amount of usage exceeded our expectations, and we're also proud that usage has surpassed the results posted by comparable sites.  Since launch, we've seen almost 2 million page views and close to 1 million unique visits. To date, we have not done any major marketing campaign. 
Moving to our Commercial results. We've ramped up our activity in 2010 to enhance capabilities, processes and products. We've expanded our sales team, both in size and focus to make sure we get in front of all small, medium and enterprise customers. Our efforts are already paying off, and we have a strong pipeline through year end for CPE end-to-end services, e911, advanced IP and fiber solutions. 
Business revenues represents 49% of our total customer revenue. We believe there is further upside potential as the economy improves. Business accounts in our territories are handled by high-touch local sales account executives who work closely with our general managers. We do not apply a national one-size-fits-all approach to this very important customers. As Don Shassian, our CFO, will discuss with the Business results, they have improved in Q1 2010 including a 5% increase in average revenue per customer over Q1 2009.
In summary, we again delivered solid quarterly results. Consistent execution by our employees on the business fundamentals is the key to our future success in the Verizon property. I thank all of our employees for keeping their eye on the day-to-day operations during the Verizon acquisition approval and integration process. I also want to thank our future employees at Verizon who are working hard to serve their customers during this transition. We look forward to having them join the Frontier team. 
Now I'd like to update you on our Verizon transaction which we announced one year ago this month. We'd come a very long way and the efforts of our employees have carried us within sight of the finish line. Over the past few weeks in particular, several milestones have been achieved. 
Two states delivered regulatory approvals in April, Washington on April 16 and Illinois on April 21. Oregon granted our application on February 26. That leaves only West Virginia and the FCC to complete their review of the transaction. 
On April 12, we closed a very successful offering $3.2 billion of Verizon's Spinco notes at a weighted average interest rates of 8.36%. This offering was sufficient to fully finance the acquisition cash payment to Verizon. These notes were raised at the Spinco level and on Verizon's balance sheet with the funds being held in an escrow account until closing. After closing, they will become our obligation. The oversubscription of our high-yield offering reinforces the confidence inventors have in Frontier and our ability to successfully close and integrate the Verizon property. 
With regard to the required pre-closing integration activities, we're running test system conversions to complete the West Virginia cutover. In May, we started training all current Verizon West Virginia employees on our systems so they will be ready on day one to handle customer calls and field services. In the 13 North Central property states, as planned and on schedule, Verizon created and formally separated the customer-facing systems that will become ours at closing. These systems are running commercially today, and we will continue to test all processes until closing.
Organizationally, we will implement our local area manager structure and now hiring general managers for the Verizon territory. We're also developing our go-to-market strategy so that at close, we can have effective interactions with employees and customers.
We are on track for closing at the end of Q2 and remain confident in our ability to improve results in these new markets. I want to reiterate some of the key goals for 2010 that I shared with you on our last call since they will drive our success in this Verizon property. 
Competitive engagement and customer focus is the name of the game, and these goals will get us there: First, increasing our broadband capacity and speeds; next, expanding our Peace of Mind services and to our installation, repair appointment windows, including full install; third, pushing a higher percentage of sales to our ultimate channel; fourth, using our call centers, commercial sales teams and local initiatives to attract and retain customers; fifth, launching new products and driving penetration of all products and bundles; and finally, enhancing the customer experience with more value at competitive prices. 
This is a transformational deal for Frontier, providing scale, scope and synergy opportunities. Significant cash flow potential will come from selling more products, expanding broadband offers and improving our combined cost structure. This transaction will also dramatically reduce our leverage to levels approaching investment grade. 
Finally, we remain committed to an annual $0.75 dividend at close for our shareholders. 
Let me now hand the call over to Don Shassian, our Chief Financial Officer, who will give you the financial overview for the first quarter of 2010. Don?"

The first quarter for Frontier communication was to improve customer trends along with both sequential and year-over-year expense reductions to help us maintain our consistent profit margins and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 54% and free cash flow for the quarter was $152 million which puts us comfortably on track for a guidance up $450 million to $475 million for 2010.  
Today, I will walk you through Frontier's [indiscernible] results, introduce our new reporting metrics for Business customers and provide an update on the upcoming closing of the Verizon transaction. 
Before I begin, I would like to note that our Q1 2010 earnings per share of $0.14 includes the after-tax impact of merger and integration costs. Our adjusted EPS excluding this cost was $0.15. 
Customer revenue from the first quarter was $431 million, which I'm pleased to say represents a first lift in sometime. On a year-over-year basis, the customer revenue declined 3.8% which is better than the 4.7% decline in the fourth quarter of 2009. The improvement in customer revenue was coming from growth in data and internet services, lower bad debts as our aging continues to improve and lastly, from the curtailment of the video credits in 2009 from the successful Rolling Thunder campaign in Q1 of last year. 
Data Internet services grew 22.1% sequentially and 4.2% year-over-year is now 31% of our revenues, and you heard Maggie talk about is the key focus to our reforms. Our people products and the corresponding focus on managing the business at the local level are having an impact in the market. Furthermore, the data strength is coming from both Commercial and Residential.
Switched access minutes of use were down 12.6% year-over-year. This contributed to an overall 1.4% decline in switched access and subsidy in the first quarter of 2010. However, that rate of decline slowed due to higher U.S. sub contribution factors resulting in higher surcharges being billed to customers advance to the neca [ph]. Switched access and subsidy are just 17.1% of our total revenues. I think it's worth noting that the Verizon Spinco properties 2009 regulatory revenue was 10% of its total revenue. We therefore expect our revenue from switched access and subsidy on a pro forma basis, including the Verizon property, to be approximately 13% of total revenues and that includes surcharge revenue.
Let me now turn to some of the customer metrics behind our revenue performance. We introduced Residential customer metrics last quarter. In this quarter, we'll introduce the Business customer metrics. This additional disclosure is designed to give you insight into the trends behind our numbers and more importantly, present our results to you in a way that's aligned with how we measure our full year performance. We designed these metrics to focus on customer accounts, the revenues the customer generates and our retention rate of these customers. As the management team, these are the metrics that we use to run the business. 
The Q1 2010 Residential customer base is down 7% compared to Q1 2009. This is lower than our reported Residential access line declines of 7.3%. The better performance in the customer line reflects a 12 basis point reduction in churn to 1.37% which is driven by our abilities on multiple services to our customers. We saw a 5% increase in products per customer in Q1 2010 versus Q1 2009 which helped increase our ARPU by 2.8%, an improvement over Q4 2009. Overall Residential customer revenue is up 1% sequentially and down 4.4% year-over-year.
Frontier served 138,000 Business customers at the end of the first quarter 2010. This is a new reporting metric for us. We have three categories of Business customers: One, is Social carrier; our second is Enterprise meeting; the third is small ROHO. Our total Q1 business customer count was down 7.8%. Year-over-year, it was a larger reduction in small ROHO than in the other categories which represents loss of its customers with lower revenue streams and ARPU. Our losses in the small ROHO segment had been consistent the past four quarters and is the portion of our commercial base that has been most affected by the down turn in the economy. 
Our total business customer ARPU for Q1 2010 was $503.41, a 5.2% increase over Q1 2009 levels. This tells us that we lost customers with a lower monthly recurring charge, MRC, and gained traction with customers with a higher MRC. We expect that the sales efforts Maggie talked about will positively impact all three Business customers categories in 2010, and as the economy improves, we expect to see improvement in small ROHO category.
As for traditional reporting of access lines, our Q1 2010 total line loss rate of 6% is our lowest in eight quarters. Residential line losses of 7.3% year-to-year with an improvement from the annual line-loss rate Q1 2009 of 8.1% and the business line loss of the 3.7% also included when compared to the annual biz line loss rate of Q1 '09 of 5.2%. 
Moving down the income statement. Our disciplined approach to controlling expenses resulted in a 4.4% decline from Q1 2009 in our adjusted cash operating expenses. By keeping our expense reductions ahead of a 3.4% total revenue decline, we were able to deliver an improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin of 54%, up from 53.5% in Q1 '09. This adjusted margin excludes $10.4 million of merger and integration expenses incurred in connection with the Verizon transaction, as well as our adjustments from non-cash pension expense and severance cost for all periods presented. 
Due to revenue initiatives and expense controls we have in place, we are reiterating our stand-alone Frontier guidance of adjusted EBITDA margins in 53% to 56% range. As it relates to our integration cost in connection with the Verizon Transaction, consistent with the expectations we have previously communicated, we are projecting $100 million of transaction and integration expenses in 2010 of which $10.4 million was spent in Q1.    
Our capital expenditures were $70 million for the first quarter with $40 million of that for business-as-usual Frontier. This compares to our $220 million to $240 million guidance for 2010 and reflects the seasonally lower first quarter spending levels. Our integration CapEx estimate for 2010 remains $180 million of which $30 million were spent in Q1.
Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at quarter end was 3.9x, comparable to Q4 2009. We do not have any material scheduled debt reductions during the quarter. This moderate leverage levels, combined with our strong operating results, was key to our ability to raise $3.2 billion of debt financing with Verizon Spinco last month. 
As Maggie mentioned, the weighted average interest rate was 8.36%, and we were able to comfortably ladder debt into four tranches maturing in 2015, 2017, 2020 and 2022, which we think is optimal for future refinancing activities. This financing is sufficient to fully fund the special cash payment to Verizon and close it to the notes of currently held in escrow on Verizon's balance sheet will become our obligations at closing. 
We have also entered into a new $750 million revolving credit facility which will be effective next season. We are pleased to have completed the financing for acquisition and the appropriate operating balance sheet liquidity due to the success of this financing, as the measure of the confidence investors have put on our pro forma capital structure and the strong cash flow outlook of the Frontier. 
I would now like to give a brief financial update as it relates to the pending Verizon transaction. We have received March 31, 2010, operating minute [ph] results from Verizon which I would like to share with you. Please note that we have not received the March 31 financial statements. Therefore, I will limit my discussion into only the key operating metrics at this time.
First, access lines as of March 31, 2010, was 4,108,000, down 107,000. This represents a 2.5% sequential decline and an 11.2% decline year-over-year. These are the best metrics we've seen since we announced the transaction. High-speed Internet subscribers, representing both DSL and FiOS technologies, were 1,067,000 with net adds for Q1 of 6,200. FiOS TV subscribers were 114,000 with net adds of 3,300 for Q1.
It's important for me to emphasize that these results are essentially aligned with our initial expectations, [indiscernible] performance when we entered into the transaction a year ago. Verizon continues to spend marketing and capital dollars in the markets. Keep in mind that roughly 40% in the Spinco territory and higher in some cases is selling only voice service. This explains much of the variance to Frontier's operating metrics and Spinco's. It also represents the tremendous opportunity Frontier has to improve broadband penetration along with customer metrics that follow.
In Frontier's territories as of March 31, 2010, our broadband availability is 92%. With 68% of our users able to get three megs or higher, 42% able to get six megs or higher and 14% able to get 20 megs or higher. 
In summary, we are well on our way towards successfully delivering on all the goals that we laid out for the half of 2010. First, continue to deliver strong results in the legacy function of business which we have shown in our Q1 results. Second, complete the Spinco financing which is done. Third, ensure the West Virginia system is all ready for conversion at closing. And the 13-state systems are tested and working, which we continue work on. And fourth, obtain the remaining one state approval plus the FCC's approval. 
We delivered excellent results in our core business and at the same time the entire organization is in the final stage of the preparation for the Verizon transaction. That was no small task and reflects the discipline of all our employees. 
As we've shown before in our prior acquisitions, we are still in the drive to make the Verizon acquisition a huge success.  The capital markets have spoken in terms of our debt financing. The DOJ and the shareholders supported us early last year, and now eight of the required states have approved the transaction. We delivered all of these constituencies recognize that all state holdings are Frontier benefit from the transaction, both in terms of a free broadband and a financially sound employer that's been committed to quality service since 1935. 
As we move towards the June 30-July 1 closing, we remain extremely focused on the West Virginia systems preparation and on the systems in 13 other those states. Our capital deployment fund is firming up and our employees are getting ready for opening day. We truly look forward to reporting back to you in August as the new Frontier, and with that, let me pass the call back to Doris to open the call up to questions."

I think one of the big drivers was our continued push for data and Internet services. And because we didn't run any major promotions during the quarter, we didn't have a lot of discounting going on in the quarter. In addition to that, we started to see a higher Video revenue because the Rolling Thunder customers from the first quarter of last year has a free video package for 12 months. So in the quarter, this first quarter of 2010, we started to realize the incremental increase in the Video revenues from those customers. We also did a lot of outreach during the quarter and up to the quarter to make sure the Rolling Thunder customers stayed on service with us even after the promo expired. And we were  very successful not only in reaching them, but in getting them to stay on service and in many cases, even upgrading. So I think it was a number of initiatives that we did throughout the quarter that helped strengthen the customer revenue profile. From a competitive environment, we are continuing to see cable competition in our markets. Our overlap from a triple-play perspective is in the mid-70s, so we keep an eye on that. But I also think again, the blocking and tackling, the proactive service that we do, the Peace of Mind services that differentiate us in the marketplace and our Price Protection Plans have really enabled us to continue to drive churn lower and to sell value to our customers and keep them on service."

And while we have seen stability over the last couple of quarters, and I think Don also mentioned that our aging has definitely improved, and we're not seeing the same business fall offs that we did in '08 and '09, we have not seen recovery yet in terms of businesses materially growing, customers really opening up their wallets in a different way, and we actually think that's really more of a change in level set. And we don't have a huge expectation that, that's going to change overnight. We think we're going to continue to see that sort of level of stability throughout the rest of 2010. Now with regard to the Verizon properties, I think, as you know, 11 of the 14 states we already do business in, and I would say that probably the macroeconomic environment in those states is very similar to what we have experienced in those states already. In Washington and the Carolinas, I think we might see some better trends in those states, I  don't know. We're going to have to wait and see. But all we can look at right now are the metrics that Verizon is delivering, and assume that they're probably much in the same position that the states where we do business are. And shifting over to the unions in West Virginia, I think the unions have been very vocal in that state since day one. We continue to work and have reached out to the unions many times. I think, as you know, we have over 30 bargaining units in our company today with CWA and IBEW. We know that it's important to have good relationships with them. We have renewed a number of contracts since May of last year when we announced this transaction. And we also believe that the issues that they have had concerns with, we have provided the Commission with the appropriate answers for those issues to allay any fears about moving forward with this transaction. This transaction is a good transaction for the state of West Virginia, for the employees that we're going to inherit in that state that we have committed to keep employed on the front lines with techs and customers support, and we will honor the union contracts that are in place in that state just like we will honor them in all the other states where we do business. So we are confident that the Public Service Commission will vote in favor of this transaction, and we are looking forward to that happening in the next several weeks. And then finally shifting over to the FCC and the hot-off-the-press announcement yesterday that they're leaning toward some form of a Title II umbrella for broadband. I think we come from a position that we really need to see what this notice of proposal making will be and really study It. I think we remain very committed to an environment where broadband can continue to grow and companies that operate on that platform. Whether they're network operator providers like us or application providers, you want an environment where you continue to have innovation and continue to have an incentive as a company like ours to deploy broadband and to maximize return on the capital investment we have to put in, in order to expand those services to customers. So we're going to hold our thoughts on this until we get more information about it. I was at the Commission last week, I did talk to the Chairman and I truly believe that his efforts are not out of alignment with what we want as a company and that is to be in a situation where we have the ability to manage our networks, we have the ability to price and provide different levels and tiers of services in a non-discriminatory way, and I think we're just going to have to see how this plays out over the next several weeks."

One is I think we introduced last year some very successful promotion which helped us reduce churn. We've made continued investments in our systems, in our people, in customer service both in the lock [ph] standpoint, the technician standpoint, the bundling of our products, increasing more penetration and sticking as to all of those products. I think that has been a very big pursuit for us. We have not seen significant increases in cable VoIP rollouts as well, so that's enabled us to continue to be very aggressive in this areas and have seen a lot more increased competition. In the economy, I think with the Residential side, it certainly has assisted us as people are not as attuned to move to home values not where they want to be. But on the flip side, this has not been helpful on the Commercial side as businesses over the past two years have been downsizing employees and have also been coming to us wanting to decrease their communication spend, not to leave but really decrease their voice spend maybe increase the data spend. So I think it's been across the board. I think it's been a number of factors. I don't won't point to any one as being -- the driver had a thousand points of late, but we've been very focused on our margins, on our pricing, be very disciplined on our pricing, be very focused about churn and really try to retain our customers. Because it cost a lot to acquire new customer, it can cost a lot less to just maintain them, to convert happy and satisfied and sell them more when they're with you. So it's really been number of different things there."

I think you should know, when you do a very large transaction like this, what you want to make sure is that employees are comfortable with products and services that you're selling in the marketplace before you really turn the spigot on and start driving activity from a phone call perspective, into customer service and to alternate channels. And so would kind of split out the answer in focusing on West Virginia, which is converting all of its systems over to our systems, and we will look at a normalization period where we will get employees very comfortable in selling and servicing the customers on a day-to-day basis, and also the billing cycles that we have to go through in that marketplace before we kind of put the pedal to the metal on marketing promos, and we have those on the shelf, we know what we want to do, and we have a flexible plan that once we get to the point where there is normalization after this conversion, we will get very aggressive in the marketplace. And we look at this plan over all, not just for West Virginia but the other 13 states as a 180-day plan. It's really a marketing plan through the end of 2010. In the Spinco properties, it's also similar. We want to have a period of time of settling in for our new employees. We're also mapping our products and services to the existing Verizon products and services that are offered in those markets, and we have a 1-to-130-day plan, 30 to 90 and then 90 to 180. So you will see us do different things and different offers in the marketplace. We are also pretty customized I think, as you know from a local engagement perspective, so we don't have one size fits all nor will we have that overtime in these Verizon markets. And out of the gate, we will also have a parallel marketing plan for the FiOS systems as well. So more to come on that, but we do have I think a very solid marketing plan but we will implement it appropriately when we know that the systems and the employees are capable and confident to handle what we want to drive in the marketplace."

In addition to that, we will make sure we are overstaffing in West Virginia for the first, at least the first 30 days to make sure that we have lots of hands on deck to help our employees who are new on this system, to get up to speed on those systems but not at the expense of the customer. So we're going to have extra people in West Virginia both in the customer service centers as well as tech and ops support. So that's really what we're looking at from a conversion perspective. We have done many of these conversions. I think many of you on this phone called know that we consolidated at Frontier all of our billing systems over the last several years and also absorbed the conversions in Pennsylvania when we bought, Commonwealth. So we are effectively implementing that blueprint."

And they've been very good discussions that you actually share a lot more information with them than you do with the general public. Let them know about your plans and the intricacies of your modeling and your opportunities to get forward. I think that they will be monitoring our progress, as we said, in a lot of metrics. They want to see how we're doing with our existing business in terms of our revenue and our cost structure, EBITDA margins and our CapEx spend and our customer gains and losses, our High-Speed penetration. And likewise, they're going to look at the 14 states as well as to how we're going break down or communicate to them in terms of how we're going with the customer change. 11.2% access line loss rate, I think they have been looking to see how we reduce that over time, which we're expecting to reduce 200 to 300 basis points, we believe, if we're getting that market improvements in February. And to point the broadband, as you know, these properties were about 62% broadband availability. We are making commitments in many of these state approval processes even though it's not required to do so. We are making commitments to expand broadband in all of these states which is the right thing to do and which we plan to do and which we really want to meet as quickly as possible, and we do expect to put up a the market strategy in place to take advantage of the existing broadband available markets and renewable to be able to increase broadband availability, whether we're looking will the revenue trends going to be what the EBITDA improvement's looking like? What are the cost savings that we said we're going to achieve? What's the plans for that as we put more details out and we deliver on those. I think, to me, we've been saying what we're going to do. And once we get past those, we're going to be a explicit about what we're going to be doing and when and then it's doing what we said. And I think that's going to be the confidence that we're delivering on what we say we're going to do. We hope that we believe that the capital structure would be we deliver on this business and the gate. And very shortly after, put us in a position to an Investment Grade metrics. We think we obviously got the numbers [ph] so we can prove that. We demonstrate sustainable and hopefully, we'll get their nod on that. I just need to reiterate however that we are not looking to be investment grade. We are looking to have a different leverage profile and to begin a 2.5x leverage and metrics that are similar to that is we think is the right risk profile for this business. And we believe that should be investment grade and that should merit investment grade. If it doesn't, that doesn't mean that we'll be there chasing old metric to get there. We believe this is the right level to be at."

I appreciate you joining our call today to discuss second quarter 2010 results for Frontier Communications Corporation. I’ll begin with a review of our second quarter followed by an update of our Verizon acquisition, which closed July 1. Please note that this is the last quarter that we will be discussing the financial results of the legacy Frontier business. In early November we will begin reporting third quarter financials as the New Frontier, which includes both legacy and new operations.
Our second quarter 2010 results are a solid transition to our focus on the large opportunity in the new property. Frontier’s revenues were $516 million and adjusted operating cash flow or EBITDA was $279 million, which represents an industry leading 54% margin. Frontier generated free cash flow of $134 million in the second quarter and paid 58% of this to our shareholders as dividends.
Frontier’s results this quarter show the stability and profitability of our business, even during a period without major promotions and with many of our employees actively preparing for the closing and integration of the Verizon acquisition.
I am proud of our employees’ focus on the goal of keeping Frontier number 1 with our customers. This was reflected in a revenue decline of just 3% year-over-year, which is the third straight quarter of an improved revenue loss rate, and is the lowest level since the second quarter of 2008.
Our success in driving and managing each product line to maximize profitability, and we are constantly selling additional products to our customers.
In residential, Frontier posted sequential revenue growth and a 4.7% year-over-year increase in average monthly revenue per customer to $60. Our sales force drove these results in a competitive market by driving incremental revenue share with each customer, with a constant focus on bundled services. We did not lower pricing to drive growth, and our customer base remains high quality with low 1.4% churn and 60% of our residential customers on price protection plans.
High-Speed Internet net additions were 3,400 units, lower than historical levels. This reflected reduced promotional activity driven by information technology and billing system limitations in preparation for the Verizon transaction.
Nevertheless, high-speed churn remained at a low 1.5%, average revenue per user remained stable at approximately $40, and residential High-Speed Internet subscribers on price protection plans grew to more than 80%.
This focus on profitability and quality growth as opposed to market share achieved through low pricing and high churn continues to have positive impact on Frontier’s bottom line. More importantly, it places a higher value component on broadband by our customers. We expect to positively impact our high-speed business through increasing the availability of higher speed tiers with a focus on three meg to six meg.
I want to add that we offer 20 megs service in many markets today, and industry equipment providers are now testing 300 megabits per second DSL services. Our customers and networks have a fast future.
In commercial, which is 49% of our customer revenue, the Q2 results show the positive impact of our efforts in this segment. Our revenues were up 2% sequentially, the first increase in more than a year, and revenues were down only 1% year-over-year, the lowest decline in over a year.
Monthly average revenue per business customer grew 6.1% year-over-year to $518. The increased size and focus of our sales team is driving these results across the carrier, enterprise and small business segment.
Some notable wins during the quarter include, Internet access and a wide area network for 13 institutions in the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Pennsylvania, advanced IP switching deployment for the distance learning company, Penn Foster, in 63 sites, VoIP system installations for school districts in Georgia, Minnesota and Arizona, hi-speed capacity fiber data transmission networks for several enterprise accounts in the Greater Rochester, New York market.
Relative to our cable and CLEC competition, customers appreciate our reliability, capabilities, size and full service suite, including, CPE, end-to-end managed services, e911, fiber solutions and advanced IP. We continue to believe our commercial business can deliver further growth potential as the economy improves.
In the acquired properties, business accounts will begin to experience a personal relationship of local sales account executive who will work closely with our new general managers. This is a big opportunity for Frontier.
In summary, we delivered on the financial goals we set out for you. This consistency is a hallmark of our business and we are enthusiastic about the opportunity to manage our new properties in the same fashion.
It’s important to note that this consistent execution doesn’t happen without dedicated employees. Our legacy Frontier employees were able to perform at very high levels despite the demands of the transaction, and our new employees from the acquired properties have been working non-stop to ensure a smooth transition for customers.
On that note, I’d like to update you about the Verizon acquisition, particularly with regard to our integration, broadband, marketing and employee activity. First integration; our systems cutover in West Virginia began at closing on July 1, after more than a year of preparation.
A week later we finished the cutover, a week ahead of schedule and the first cycle bills were received by customers during the week of July 12. Approximately 250 Frontier employees were brought into West Virginia to help us the cutover and subsequent customer call volume and network installation and repair.
We have significantly reduced the backlog that we inherited and that also built during the cutover in initial billing cycle, as it does with any conversion. We will keep extra resources in West Virginia until the backlog reverts to normal business as usual level and until all billing cycles are completed.
In the other 13 states, no system cutover was necessary and the transition to Frontier ownership has gone smoothly. In the coming months, we will begin formulating our plan to drive the 13 state systems to a single common platform, as we expect to complete this process by the end of 2012.
Broadband; at closing, our engineering team had full access to the network and had begun implementing our broadband expansion plan. In West Virginia, we have already deployed broadband service to customers’ premises that did not have broadband access prior to Frontier.
By the end of August, we will be deploying broadband across remaining 13 states. Our strategy is to quickly build broadband where it doesn’t exist or to turn it on where the network capability is already in place, but electronics or DSLAM cards were lacking. We plan to aggressively build out tens of thousands of new residences and businesses between now and the end of the year.
On the marketing front, we began our marketing activities well in advance of closing including the design of service bundles and pricing that would be offered in West Virginia on our own systems and in the other 13 states acquired.
Across all of these properties, we implemented our Take the Lead initiative program, by which all employees can be compensated for generating leads that turn into sales. We saw hundreds of leads in just the first few days of ownership.
In West Virginia, we’ve launched an aggressive residential offer with two months of free DISH with unlimited Digital Phone and High-Speed Max. We also launched a commercial Double Play of voice and High-Speed Internet, which has been successful out of the gate.
We supported our launch with local media including radio, newspaper, freestanding inserts, outdoor advertising, and local engagement marketing. In all states, we have rolled out our new brand awareness campaign.
I encourage you to see it on our Web site, frontier.com. It positions Frontier as the, ‘Conversation Company’ that gives our customers something to talk about; reliable phone service, fast broadband, great video and the best value on quality communication services. We also emphasize our 100% all American customer service team. In fact, all of our Frontier employees are U.S-based.
Our brand-media tactics in the 13 states include those I just described for West Virginia, and we even painted 12 roadside barns with the ‘New Frontier’ logo. In the new 13 states, we have launched a special residential triple-play offer with DIRECTV that includes a free NFL package. We are working on implementing additional promotions and offers for Q4.
In Frontier’s legacy markets, we launched an aggressive High-Speed Internet promotion on August 1 targeted at new customers and win-backs. The offer is only available in double and triple-play bundle, and based on our past experience, we believe that we can drive incremental market share with all of these offers.
On the employee front, at closing we welcomed 9,200 employees to Frontier’s existing 5,600. Our senior leadership team went across the country to meet with virtually every new employee and we’re seeing enthusiasm, excitement and engagement. Our goal in the new properties is to become as customer-facing as we are in the legacy Frontier market.
A critical step in that process is the implementation of Frontier’s local area manager structure. We hired and trained over 60 new general managers prior to closing and they are ramping up in their markets. We are also giving all of our new employees the tools and training to empower them to provide the best possible experience to our customers.
In summary, we’re off to a good start. We completed our transaction on time and as expected. Our successful West Virginia conversion process is well underway. We believe that the solid Q2 2010 results give you an indication of what we plan to achieve with these new properties.
These achievements will be driven by all employees engaging customers in a new way, which drive significant cash flow potential by selling more products, expanding broadband, and improving our combined cost structure. There is much to do to move the integration activities along and achieve the synergies we have promised. In just 30 days though, I am more confident than ever that we can and will deliver on your expectations.
Our financial house is in very good shape with lower leverage, credit metrics approaching investment grade and a stable annual dividend of $0.75.
I will end by thanking our employees, our customers and our investors. You got us here and we’re glad you are part of the New Frontier.
Let me now hand the call over to Don Shassian, our Chief Financial Officer, who will give you the financial overview for the second quarter of 2010 and some color on the Q2 financial performance in our new market. Don?

261171,108550658,72089,"Frontier Communications Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-04-2010",2010-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Frontier Communications Parent, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Maggie, and thank you, everyone for joining us this morning. Frontier’s Q2 2010 financial results showed continued strong financial performance. This marks the 10th consecutive quarter we delivered an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 5",1820,"Thank you, Maggie, and thank you, everyone for joining us this morning. Frontier’s Q2 2010 financial results showed continued strong financial performance. This marks the 10th consecutive quarter we delivered an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 54%, which we’ve achieved by growing customer revenue and reducing operating expenses, all while lowering our reliance on and exposure to regulatory revenues.
Our free cash flow in Q2 was $134 million, which puts us well on the way toward our legacy Frontier guidance of $450 million to $475 million for 2010. I would also like to note that our Q2 2010 earnings per share of $0.11 includes the after tax impact of merger and integration costs. Our adjusted EPS, excluding these costs was $0.19.
Today, I will walk you through Frontier’s core operating results and provide you an update on our integration activities. I will also provide you with an updated operating metrics and financials for the acquired properties.
During this call, we are going to focus primarily on our legacy business. Financial metrics and guidance discussed during this call will be for legacy Frontier only. Obviously, our acquired properties’ financial performance and guidance for the future is important to all of our stakeholders.
By our Q3 earnings call in early November, we expect to provide the following
Reporting on a combined basis, an analysis and plan for achieving our targeted cost savings, and updated guidance at that time.
Customer revenue for the second quarter was $436 million, which is a 1.1% sequential lift, second straight quarter of positive growth. On a year-over-year basis, customer revenue declined just 2%, which is better than the 3.6% decline in Q2 2009. The improvement in customer revenue is coming from continued positive growth in data and Internet services and slowing revenue declines in local and long distance.
As we discussed momentarily, this is largely a function of growing products per customer, raising our average monthly revenue per customer, and solidly low churn.
Switched access minutes of use were done 8.7% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2010 and switched access and subsidy revenues fell 8.2% over the same period. This rate of decline is more in line with our historical trend, as Q1 2010 results were favorably impacted by higher U.S. sub contribution factors.
Switched access and subsidy were just 15.6% of our total revenues during Q2, down from 16.4% in Q2 2009 and 18% in Q2 2008. Our reliance on and exposure to regulatory revenue continued to decrease, as the acquired properties 2009 regulatory revenue is 10% of this total revenue compared to legacy Frontier’s 17% in 2009.
With the continued decline we experienced in Q2 2010, we expect our revenue in switched access and subsidy on a pro forma basis including the acquired properties to be approximately 13% of total revenue. And if one excludes surcharges that we bill customers and remit to third parties like MECA [ph] our true exposure to switch access with subsidy support is below 11%.
Let me now turn to some of the customer metrics behind the revenue performance. Although we so report our traditional access line detail, the additional customer disclosure gives you insight into how we manage and measure ourselves internally.
The Q2 2010 residential customer base is down 7.5% compared to Q2 2009. This is lower than our reported residential access line decline of 7.7%. The better customer performance reflects a year-over-year reduction in churn to 1.37% and a 4.5% increase in product sold to customers, which helps increase our average revenue per customer by 4.7%, an improvement over the growth rates in the past two quarters.
Sequentially, our overall residential customer revenue was up slightly and on a year-over-year basis down 2.9% compared to 5% year-over-year decline in Q2 2009.
Frontier served 139,000 business customers at the end of second quarter 2010, slightly up sequentially and down 5.7% from Q2 2009. This was a solid improvement from the 7.8% year-over-year loss rate we reported last quarter.
We manage our business customers across the three different segments; wholesale carrier, enterprise medium and small ROHO, residential home office. We saw stable trends year-over-year in our wholesale and enterprise customer levels but a decline in our small ROHO customers, a consistent trend as this segment of our commercial base has been most affected by the downturn in the economy.
However, the average revenue per customer with small ROHO was lower which therefore do not impact our ability to deliver overall average revenue per customer growth in the commercial segment in the quarter.
Our total business customer ARPU for Q2 2010 was at $518, a 6.1% increase over Q2 2009 levels. As Maggie mentioned earlier, our focus on commercial accounts has increased in 2010, and we expect it to favorably impact our results in the future.
At 49% of Frontier’s customer revenues, commercial is a big part of the Frontier customer focus. Frontier’s consistent expense control resulted in a 2.6% decline from Q2 2009 in our adjusted cash operating expenses, which is in line with our 3% revenue reduction.
Adjusted EBITDA margins were steady and strong at 54%. This adjusted margin excludes $37 million of merger integration expenses incurred in connection to the Verizon transaction, as well as our adjustments for non-cash pension expense and severance cost.
Due to the revenue initiatives and the expense controls we have in place, we are reaffirming our legacy Frontier guidance of adjusted EBITDA margins in the 53% to 56% range.
As it relates to our integration cost in connection with the acquisition and integration activities, consistent with the expectations we have previously communicated, we are projecting approximately $100 million of transaction and integration expenses in 2010 in total, of which, $47 million has been spent for Q2.
Our capital expenditures were $86 million for the second quarter. Of that amount, $53 million was for legacy Frontier, which puts us at approximately 42% of our $220 million to $240 million 2010 CapEx guidance. Seasonally higher spending in the second half will increase this level of spending.
Spending in the legacy Frontier markets continues to focus on network quality and expansion of broadband speeds in the three megabit tiers and above. Our integration CapEx estimate for 2010 remains $180 million, of which, $62 million has been spent through Q2.
We did not have any material scheduled debt reductions during the quarter and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at June 30 was four times. The next day, July 1, we closed on our transaction with Verizon, which was a significant deleveraging event for Frontier. On a pro forma basis, our leverage at 12/31/09 was 2.6 times before synergies. We expect to provide you with updated figures in November.
Our new $750 million revolving credit facility became effective at closing, which enhances our liquidity. In the New Frontier, we have 2011 maturities of under $300 million and 2012 maturities of under $200 million.
I would now like to give you an update on our integration activities and the operating results of the acquired properties. For integration activities, in what we call the Frontier 13 states, excluding West Virginia if you would, we have completed all 10 of our July monthly billing cycles during the month on schedule.
In West Virginia, which now runs on the same billing platform as legacy Frontier, we have completed and mailed 10 of the 11 July billing cycles, and we are within five days of our normal billing dates.
As investors, what you should take away from this is, is that one of the most critical aspects of system conversion has gone very well. Cash in opening balance receivables is coming in and cash from July billings from new properties is also coming in.
In addition, out of the 1.5 million customers, these email addresses need to be migrated over to frontier.com by October 15, 2010. Over 350,000 have already been converted with minimal customer impact. This demonstrates another critical integration step is well along to being accomplished.
On our operating metrics, we have received June 30, 2010, operating unit results from Verizon in the same format that we had been reporting to you previously. Access lines as of June 30, 2010, were 3,989,000, down 118,000 sequentially. This represents a 2.9% sequential decline and an 11.2% decline year-over-year, which is consistent with last quarter.
High-Speed Internet subscribers representing both the DSL and FiOS technologies were 1,057,000 with a Q2 net loss of approximately 9,500. This included a gain of approximately 3,300 FiOS Internet subscribers and a loss of approximately 12,800 DSL subscribers, a trend that is similar to what Verizon reported in its consolidated Q2 financials.
This loss reflects the low capital investment and broadband availability in the acquired properties as well as the lack of any significant promotions or incentives during the quarter. I would like to remind you that the broadband availability in these properties is approximately 64% compared to legacy Frontier at 92%. We plan to drive market share by expanding broadband reach and implementing our local go-to-market strategies.
FiOS TV subscribers were approximately 117,000 with net adds of approximately 2,900 for Q2. DIRECTV subscribers were approximately 216,200 with net adds of approximately 4,100 for Q2 and revenue Q2 2010 was $918 million, which is down 1.9% sequentially and 9% over Q2 2009.
These operating statistics and financial results are slightly softer than our original overall estimates, but we remain very comfortable with the assets we’ve committed to buy in May 2009, and most importantly, we believe that we can a make very positive impact on the customer metrics and cash flows in these markets driving value for all of our stakeholders.
In summary, we continue to deliver on the legacy Frontier base you expected from us. One, successfully managed the legacy Frontier business, which our Q2 results demonstrate. Two, close the Verizon transaction, which we did successfully with $3.2 billion of financing, the issuance of equity near the midpoint of the caller and with regulatory conditions put forth in our financial guidance that are aligned with our strategic business line.
Three, ensure that West Virginia’s systems are ready for conversion at closing and the 13 state systems are tested and working, which we’ve demonstrated through our billing cycles and our operations in markets since July 1. We believe our company is extremely well positioned to serve all of our stakeholders at the New Frontier.
Customers can expect continuous improvements in our service and product solutions. Employees can expect an exciting organization driven to win. Debt holders can expect us to remain focused on our 2.5 times leverage target and prudently manage our capital structure and maturity schedule.
Last but not least, shareholders can expect us to dramatically improve the performance of the acquired properties wisely deploying residual free cash flow and drive increase in value in Frontier stock.
With that, let me pass the call back to Doris to open the call up to questions.

We have noticed over the last couple of years, when we spend on promotions we can drive share, and we do that in a segmented way and we do it in bundled products. We have already started to run promotions, as I said, as of August 1, in just the last of couple of days we have seen very strong take on the broadband platform. So we do think there is still opportunity to drive share.
One of the things though is we are 92% reach in our markets, and have been there for over a year. So, we have continued to push to get market share onto our platform in our legacy Frontier market, and we’ve always had positive broadband growth on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
When you look at the Verizon markets, as Don mentioned, there was negative broadband in the second quarter, and that has been a trend for those markets. But we think a lot of that has to with availability, it has to do with, not being customer facing in the processes of how they deliver service in these markets, not a lot of local engagement, not a lot of promotion. But we are still optimistic on a growing broadband overall into those markets.
We’re, as I mentioned, aggressively putting a build plan together to make sure that we are driving to increase our reach in the new markets. I would say it’s going to be somewhere between 6% and 7%, so that would take us from 64% up into 70% to 72% reach by the end of the year.
And then we are following with each of those build plans in every single location very aggressive promotion and channel door-to-door, outbound telemarketing, direct mail to capture penetration as we build. So, we will be able to give you a better sense in November, but we are in the planning stage to make that happen as we speak.

While we were even in the throes of the West Virginia approval process where there was a lot of noise in the system, we continued to contract negotiate in other locations and actually find a number of CWA contracts during that period of time, and we continue to do that.
In West Virginia, we inherited the Verizon contracts and there is actually a standard clause in that contract that’s called a service emergency. The title is a misnomer because you evoke that clause whenever you want to have technicians work overtime, it’s sort of your pass as Company to get techs work overtime and it also allows us to bring technicians in from other location to help with the work load.
Verizon has evoked this many times. In West Virginia before we took over the properties. A lot of times this will happen when you have a state of emergency for weather or some kind of a network outage issue. So, it was a standard procedure that we did in order to make sure that we followed the union protocol to get our employees, our techs in West Virginia to be able to work overtime.
I spent several days in West Virginia with our technicians. They are excited about Frontier taking over these properties. They are excited about our commitment to broadband in West Virginia. They know that that helps with job security for them to be more competitive in the marketplace, and many of them are working overtime, and the technicians that we brought in from other locations, many of them are CWA workers from around the country to help with the backlog. So, we don’t believe that there is any material issues with our union relationships in West Virginia or anywhere else where we do business.

But I would also make sure to point out that FiOS is a fiber-to-the-home, and so that data line to that home is extremely importance, so getting that customer on high-speed, whether its DSL technology or fiber-to-the-home is actually the number one priority for us, and the incremental investments and operating expenses on a video platform worthwhile for that investment, and how does it interplay with churn, we’re going through that analysis, and we’ll get that done shortly.

They are thrilled to be part of Frontier. They are enthusiastic. They are engaged as I mentioned, and they know that their markets have not gotten attention over the last several years. And so, they are really feeling good that we are the type of Company that will focus on customers and really help them be able to have the tools and capabilities to win in the marketplace.
So, on the positive side, I would say that’s the biggest surprise. I would say, in any acquisition, especially one like this where we tripled our size, the biggest issue is really getting the processes of how Verizon did business customer facing. We had the same issues as you mentioned, when I got here almost six years ago, we had five or six different billing systems. We had acquisitions that have been done that we were integrating and we were not customer facing everywhere where we did business. It took us several years to get the entire organization realigned and really streamline and simplify those processes. So, they were competitive advantage processes in the marketplace.
That’s the biggest heavy lifting we’re going to have to do, on the technician side, in terms of one tech out for any jobs that we have to do, from a dispatch perspective or repair perspective, making sure that our techs finish the job and don’t move on to the next one because they got productivity measures but stay to complete the job on behalf of the customer.
And I would say the other heavy lifting is in the customer service area. We have inherited 14 call centers that are discreetly functional. There is a fiber call center and a data call center and a voice call center and the customer calls the Company. The customer doesn’t know which center to call. So, there is a lot of transferring of customers right now.
So, we’re in the process of taking a look at how they’re set-up, how we can start to move to universal reps in our call centers. So, it’s one call resolution, one stop shopping. And, again, it’s not about how many minutes or seconds you are on the phone with a customer. It’s about resolving the customers’ issue the first time without having to transfer that customer.
So, I would say those are the two biggest process areas that we’re going to need to spend a fair amount of time focused on, and it’s going to take us several quarters to right size what I’m talking about here, but we’re going to put our heads down and move as fast as we possibly can. But we are seeing employees changing process on your day-to-day activity every single day now, that’s their part of Frontier and I think our local engagement makes a huge difference in giving employees permission to do what’s right for customers. They have not felt they’ve had that permission to do so in the past.

If I shift over to Washington for what we are seeing there, there is a lot of activity I think as you know on the Universal Service funding and the intercarrier compensation, I think that there will be a notice of proposed rulemaking that will come out of the FCC possibly in the fourth quarter of this year. If there is going to be any changes that would be the earliest 2011
I think you have also seen Boucher, Lee put out a bill, a proposed bill on Universal Service funding that would give permission to the FCC to be able to shift funding to broadband. We are very bullish on that build. We’ve actually worked with Congressman Boucher’s office on the concept that they have in that bill, so we’re very supportive of it.
We also think that no matter what happens with Universal Service funding and intercarrier compensation, it will be a transition and there will be a number of things that get cleaned up, including phantom traffic issues and the ability to charge for IT terminating traffic that we don’t have that capability to do today.
So there are checks and balances that we think would be positive, but I don’t foresee anything happening in the short-term. I think it’s probably over the next six months to 12 months and there will be a lot of stakeholders betting on that subject. Net neutrality, there was a lot of behind closed doors discussions with the FCC with regard to Title I, Title II, Title II Lite, is there really jurisdiction on the part of the FCC to make these changes and I think there is a big push to try to do something that will not hurt investment in broadband and to clear up the uncertainty, because right now that’s the biggest issue I think for all of us is the uncertainty of not knowing what’s going to happen.

Recognizing obviously the EBITDA number adjustments that you’re trying to make are complex, could you just give us the unadjusted Verizon numbers that would comp to the filings that we’ve seen before if you have them, which you clearly do?
The second question would just be the merger and integration costs this quarter. Could you divide them between what was West Virginia and what was other stuff? As we think about the model going forward, where is the dividing line going to be, for instance, are the sales people that are being hired for enterprise, merger and integration expense, are those recurring, are the West Virginia people recurring or separated out, that would be helpful?
My last question if I could, would be, it sounds like the game plan, the go-forward game plan in the Verizon properties to arrest this 11.2% rate of line decline is to go promote more heavily, re-train the workers, make friends with the unions, hire new people and it seems like there is a lot of spending and not so much saving that goes into that process. So if you could just balance out that being able to cut cost and cut into an 11% plus rate of line decline will be helpful?

On the 13 states CapEx, capital expenditures spent on the network in terms of getting integration working, so we are in the midst of finalizing and to continue to enhance on the network side. We’ve got a number of opportunities to reduce expense, reduce some of our backbone costs, reduce some circuit costs, put it in our own backbone and that will be some continued expenditures we’re going to make on the network in the 13 states. And then we’re building the process.
Just started developing our plans from moving the 13 state systems on to one single platform, and we want to have that plan done in the next several weeks and then be able to start implementing beginning at the end of fourth quarter and to get all that done by the end of 2012. But I think the 80% to 90% is my best read of that.
There was also a cost we had spent on FiOS, setting that up. Setting up interactive media guide and some other areas in FiOS, but I think 80% to 90% I would say is really around West Virginia. It should not, however, give you an indication of what the integration costs you’re going to have to be for the 13 states, and I’d say that because in this transaction when we did the West Virginia systems conversion, we did not have the luxury of utilizing full time another IT department.
What we are now doing is we now had an additional IT organization acquired, and we’ll be able to utilize the people and experience that we acquired with these new employees along with our legacy employees to work on the 13 states, so it should be significant less cost to do the other implementations over the next two and half years.

We’re going to have to retrain employees and we make friends with the unions every day, so that’s not any additional overhead that we already have in the Company. But, yes, hiring new people, getting the right people on the right seats on the bus, launching product, broadband build out, those are cost associated with us driving that number down.
But let me say on the flipside, there is a lot of cost saving opportunity. When we went to full installs at legacy Frontier, we didn’t add a technician. What we did is, we realigned the work, and by realigning that work and having a full install for high speed, we reduced churn dramatically for high speed in the first 90 days to 120 days.
So, the counterpoint is the revenue gains that you get when you change the paradigm and get customer focused is about growth, and it’s about keeping existing customers. Reduction in repeat trouble calls. That’s a big expense to the Company today in the 13 states in West Virginia and getting the network quality improved changes that paradigm.
Reducing the number of multiple calls to customer service today, so as you start to realign the business, you start to take cost out of the complexity of how the business is operated today, and those costs are fairly substantial in these markets. We also look at spans and layers, and the organization is set up today where you have a lot of people checking a lot of people’s work. By having people take ownership and are empowered to do the work themselves and make those decisions, you can remove those extra jobs that today don’t add value to the bottom line.
So, net-net, I sort of look at this business to say, today we have lot of activity and a lot of cost about trying to manage downside instead of drive proactive upside, and I think it’s going to take us a bit to turn the ship here, but we’ve done it in our legacy market. I know we can do it in these markets and it’s just a matter of getting over the hump and getting things more customer-focused, and we will start to see material changes in revenue growth and a reduction in lost customers, which is the biggest driver of profitability for this business.

So, my saying about 80% to 90% being West Virginia, sort of was picking that one out of my mind and keeping that sort of separate. It was about $105 million that was specific for the 13 states. It was a payment for the license cost for those 13 state systems. Hopefully that also helps. Operator, one more question please.

First is about reduction of access line losses, and we have a pretty aggressive goal where we’ve taken the run rate of line losses of the Company and we’ve looked to bring that down by a percentage, it’s like 5% or something like this to get everybody focused on keeping customers from an access line perspective.
The second goal is to expand and build High-Speed Internet and to drive penetration and market share on High-Speed Internet throughout all of the properties. And then the third objective is about local engagement. We’ve hired the general managers. We’ve created the market clusters and Verizon managed all of the technicians, the installation repair and COO techs from a centralized basis. They didn’t do it on a local basis.
So, what we are doing is transitioning the workforce to the local market, and we’ve got 102 locations where we have to do that. Just in the last 30 days, we’ve done 40% of them, so we are moving very fast to get all of the employees for specific markets under the leadership of the general managers for local engagement, and to have a better handle on the business.
So, stemming access line losses, growing aggressive High-Speed Net and maximizing local engagement are really the top three objectives and priorities. Everything else that we’ll do, whether that’s how the call center gets measured from a metrics perspective which in the Frontier binocular is first call resolution and sales, that’s what we’re going to put into all of these properties too, those all support those three goals. That’s how we look at the business.

I appreciate you joining our call today to discuss second quarter 2010 results for Frontier Communications Corporation. I'll begin with the review of our second quarter, followed by an update of our Verizon acq",1756,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining our call today to discuss second quarter 2010 results for Frontier Communications Corporation. I'll begin with the review of our second quarter, followed by an update of our Verizon acquisition, which closed July 1.
Please note that this is the last quarter that we will be discussing the financial results of the legacy Frontier business. In early November, we will begin reporting third quarter financials as the new Frontier, which includes both legacy and new operation.
Our second quarter 2010 results are a solid transition to our focus on the large opportunities in the new properties. Frontier's revenues were $516 million and adjusted operating cash flow or EBITDA was $279 million, which represents an industry-leading 54% margin. Frontier generated free cash flow of $134 million in the second quarter and paid 58% of this to our shareholders as dividends.
Frontier's results this quarter showed the stability and profitability of our business even during a period without major promotion and with many of our employees actively preparing for the closing and integration of the Verizon acquisition. I am proud of our employees' focus on the goal of keeping Frontier number one with our customers. 
This was reflected in a revenue decline of just 3% year-over-year, which is the third straight quarter of an improved revenue loss rate and is the lowest level since the second quarter of 2008. Our success in driving and managing each product line to maximize profitability, and we are constantly selling additional products to our customers.
In Residential, Frontier posted sequential revenue growth and a 4.7% year-over-year increase in average monthly revenue per customer to $60. Our sales force drove these results in the competitive market by driving incremental revenue share with each customer, with a constant focus on bundled services. We did not lower pricing to drive growth, and our customer base remained high quality with low 1.4% churn and 60% of our residential customers on Price Protection Plan.
High-speed Internet net additions were 3,400 units, lower than historical levels. This reflected reduced promotional activity driven by information technology and billing system limitation in preparation for the Verizon transaction. Nevertheless, high-speed churn remains at a low 1.5%, average revenue per user remained stable at approximately $40 and residential high-speed Internet subscribers on Price Protection Plan grew to more than 80%. 
This focus on profitability and quality growth as opposed to market share achieved through low pricing and high churn continues to have positive impact on Frontier's bottom line. More importantly, it places a higher value component on broadband by our customers.
We expect to positively impact our High-Speed business through increasing the availability of higher-speed tiers with a focus on three to six meg. I want to add that we offer 20 meg service in many markets today, and industry equipment providers are now testing 300 megabits per second DSL services. Our customers and networks have a vast future.
In Commercial, which is 49% of our customer revenue, the Q2 result showed the positive impact of our efforts in this segment. Our revenues were up 2% sequentially, the first increase in more than a year. And revenues were down only 1% year-over-year, the lowest decline in over a year. Monthly average revenue per business customer grew 6.1% year-over-year to $518. The increased size and focus of our sales team is driving these results across the Carrier, Enterprise and Small Business segments.
Some notable wins during the quarter include Internet access and a Wide Area Network for 13 institutions in the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Pennsylvania; advanced IP switching deployment for the distance learning company, Penn Foster, in 63 sites; VoIP system installation for school districts in Georgia, Minnesota and Arizona; high-speed capacity fiber data transmission networks to several enterprise accounts in the greater Rochester, New York market.
Relative to our cable and CLEC competition, customers appreciate our reliability, capability, size and full-service suite, including PPE end-to-end managed services, E911, fiber solutions and advanced IP. We continue to believe our Commercial business can deliver further growth potential as the economy improves. In the acquired properties, business accounts will begin to experience the personal relationship of local sales account executives, who will work closely with our new general managers. This is a big opportunity for Frontier.
In summary, we delivered on the financial goals we've set out for you. This consistency is a hallmark of our business, and we are enthusiastic about the opportunity to manage our new property in the same fashion. It's important to note that this consistent execution doesn't happen without dedicated employees. Our legacy Frontier employees were able to perform at very high levels despite the demands of the transaction. And our new employees from the acquired properties have been working nonstop to ensure a smooth transition for customers.
On that note, I'd like to update you about the Verizon acquisition, particularly with regard to our integration, broadband, marketing and employee activities. First, integration. Our systems cutover in West Virginia began at closing on July 1 after more than a year of preparation. A week later, we finished the cutover a week ahead of schedule, and the first cycle bills were received by customers during the week of July 12. Approximately 250 Frontier employees were brought into West Virginia to help with the cutover and subsequent customer call volumes and network installation and repair. 
We have significantly reduced the backlog that we inherited and that also built during the cutover in initial billing cycle, as it does with any conversion. We will keep extra resources in West Virginia until the backlog reverts to normal business-as-usual levels and until all billing cycles are completed. In the other 13 states, no system cutover was necessary, and the transition to Frontier ownership has gone smoothly. In the coming months, we will begin formulating our plans to drive the 13-state system to a single common platform, as we expect to complete this process by the end of 2012.
Broadband. At closing, our engineering team had full access to the network and have begun implementing our broadband expansion plan. In West Virginia, we have already deployed broadband service to customers' premises that did not have broadband access prior to Frontier. By the end of August, we will be deploying broadband across the remaining 13 states. Our strategy is to quickly build broadband where it doesn't exist or to turn it on where the network capability is already in place but electronics or DSLAM cards were lacking.  We plan to aggressively build out tens of thousands of new residences and businesses between now and the end of the year.
On the marketing front, we began our marketing activities well in advance of closing, including the design of service bundles and pricing that would be offered in West Virginia on our own systems and in the other 13 states acquired. Across all of these properties, we implemented our Take the Lead initiative program, by which all employees can be compensated for generating leads that turn into sales. We saw hundreds of leads in just the first few days of ownership.
In West Virginia, we've launched an aggressive residential offer with two months of free DISH with unlimited digital phone and High-Speed Max. We also launched a commercial Double Play of voice and high-speed Internet, which has been successful out of the gate. We supported our launch with local media, including radio, newspaper, freestanding inserts, outdoor, advertising and local engagement marketing.
In all states, we rolled out our new brand awareness campaign. I encourage you to see it on our website, frontier.com. It positions Frontier as the conversation company that gives our customers something to talk about, reliable phone service, fast broadband, great video and the best value on quality communications services. We also emphasized our 100% All-American customer service team. In fact, all of our Frontier employees are U.S.-based.
Our brand media tactics in the 13 states included those I just described for West Virginia, and we even painted 12 roadside barns with the new Frontier logo. In the new 13 states, we have launched a special residential Triple Play offer with DIRECTV that includes a free NFL package. We are working on implementing additional promotions and offers for Q4.
In Frontier's legacy markets, we launched an aggressive high-speed Internet promotion on August 1, targeted at new customers and winbacks. The offer is only available in Double and Triple Play bundles. And based on our past experience, we believe that we can drive incremental market share with all of these offers.
On the employee front, at closing, we welcomed 9,200 employees to Frontier's existing 5,600. Our senior leadership team went across the country to meet with virtually every new employee, and we're seeing enthusiasm, excitement and engagement. Our goal in the new property is to become as customer-facing as we are in the legacy Frontier market. A critical step in that process is the implementation of Frontier's local area manager structure. We hired and trained over 60 new general managers prior to closing, and they are ramping up in their markets. We are also giving all of our new employees the tools and training to empower them to provide the best possible experience to our customers. 
In summary, we're off to a good start. We completed our transaction on signed and as expected. Our successful West Virginia conversion processes is well under way. We believe that the solid Q2 2010 results give you an indication of what we plan to achieve with these new properties. These achievements will be driven by all employees engaging customers in a new way, which drives significant cash flow potential by selling more products, expanding broadband and improving our combined cost structure.
There is much to do to move the integration activities along and achieve the synergies we have promised. In just 30 days though, I am more confident than ever that we can and will deliver on your expectations. Our financial house is in very good shape with lower leverage, credit metrics approaching investment-grade and a stable annual dividend of $0.75. I will end by thanking our employees, our customers and our investors. You got us here and we're glad you are part of the new Frontier.
Let me now hand the call over to Don Shassian, our Chief Financial Officer, who will give you the financial overview for the second quarter of 2010 and some color on the Q2 financial performance in our new market. Don?"
261171,108550658,72122,"Frontier Communications Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-04-2010",2010-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Frontier Communications Parent, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Maggie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Frontier's Q2 2010 financial results showed continued strong financial performance. This marks the 10th consecutive quarter we delivered an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 54",1808,"Thank you, Maggie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Frontier's Q2 2010 financial results showed continued strong financial performance. This marks the 10th consecutive quarter we delivered an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 54%, which we've achieved by growing customer revenue and reducing operating expenses, all while lowering our reliance on any exposure to regulatory revenues. Our free cash flow in Q2 was $134 million, which puts as well under way toward our legacy Frontier guidance of $450 million to $475 million for 2010.
I would also like to note that our Q2 2010 earnings per share of $0.11 includes the after tax impact of merger and integration costs. Our adjusted EPS excluding these costs was $0.19. Today, I'll walk you through Frontier's core operating results and provide an update on our integration activities. I'll also provide you with an updated operating metrics and financials for the acquired properties. 
During this call, we are going to focus primarily on our Legacy business. Financial metrics and guidance discussed during this call will be for legacy Frontier only. Obviously, our acquired properties' financial performance and guidance for the future is important to all of our stakeholders. On our Q3 earnings call in early November, we expect to provide the following: Reporting on a combined basis an analysis and plan for achieving our targeted cost savings and updated guidance at that time.
Customer revenue for the second quarter was $436 million, which is a 1.1% sequential lift, second straight quarter of positive growth. On a year-over-year basis, customer revenue declined just 2%, which is better than the 3.6% decline in Q2 2009. The improvement in customer revenue is coming from continued positive growth in data and Internet services and slowing revenue declines in local and long distance. As I'll discuss momentarily, this is largely a function of growing products per customer, raising our average monthly revenue per customer and solidly low churn.
Switched access minutes of use were down 8.7% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2010 and switched access and subsidy revenues fell 8.2% over the same period. This rate of decline is more in line with our historical trend as Q1 2010 results were favorably impacted by higher U.S. debt [ph] (1:09:47) contribution factors. Switched access and subsidy were just 15.6% of our total revenues during Q2, down from 16.4% in Q2 2009 and 18% in Q2 2008.
Our reliance on any exposure to regulatory revenue continued to decrease, as the acquired properties' 2009 regulatory revenue is 10% of this total revenue compared to legacy Frontier's 17% in 2009. With the continued decline we experienced in Q2 2010, we expect our revenue in switched access and subsidy on a pro forma basis including the acquired properties to be approximately 13% of total revenue. And if it only excludes surcharges that we bill customers and remit to third parties like Mecca, our true exposure to switched access and subsidy support is below 11%.
Let me now turn to some of the customer metrics behind our revenue performance. Although we still report our traditional access line in detail, the additional customer disclosure gives you insight in how we manage and measure ourselves internally. 
The Q2 2010 residential customer base is down 7.5% compared to Q2 2009. This is lower than our reported residential access line decline of 7.7%. The better customer performance reflects a year-over-year reduction in churn to 1.37% and a 4.5% increase in products sold to customers, which helped increase our average revenue per customer by 4.7%, an improvement over the growth rates of the past two quarters. Sequentially, our overall residential customer revenue was up slightly and our year-over-year base is down 2.9% compared to 5% year-over-year decline in Q2 2009.
Frontier served 139,000 business customers at the end of second quarter of 2010, slightly up sequentially and down 5.7% from Q2 2009. This was a solid improvement in the 7.8% year-over-year loss rate we reported last quarter. We managed our business customers across the three different segments: Wholesale Carrier, Enterprise Medium and Small ROHO, Residential Home Office. 
We saw stable trends year-over-year in our Wholesale and Enterprise customer levels but a decline in our Small ROHO customers, a consistent trend in this business segment of our customer base has been most affected by the downturn in the economy. However, the average revenue per customer in Small ROHO is lower, which, therefore, did not impact our ability to deliver overall average revenue per customer growth in Commercial segment in the quarter. 
Our total business customer ARPU for Q2 2010 was at $518, a 6.1% increase over Q2 2009 levels. As Maggie mentioned earlier, our focus on commercial accounts has increased in 2010, and we expect it to favorably impact our results in the future. At 49% of Frontier's customer revenues, Commercial is a big part of the Frontier customer focus.
Frontier's consistent expense control resulted in 2.6% decline from Q2 2009 in our adjusted cash operating expenses, which is in line with our 3% revenue reduction. Adjusted EBITDA margins were steady and strong 54%. This adjusted margin excludes $37 million of merger and integration expenses in further connection with the Verizon transaction, as well as our adjustments for non-cash pension expense and severance costs. Due to revenue initiatives and expense controls we have in place, we are reaffirming our legacy Frontier guidance of adjusted EBITDA margins in the 53% to 56% range.
As it relates to integration costs in connection with acquisition and integration activities, consistent with the expectations we have previously communicated, we are projecting approximately $100 million of transaction and integration expenses in 2010 in total, of which $47 million has been spent for Q2.
Our capital expenditures were $86 million in the second quarter. Of that amount, $53 million was for legacy Frontier, which puts us in approximately 42% of our $220 million to $240 million 2010 CapEx guidance. Seasonally higher spending in the second half will increase this level of spending. Spending in the legacy Frontier market continues to focus on network quality and expansion of broadband speed in the three megabit tiers and above. Our integration CapEx estimate for 2010 remains $180 million, of which $62 million has been spent through Q2.
We do not have any material scheduled debt reductions during the quarter, and our net debt to adjusted to EBITDA ratio of June 30 was 4x. The next day, July 1, we closed our transaction with Verizon, which was a significant deleveraging event for Frontier. On a pro forma basis, our leverage at 12/31/09 was 2.6x before synergies. We expect to provide you with updated figures in November. 
Our new $750 million revolving credit facility became effective at closing, which enhances our liquidity. In the new Frontier, we have 2011 maturities of under $300 million and 2012 maturities of under $200 million.
I would now like to give you an update on our integration activities and the operating results for the acquired properties.  For integration activities, in what we call the Frontier 13 states, excluding West Virginia, if you would, we had completed all 10 of our July monthly billing cycles during the month on schedule. In West Virginia, which now runs in the same billing platform as legacy Frontier, we have completed and mailed 10 of the 11 July billing cycles and we're open five days of our normal billing dates. As investors, what you should take away from this is that one of the most critical aspects of system conversion has gone very well. 
Cash on opening balances receivables is coming in and cash from July billings from new properties is also coming in. In addition, out of the 1.5 million customers whose e-mail addresses need to be migrated over to Frontier.com by October 15, 2010, over 350,000 have already been converted with minimal customer impact. This demonstrates another critical integration step is well along to being accomplished.
For Operating metrics, we have received June 30, 2010 operating unit results from Verizon the same format that we have been reporting to you previously. Access lines as of June 30, 2010 were 3,989,000, down 118,000 sequentially. This represents a 2.9% sequential decline and an 11.2% decline year-over-year, which is consistent with last quarter.
High-Speed Internet subscribers representing both DSL and FiOS Technologies were 1,057,000 with a Q2 net loss of approximately 9,500. This included a gain of approximately 3,300 FiOS Internet subscribers and a loss of approximately 12,800 DSL subscribers, a trend that is similar to what Verizon reported in consolidated Q2 financials. This loss reflects the low capital investment in broadband availability in acquired properties as well as a lack of any significant promotions or incentives during the quarter. 
I would like to remind you that the broadband availability in these properties is approximately 64% compared to legacy Frontier at 92%. We plan to drive market share by expanding broadband reach and implementing our local go-to-market strategies. 
FiOS TV subscribers were approximately 117,000 with net adds of approximately 2,900 for Q2.  DirecTV subscribers were approximately 216,200 with net adds of approximately 4,100 for Q2. And revenue for Q2 2010 was $918 million, which is down 1.9% sequentially and 9% over Q2 2009. These operating statistics and financial results are slightly softer than our original overall estimates, but we remain very comfortable of the assets we've committed to buy in May, 2009. And most importantly, we believe that we make a very positive impact on the customer metrics and cash flows in these markets while we increased value for all of our stakeholders. 
In summary, we continue to deliver on the legacy Frontier base you expected from us: One, successfully managed the legacy Frontier business, which our Q2 results demonstrate; two, close the Verizon Transaction, which we did with a successful $3.2 billion of our financing, the issuance of equity near the midpoint of the collar, and with regulatory conditions that fall within our financial guidance that are aligned with our strategic business plans; three, ensure the West Virginia systems are ready for conversion at closing and the 13 states systems are tested and working, which we had demonstrated to our billing cycles in our operations and markets in July 1.
We believe our company is extremely well positioned to serve all our stakeholders as the new Frontier. Customers can expect continuous improvements in their service and product solutions. Employees can expect an exciting organization driven to win. Debt holders can expect us to remain focused on our 2.5x leverage target and prudently manage our capital structure and maturity schedule.  And last but not least, shareholders can expect us to dramatically improve the performance of the acquired properties, wisely deploying residual free cash flow and drive increasing value in Frontier stock. 
With that, let me pass the call back to Doris to open the call to questions."

We did not do any material promotions in the second quarter, but nor did we see any top in churn from a competitive perspective. We have noticed over the last couple of years when we spend on promotions, we can drive share. And we do that in a segmented way and we do it in bundled products. We have already started to run promotion, as I said as of August 1, and just the last couple of days, we have seen very strong take on the broadband platform. So we do think there's still opportunity to drive share. One of the things, though, is we are 92% reach our market and have been there for over a year. So we have continued to push to get market share on to our platform in our legacy Frontier markets. And we've always had positive broadband growth on a quarter-by-quarter basis. When you look at the Verizon markets, as Don mentioned, there was negative broadband in the second quarter, and that has been the trend for those markets. So we think a lot of that has to do with availability, has to do with not being customer facing in the processes of how they deliver service in these markets, not a lot of local engagement, not a lot of promotion. So we are still optimistic on growing broadband overall into those markets. We are, as I mentioned, aggressively putting a build plan together to make sure that we are driving to increase our reach in the new markets. I would say it's going to be somewhere between 6% and 7%. So that would take us from 64% up into 70% to 72% reach by the end of the year. And then, we are following with each of those build plans in every single location, very aggressive promotion, door-to-door, outbound telemarketing, direct mail to capture penetration as we build. So we'll be able to give you a better sense in November, but we are in the planning stage to make that happen as we speak."

We are in good shape with our unions across the country. If you think about it, CWA [Communications Workers of America], IBEW [International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers], UNITE HERE, we have a number of unions we do business with. Between 40% and 50% of our employees are with CWA. While we were even in the throes of the West Virginia approval process where there's a lot of noise in the system, we continue to contract negotiate in other locations and actually signed a number of CWA contracts during that period of time, and we continue to do that. In West Virginia, we inherited the Verizon contract. And there's actually a standard clause in that contract that's called a service emergency. The title is a misnomer because you evoke that clause whenever you want to have technicians work overtime. It's sort of your pass as a company to get techs to work overtime. And it also
allows us to bring technician in from other locations to help us the workload. Verizon has evoked this many times in West Virginia before we took over the properties. A lot of times, this will happen when you have a state of emergency for weather or some kind of a network outage issue. So it was a standard procedure that we did in order to make sure that we followed union protocol to get our employees, our techs in West Virginia to be able to work overtime. I spent several days in West Virginia with our technicians. They are excited about Frontier taking over these properties. They're excited about our commitment to broadband in West Virginia. They know that, that helps with job security for them to be more competitive in the marketplace, and many of them are working over time. And the technicians that we brought in from other locations, many of them are CWA workers from around the country, to help with the backlog.

They are thrilled to be part of Frontier. They are enthusiastic. They are engaged, as I mentioned. And they know that their markets have not gotten attention over the last several years. And so they are really feeling good that we're the type of company that will focus on customers and really help them be able to have the tools and capabilities to win in the marketplace. So on the positive side, I would say that's the biggest surprise. I would say, in any acquisition, especially in one like this where we triple our size, the biggest issue is really getting the processes of how Verizon did business, customer facing. We had the same issues as you mentioned. When I gone here almost six years ago, we had five or six different billing systems. We had acquisitions that have been done that we were integrating. And we were not customer-facing everywhere where we did business, it took us several years to get the entire organization realigned and really streamline and simplify those processes. So they were competitive advantage processes in the marketplace. That's the biggest heavy lifting we're going to have to do, on the technicians side, in terms of one tech out for any job that we have to do, from a dispatch perspective, a repair perspective, making sure that our tech finish the job and double onto the next one because they've got productivity measures, but stay to complete the job on behalf of the customer. And I would say, as the other heavy lifting is in the customer service area. We have inherited 14 call centers, that are discreetly functional. Their a fiber call center and a data call center and a voice call center. The customer calls the company, the customer doesn't know what center to call. So there's a lot of transferring of customers right now. So we're in the process of taking a look at how they're set up, how we can start to move to universal reps in our call centers, so it's one-call resolution, one-stop shopping. Again, it's not about how many minutes or seconds you're on the phone with a customer, it's about resolving the customer's issue the first time without having to transfer that customer. So I would say those are the two biggest process areas that we're going to need to spend a fair amount of time focused on. And it's going to take us several quarters to rightsize what I'm talking about here, but we're going to put our heads down and move as fast as we possibly can. But we are seeing employees changing processes on their day-to-day activity every single day now that's their part of Frontier. And I think our local engagement makes a huge difference in giving employees permission to do what's right for customers. They have not felt they've had that permission to do so in the past."

If there is going to be any changes that would be, the earliest, 2011, I think you've also seen a voucher. We believe put out a bill, our proposed bill on Universal Service Funding that would give permission to the FCC to be able to shift funding to broadband. We are very bullish on that bill. We've actually worked with Congressman Boucher's office on the concepts that they have in that bill. So we're very supportive of it. We also think that no matter what happens with Universal Service Funding and intercarrier compensation, it will be a transition. And there'll be a number of things that get cleaned up, including phantom traffic issues and the ability to charge for IP-terminating traffic that we don't have that capability to do today. So there are checks and balances that we think would be positive. But I don't foresee anything happening in the short term. I think it's probably over the next six to 12 months. And there will be a lot of stakeholders betting on that subject. Net neutrality, there's a lot of behind-closed-door discussions with the FCC with regards to Title I, Title II, Title II to why is there really jurisdiction on the part of the FCC to make these changes. And I think there is a big push to try to do something that will not hurt investment in broadband and to clear up the uncertainty.

That will be helpful. And I guess my last question, if I could, would be, it sounds like the go-forward game plan in the Verizon properties to kind of arrest this 11.2% rate of line decline is to go promote more heavily in retrain the workers, make friends with the unions, hire new people.

And then, we're really in the process, just started developing our plans from moving the 13-state systems onto one single platform. And we want to have that plan done in the next several weeks. And then, be able to start implementing, beginning the end of fourth quarter and to get all that done by the end of 2012. I think 80% to 90%, my best read of that. There was also a cost that was spent on FiOS setting that up. Setting up Interactive Media Guide and in some other areas of FiOS. I think 80% to 90% of it is really on West Virginia. It should not, however, give you an indication of what the integration costs are going to have to be for the 13 states. And I say that because in this transaction, when we did West Virginia systems conversion, we did not have the luxury of utilizing full-time another IT department. What we have done is we now have an additional IT organization required and we'll be able to utilize the people and experience that is part of these new employees along with our legacy employees to work on the 13 states. It should be significantly less cost to do the other implementations over the next 2.5 half years."

So t",419,"David, with regard to the 11.2% access line losses, and how do we stem that tide from across to a savings perspective, you're absolutely right. We're going to have to retrain employees, and we're going to -- we make friends with the Unions every day. So that's not any additional overhead that we already have in the company. But yes, hiring new people, getting the right people in the right seats on the bus, launching products, broadband build out. Those are costs associated with us driving that number down. But let me say on the flip side, there's a lot of cost-saving opportunity. When we went to full installs at legacy Frontier, we didn't add a technician. What we did is we realigned the work. And by realigning that work and having a full install for High-Speed, we reduced churn, dramatically, for High-Speed in the first 90 to 120 days. So the counterpoint is the revenue gains that you get when you change that paradigm and get customer focused is about growth and it's about keeping existing customers. The reduction and repeat travel costs, that's a big expense to the company today in the 13 states in West Virginia, and getting the network quality improved, changes that paradigm. We're reducing the number of multiple calls to customer service today. So as you start to realign the business, you start to take costs out of the complexity of how the business is operated today, and those costs are fairly substantial in these markets. We also look at spans and layers and the organization is set up today where you have a lot of people checking a lot of peoples work. By having people take ownership and are empowered to do the work themselves and make those decisions, you can remove those extra jobs that today don't add value to the bottom line. So net-net, I sort of look at this business to say, today, we have a lot of activity and a lot of costs about trying to manage downside instead of drive proactive upside. And I think it's going to take us a bit to a turn the ship here, but we've done it in our legacy markets. I know we can do it in these markets, and it's just a matter of getting over the hump and getting things more customer-focused and we will start to see material changes in revenue growth and a reduction in lost customers which is the biggest driver of profitability for this business."

First is about reduction of access line losses. And we have a pretty aggressive goal, where we've taken the run rate of line losses of the company, and we've looked to bring that down by a percentage, like 5% or something like this to get everybody focused on keeping customers from an active-line perspective. The second goal is to expand and build High-Speed Internet and to drive penetration and market share on High-Speed Internet throughout all of the properties. And then, the third objective is about local engagement. We've hired the general managers. We've created the market clusters. And Verizon managed all of the technicians, the installation, repair and CEO techs from a centralized basis. They didn't do it on a local basis. So what we are doing is transitioning the workforce to the local markets. And we've got 102 locations, where we have to do that. Just in the last 30 days, we've done 40% of them. So we're moving very fast to get all of the employees for specific markets under the leadership of the general managers for local engagement, and to have a better handle on the business. So stemming access line losses, growing, aggressive High-Speed net and maximizing local engagement are really the top three objectives and priorities. Everything else that we'll do, whether that's how the call center gets measured from a metrics perspective which in the Frontier vernacular is first-call resolution and sales, that's what we're going to put into all of these properties too. Those all support those three goals. That's sort of how we look at the business."

Thank you for joining our call today to discuss third quarter 2010 results for Frontier Communications Corporation. We’re excited to be reporting our first financial results as the new Frontier, following the completion of our July 1st acquisition of Verizon properties. We know that you’ve all been waiting patiently for these numbers and we believe that the wait has been worthwhile.
Frontier’s third quarter results demonstrate the improvements that are already happening in the acquired properties, our confidence in our business plan and the strong and steady results in our legacy business. In Q3 2010, Frontier realized synergies of $63 million in the acquired properties. This is a $252 million annualized rate and was achieved from the elimination of corporate overhead costs and other wage and non-wage synergies.
Looking forward, this permanent reduction along with continued synergy realization, gives us confidence to raise our 2013 synergy run rate estimate by 10% to $550 million. This positive lift to our synergy target is on top of a very solid quarter as the new Frontier.
Our Q3 revenues were $1.4 billion and adjusted operating cash flow or EBITDA of $671 million that represented a strong margin of 48%. We converted this into free cash flow of $339 in the third quarter and paid 55% of this to our shareholders as dividends.
Consistent with our position since we first announced the Verizon transaction, Frontier is successfully managing a business three times its former size in terms of revenues and employees. We believe this success is being driven by strong leadership, a focus on customer sales and retention and by implementing our local engagement model in all new markets.
In the four months that we have owned the acquired properties we have laid a solid foundation for the future business. We manage Frontier’s business internally by focusing on three key drivers of value for our company, people, products and profits. Managing the business this way differentiated Frontier’s legacy business this quarter by driving improved customer metrics, rising ARPU and strong margins.
Let me start with people. As I mentioned, our employees tripled in number at closing and implementing cultural change has been one of our primary missions. Our senior leadership team has met with every one of our employees over the past few months and I have personally met with 11,000 new and legacy Frontier employees, since closing.
Our people are energized and engaged in the Frontier mission and values. They’re truly owners of the company because on July 1st we made every employee a shareholder of Frontier. This gesture linked our legacy and new employees together. All employees are working toward the same three goals, keep and grow access lines, accelerate high-speed Internet deployment and growth, and implement local engagement to enhance the customer experience. Everyone from our call center reps to field technicians knows that these goals will improve the results of our business, sustain jobs and communities, and build on our foundation of quality, reliability and trusted interactions with our customers.
Some examples, we’ve looked at processes and procedures and eliminated what’s unnecessary. This basic blocking and tackling has a big positive financial impact. We have deployed local area managers to our new markets, majority of these managers were trained by Frontier well before close. They now have access to daily sales and retention customer activity that they never had before to help them run their business. You can’t know how you’re doing if you don’t have daily reports on customer gross adds and deactivations.
All 7,000 technicians in our new markets now report to their local area managers, not to a distant centralized group. These technicians are doing full installations for high-speed, keeping two hour appointment windows and will resolve any technical problem a customer experiencing. Each tech is trained to handle voice, high-speed Internet and any other issues pertaining to our network for both business and residential customers.
We have also revamped customer service processes to be more customer-centric. Hours have been expanded to include evenings and weekends. Reps are measured on first call resolution and sales for the first time and all reps now have customer save tools. We have eliminated work that is non-value added and as a result of all of these changes, call transfers are down over 10% and we’re outsourcing 12% less calls to third-party vendors.
Our next step is to train all customer service reps on all customer issues. Once this training is complete in 2011, we will have all Frontier customer service reps as universal reps. Again, this streamlines our service delivery, eliminates transfers and will reduce outsource dependence.
Shifting to product. Frontier’s product goal is to be the provider of choice and increase the number of products that residential and business customers take from us. To achieve this, we are constantly innovating with price simplification and new products and services.
Our newly acquired markets also require an investment to improve the quality of existing services and to increase broadband availability. With these steps, communicated to the customers through local engagement, we expect to drive down churn in the acquired properties and to expand reoccurring customer revenues.
Some examples, Frontier increased broadband availability to over 30,000 homes and businesses in the third quarter. We plan to enable more than 300,000 total homes by year end. Together, this will take broadband availability from 64% at closing to over 70% by year end.
Our network upgrade projects are being implemented in every market. In addition to increased high-speed availability, we are also enhancing speeds and capacity. In Q3, our overall 6-megabyte availability increased from 43% to 50%. All new Frontier markets are now selling new double and triple plays along with value added services like peace of mind. In the past four months, we also completed the huge task of converting a 100% of customer e-mail accounts from verizon.net to frontier.com.
Finally, Frontier just introduced custom value pricing in our legacy markets and in West Virginia. The concept allows customers to build their own bundles by mixing and matching any voice, video or data service. The more they buy, the more they will save with discounts up to 15% on all products and services purchased.
Profit, when we execute on people and products, profit follows because our customers pay us for value and as we have demonstrated in our legacy markets, they will buy more products. To align our employees with the company’s goals we’ve rolled out new performance and compensation metrics in the new markets. These metrics include revenue per customer, number of products the customer takes, retention of access lines and high-speed services and capital efficiency.
Some examples, our Take the Lead program, which rewards employees for referring sales of Frontier products and services generated 3,000 leads in July, 4,300 leads in August and 5,500 leads in September. In commercial sales, the legacy business is strong and West Virginia has built steady momentum in small, medium, enterprise and carrier sales.
In the 13 states, we’re hiring over 50 new sales account positions, our equipment sales initiative is ramping as well in all markets. The wireless backhaul outlook is for double-digit growth and we’re making process improvements in commercial sales and service activities.
Commercial business and residential broadband revenues represent 60% of our total revenue base, which is clearly a positive shift away from access line revenue dependence. Our integration team which did a phenomenal job in West Virginia has been redeployed and is focused on the conversion plan for the remaining 13 states from the current Verizon systems on to our Frontier system.
As I mentioned on the second quarter call, the West Virginia conversion went very well, the best conversion we’ve ever done. And we delivered these results on a very specific time schedule. All of the billing cycles went out on time, call volumes are now back to normal, answer times are on plan and other operational metrics are in line with our legacy Frontier market levels.
Financially, we are in a solid position with a safe and attractive annual dividend of $0.75 per share. We remain committed to our investors and we are committed to improving our cash flow from the acquisition. We are off to a good start but we have a lot more to do.
I look forward to reporting continued progress to you next quarter. On that note, I will now hand the call over to Don Shassian, our Chief Financial Officer, who will give you the financial overview for the third quarter of 2010. Don?

I’m very excited to be reporting our financials to you today. Our third quarter results are a great kickoff to the new Frontier and today’s synergy number and raised guidance should give you comfort that we can dramatically change the cost structure of the acquired properties while growing revenues and investing in future capabilities of the network.
Before we go into the numbers, I want to point out that our discussion is going to focus primarily on the combined company. However, we are providing a supplemental schedule filed via 8-K today and available on our website that’s similar to the pro forma data we filed in September. In that document, you will find supplemental line item details broken out for Q3 between legacy Frontier and the acquired properties.
Also, our further review and analysis of acquired properties has led us to restate some of the customer-operating metrics to conform to our data reporting standards. This comment relates to high-speed and video subscriber counts only.
I’d like to begin today with customer trend and working the revenues of profitability before turning to capital spending and the guidance. Please note that our Q3 2010 earnings per share includes the after tax impact of merger and integration costs.
Our adjusted EPS excluding these costs was $0.08. Frontier’s Q3 2010 customer revenues of $1.2 billion reflects stabilized customer loss rates in residential and improved customer loss rates in business. Access line losses improved this quarter as compared to Q10 2010 -- Q2 2010 with annual line loss rates of 6% for legacy Frontier, 10.9% for the acquired properties and 9.3% on a total company basis.
On the residential side, our legacy business demonstrated improved customer losses as compared to both Q2 2010 and Q3 2009. On the acquired side, residential customer loss performance was weaker on a sequential basis, but reflected improvement over Q3 2009. Our local engagement tactics, promotions and broadband build-out are expected to slow the rate of residential access line losses in the next year.
Both legacy and acquired properties showed increasing products per customer and average revenue per customer. On a combined basis, residential ARPU increased 3.4% over last year’s pro forma third quarter to over $58.
In our business segment, Frontier’s 381,000 customers generated a $533 average revenue per customer per month, helping drive $611 million of revenues, down only 2.7% from pro forma Q3 2009 and only slightly less than pro forma Q2 2010.
Our legacy business revenues were slightly positive year-over-year while the acquired properties were down 4.3%, an improvement from the 6.3% loss rate in 2010. We believe our increased focus on business customer, especially in the acquired properties through our local engagement model, will have a positive impact on this important part of our business.
For Q3 2010, business revenues represented 49% of Frontier’s total customer revenues. Data and Internet services revenues of $453 million, declined sequentially, reflecting $2 million improvement in legacy business and $12 million decline in acquired properties.
The HSI net subscriber losses in the acquired properties improved sequentially and we had a positive net adds in legacy similar to last quarter. Since a large portion of our high speed build-out in the new territories was weighted toward the end of Q3 and we are aggressively expanding our HSI [build availability threat] Q4 as Maggie mentioned, we expect our high-speed net adds to continue to improve and turn positive over the next several quarters.
Switched access and subsidy revenues were just 11.5% of Frontier’s total revenues in the quarter. Looking back at Q3 2009, this was 12.9% on a pro forma basis and legacy Frontier was 17.3%. As you can see the acquired properties have decreased our reliance on this revenue category.
We are pleased to report that cash operating expenses of the acquired properties were $479 million in Q3 2010. This $63 million sequential reduction from the prior quarter represents our synergies realized in the elimination of the corporate, administrative and common costs incurred by the properties we acquired.
Several wage and non-wage cost reduction initiatives also commenced during the quarter. On the legacy side, our cash expenses increased slightly due to pension and benefit costs, overtime and marketing expenses of specific legacy business.
On a pro forma basis, our EBITDA margin expanded from 45.7% in pro forma Q2 2010 to 47.9% this quarter. An adjusted EBITDA grew 2.5% sequentially to $671 million. It is a small step but a very strong step in the right direction for the combined companies.
Turning back to synergies, the $63 million in cost savings in the acquired properties represents the sequential three month comparisons of costs incurred under our management as compared to the cash operating expenses reported by Verizon in their last and final set of financial reports for June 30.
This $63 million level, $252 million on annualized basis and represents more than 50% of our original $500 million target. I will also remind you that our synergy estimates do not include any assumptions relative to revenues.
The savings already achieved through the elimination of the corporate administrative and common costs coupled with identified expense savings initiatives presently being implemented gives us great comfort in raising our 2013 synergy target by $15 million with total run rate of $550 million.
We expect to realize annualized cost savings of $300 million by the end of 2010, $400 million by the end of 2011 and $550 million by the end of 2012. Approximately, 30% of these synergies were driven by non-wage savings in network and IT operations.
Capital expenditures in Q3 were $159 million or 11.3% of revenues excluding $16 million of integration CapEx. The level of spending in the acquired properties increased throughout the quarter as we deployed broadband.
Total spending in the acquired property was $105 million for the quarter or 11.8% of revenues. Capital expenditures in the acquired properties did increase throughout the third quarter and will be substantially higher in Q4 as we increase our broadband and network deployment initiatives.
Our capital expenditure forecasts have remained consistent with previous guidance provided at approximately 12% of annual revenues plus $100 million of additional spending per annum for three years. We will give full 2011 guidance during our Q4 2010 conference call in February.
As for revised full year 2010 expectations, we believe that our capital expenditures excluding integration CapEx will be between $500 million and $525 million. Our adjusted free cash flow will be between $830 million and $860 million and our cash taxes will be between $40 million and $50 million, which reflects the benefits of bonus appreciation.
Please note that the CapEx forecast reflected very sizable increase in Q4 as our broadband expansion network improvement are in full swing. At September 30, 2010, our leverage ratio was 2.84 times, net of cash and restricted cash. Frontier generated $339 million in adjusted free cash flow and paid dividends of $186 million or a payout ratio of 55%.
Please note that this CapEx increases in future quarters for our broadband expansion, specifically for example, in Q4, our payout ratio will increase. In the future, the capital expenditure decreased and our revenue initiatives and our cost saving are fully realized, our dividend payout ratio would significantly improve to at or below 50%.
As Maggie stated earlier, we are very committed to maintain your 75% annual dividend. We are also committed to lowering our leverage to 2.5 times or below, which we continue to believe is achievable for the combination of EBITDA improvement and/or debt reduction. At this time, we expect residual free cash flow to build on a balance sheet and are not contemplating any near-term changes to share buyback or dividend policy.
In summary, we’re very pleased to be able to report these solid Q3 financial Q as the new Frontier, results show the beginning of the turnaround that we’ve committed to you. We know that this turnaround and our achievement of further cost savings is key piece of new investment thesis. We hope that you look back on this long year and take comfort that we’ve done what we’ve said we’re going to doing.
From regulatory approval and conditions, the financing and closing of transaction, the West Virginia system conversion, as we move our focus to converting a next states, we can expect continued delivery of solid legacy results and a notable improvement in the acquired properties.
With that, let me pass the call back to Alan to open the call up to questions.

Thanks. Obviously, the strong start to the synergy number in the quarter, just wanted if you could talk a bit about what areas provided the greatest benefit in the quarter, which is a function of eliminating some of the headcount that was brought on in the second quarter, kind of unexpectedly? And then as you think about the raising the guidance, may be talk a bit about what area has helped drive that increasing guidance?
And then secondly, just wanted to touch quickly on margins both within legacy Frontier and SpinCo, we had a pretty good step down looks like in the legacy markets to about 51% margin, I wondering if this is tie to expenses on West Virginia after some other incremental cost we should be thinking about?
And then conversely on SpinCo, a very nice improvement there, is that really driven by some of the synergies that we’re talking about before or, there are incremental expenses that are being eliminated on that side? Thanks.

And so that has all been achieved, substantially the largest amount of that $63 million for the quarter.
There are over 75 initiatives that we had in-house that are being worked on to reduce cost savings over the next several years. Some of the really larger ones are on the network side. We are migrating the backbone to our backbone, to eliminating circuit costs, very substantial migrating long distance from one carrier to another, also very substantial. We’re rationalizing some vendors that they are using versus what we’re using, trying to consolidate the spending and there’s a host of other activities that are going on, all very -- gives us a lot of comfort to raise the guidance.
I think some of the real push for us is on the network side as Dan McCarthy and his team were looking at the network side before even closed and we’re planning on, what we were going to do with the network. We were seeing a little bit more savings than we anticipated out of the gate and sort of gave us some comfort to raise it up and feel very comfortable with that.
The second question on the margins, on legacy, on legacy side there were some costs for the quarter that were higher than normal. Overtime was quite high. There were a lot of storms in a number of our regions which caused a lot of higher overtime than we normally have this time of year. And also we did have increased pension contributions, cash pension contributions of $5 million this quarter over last quarter which will drop down significantly for next quarter.
So there’s a little bit of some one-timers if you would. West Virginia has really been culled out of that. We’re reporting to you, West Virginia, in the acquired properties so the step-up in legacies from a couple of areas that should be for the most part one-timers and we should be able to get the margins back up next quarter. And in the acquired properties, improvement is really trying to -- its expenses kicking in, savings kicking in as well as revenues being pretty solid.

And I agree with Don. I think if you look at our legacy margins, I think you will see a bounce back in the fourth quarter because we did have a lot of one-time issues in the third quarter.

We raised the guidance publicly because we have a very, very clear line of sight for the 550 and so therefore it’s the best thing to be able to give guidance to folks externally.
Your question on the regulatory revenue on the acquired properties, the only response I really can give is it comes from -- I believe on the switch side. Switched access appears to be a little bit lower than we anticipated. We are continuing to look at all of that information to make sure that we are billing for everything we should be billing for. And it really is a -- the changeover from pre-closing to post-closing, there may be a little bit of bumps and bruises there. We’re still looking at it. But it really is on the switched access side.

So, we are extending the sales team as I mentioned. We’re hiring over 50 new salespeople throughout the acquired markets. The local engagement model with our local general managers meeting with businesses on a day-to-day basis, is really changing the game in those markets and we are packaging our product sets differently to not only have day-to-day capabilities from a voice and data perspective, but also CPE projects in all of those markets as well.

We have been very quick from a signage perspective, all of our trucks we’ve been converting over to Frontier. We look at those as billboards all around our markets. The web, we have changed the branding on all of the websites and have really pushed web in a number of those markets with our customer base. We’ve had a series of communications out to the customer by mail.
Again, reinforcing who we are and what we’re doing and we’ve used a new brand called the conversation company as a way to increase dialogue between us and our customers. And to also facilitate dialogue between our customers and the people that they care about that they want to communicate to. So we’ve done a lot in the markets from a branding perspective. I think the good news is we’ve had a lot of press coverage on Frontier.
We have a good reputation and as you recall, we do business in every one of the states that we acquired, except for three new ones. And in those new ones we’ve actually put more focus on branding because our name is not as well-known in those states. But we do believe that we have come on strong from a branding perspective in these markets to really change the game of being about customers and customer service and a focus on customers versus -- Verizon has not been doing much in those markets from an advertising or engagement perspective over the last several years.
I think the other good thing for us is the competitors in all those markets are used to a Verizon lethargic approach to competition. That’s not how we do business. So we’re really trying to step up the game too with local engagement to change that paradigm and to really drive customers to call us or to communicate with us And especially new customers or win-backs and we have a number of initiatives going on in those markets through the end of the year to really drive communication and promotions to the win-back customers in those markets.
We have, as I mentioned, changed a number of things that we’re doing from a customer service perspective to make that a better experience for the customer and we think that will drive better customer satisfaction rates and -- on a monthly basis continue to do customer satisfaction surveys in the new markets as well.
Shifting over to Washington, D.C. I was actually in DC about two weeks ago. I had lunch with the Chairman of the FCC. I spent some time at the Whitehouse and on the hill. I do think with this election, there’s a chance for a reset for some of the initiatives that have been talked about in Washington that would affect our industry, specifically net neutrality and also inter-carrier compensation and universal service reform.
One of the negatives that happened is, Rick Boucher, who I think all of us knew as a pretty level-headed Congressman who was one of the leaders in driving for universal service reform and inter-carrier comp reform was defeated. I do think that Julius Genachowski will sort of pick up the mantel on that, though and will look to get a proposed rule making sometime in 2011 on universal service and inter-carrier comp. Whether they’ll swallow the whole issue or break off certain pieces of that that are more although-hanging fruit remains to be seen. But I think they’ll be rational and open and transparent in the process.
And we truly believe any change in universal service funding and inter-carrier compensation would be positive for our company, no doubt about it, because there’s a lot of things broken in that system. I also would think that the net neutrality debate, I’m not sure if the FCC will go forward with the Title II light. I think that remains to be seen. But I think there will be more pressure on them if they try do that now with a Republican House.
So we’re going to learn a lot I think over the next several weeks once the lame duck session starts to really see what will be on the docket, but again, I don’t think anything will happen for our industry until we’re into 2011.

Just was wondering if you see a path in the near term to getting back to growth on the DSL side in the Verizon assets and then how you think about FiOS now going forward having a quarter of it under your belt, any dramatic changes to Verizon’s marketing efforts or are you pushing that any harder in those properties than what Verizon was doing?

So if you think about the high-speed DSL in the acquired markets, when we took over, if you recall in the second quarter they lost over 11,000 DSL customers. So we started pretty much in the hole with these markets. We actually improved that loss by 45% in one quarter. So just like anything else, when you’re trying to turn an aircraft carrier, it takes a lot of effort to drive the momentum in a different direction.
In addition to that and just taking over those markets, it took us some time to do the planning as to where we were going to expand high-speed DSL in those markets, so the momentum of build-out didn’t start until late in the quarter, in September more so than July and August. So, we do believe that we’ll see better momentum in the fourth quarter and into first quarter next year as we continue to do more aggressive build-out which gives us an opportunity to build on the momentum that we’ve already started.
We also found in the FiOS markets -- if we think about FiOS we think about it in two parts ,you think about broadband and you think about video. And one of the policies that Verizon had in how they managed those markets is they would not offer a customer who was in a FiOS neighborhood DSL service.
Now, FiOS starts at like 50 MEG and it’s very expensive. It’s like $50 a month for a customer. So they left a whole host of customers behind from an affordability perspective who didn’t need that kind of capability on broadband. We have just over the last 30 to 60 days opened up DSL in all of the FiOS markets to give the customer choice. So the customer can choose whether they want FiOS broadband or they want high-speed Internet service, typically, and in those markets we’re offering around 6 to 7 MEG as the entre point.
In addition to that, we’re also offering in the FiOS markets the choice of DirecTV or FiOS video. Again, we come from a paradigm of choice for customers. We think that customers should be able to choose what kind of video they want. We have aggressive offers in the market for both DirecTV and for FiOS video, but in our vernacular, what we care about is keeping the customer, getting the customer to take more products and services from us and making sure the customer is happy with the choice points.
So we’ve made a number of changes throughout all of these markets in terms of policy. Another good example is we’ve opened up in many of these locations the opportunity to sell high-speed service up to 95% capacity on the equipment that we have out in the field. Verizon had set a parameter at 75%.
So again, we’re opening up more opportunities which we also think will change the paradigm shift in the numbers for high-speed overall. With regard to the FiOS video product, we are still evaluating it from a financial perspective and a customer perspective, and from a cost perspective and a revenue perspective.
In terms of what that does for us overall, what it does for churn, how much does it really cost to extend this capability in the markets that we’re in today, and we think that -- that analysis and evaluation will go on through the first quarter and then we’ll be able to make some choice points in terms of was we want to do with FiOS from an expansion perspective or a maintenance perspective.

There are a number of things that we have to do in order to get there. Our goal would be to get to 8% line losses. That’s what we’re focused on.
And I think it starts with having high speed service as a component of what we sell to the customer. It’s also about improving network quality. We have a number of areas where the voice network quality is not where it needs to be and we’ve jumped on that. So we’re making some dramatic improvements to the network throughout the footprint.
We are also talking about the value of our phone service and communicating that through advertising as well as promotions in the marketplace. It’s about improved customer service in these markets. And, it’s about selling bundles and getting customers on price protection plans. I think, as you know, in our legacy markets, 96% of all of our sales are on a price protection plan and we have close to 60% of our residential customers on a one-, two- or three-year price protection plan. That number is below 15% in the acquired markets.
So we’re also driving for price protection plans with every sale that we’re doing in these new markets as well. So, again, there’s a number of push points that we have to do to get the access line losses in line where they need to be. Again, it doesn’t happen overnight, but we are pleased with the progress that we’ve made so far.

So the 30,000 we turned on in the third quarter were basically turned on in September. Right? And so, October and November will be big months for build all the way through the middle of December.
And it’s not just about building new, but it’s also about going out and we’ve looked at every single area from a local engagement perspective, to see where we have excess capacity that we can put into existing equipment and turn on neighborhoods that actually have more capacity, but just based upon policy that Verizon had in place, they wouldn’t sell to additional customers in those areas. So we have a very different philosophy that we’ll be creating about turning broadband on for customers, and so a number of the homes that we’re turning on don’t require us to add more capital. It’s simply changing policy.
A good example is, even if you look at the DSL choice points in the FiOS markets, that’s several hundred thousand homes over probably the next year that we could have access to that we didn’t have access to before. So, we feel pretty confident that we’ll get to that 300,000 level and we’re trying to push too as much this quarter, because January, February, March are tough months to build. So the more we can front-load into the fourth quarter, try to hit some of those homes with promotions during the holiday season, allows us to continue to sell to that capacity into Q1 where we won’t be able to build as aggressively.

Thank you for joining our call today to discuss third quarter 2010 results for Frontier Communications Corp. We're excited to be reporting our first financial results as to the new Frontier, following the completion of our July 1st acquisition of Verizon properties. We know that you've all been waiting patiently for these numbers, and we believe that the wait been worthwhile.
Frontier's third quarter results demonstrates the improvements that are already happening in the acquire property, our confidence in our business plan, and the strong and steady results in our legacy business. In Q3 2010, Frontier realized synergies of $63 million in the acquired properties. This is a $252 million annualized rate and was achieved from the elimination of corporate overhead costs and other wage and non-wage synergies.
Looking forward, this permanent production, along with continued synergy realization gives us confidence to raise our 2013 synergy run rate estimate by 10% to $550 million. 
This positive lift to our synergy target is on top of the very solid quarter as the new Frontier. Our Q3 revenues were $1.4 billion, and adjusted operating cash flow, or EBITDA of $671 million, that we represented a strong margin of 48%. We converted this into free cash flow of $339 million in the third quarter, and paid 55% of this to our shareholders as dividends. 
Consistent with our position since we first announced the Verizon transaction, Frontier is successfully managing the business 3x its former size in terms of revenues and employees. We believe this excess is being driven by a strong leadership, a focus on customer sales and retention, and by implementing our local engagement model in all new markets.
In the 4 months that we have owned the acquired properties, we have laid a solid foundation to the future business. We managed Frontier's business internally by focusing on 3 key drivers of value for our company, people, product and profit. Managing the business this way, differentiated Frontier's legacy business this quarter by driving improved customer metrics, rising ARPU and strong margins.
Let me start with people. As I mentioned, our employees tripled the number at closing, and implementing cultural change has been one of our primary missions. Our senior leadership team has met with every one of our employees over the past few months, and I have personally met with 11,000 new and legacy Frontier employees since closing.
Our people are energized and engaged in the Frontier's mission and value. We are truly owners of the company because on July 1, we made every employee a shareholder of Frontier. This gesture links our legacy in employees together, all in place our working towards the same 3 goals, keeping growth access lines, accelerate High-Speed Internet deployment and growth, and implement local engagement to enhance the customer experience. Everyone from our call center reps to field technicians knows that these goals will improve the results of our business, sustained jobs and communities, and build o our foundation of quality, reliability and trusted interactions with our customers.
Some examples. We've looked at processes and procedures and eliminated what's unnecessary. This basic blocking and tackling has a big positive financial impact. We have deployed local area managers to our new markets. The majority of these managers were trained by Frontier well before close. They now have access to daily sales and retention customer activity that they never had before to help them run their business. We can't know how you're doing, if you don't have daily reports on customers grow adds and deactivations.
All 7,000 technicians and our new markets now report to the local area managers, not-too-distant centralized group. These technicians are doing full installations for High-Speed, keeping 2-hour appointment windows, and will resolve any technical customers a customer is experiencing. Each tech is trained to handle VoIP, High-Speed Internet and any other issues pertaining to our network for both business and residential customers. 
We have also revamped customer service processes to be more customer-centric. Hours have been expanded to include evenings and weekends. Reps are measured on first call resolutions and sales for the first time, and all reps now have customers save tools. We have eliminated reg that is non-value-added, and as a result of all of these changes, call transfers are down over 10%, and we're outsourcing 12% less calls to third-party vendors. 
Our next step is to train all customer service reps on all customer issues. Once this training is complete in 2011, we will have all Frontier customer service reps as Universal reps. Again, this streamlines our service delivery, eliminates transfers, and will reduce outsource dependence. Shifting to product. Frontier's product goal is to be the provider of choice and increase the number of products that residential and business customers take from us. To achieve this, we are constantly innovating the price simplification in new products and services. 
Our newly acquired market also require an investment to improve the quality of existing services and to increase broadband availability. With these steps, communicated to the customers to local engagement, we expect to drive downturn in the acquire property and to expanded recurring customer revenues. 
Some examples. Frontier increased broadband availability to over 30,000 homes and businesses in that third quarter. We plan to enable more than 300,000 total homes by year end. Together, this will take broadband availability from 64% at closing to over 70% by year end. Our network upgrade projects are being implemented in every market. In addition to increased High-Speed availability, we are also enhancing speeds and capacity.  In Q3, our overall 6 megabytes availability increased from 43% to 50%. 
All new Frontier markets are now selling new double and triple-play along with value-added services like Peace of Mind. In the past 4 months, we also completed the huge test of converting 100% of customer e-mail accounts from Verizon.net to frontier.com. Finally, Frontier just introduced us custom value pricing in our legacy market and in West Virginia. The concept allows customers to build their own bundles by mixing and matching any voice, video or data service. The more they buy, the more they will save, with discounts up to 15% on all products and services purchased.
Profit. When we execute on people and products, profit follows, because our customers pay us for value, and as we have demonstrated in our legacy markets, they will buy more products. To align our employees with the company's goals, we've rolled out to performance and compensation metrics in the new markets. These metrics include revenue per customer, a number of products the customer takes, retention of access lines and High-Speed services and capital efficiency. 
Some examples. Our Take the Lead program, which rewards employees for referring sales of Frontier products and services generated 3,000 leads in July, 4,300 leads in August, and 5,500 leads in September. In commercial sales, the Legacy business is strong, and West Virginia has built steady momentum in small, medium, enterprise and carrier sales. In the 13 states, we're hiring over 50 new sales account position, our equipment sales initiative is ramping as well in all markets, the wireless backhaul outlook is for double-digit growth, and we're making process improvements in commercial sales and service activity.
Commercial business and Residential Broadband revenue represents 60% of our total revenue base, which is clearly, a positive shift the way from access line revenue dependent. Our integration team which did a phenomenal drive in West Virginia, has been redeployed and has focused on the conversion plan for the remaining 13 states, from the current Verizon systems onto our Frontier system. 
As I mentioned on our the second quarter call, the West Virginia conversion went very well, so that conversion we've ever done, and we've delivered these results on a very specific time schedule. All of the billing cycles went out on time, call volumes are now back to normal, answer times are on plan, and other operational metrics are in line with our legacy Frontier market levels. 
Financially, we are in a solid position with a safe and attractive annual dividend of $0.75 per share. We remain committed to our investors, and we are committed to improving our cash flow from the acquisition. We are off to a good start but we have a lot more to do. I look forward to reporting continued progress to you next quarter. On that note, I'll now had a call over to Don Shassian, our Chief Financial Officer, who will give you the financial overview for the third quarter of 2010. Don?"

I'm very excited to be reporting our financials for you today. Our third quarter results were a great tick off for the new Frontier, and today's synergy number and raise should give you comfort, that we can dramatically change the cost structure of our properties while growing revenues and investing in future capabilities of the network. 
Before we go into the numbers, I want to point out a that our discussions is going to focus on the combined company. Now whatever we are providing of supplemental schedule filed via 8-K, and available on our website and similar to the pro forma data we filed in September. In that document, you will find supplemental line item detail broken up for Q3, between legacy Frontier and the acquired properties. Also, our further review and analysis in acquired properties has led us to restate some of the customer operating metrics that confirmed our data reporting centers. This comments relates to High-speed and video subscriber accounts owned. 
I'd like to begin today with customer trends and work in revenues of profitability before turning the capital spending and new guidance. Please note that our Q3 2010 earnings per share include: The after-tax impact of merger and integration costs, our adjusted EPS excluding these costs was $0.08. Frontier's Q3 2010 customer revenues of $1.2 billion reflects stabilized customer loss rates in residential, and improved customer loss rates in business. 
As declined losses improved this quarter compared to Q3 2010 -- Q2 2010, with annual line loss rates of 6% for legacy Frontier, 10.9% to the acquired properties, and 9.3% on a total company basis.
On the residential side, our Legacy business demonstrates improved customer losses, as compared to both Q2 2010 and Q3 2009. On the acquired side, residential customer loss performance was weaker on a sequential basis, but reflected improvement over Q3 2009. Our local engagement tactics, promotions and broadband build-out are expected to slow the rate of residential access volume losses into next year. Both legacy and the acquire properties show increasing products per customer and average revenue per customer. On a combined basis, residential ARPU increased 3.4% over last year's pro forma third quarter, to over $58. 
In our business segments, Frontier's 381,000 customers generated a $533 average revenue per customer per month, helping drive $611 million of revenues, down only 2.7% from pro forma Q3 2009, and only slightly less than pro forma Q2 2010.
Our Legacy business revenues were slightly positive year-over-year, while the acquired properties were down 4.3%, and an improvement from the 6.3% loss rate in Q2 2010. We believe that our increased focus on business customers, especially the acquired properties for local engagement model, where the positive impact on this part of our business. For Q3 2010, business revenues represented 49% of Frontier's total customer revenues. 
Data & Internet services revenues of $453 million declined sequentially, reflecting a $2 million improvement on Legacy business, and the $12 million decline in acquired properties. The HSI net subscriber losses in the acquired properties, improved sequentially, and we have positive net adds in legacy similar to last quarter. There's a large portion of our high-speed build-out in the mid-territories, was weighted towards the end of Q3, and we are aggressively expanding our new HSI availability throughout Q4, as Maggie mentioned. We expect our high-speed net adds to continue to improve and turn positive over the next several quarters. 
Switched Access and subsidy revenues was up 11.5% of Frontier's total revenues in the quarter. Looking back at Q3 2009, this was 12.9% on a pro forma basis, and legacy Frontier was 17.3%. As you can see, the acquired properties have decreased our reliance on this revenue category.
We are pleased to report the cash property expenses in the acquire properties for $479 million in Q3 2010. This $53 million sequential reduction from the prior quarter represents our synergy realize from the elimination of the corporate administrative and common costs incurred by the companies we acquired. Several wage and non-wage cost reduction initiatives will also commence during the quarter. On a legacy front, our cash expenses increased slightly, due to pension and benefit costs overtime and marketing expenses, all specific Legacy business. 
On a pro forma basis, our EBITDA margin expanded from 45.7% in pro forma Q2 2010, to 47.9% this quarter, and adjusted EBITDA grew 2.5% sequentially to $671 million. It is a small step, but it a very strong step in the right direction for the combined companies.
Turning back to synergies. The $63 million in cost savings in the acquired property represents the sequential 3 months comparison of costs incurred under our management, as compared to cash operating expenses reported by Verizon or and for the financial reports at June 30. This $63 million level, $252 million in annualized basis, and represents more than 50% of our original $500 million target. I would also remind you that our synergy estimates do not include any assumptions relative to revenues. The savings already achieved through the elimination of the corporate administrative and common costs, coupled with identified expense savings initiatives, principally implemented, gives us great comfort and reason our 2013 synergy targets, our $50 million, to total run rate of $550 million.  We expect to realize annualized cost savings of $300 million by the end of 2010, $400 million by the end of 2011 and $550 million by the end of 2012. Approximately 30% of these synergies were driven by non-wage savings in network and IT operations.
Capital expenditures in Q3 were $159 million or 11.3% of revenues, excluding $15 million of integration CapEx. The level of spending in the acquired properties increased throughout the quarter as we deploy broadband. Total spending in acquire property of $105 million, or 11.8% of revenues. Capital expenditures in the acquired properties did increase throughout the third quarter, and will be substantially higher than Q4, as we increase our broadband and network deployment initiatives. Our capital expenditure forecast to remain consistent with previous guidance provided that are approximately 12% of annual revenues, plus $100 million additional spending per item for 3 years. We will give full 2011 guidance during our Q4 2010 conference call in February. 
As for revised full-year 2010 expectations, we believe that our capital expenditures, excluding integration CapEx will be between $500 million and $525 million. Our adjusted free cash flow will be between $830 million and $850 million, and our cash taxes will be between $40 million and $50 million, which reflects the benefits of bonus depreciation. Please note that this CapEx forecast reflected very sizable increase in Q4 as our broadband expansion network improvements are in full swing. 
At September 30, 2010, our leverage ratio was 2.84x, net of cash and restricted cash. Frontier generated $339 million of adjusted free cash flow, and paid dividend of $186 million, or a payout ratio of 55%. Please note that as CapEx increases in future quarters for our broadband expansion, specifically, for example, in Q4, our payout ratio will increase. In the future, the capital expenditures decrease in and our revenue initiatives and cost savings are fully realized, our dividend payout ratio would significantly improve to at or below 50%.
As Maggie stated earlier, we are very committed to maintaining our 75% annual dividend, we're also committed to lowering our leverage to 2.5x or below, which we continue to believe is achievable for a combination of EBITDA improvement and our debt reduction. At this time, we expect residual free cash flow to build on the balance sheet, and are not contemplating any near-term changes to share buyback or dividend policy.
In summary, we're very pleased to be able to report these solid Q3 financials as the new Frontier. Results for the beginning of the turnaround that we've committed to you. We know that this turnout in our achievement in further cost savings is a key piece of your investment basis. We hope that you'll look back on this long year and take comfort, that we've done what we said we will do. From regulatory approvals and conditions, the financing and closing of transaction, the West Virginia system conversion. As you move our focus in converting the seats, we can expect continued delivery of solid legacy results and a notable improvement in the acquired properties. With that, let me pass the call back to Allen to open the call up for questions."

Was this a function of eliminating some of the headcount that was brought in the second quarter, kind of unexpectedly? And then as you think about raising the guidance, maybe talk about what areas help drive that increasing guidance. And then secondly, I just wanted to touch with good margins both within legacy Frontier and Spinco. We had a pretty good step down it looks like in the legacy market about 51% margin. I wonder if this is tied to expenses unless in West Virginia, if there's some other incremental costs we should be thinking about. Then conversely and Spinco, very nice improvement there. Is that really driven by some of the synergies that were talking about before are the incremental expenses that are being eliminated on that side?"

And for that I will be achieved substantially, but the largest amount of that $63 million for the quarter. There are over 75 initiatives in the House that we'll be worked on to reduce cost savings over the next several years. Some are really larger ones from the network side. We are migrating the backbone, our backbone to eliminating certain costs, very substantial from migrating long distance from one carry to another, it's also very substantial. We're rationalizing some vendors, that they're using versus what we're using, trying to consolidate our spending. There's also some other activities that are going on, all very gives us a lot of comfort to raise the guidance. I think some of the real push for us, is on the network side, is Dan McCarthy, and his team were looking at the network side before even close, and were planning on that work. We are seeing a little bit more savings than we have anticipated as to gate, as sort of gave us some comfort to raise that up and so we're very comfortable with that. The second question on the margins, or legacy. On the legacy side, there were some costs for the quarter that were higher than normal. Overtime, it's quite high. There are a lot of storms in a lot of our regions, which caused a lot over this time of year. And also, we did have increased pension contributions. Our cash pension contributions of $5 million this quarter over last quarter, will drop down significantly for next quarter. So there's a little bit of some one-timers, if you would. West Virginia is really been cold out of that. We're reporting to you West Virginia and the acquired properties, so the step-up in legacy, for in a couple of areas, that should be for the most part, one-timers and we should be able to get those margins back up next quarter. And the acquired properties improvement, is really trying to, the expense is kicking in, the savings is kicking in as well as the revenues seems pretty solid."

We have been very quick from a signage perspective, all of our trucks, we've been converting over to Frontier, we look at those at billboards all around our markets. The red, we have changed the branding on all of the websites, and have really pushed web in a number of those markets with our customer base. We've had a series of vacations out in the customer by mail. Again, reinforcing who we are and what we're doing. And we've used a new brand called, The Conversation Company, as the way to increase dialogue between us and our customers and to also, facilitate dialogue between our customers. And the people that they served up say that they want to communicate, too. So we've done a lot in the markets from a branding perspective. I think the good news is we've got a lot of press coverage on Frontier. We have a good reputation. And as you recall, we do business in every one of the states that we acquired, except for 3 new ones. And in those new ones, we've actually put more focus on branding, because our name is not as well-known in those states. So but we do believe that you have come on strong from a branding perspective in these markets to really change the game of being about customers and customer service, and a focus on customers, versus Verizon, has not been in doing what from an average advertising our engagement perspective over the last several years. I think the other good thing for us is, the competitors and all those markets are used to a Verizon approach to competition. That's not how we do business. So we're really trying to step-up the game, too with local engagement to change that paradigm and to really drive customers to call us or to communicate with us, and especially new customers or win-back. And we have a number of initiatives going on in those markets to the end of the year to really drive communications and promotions to the win-back customers in those markets. We have, as I mentioned, changed the number of things that were doing from a customer service perspective to make that a better experience for the customer, and we think that will drive better customer satisfaction rates. And you'll see us on a monthly basis continue to the customer satisfaction survey in the new markets as well.  Shifting over to Washington DC, I was actually in DC about 2 weeks ago. I had lunch with the Chairman of the FCC. I spent some time at the White House and on the Hills. I do think this is election, there's a chance for a reset for some of the initiatives that have been talked about in Washington, that would affect our industry specifically, net neutrality and also, intercarrier compensation and Universal Service Reform. One of the negatives that happened is, for Rick Boucher, you who I think, all of us knew, was a pretty levelheaded Congress meant who was one of leaders in driving for Universal Service Reform and Inter-carrier Reform was defeated. I do think that Julius Genachowski will sort of pick up the mantle on that though and we look to get a proposed rule-making, sometime in 2011 on Universal service and inter-carrier comp, whether they'll swallow the whole issue or break off certain pieces of that are more low-hanging fruit remains to be seen. But I think they'll be rational and open and transparent in the process. And we truly believe any change in Universal Service Funding and Intercarrier Compensation would be positive for our company, and that's about it. Because there's a lot of things that are broken in that system. I also, would think, that net neutrality debate, I'm not sure if the FCC will go for the Title II right. I think that remains to be seen, but I think they'll be more pressure on them as attractive at that now with a Republican House. So we're going to learn a lot, I think over the next several weeks on the lame session starts to really see what will be on the. But again, I don't think anything will happen for our industry until we're into 2011."

So we targeted pretty much in the whole with these markets. We actually improved that loss by 45% in one quarter. So just like anything else when you're trying to turn an aircraft carrier, it takes a lot of effort to drive the momentum in the different direction. In addition to that, in just taking those markets, it taken some time to do the planning as to where we are going to spit expand high-speed DSL in those markets. So the momentum of build-out didn't really start until late in the quarter, in September, more so than July and August. So we do believe that we'll see better momentum in the fourth quarter and into first quarter next year as we continue to do more aggressive build-out, which gives us and the opportunity to build on the momentum that we've already started. We also found in the FiOS market, if we think about FiOS, we think about it in 2 parts: We think about broadband, and we think about video. And one of the policies that Verizon having manage market is they would not offer a customer who is in FiOS neighborhood, DSL service. Now FiOS starts like 50 meg, and it's very expensive, it's like $50 a month per customer. So they customers behind, from an affordability perspective we didn't need that kind of capability on broadband. We addressed over the last 30 to 50 days, opened up DSL, in all the FiOS markets to give the customers choice. So the customer can choose whether they want FiOS broadband, or they want High-Speed Internet service, typically in those markets, we're offering around 6 to 7 meg as the entrée point. In addition to that, we're also offering in the FiOS market, the choice of DirecTV or FiOS video. Again, we complement paradigm of choice for customers. We think that customer should be able to choose what kind of video they want. We have aggressive offers in the market, good growth, Direct TV and for FiOS video. But in our binocular, let me curve out is giving the customers are getting the customer from us, and making sure that customers are happy with the choice point. So we've made a number of changes throughout all of these markets in terms of policy. Another good example is we've opened up in many of these locations the opportunity to sell High-Speed service, up to 95% capacity on the equipment that we have out in the field. Verizon a set a parameter of 75%. So again, we're opening up more opportunities which we also think will change the support on shift in the numbers for High-Speed overall. With regard to the FiOS video products, we are still evaluating it from a financial perspective and a customer perspective. And from a cost perspective, and a revenue perspective. In terms of what that does for us overall, what it does return, how much does it really cost to extent this, our capability in the markets that we are in today an we think that announces and a valuation will go on through the first quarter, and then we'll be able to make some choice points in terms of what we want to do with FiOS from an expansion perspective or, from a maintenance perspective."

And it's not just about building new, but it's also about going out, and look at every single area from a local engagement perspective to see where we have excess capacity that we can put into existing equipment and turn on neighborhoods that actually have more capacity to go but just based upon policy that Verizon had in place, they wouldn't sell to additional customers in those areas. So we have a very different velocity that we'll be creative about 20 broadband offer customers. And so a number of the homes that we're turning on don't require us to add more capital, it's simply changing policy. A good example, if you look at the DSL choice points in the FiOS markets, that several hundred thousand homes over probably, the next year that we could have access to that we didn't have access to before. So we feel pretty confident that we'll get to that 300,000 level, and we're trying to push too, as much this quarter because January, February, March our top months to build. So the more we can front load into the fourth quarter, trying to get some of those homes with promotions during the holiday season allows us to continue to sell to that capacity into Q1 we won't be able to build this aggressively."

Thank you for joining our call today to discuss third quarter 2010 results for Frontier Communications Corporation. We're excited to be reporting our first financial results as the new Frontier, following the completion of our July 1 acquisition of Verizon properties. We know that you've all been waiting patiently for these numbers, and we believe that the wait has been worthwhile.
Frontier's third quarter results demonstrates the improvements that are already happening in the acquired property, our confidence in our business plans, and the strong and steady results in our legacy business. In Q3 2010, Frontier realized synergies of $63 million in the acquired properties. This is a $252 million annualized rate and was achieved from the elimination of corporate overhead costs and other wage and non-wage synergies.
Looking forward, this permanent reduction, along with continued synergy realization gives us confidence to raise our 2013 synergy run rate estimate by 10% to $550 million. 
This positive lift to our synergy target is on top of the very solid quarter as the new Frontier. Our Q3 revenues were $1.4 billion, and adjusted operating cash flow, or EBITDA of $671 million, that represented a strong margin of 48%. We converted this into free cash flow of $339 million in the third quarter, and paid 55% of this to our shareholders as dividends. 
Consistent with our position since we first announced the Verizon transaction, Frontier is successfully managing a business, 3x its former size in terms of revenues and employees. We believe this success is being driven by strong leadership, a focus on customer sales and retention, and by implementing our local engagement model in all new markets.
In the 4 months that we have owned the acquired properties, we have laid a solid foundation for the future business. We managed Frontier's business internally by focusing on 3 key drivers of value for our company, people, product and profit. Managing the business this way, differentiated Frontier's legacy business this quarter by driving improved customer metrics, rising ARPU and strong margins.
Let me start with people. As I mentioned, our employees tripled the number at closing, and implementing cultural change has been one of our primary missions. Our senior leadership team has met with every one of our employees over the past few months, and I have personally met with 11,000 new and legacy Frontier employees since closing.
Our people are energized and engaged in the Frontier mission and value. We are truly owners of the company because on July 1, we made every employee a shareholder of Frontier. This gesture links our legacy and new employees together, all employees are working towards the same 3 goals, keep and grow access lines, accelerate High-Speed Internet deployment and growth, and implement local engagement to enhance the customer experience. Everyone from our call center reps to field technicians knows that these goals will improve the results of our business, sustained jobs and communities, and build on our foundation of quality, reliability and trusted interactions with our customers.
Some examples. We've looked at processes and procedures and eliminated what's unnecessary. This basic blocking and tackling has a big positive financial impact. We have deployed local area managers to our new markets. The majority of these managers were trained by Frontier well before close. They now have access to daily sales and retention customer activity that they never had before to help them run their business. We can't know how you're doing, if you don't have daily reports on customers grow adds and deactivations.
All 7,000 technicians in our new markets now report to their local area managers, not to a distant centralized group. These technicians are doing full installations for high-speed, keeping 2-hour appointment windows, and will resolve any technical problem a customer is experiencing. Each tech is trained to handle VoIP, High-Speed Internet and any other issues pertaining to our network for both business and residential customers. 
We have also revamped customer service processes to be more customer-centric. Hours have been expanded to include evenings and weekends. Reps are measured on first call resolutions and sales for the first time, and all reps now have customers save tools. We have eliminated work that is non-value-added, and as a result of all of these changes, call transfers are down over 10%, and we're outsourcing 12% less calls to third-party vendors. 
Our next step is to train all customer service reps on all customer issues. Once this training is complete in 2011, we will have all Frontier customer service reps as universal reps. Again, this streamlines our service delivery, eliminates transfers, and will reduce outsource dependence. 
Shifting to product. Frontier's product goal is to be the provider of choice and increase the number of products that residential and business customers take from us. To achieve this, we are constantly innovating the price simplification and new products and services. 
Our newly acquired market also require an investment to improve the quality of existing services and to increase broadband availability. With these steps, communicated to the customers to local engagement, we expect to drive downturn in the acquire property and to expanded recurring customer revenues. 
Some examples. Frontier increased broadband availability to over 30,000 homes and businesses in that third quarter. We plan to enable more than 300,000 total homes by year end. Together, this will take broadband availability from 64% at closing to over 70% by year end. Our network upgrade projects are being implemented in every market. In addition to increased high-speed availability, we are also enhancing speeds and capacity. In Q3, our overall 6 megabyte availability increased from 43% to 50%. 
All new Frontier markets are now selling new double and triple-play along with value-added services like Peace of Mind. In the past 4 months, we also completed the huge test of converting 100% of customer e-mail accounts from Verizon.net to frontier.com. Finally, Frontier just introduced custom value pricing in our legacy market and in West Virginia. The concept allows customers to build their own bundles by mixing and matching any voice, video or data service. The more they buy, the more they will save, with discounts up to 15% on all products and services purchased.
Profit, when we execute on people and products, profit follows because our customers pay us for value, and as we have demonstrated in our legacy markets, they will buy more products. To align our employees with the company's goals, we've rolled out new performance and compensation metrics in the new markets. These metrics include revenue per customer, a number of products the customer takes, retention of access lines and high-speed services and capital efficiency. 
Some examples. Our Take the Lead program, which rewards employees for referring sales of Frontier products and services generated 3,000 leads in July, 4,300 leads in August, and 5,500 leads in September. In commercial sales, the Legacy business is strong, and West Virginia has built steady momentum in small, medium, enterprise and carrier sales. In the 13 states, we're hiring over 50 new sales account position, our equipment sales initiative is ramping as well in all markets, the wireless backhaul outlook is for double-digit growth, and we're making process improvements in commercial sales and service activity.
Commercial business and residential broadband revenue represents 60% of our total revenue base, which is clearly a positive shift away from access line revenue dependence. Our integration team which did a phenomenal drive in West Virginia, has been redeployed and has focused on the conversion plan for the remaining 13 states, from the current Verizon systems on to our Frontier system. 
As I mentioned on the second quarter call, the West Virginia conversion went very well, the best conversion we've ever done. And we delivered these results on a very specific time schedule. All of the billing cycles went out on time, call volumes are now back to normal, answer times are on plan, and other operational metrics are in line with our legacy Frontier market levels. 
Financially, we are in a solid position with a safe and attractive annual dividend of $0.75 per share. We remain committed to our investors, and we are committed to improving our cash flow from the acquisition. We are off to a good start but we have a lot more to do. I look forward to reporting continued progress to you next quarter. On that note, I will now hand the call over to Don Shassian, our Chief Financial Officer, who will give you the financial overview for the third quarter of 2010. Don?"

I'm very excited to be reporting our financials to you today. Our third quarter results are a great kick off for the new Frontier, and today's synergy number and raised guidance should give you comfort, that we can dramatically change the cost structure of the acquired properties while growing revenues and investing in future capabilities of the network. 
Before we go into the numbers, I want to point out a that our discussions is going to focus primarily on the combined company. However, we are providing a supplemental schedule filed via 8-K today, and available on our website that's similar to the pro forma data we filed in September. In that document, you will find supplemental line item detail broken up for Q3, between legacy Frontier and the acquired properties. Also, our further review and analysis in acquired properties has led us to restate some of the customer operating metrics that conform to our data reporting standards. This comments relates to high-speed and video subscriber accounts only. 
I'd like to begin today with customer trends and working the revenues and profitability before turning to capital spending and new guidance. Please note that our Q3 2010 earnings per share include: The after-tax impact of merger and integration costs. Our adjusted EPS excluding these costs was $0.08. Frontier's Q3 2010 customer revenues of $1.2 billion reflects stabilized customer loss rates in residential, and improved customer loss rates in business. 
Access line losses improved this quarter as compared to Q10 2010 -- Q2 2010, with annual line loss rates of 6% for legacy Frontier, 10.9% for the acquired properties, and 9.3% on a total company basis.
On the residential side, our legacy business demonstrated improved customer losses as compared to both Q2 2010 and Q3 2009. On the acquired side, residential customer loss performance was weaker on a sequential basis, but reflected improvement over Q3 2009. Our local engagement tactics, promotions and broadband build-out are expected to slow the rate of residential access line losses into next year. Both legacy and the acquired properties showed increasing products per customer and average revenue per customer. On a combined basis, residential ARPU increased 3.4% over last year's pro forma third quarter to over $58. 
In our business segments, Frontier's 381,000 customers generated a $533 average revenue per customer per month, helping drive $611 million of revenues, down only 2.7% from pro forma Q3 2009, and only slightly less than pro forma Q2 2010.
Our legacy business revenues were slightly positive year-over-year, while the acquired properties were down 4.3%, an improvement from the 6.3% loss rate in Q2 2010. We believe that our increased focus on business customers, especially in the acquired properties for our local engagement model, will have a positive impact on important part of our business. For Q3 2010, business revenues represented 49% of Frontier's total customer revenues. 
Data and internet services revenues of $453 million declined sequentially, reflecting a $2 million improvement of legacy business, and the $12 million decline in acquired properties. The HSI net subscriber losses in the acquired properties, improved sequentially, and we have positive net adds in legacy similar to last quarter. There's a large portion of our high-speed build-out in the new territories, was weighted towards the end of Q3, and we are aggressively expanding our new HSI availability throughout Q4, as Maggie mentioned. We expect our high-speed net adds to continue to improve and turn positive over the next several quarters. 
Switched access and subsidy revenues were just 11.5% of Frontier's total revenues in the quarter. Looking back at Q3 2009, this was 12.9% on a pro forma basis, and legacy Frontier was 17.3%. As you can see, the acquired properties have decreased our reliance on this revenue category.
We are pleased to report the cash property expenses in the acquired properties were $479 million in Q3 2010. This $63 million sequential reduction from the prior quarter represents our synergies realized in the elimination of the corporate, administrative and common costs incurred by the properties we acquired. Several wage and non-wage cost reduction initiatives will also commence during the quarter. On the legacy side, our cash expenses increased slightly, due to pension and benefit costs overtime and marketing expenses, all specific legacy business. 
On a pro forma basis, our EBITDA margin expanded from 45.7% in pro forma Q2 2010, to 47.9% this quarter, and adjusted EBITDA grew 2.5% sequentially to $671 million. It is a small step, but a very strong step in the right direction for the combined companies.
Turning back to synergies. The $63 million in cost savings in the acquired property represents the sequential 3 months comparison of costs incurred under our management, as compared to the cash operating expenses reported by Verizon in their last and final set of financial reports at June 30. This $63 million level, $252 million on annualized basis, and represents more than 50% of our original $500 million target. I would also remind you that our synergy estimates do not include any assumptions relative to revenues. The savings already achieved through the elimination of the corporate administrative and common costs, coupled with identified expense savings initiatives, presently being implemented, gives us great comfort in raising our 2013 synergy targets of $50 million with total run rate of $550 million.  We expect to realize annualized cost savings of $300 million by the end of 2010, $400 million by the end of 2011 and $550 million by the end of 2012. Approximately, 30% of these synergies were driven by non-wage savings in network and IT operations.
Capital expenditures in Q3 were $159 million or 11.3% of revenues, excluding $15 million of integration CapEx. The level of spending in the acquired properties increased throughout the quarter as we deploy broadband. Total spending in acquired property of $105 million or 11.8% of revenues. Capital expenditures in the acquired properties did increase throughout the third quarter, and will be substantially higher than Q4, as we increase our broadband and network deployment initiatives. Our capital expenditure forecast have remained consistent with previous guidance provided that are approximately 12% of annual revenues, plus $100 million of additional spending per annum for 3 years. We will give full 2011 guidance during our Q4 2010 conference call in February. 
As for revised full year 2010 expectations, we believe that our capital expenditures, excluding integration CapEx, will be between $500 million and $525 million. Our adjusted free cash flow will be between $830 million and $850 million, and our cash taxes will be between $40 million and $50 million, which reflects the benefits of bonus appreciation. Please note that this CapEx forecast reflected very sizable increase in Q4 as our broadband expansion network improvements are in full swing. 
At September 30, 2010, our leverage ratio was 2.84x, net of cash and restricted cash. Frontier generated $339 million in adjusted free cash flow, and paid dividend of $186 million or a payout ratio of 55%. Please note that as CapEx increases in future quarters for our broadband expansion, specifically, for example, in Q4, our payout ratio will increase. In the future, the capital expenditures decrease and our revenue initiatives and cost savings are fully realized, our dividend payout ratio would significantly improve to at or below 50%.
As Maggie stated earlier, we are very committed to maintaining our $0.75 annual dividend. We're also committed to lowering our leverage to 2.5x or below, which we continue to believe is achievable through a combination of EBITDA improvement and/or debt reduction. At this time, we expect residual free cash flow to build on the balance sheet, and are not contemplating any near-term changes to share buyback or dividend policy.
In summary, we're very pleased to be able to report these solid Q3 financial to you as the new Frontier. Result show the beginning of the turnaround that we've committed to you. We know that the turnaround and our achievement of further cost savings is a key piece of your investment pieces. We hope that you'll look back on this long year and take comfort that we've done what we said, we're going to do. From regulatory approvals and conditions, the financing and closing of transaction, the West Virginia system conversion. As we move our focus to converting the next group of seats [ph], we can expect continued delivery of solid legacy results and a notable improvement in the acquired properties. With that, let me pass the call back to Allen to open the call up to questions."

I'm just wondering if you could talk a bit about what areas provided the greatest benefit in the quarter? Was this a function of eliminating some of the headcount that was brought in the second quarter, kind of unexpectedly? And then as you think about raising the guidance, maybe talk a bit about what areas help drive that increasing guidance. And then secondly, I just wanted to touch quickly on margins both within legacy Frontier and Spinco. We had a pretty good step down it looks like in the legacy market about 51% margin. I wonder if this is tied to expenses on West Virginia, if there's some other incremental costs we should be thinking about. And then conversely on Spinco, very nice improvement there. Is that really driven by some of the synergies that were talking about before or are there incremental expenses that are being eliminated on that side?"

And so that has all been achieved substantially, the largest amount of that $63 million for the quarter. There are over 75 initiatives that we wad in-house that are being worked on to reduce cost savings over the next several years. Some of the really larger ones on the network side. We are migrating the backbone, our backbone to eliminating circuit costs, very substantial from migrating long distance from one carrier to another, also very substantial. We're rationalizing some vendors, that they're using versus what we're using, trying to consolidate the spending, and there's a host of other activities that are going on, all very -- gives us a lot of comfort to raise the guidance. I think some of the real push for us, is on the network side, as Dan McCarthy and his team were looking at the network side before even closed, and we're planning on what we're going to do with the network. We are seeing a little bit more savings than we have anticipated out of the gate and sort of gave us some comfort to raise it up and feel very comfortable with that. The second question on the margins on legacy. On the legacy side, there were some costs for the quarter that were higher than normal. Over time, it's quite high. There are a lot of storms in a number of our regions, which caused a lot higher overtime than we normally have this time of year. And also, we did have increased pension contributions. Our cash pension contributions of $5 million this quarter over last quarter, will drop down significantly for next quarter. So there's a little bit of some one-timers, if you would. West Virginia is really been cold out of that. We're reporting to you West Virginia and the acquired properties so the step-up in legacy from a couple of areas that should be for the most part, one-timers and we should be able to get those margins back up next quarter. And in the acquired properties improvement, is really trying to -- the expense is kicking in, savings kicking in as well as the revenues being pretty solid."

We have been very quick from a signage perspective, all of our trucks, we've been converting over to Frontier, we look at those at billboards all around our markets. The web, we have changed the branding on all of the websites, and have really pushed web in a number of those markets with our customer base. We've had a series of communications out in the customer by mail. Again, reinforcing who we are and what we're doing. And we've used a new brand called, The Conversation Company, as the way to increase dialogue between us and our customers and to also, facilitate dialogue between our customers. And the people that they care about that they want to communicate to. So we've done a lot in the markets from a branding perspective. I think the good news is we've got a lot of press coverage on Frontier. We have a good reputation. And as you recall, we do business in every one of the states that we acquired, except for 3 new ones. And in those new ones, we've actually put more focus on branding, because our name is not as well-known in those states. But we do believe that you have come on strong from a branding perspective in these markets to really change the game of being about customers and customer service, and a focus on customers, versus Verizon, has not been doing much on those market from an advertising or engagement perspective over the last several years. I think the other good thing for us is, the competitors in all those markets are used to a Verizon lethargic approach to competition. That's not how we do business. So we're really trying to step up the game, too, with local engagement to change that paradigm and to really drive customers to call us or to communicate with us, and especially new customers or win-backs. And we have a number of initiatives going on in those markets to the end of the year to really drive on communications and promotions to the win-back customers in those markets. We have, as I mentioned, changed a number of things that we're doing from a customer service perspective to make that a better experience for the customer, and we think that will drive better customer satisfaction rates. And you'll see us on a monthly basis to continue to do customer satisfaction survey in the new markets as well.  Shifting over to Washington D.C., I was actually in D.C. about 2 weeks ago. I had lunch with the Chairman of the FCC. I spent some time at the White House and on the Hills. I do think this is election, there's a chance for a reset for some of the initiatives that have been talked about in Washington, that would affect our industry specifically, net neutrality and also, intercarrier compensation and universal service reform. One of the negatives that happened is, Rick Boucher, who I think, all of us knew, was a pretty levelheaded Congress who was one of leaders in driving for universal service reform and intercarrier comp reform was defeated. I do think that Julius Genachowski will sort of pick up the mantle on that though and we look to get a proposed rule-making, sometime in 2011 on universal service and intercarrier comp, whether they'll swallow the whole issue or break off certain pieces of that are more low-hanging fruit remains to be seen. But I think they'll be rational and open and transparent in the process. And we truly believe any change in universal service funding and intercarrier compensation would be positive for our company, no doubt about it because there's a lot of things that broken in that system. I also, would think, that net neutrality debate, I'm not sure if the FCC will go forward with the Title II right. I think that remains to be seen, but I think they'll be more pressure on them, if they try to do that now with a Republican House. So we're going to learn a lot, I think over the next several weeks once the lame duck session starts to really see what will be on the docket. But again, I don't think anything will happen for our industry until we're into 2011."

So we targeted pretty much in the whole with these markets. We actually improved that loss by 45% in one quarter. So just like anything else when you're trying to turn an aircraft carrier, it takes a lot of effort to drive the momentum in the different direction. In addition to that, in just taking over those markets, it took us some time to do the planning as to where we're going to expand high-speed DSL in those markets. So the momentum of build-out didn't really start until late in the quarter, in September, more so than July and August. So we do believe that we'll see better momentum in the fourth quarter and into first quarter next year as we continue to do more aggressive build-out, which gives us an opportunity to build on the momentum that we've already started. We also found in the FiOS market, if we think about FiOS, we think about it in 2 parts: We think about broadband, and we think about video. And one of the policies that Verizon had in how they managed those market is they would not offer a customer who is in FiOS neighborhood, DSL service. Now FiOS charge like 50 meg, and it's very expensive, it's like $50 a month per customer. So they left a whole host of customers behind from an affordability perspective, we didn't need that kind of capability on broadband. We addressed over the last 30 to 60 days, opened up DSL, in all the FiOS markets to give the customers choice. So the customer can choose whether they want FiOS broadband, or they want High-Speed Internet service. Typically, in those markets, we're offering around 6 to 7 meg as the entrée point. In addition to that, we're also offering in the FiOS market, the choice of DirecTV or FiOS video. Again, we come from a paradigm of choice for customers. We think that customer should be able to choose what kind of video they want. We have aggressive offers in the market, good growth, DirecTV and for FiOS video. But in our vernacular, what we care about is keeping the customers, getting the customer to take more products and services from us, and making sure that customers are happy with the choice point. So we've made a number of changes throughout all of these markets in terms of policy. Another good example is we've opened up in many of these locations the opportunity to sell high-speed service, up to 95% capacity on the equipment that we have out in the field. Verizon had set a parameter at 75%. So again, we're opening up more opportunities which we also think will change the paradigm shift in the numbers for high-speed overall. With regard to the FiOS video products, we are still evaluating it from a financial perspective and a customer perspective, and from a cost perspective and a revenue perspective. In terms of what that does for us, overall, what it does for churn, how much does it really cost to extend this capability in the markets that we're in today and we think that, that analysis and evaluation will go on through the first quarter, and then we'll be able to make some choice points in terms of what we want to do with FiOS from an expansion perspective or from a maintenance perspective."

So the 30,000 we turned on in the third quarter, were basically turned on in September, right? And so October and November will be big months for build, all the way through the middle of December. And it's not just about building new, but it's also about going out, and look at every single area from a local engagement perspective to see where we have excess capacity that we can put into existing equipment and turn on neighborhoods that actually had more capacity to go but just based upon policy that Verizon had in place, they wouldn't sell to additional customers in those areas. So we have a very different velocity that we'll be creative about turning broadband on for customers, and so a number of the homes that we're turning on don't require us to add more capital, it's simply changing policy. A good example is, if you look at the DSL choice points in the FiOS markets, that several hundred thousand homes over probably, the next year that we could have access to that we didn't have access to before. So we feel pretty confident that we'll get to that 300,000 level, and we're trying to push too, as much this quarter because January, February, March our top months to build. So the more we can front load into the fourth quarter, trying to hit some of those homes with promotions during the holiday season allows us to continue to sell to that capacity into Q1 where we won't be able to build this aggressively."

Thank you for joining our call today to discuss third quarter 2010 results for Frontier Communications Corporation. We're excited to be reporting our first financial results as the new Frontier, following the completion of our July 1 acquisition of Verizon properties. We know that you've all been waiting patiently for these numbers, and we believe that the wait has been worthwhile.
Frontier's third quarter results demonstrate the improvements that are already happening in the acquired properties, our confidence in our business plan, and the strong and steady results in our legacy business. In Q3 2010, Frontier realized synergies of $63 million in the acquired properties. This is a $252 million annualized rate and was achieved from the elimination of corporate overhead costs and other wage and non-wage synergies.
Looking forward, this permanent reduction, along with continued synergy realization gives us confidence to raise our 2013 synergy run rate estimate by 10% to $550 million. 
This positive lift to our synergy target is on top of the very solid quarter as the new Frontier. Our Q3 revenues were $1.4 billion, and adjusted operating cash flow, or EBITDA of $671 million, that represented a strong margin of 48%. We converted this into free cash flow of $339 million in the third quarter, and paid 55% of this to our shareholders as dividends. 
Consistent with our position since we first announced the Verizon transaction, Frontier is successfully managing a business, 3x its former size in terms of revenues and employees. We believe this success is being driven by strong leadership, a focus on customer sales and retention, and by implementing our local engagement model in all new markets.
In the 4 months that we have owned the acquired properties, we have laid a solid foundation for the future business. We managed Frontier's business internally by focusing on 3 key drivers of value for our company, people, product and profit. Managing the business this way, differentiated Frontier's legacy business this quarter by driving improved customer metrics, rising ARPU and strong margins.
Let me start with people. As I mentioned, our employees tripled in number at closing, and implementing cultural change has been one of our primary missions. Our senior leadership team has met with every one of our employees over the past few months, and I have personally met with 11,000 new and legacy Frontier employees since closing.
Our people are energized and engaged in the Frontier mission and value. We are truly owners of the company because on July 1, we made every employee a shareholder of Frontier. This gesture linked our legacy and new employees together, all employees are working towards the same 3 goals, keep and grow access [ph] line, accelerate High-Speed Internet deployment and growth, and implement local engagement to enhance the customer experience. Everyone from our call center reps to field technicians knows that these goals will improve the results of our business, sustain jobs and communities, and build on our foundation of quality, reliability and trusted interactions with our customers.
Some examples. We've looked at processes and procedures and eliminated what's unnecessary. This basic blocking and tackling has a big positive financial impact. We have deployed local area managers to our new markets. The majority of these managers were trained by Frontier well before close. They now have access to daily sales and retention customer activity that they never had before to help them run their business. You can't know how you're doing, if you don't have daily reports on customers grow adds and deactivations.
All 7,000 technicians in our new markets now report to their local area managers, not to a distant centralized group. These technicians are doing full installations for high-speed, keeping 2-hour appointment windows, and will resolve any technical problem a customer is experiencing. Each tech is trained to handle VoIP, High-Speed Internet and any other issues pertaining to our network for both business and residential customers. 
We have also revamped customer service processes to be more customer-centric. Hours have been expanded to include evenings and weekends. Reps are measured on first call resolutions and sales for the first time, and all reps now have customer save tools. We have eliminated work that is non-value-added, and as a result of all of these changes, call transfers are down over 10%, and we're outsourcing 12% less calls to third-party vendors. 
Our next step is to train all customer service reps on all customer issues. Once this training is complete in 2011, we will have all Frontier customer service reps as universal reps. Again, this streamlines our service delivery, eliminates transfers, and will reduce outsource dependence. 
Shifting to product. Frontier's product goal is to be the provider of choice and increase the number of products that residential and business customers take from us. To achieve this, we are constantly innovating the price simplification and new products and services. 
Our newly acquired markets also require an investment to improve the quality of existing services and to increase broadband availability. With these steps, communicated to the customers through local engagements, we expect to drive downturn in the acquire properties and to expand recurring customer revenues. 
Some examples. Frontier increased broadband availability to over 30,000 homes and businesses in that third quarter. We plan to enable more than 300,000 total homes by year end. Together, this will take broadband availability from 64% at closing to over 70% by year end. Our network upgrade projects are being implemented in every market. In addition to increased high-speed availability, we are also enhancing speeds and capacity. In Q3, our overall 6 megabyte availability increased from 43% to 50%. 
All new Frontier markets are now selling new double and triple-play along with value-added services like Peace of Mind. In the past 4 months, we also completed the huge test of converting 100% of customer e-mail accounts from Verizon.net to frontier.com. Finally, Frontier just introduced custom value pricing in our legacy market and in West Virginia. The concept allows customers to build their own bundles by mixing and matching any voice, video or data service. The more they buy, the more they will save, with discounts up to 15% on all products and services purchased.
Profit, when we execute on people and products, profit follows because our customers pay us for value, and as we have demonstrated in our legacy markets, they will buy more products. To align our employees with the company's goals, we've rolled out new performance and compensation metrics in the new markets. These metrics include revenue per customer, the number of products the customer takes, retention of access lines and high-speed services and capital efficiency. 
Some examples. Our Take the Lead program, which rewards employees for referring sales of Frontier products and services generated 3,000 leads in July, 4,300 leads in August, and 5,500 leads in September. In commercial sales, the Legacy business is strong, and West Virginia has built steady momentum in small, medium, enterprise and carrier sales. In the 13 states, we're hiring over 50 new sales account position, our equipment sales initiative is ramping as well in all markets, the wireless backhaul outlook is for double-digit growth, and we're making process improvements in commercial sales and service activity.
Commercial business and residential broadband revenue represents 60% of our total revenue base, which is clearly a positive shift away from access line revenue dependence. Our integration team which did a phenomenal job in West Virginia, has been redeployed and has focused on the conversion plan for the remaining 13 states, from the current Verizon system on to our Frontier system. 
As I mentioned on the second quarter call, the West Virginia conversion went very well, the best conversion we've ever done. And we delivered these results on a very specific time schedule. All of the billing cycles went out on time, call volumes are now back to normal, answer times are on plan, and other operational metrics are in line with our legacy Frontier market levels. 
Financially, we are in a solid position with a safe and attractive annual dividend of $0.75 per share. We remain committed to our investors, and we are committed to improving our cash flow from the acquisition. We are off to a good start but we have a lot more to do. I look forward to reporting continued progress to you next quarter. On that note, I will now hand the call over to Don Shassian, our Chief Financial Officer, who will give you the financial overview for the third quarter of 2010. Don?"

I'm very excited to be reporting our financials to you today. Our third quarter results are a great kick off for the new Frontier, and today's synergy number and raised guidance should give you comfort, that we can dramatically change the cost structure of the acquired properties while growing revenues and investing in future capabilities of the network. 
Before we go into the numbers, I want to point out  that our discussion is going to focus primarily on the combined company. However, we are providing a supplemental schedule filed via 8-K today, and available on our website that's similar to the pro forma data we filed in September. In that document, you will find supplemental line item details broken up for Q3, between legacy Frontier and the acquired properties. Also, our further review and analysis in acquired properties has led us to restate some of the customer operating metrics that conform to our data reporting standards. This comment relates to high-speed and video subscriber accounts only. 
I'd like to begin today with customer trends and working the revenues and profitability before turning to capital spending and new guidance. Please note that our Q3 2010 earnings per share include: The after-tax impact of merger and integration costs. Our adjusted EPS excluding these costs was $0.08. Frontier's Q3 2010 customer revenues of $1.2 billion reflects stabilized customer loss rates in residential, and improved customer loss rates in business. 
Access line losses improved this quarter as compared to Q10 2010 -- Q2 2010, with annual line loss rates of 6% for legacy Frontier, 10.9% for the acquired properties, and 9.3% on a total company basis.
On the residential side, our legacy business demonstrated improved customer losses as compared to both Q2 2010 and Q3 2009. On the acquired side, residential customer loss performance was weaker on a sequential basis, but reflected improvement over Q3 2009. Our local engagement tactics, promotions and broadband build-out are expected to slow the rate of residential access line losses into next year. Both legacy and the acquired properties showed increasing products per customer and average revenue per customer. On a combined basis, residential ARPU increased 3.4% over last year's pro forma third quarter to over $58. 
In our business segments, Frontier's 381,000 customers generated a $533 average revenue per customer per month, helping drive $611 million of revenues, down only 2.7% from pro forma Q3 2009, and only slightly less than pro forma Q2 2010.
Our legacy business revenues were slightly positive year-over-year, while the acquired properties were down 4.3%, an improvement from the 6.3% loss rate in Q2 2010. We believe that our increased focus on business customers, especially in the acquired properties for our local engagement model, will have a positive impact on some important part of our business. For Q3 2010, business revenues represented 49% of Frontier's total customer revenues. 
Data and internet services revenues of $453 million declined sequentially, reflecting a $2 million improvement in legacy business, and the $12 million decline in acquired properties. The HSI net subscriber losses in  acquired properties, improved sequentially, and we have positive net adds in legacy similar to last quarter. There's a large portion of our high-speed build-out in the new territories, was weighted towards the end of Q3, and we are aggressively expanding our new HSI availability throughout Q4, as Maggie mentioned. We expect our high-speed net adds to continue to improve and turn positive over the next several quarters. 
Switched access and subsidy revenues were just 11.5% of Frontier's total revenues in the quarter. Looking back at Q3 2009, this was 12.9% on a pro forma basis, and legacy Frontier was 17.3%. As you can see, the acquired properties have decreased our reliance on this revenue category.
We are pleased to report the cash property expenses in the acquired properties were $479 million in Q3 2010. This $63 million sequential reduction from the prior quarter represents our synergies realized in the elimination of the corporate, administrative and common costs incurred by the properties we acquired. Several wage and non-wage cost reduction initiatives will also commence during the quarter. On the legacy side, our cash expenses increased slightly, due to pension and benefit costs overtime and marketing expenses, all specific legacy business. 
On a pro forma basis, our EBITDA margin expanded from 45.7% in pro forma Q2 2010, to 47.9% this quarter, and adjusted EBITDA grew 2.5% sequentially to $671 million. It is a small step, but a very strong step in the right direction for the combined company.
Turning back to synergies. The $63 million in cost savings in the acquired property represents the sequential 3 months comparison of costs incurred under our management, as compared to the cash operating expenses reported by Verizon in their last and final set of financial reports at June 30. This $63 million level, $252 million on annualized basis, and represents more than 50% of our original $500 million target. I will also remind you that our synergy estimates do not include any assumptions relative to revenues. The savings already achieved through the elimination of the corporate administrative and common costs, coupled with identified expense savings initiatives, presently being implemented, gives us great comfort in raising our 2013 synergy target by $50 million with total run rate of $550 million.  We expect to realize annualized cost savings of $300 million by the end of 2010, $400 million by the end of 2011 and $550 million by the end of 2012. Approximately, 30% of these synergies were driven by non-wage savings in network and IT operations.
Capital expenditures in Q3 were $159 million or 11.3% of revenues, excluding $15 million of integration CapEx. The level of spending in the acquired properties increased throughout the quarter as we deploy broadband. Total spending in acquired property of $105 million for the quarter or 11.8% of revenues. Capital expenditures in the acquired property did increase throughout the third quarter, and will be substantially higher in Q4, as we increase our broadband and network deployment initiatives. Our capital expenditure forecasts have remained consistent with previous guidance provided at approximately 12% of annual revenues, plus $100 million of additional spending per annum for 3 years. We will give full 2011 guidance during our Q4 2010 conference call in February. 
As for revised full year 2010 expectations, we believe that our capital expenditures, excluding integration CapEx, will be between $500 million and $525 million. Our adjusted free cash flow will be between $830 million and $850 [ph] million, and our cash taxes will be between $40 million and $50 million, which reflects the benefits of bonus depreciation. Please note that this CapEx forecast reflected very sizable increase in Q4 as our broadband expansion network improvements are in full swing. 
At September 30, 2010, our leverage ratio was 2.84x, net of cash and restricted cash. Frontier generated $339 million in adjusted free cash flow, and paid dividend of $186 million or a payout ratio of 55%. Please note that if CapEx increases in future quarters for our broadband expansion, specifically, for example, in Q4, our payout ratio will increase. In the future, the capital expenditures decrease and our revenue initiatives and cost savings are fully realized, our dividend payout ratio would significantly improve to at or below 50%.
As Maggie stated earlier, we are very committed to maintaining our $0.75 annual dividend. We're also committed to lowering our leverage to 2.5x or below, which we continue to believe is achievable through a combination of EBITDA improvement and/or debt reduction. At this time, we expect residual free cash flow to build on the balance sheet, and are not contemplating any near-term changes to share buyback or dividend policy.
In summary, we're very pleased to be able to report these solid Q3 financial to you as the new Frontier. Results show the beginning of the turnaround that we've committed to you. We know that the turnaround and our achievement of further cost savings is a key piece of your investment pieces. We hope that you'll look back on this long year and take comfort that we've done what we said, we're going to do. From regulatory approvals and conditions, to financing and closing the transaction, the West Virginia system conversion. As we move our focus to converting the next group of states, we can expect continued delivery of solid legacy results and a notable improvement in the acquired properties. With that, let me pass the call back to Allen to open the call up to questions."

I'm just wondering if you could talk a bit about what areas provided the greatest benefit in the quarter? Was this a function of eliminating some of the headcount that was brought  on in the second quarter, kind of unexpectedly? And then as you think about raising the guidance, maybe talk a bit about what areas help drive that increase in guidance. And then secondly, I just wanted to touch quickly on margins both within legacy Frontier and Spinco. We had a pretty good step down it looks like in the legacy market about 51% margin. I wonder if this is tied to expenses on West Virginia, if there's some other incremental costs we should be thinking about. And then conversely on Spinco, very nice improvement there. Is that really driven by some of the synergies that were talking about before or are there incremental expenses that are being eliminated on that side?"

And so that has all been achieved substantially, the largest amount of that $63 million for the quarter. There are over 75 initiatives that we had in-house that are being worked on to reduce cost savings over the next several years. Some of the really larger ones are on the network side. We are migrating the backbone, to  our backbone to eliminating circuit costs, very substantial from migrating long distance from one carrier to another, also very substantial. We're rationalizing some vendors, that they're using versus what we're using, trying to consolidate the spending, and there's a host of other activities that are going on, all very -- gives us a lot of comfort to raise the guidance. I think some of the real push for us, is on the network side, as Dan McCarthy and his team were looking at the network side before even closed, and we're planning on what we're going to do with the network. We are seeing a little bit more savings than we have anticipated out of the gate and sort of gave us some comfort to raise it up and feel very comfortable with that. The second question on the margins on legacy. On the legacy side, there were some costs for the quarter that were higher than normal. Over time, it's quite high. There are a lot of storms in a number of our regions, which caused a lot higher overtime than we normally had this time of year. And also, we did have increased pension contributions. Cash pension contributions of $5 million this quarter over last quarter, which will drop down significantly for next quarter. So there's a little bit of some one-timers, if you would. West Virginia is really been called out of that. We're reporting to you West Virginia and the acquired properties so the step-up in legacy from a couple of areas that should be for the most part, one-timers and we should be able to get those margins back up next quarter. And in the acquired properties improvement, is really trying to -- the expense is kicking in, savings kicking in as well as the revenues being pretty solid."

Your question on the regulatory revenue on the acquired property, the only response you're looking to, is it really comes from, I believe on the switch side. Switch access appears to a be a little than we had anticipated. We are continuing to look at all of that information and to make sure that we are billing for everything, we should be billing for.

We have been very quick from a signage perspective, all of our trucks, we've been converting over to Frontier, we look at those as billboards all around our markets. The web, we have changed the branding on all of the websites, and have really pushed web in a number of those markets with our customer base. We've had a series of communications out to the customer by mail. Again, reinforcing who we are and what we're doing. And we've used a new brand called, The Conversation Company, as the way to increase dialogue between us and our customers and to also, facilitate dialogue between our customers. And the people that they care about that they want to communicate to. So we've done a lot in the markets from a branding perspective. I think the good news is we've had a lot of press coverage on Frontier. We have a good reputation. And as you recall, we do business in every one of the states that we acquired, except for 3 new ones. And in those new ones, we've actually put more focus on branding, because our name is not as well-known in those states. But we do believe that we have come on strong from a branding perspective in these markets to really change the game of being about customers and customer service, and a focus on customers, versus Verizon, has not been doing much on those markets from an advertising or engagement perspective over the last several years. I think the other good thing for us is, the competitors in all those markets are used to a Verizon lethargic approach to competition. That's not how we do business. So we're really trying to step up the game, too, with local engagements to change that paradigm and to really drive customers to call us or to communicate with us, and especially new customers or win-back. And we have a number of initiatives going on in those markets to the end of the year to really drive  communication and promotions to the win-back customers in those markets. We have, as I mentioned, changed a number of things that we're doing from a customer service perspective to make that a better experience for the customer, and we think that will drive better customer satisfaction rates. And you'll see us on a monthly basis to continue to do customer satisfaction survey in the new markets as well.  Shifting over to Washington D.C., I was actually in D.C. about 2 weeks ago. I had lunch with the Chairman of the FCC. I spent some time at the White House and on the Hill. I do think this is election, there's a chance for a reset for some of the initiatives that have been talked about in Washington, that would affect our industry specifically, net neutrality and also, intercarrier compensation and universal service reform. One of the negatives that happened is, Rick Boucher, who I think, all of us knew, was a pretty levelheaded Congressman who was one of leaders in driving for universal service reform and intercarrier comp reform was defeated. I do think that Julius Genachowski will sort of pick up the mantle on that though and will look to get a proposed rule-making, sometime in 2011 on universal service and intercarrier comp, whether they'll swallow the whole issue or break off certain pieces of that that are more low-hanging fruit remains to be seen. But I think they'll be rational and open and transparent in the process. And we truly believe any change in universal service funding and intercarrier compensation would be positive for our company, no doubt about it because there's a lot of things  broken in that system. I also, would think, that the net neutrality debate, I'm not sure if the FCC will go forward with the Title II right. I think that remains to be seen, but I think they'll be more pressure on them, if they try to do that now with a Republican House. So we're going to learn a lot, I think over the next several weeks once the lame duck session starts to really see what will be on the docket. But again, I don't think anything will happen for our industry until we're into 2011."

So we started pretty much in the whole with these markets. We actually improved that loss by 45% in one quarter. So just like anything else when you're trying to turn an aircraft carrier, it takes a lot of effort to drive the momentum in the different direction. In addition to that, in just taking over those markets, it took us some time to do the planning as to where we're going to expand high-speed DSL in those markets. So the momentum of build-out didn't really start until late in the quarter, in September, more so than July and August. So we do believe that we'll see better momentum in the fourth quarter and into first quarter next year as we continue to do more aggressive build-out, which gives us an opportunity to build on the momentum that we've already started. We also found in the FiOS market, if we think about FiOS, we think about it in 2 parts: We think about broadband, and we think about video. And one of the policies that Verizon had in how they managed those markets is they would not offer a customer who is in FiOS neighborhood, DSL service. Now FiOS charges like 50 meg, and it's very expensive, it's like $50 a month per customer. So they left a whole host of customers behind from an affordability perspective, who didn't need that kind of capability on broadband. We addressed over the last 30 to 60 days, opened up DSL, in all the FiOS markets to give the customer choice. So the customer can choose whether they want FiOS broadband, or they want High-Speed Internet service. Typically, in those markets, we're offering around 6 to 7 meg as the entrée point. In addition to that, we're also offering in the FiOS market, the choice of DirecTV or FiOS video. Again, we come from a paradigm of choice for customers. We think that customers should be able to choose what kind of video they want. We have aggressive offers in the market, for both, DirecTV and for FiOS video. But in our vernacular, what we care about is keeping the customer, getting the customer to take more products and services from us, and making sure that customer is happy with the choice point. So we've made a number of changes throughout all of these markets in terms of policy. Another good example is we've opened up in many of these locations the opportunity to sell high-speed service, up to 95% capacity on the equipment that we have out in the field. Verizon had set a parameter at 75%. So again, we're opening up more opportunities which we also think will change the paradigm shift in the numbers for high-speed overall. With regard to the FiOS video products, we are still evaluating it from a financial perspective and a customer perspective, and from a cost perspective and a revenue perspective. In terms of what that does for us, overall, what it does for churn, how much does it really cost to extend this capability in the markets that we're in today and we think that, that analysis and evaluation will go on through the first quarter, and then we'll be able to make some choice points in terms of what we want to do with FiOS from an expansion perspective or from a maintenance perspective."

There are a number of things that we have to do in order to get there. Our goal would be to get to 8% line losses, that's what we're focused on. And I think it starts with having high-speed service as a component of what we sell to the customer. It's also about improving network quality. We have a number of areas where the voice network quality is not where it needs to be, and we've jumped on that. So we're making some dramatic improvements to the networks throughout the footprint. We are also talking about the value of our phone service and communicating that through advertising as well as promotions in the marketplace. It's about improved customer service in these markets. And it's about selling bundles, and getting customers on price protection plan. I think as you know in our legacy market, 96% of all of our sales are on a price protection plan, and we have -- close to 60% of our residential customers on a 1, 2 or 3-year price protection plan. That number is below 15% in the acquired markets. So we're also driving for price protection plans with every sale that we're doing in these new markets as well. So there is again, a number of push points that we have to do to get the access line losses in line where they need to be. Again, it doesn't happen overnight, but we're pleased with the progress that we've made so far."

So the 30,000 we turned on in the third quarter, were basically turned on in September, right? And so October and November will be big months for build, all the way through the middle of December. And it's not just about building new, but it's also about going out, and we've  looked at every single area from a local engagement perspective to see where we have excess capacity that we can put into existing equipment and turn on neighborhoods that actually had more capacity to just based upon policy that Verizon had in place, they wouldn't sell to additional customers in those areas. So we have a very different philosophy that we'll be creative about turning broadband on for customers, and so a number of the homes that we're turning on don't require us to add more capital, it's simply changing policy. A good example is, if you look at the DSL choice points in the FiOS markets, that's several hundred thousand homes over probably, the next year that we could have access to that we didn't have access to before. So we feel pretty confident that we'll get to that 300,000 level, and we're trying to push too, as much this quarter because January, February, March are top months to build. So the more we can front load into the fourth quarter, trying to hit some of those homes with promotions during the holiday season allows us to continue to sell to that capacity into Q1 where we won't be able to build this aggressively."
