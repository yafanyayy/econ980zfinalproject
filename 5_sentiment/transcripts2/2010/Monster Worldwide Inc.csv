Good afternoon, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter and Year End 2009 Conference Call. I will cover the following topics in my remarks this afternoon: A quick review of Monster's growth strategy, our core business trends, a summary review of fourth quarter performance, today's announcement of our entry into a definitive agreement with Yahoo! to acquire HotJobs and the traffic agreement with Yahoo! and the areas of focus as we enter 2010. Tim will then provide financial details on the fourth quarter 2009 and further perspective on the Yahoo! announcement, as well as context for the first quarter and full year 2010. I will then make brief summary remarks and then we'll take your questions.We were pleased to see many of you at our Investor Conference in New York City three months ago. At that time, we updated you on the progress we've made in transforming Monster and demonstrated our innovative precision search technology powered by Trovix, which we've now branded 6Sense.This new search engine powers the suite of products that delivers precise, relative results that match seekers with job opportunity faster and better than ever before. This revolutionary product exemplifies the innovative approach we've taken in reviewing every aspect of our business. It is a culmination of our initiative to position the company for long-term sustainable growth. Let me take a few minutes to quickly summarize these initiatives.We have largely rebuilt our infrastructure, creating a solid platform for future growth. We've overhauled the seeker experience and introduced new career management resources and tools for many of the job seekers who visit Monster around the globe. We've expanded the audience for our employers' job postings through our innovative media products, including Career Ad Network product. We significantly enhanced our networking capability through the integration of our Monster Affinity Communities. We've expanded our reach to key alliances and partnerships with offline and online media. We've established a wider geographic footprint in large geographic markets in Asia. And now with today's announcement regarding the proposed acquisition of HotJobs from Yahoo! and the traffic agreement with Yahoo!, we have substantially added quality traffic, while significantly increasing our customer base. The new tools and applications available to our customers, both employers and seekers, are unique to Monster and distinguished us from the competition. We have changed the industry by creating the best search technology in the Recruitment business.All these positive initiatives have generated strong momentums as we enter a better environment in 2010. We are very proud of these accomplishments, particularly given that we achieved them during a deep global recession and are gratified by our customers' support.As the global economy appears to be recovering from recession, we have seen positive signs of continued stability and improvement. Several major economic indicators, including GDP, employment and online recruitment data, suggest that U.S. and Europe are in early stages of recovery. For example, the U.S. GDP increased on an annual rate of 5.7% in the fourth quarter of '09. Additionally, the Monster Employment Index for the U.S. and Europe consistently show more positive trends.As a result, companies are fighting their interest in acquiring talent and filling critical-skilled positions. Conversations with our customers are becoming increasingly more positive, as they look to rehire and create jobs during this period of high-labor productivity.It's becoming evident that companies will need to expand their workforce to keep up with demand as the economy recovers. The combination of a strengthening economic environment with strategic initiatives we have implemented at Monster as a result of significant improvements in our operations and provide a superior value proposition to our customers.However, as you know, the unemployment rate remains historically high and demand is substantially down from normal level. But there is no question that we are in a far better place today than we were at this time last year. The psychology of the market has clearly improved, customers are showing more optimism and job creation is now the nation's top priority.On a personal note, I have been honored and privileged to have made several trips to the White House recently as part of the President's plans to create jobs in America. These meetings have provided valuable insight into the thinking of business leaders and their future needs to expand their workforce. While there was still many obstacles to overcome, the tone of these business leaders have become more positive and upbeat as the economy's been strengthening.In looking at the fourth quarter results, sales came in better than our forecast. The recruitment market is large and highly competitive and fragmented, and we are increasingly confident that we are gaining share from targeted competitors. While we expected a sequential seasonal lift in sales, the increase we experienced was a pleasant surprise. Our deferred revenue balance, excluding ChinaHR, increased sequentially for the first time in almost two years and as a precursor to higher revenue over time. Both revenue and the bottom line were in line with our expectations. Our international revenues showed a sequential increase in the fourth quarter, as certain larger European countries contributed to the momentum that we experienced in our Asia business beginning in the third quarter. In the U.S., key indicators have improved, and it is clear we are winning the competitive battle.There were number of strategic factors that came together to drive those performance. Monster have seen the benefits of the many changes made to improve and enhance our customer experience. Seekers have become more engaged on the site as a result of the new career management resource tools and the ability to view more relevant jobs quicker.Our ability to offer expanded portfolio of products, including media products through our Career Ad Network, provide more exposure and better results for our customers' postings. The results of our Power Resume Search product, which was introduced during the last week in October in the U.S., so far has been absolutely outstanding.Customers are finding that they are operating more efficiently by saving time and money, as we deliver more relevant and qualified candidates. This efficiency and improved results have allowed us to capture a premium price for the product. We are very excited about the potential for this product as it gains traction and as we rollout the product in certain markets in Europe, Asia and Australia this year. The bottom line is that we have seen improved results due to customers' acceptance of our new products and expanded portfolio, only by the improvement in employment as a result of a better economy. We're extremely pleased to also announce today a definitive agreement with Yahoo! to acquire HotJobs and at the same time enter into a multi-year traffic deal to be the exclusive career site on Yahoo!'s U.S. and Canadian homepage. The agreement also provides Monster with the exclusivity to negotiate similar traffic agreement with Yahoo! properties on a global basis.I'd like to provide a high-level overview of what this deal brings to Monster and Ted will provide additional details in our financial perspective. Essentially, the transaction positions Monster to add high-quality, relevant job seekers efficiently, while at the same time, significantly expanding our customer base. This transaction will bring Monster superior technology and expertise, including its recently introduced 6Sense search technology to a deeper combined pool of job seekers and employers.This combined offering will be made even more robust as future job seekers and employers are brought to the Monster's site to increase traffic from the vast Yahoo! network. The traffic deal will establish a number one traffic position for Monster in the U.S.The opportunity to work with an additional 600 billion weekly newspapers to both companies alliances, with newspaper publishers is exciting and presents an opportunity for significant growth going forward. These media partners represent approximately half of U.S. daily and weekly market newspaper circulation and our further access into local markets and job sectors.The transaction will be accretive to our earnings in 2011 and break even on a pro forma basis in 2010. Our liquid balance sheet provides a strong financial foundation to execute this transaction and allows us to continue to finance future investments without compromising our financial strength.A deeper pool of employers and job seekers ensures more and better quality matches, making the business more attractive and providing more value than with each company could achieve separately. With this added value and with the accretive aspects of the transactions, we believe that employers, job seekers, our newspaper partners and shareholders will realize substantial benefits from this new partnership once the deal closes and for the longer term. Finally, while this transaction directly strands [ph] our U.S. operations, Monster's customers will benefit as they recruit talent from a larger U.S. seeker base. We are entering the new year a much stronger company. We have innovative products, superior technology, improved customer service and vastly improved go-to market strategy. We're confident we will build on the strong foundation by continuing to invest in areas that will contribute to future growth and we certainly have many initiatives in place to build on our success.Let me just highlight a few. Innovation will continue to be the cornerstone of Monster's growth strategy. We believe there are many opportunities to broaden the application for our 6Sense technology and we are intrigued [ph] with the potential. On the marketing front, we'll continue to support and promote our brand creatively and efficiently. Our new marketing campaign, Get a Monster Advantage, is a three-tier platform aimed at giving both job seekers and employers a way to search better, plan better and connect better. The campaign highlights Monster's innovative resources designed to match people with the right job and employers with the right talent. You will see an important part of the campaign during Sunday's Super Bowl. I don't want to give away too much but watch for the beaver with the fiddle that migrates from pond to a hot tub. I think you'll find them entertaining.We have spent a considerable amount of time internally, crafting a multi-year geographic expansion that enable Monster to enter developing countries efficiently and effectively. The center is being led by Rob Brouwer, who was a key member of the team to establish Monster's current leadership position in Europe. The strength of our European management team allows Rob to assume responsibility for this important initiative. We believe there is huge opportunity to expand the Monster brand to countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia, which have large employee populations and growing economies. This planned expansion is underway and will accelerate throughout the year. We will continue to be disciplined and follow a strategic plan that allows us to build on the strong foundation we've created. Monster has tremendous opportunity to expand its products, its market and its geographic presence. As the economy continues to improve, we are poised to take advantage of those opportunities. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Tim. Tim?"

As we have in prior quarters, first, I will walk through our pro forma income statement, then I will highlight the adjustments which reconcile our pro forma results to our GAAP results. After a brief discussio",3399,"Thank you, Sal, and good afternoon, everyone. As we have in prior quarters, first, I will walk through our pro forma income statement, then I will highlight the adjustments which reconcile our pro forma results to our GAAP results. After a brief discussion of our operating segments, I will comment on our cash and liquidity, then I will build on the comments we made in our Investor Day presentation in late October about 2010 and in particular, the first quarter. And finally, I will discuss the transaction we announced today with Yahoo!.Throughout our conversation, I will be distinguishing between sales, which represent contractual bookings received during the quarter and accounted for in deferred revenue and revenue for the amount of revenue recognized during the period consistent with our revenue recognition policies.Pro forma revenue during the quarter was $213 million, essentially flat with the third quarter and down 27% from last year's $293 million. Currency favorably impacted revenue during the quarter by $7.7 million on a year-over-year basis. This positive impact was largely offset by an unfavorable impact on operating expense as a result of currency adjustments of $5.9 million.Pro forma operating expenses at $213 million were essentially flat with the third quarter and lower than last year's fourth quarter by $38 million or 15%. Pro forma interest was a loss of $1 million during the quarter compared with a positive $1.6 million in the prior year quarter. Our pro forma consolidated tax rate was 33% versus 29% in the third quarter and 34% last year. Pro forma income from continuing operations was a loss of $1.5 million or $0.01 per share, compared with a $28.3 million profit in the prior year and $0.24 per share. I will now walk through this quarter's pro forma adjustments, which had a negative impact on GAAP net income of $600,000 or slightly over $0.01 per share. The pretax adjustments are: $2.9 million charge on the salary and related line, resulting from realignment of staff; a $6.3 million benefit on the office and general line, resulting from our settlement with a former officer of the company and a litigation matter, which was partially offset by real estate consolidation charges; a $6.1 million charge on the interest and other line, resulting from the settlement of our litigation with RBC related to our auction rate securities portfolio and additional charges to value the portfolio on a consistent basis. We will discuss that settlement when we discuss our liquidity position.Total pro forma operating expense during the quarter was $213 million, essentially even with the third quarter and a 15% improvement year-over-year. Within that, total salary and related expense was down 14% year-over-year, reflecting the net reduction of headcount of approximately 1,300 including China, as well as a lower level of incentive compensation and commissions in 2009. On a sequential basis, salary and related was up 5% as a result of one-time benefits in the third quarter and an increasing commissions, combined with negative currency impact in the fourth quarter. Total advertising and commercial expense at $45 million was down 14% versus the prior year, but was consistent with the level of spend in the prior quarter. Total office and general expense was $56 million in the quarter, 18% lower than last year and 5% lower sequentially. The North American operating segment had revenue of $91 million, a 33% year-over-year and a 4.5% sequential decrease. Despite this decline, segment generated $4.3 million of operating income. On a sequential revenue basis within the North American segment, our Canadian and government channels were slightly up, our enterprise channel was essentially flat and the SMB and staffing channels continue to lag again on a revenue basis.More importantly, on a sequential sales basis, during the quarter, our enterprise, staffing, healthcare and telesales or SMB channels were significantly up, our eComm channel declined slightly due to seasonality and our government channel was down on a sequential sales basis as a result of the significant number of larger sales closed during the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our government channel was our single-percentage strongest performer.Revenue for the International segment was $88 million, representing a 29% year-over-year decline but a 4% increase on a sequential basis. Operating income was $300,000, consistent with the prior quarter. On a sequential revenue basis, a number of our international markets were up, including China, Korea, France, Italy and Sweden. While the U.K., Germany and the Netherlands continue to show lower sequential revenue. However, the pace of the decline slowed dramatically. On a sequential sales basis, all countries showed an increase. Revenue from the IAS segment was $34 million in the quarter, a 3% increase year-over-year and a 2.5% sequential decrease. Operating income was $5 million. As you know, a portion of the revenue of the IAS segment is related to the creators and jobs market and thus, throughout the year, has been suffering from the same headwinds as our other Careers business. The weakness in the Careers business, however, during the year, has been substantially offset by strength in our other advertising platforms, in particular, in the lead generation area. On a sequential basis, third quarter is particularly strong in our Education and Military businesses as a result of the strong September back-to-school's selling season, which they both benefit from.Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. Throughout this difficult period, a tough priority has been to preserve cash. At year end, we had net cash and securities of $250 million versus $234 million at the end of the third quarter. Including our undrawn revolving credit, the company has total liquidity of $550 million.During the quarter, the company settled its litigation with RBC with regard to the auction rate securities. RBC agreed to and has immediately repurchase at a discount the securities we have bought through that. Under certain circumstances, Monster will receive additional proceeds if any of the securities repurchased by RBC are refinanced at a level higher than we received.In addition to the charge taken to reflect this settlement, the company decided to mark to market the remaining auction rates, which were not acquired through RBC to the price reflected in the settlement. With our settlements with RBC and UBS, we have substantially resolved the liquidity of our ARS portfolio.Pro forma EBITDA during the quarter was $27 million and capital expenditures were $10 million, a reflection of the maturing of our investment cycle. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $306 million, up 15% from last year's last quarter's level of $266 million. As Sal mentioned, this is the first time that deferred revenue, excluding the impact of the acquisition of ChinaHR, has increased on a sequential basis since December of 2007, and is concrete evidence that the business is improving.Summarizing the quarter, revenue and earnings per share loss were consistent with our expectations; several of our channels and key countries showed sequential revenue increases; and all of our countries and most of our channels showed solid increase in sequential sales.Our cost and headcount remain under tight control. This composition of our liquidity has been enhanced, as a result of our settlement with RBC. The increase in deferred revenue is somewhat greater than we anticipated going into the quarter. The continued firming in the economy, combined with strong competitive results, fueled by strong acceptance of our new products are resulting in gains in sales.As we move into 2010, there are many encouraging signs in our business. The economy has stabilized around the world and our clients' budgets and hiring plans are beginning to loosen up. The cumulative effect of the improvements we have made to our seeker experience and to our employer tools is resulting in increasingly improved results for our clients. And as a result, we are confident that we are gaining share.The fourth quarter is historically a strong renewal season. But certainly in 2008, as a result of the recession, the renewal season was not as robust as in prior years. This year, on the other hand, fourth quarter sales were at the higher end of our own expectations, leading to a greater increase in the deferred revenue balance than anticipated.We are confident that in the execution of our business plan and in the fact that the macro global economy is slowly improving. As the economy improves, as hiring picks up, as recruiting dollars continue to migrate from offline to online on a global basis and as our sales increase, there is a powerful upside to our revenue.Because much of our investment in product technology and infrastructure is in place, a substantial portion of that incremental revenue will drop to the bottom line. So despite continuing headwinds in the general economy, with global unemployment remaining at historically high levels, we approached 2010 with considerable optimism.But as we discussed at some length in our Investor Day meeting, recognized revenue will lag sales as a result of the depth of the recession in 2009. Our comments about the first quarter and more particularly about the full year are based on the environment as we see it today, which assumes a continuing slow improvement in the global economy. These comments do not reflect potential impact on our proposed acquisition of HotJobs, which I'll discuss separately. And please recall that they pertain to our pro forma results, consistent with prior practices and do not reflect any one-time charges, which may occur or other costs associated with continuing realignment of the business.As you know, our deferred revenue increased in the fourth quarter to $306 million. We started 2009 with a deferred revenue balance of $414 million, so we start the year with over $100 million less in deferred revenue. While we expect annual sales for 2010 to increase by 15% to 20%, the first $100 million of that increase goes to replace the reduction in deferred revenue.As a result, on an annual basis, we expect revenue will be flat on a year-over-year basis plus or minus a few percent. And because the first quarter is somewhat slower from a seasonal point of view, we expect revenue in Q1 to be flat to slightly down on a sequential basis. For comparison purposes, the first quarter of 2009 was down 13% sequentially and that, of course, included a higher level of deferred revenue runoff.Turning to operating expense. The first quarter has a higher level of salary expense primarily as a result of increased benefit expense in the U.S. In addition, marketing expense will run higher in the first quarter, as we rollout our 6Sense products and we execute our marketing campaign at the Super Bowl. Because of these two major factors, operating expense during Q1 will increase in the range of 10% to 15%, but both of these expenses will not reoccur in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect pro forma operating expense to be up 3% to 6% on a year-over-year basis. This annual increase of 3% to 6% reflects the effect of the increase in operating expense in Q1, which I have described, and the potential reintroduction of some incentive compensation later in the year, assuming the economies continue to improve as we forecast.We will, of course, continue to stringently control operating expense and we will continue to refine the mix of our spend with a greater percentage of 2010 spend going to sales and marketing than in recent years. As you know, over the past several years, we have spent significantly to improve our product, our infrastructure and our seeker experience. At this stage of our evolution, while we fully intend to continue to innovate our product, it is only natural that an increased percentage go towards getting our new product fully to the market. I want to reiterate here that the economies and the markets continue to have a higher degree of uncertainty than normal and we are mindful of that in providing this commentary. We are, of course, monitoring the situation on a real-time basis and we are not committing ourselves to measure new fixed cost spending.While we currently believe that the growing rebound in the business warrants relaxing the operating expense controls of recent years a bit, we are equally prepared to go the other way in the event that the business does not progress as we currently forecast. To summarize, and again, these comments are made before the impact of the proposed acquisition of HotJobs, we expect sales to be up in the 15% to 20% range for the year, with annual operating expenses up 3% to 6%. Both of these expectations are consistent with our longer-term belief that revenue can grow at 15% per annum and that a substantial portion of incremental revenue will drop to the bottom line.The lag between sales and recognized revenue reflects the lower level of deferred revenue coming into the year, thus, revenue for the full year will be flat plus or minus a few percent. For the first quarter, on a sequential basis, we expect revenue to be flat to slightly down and operating expenses to be up 10% to 15%, reflecting seasonal spending. Thereafter, operating expenses return to a more normal level. Our forecast do not imply any significant drawdown in cash with the exception of the proposed acquisition of HotJobs and as the business builds, our cash will begin to build.Turning now to our transactions with Yahoo! that were announced today. We are extremely pleased to announce that we signed a definitive agreements with Yahoo! to acquire HotJobs and at the same time, enter into a multi-year traffic deal to be the exclusive career site on Yahoo!'s U.S. and Canadian homepage. I'm going to outline the major terms of the transaction, the strategic rationale for it, discuss the timing and finally, review the financial attributes.Outline of the major terms, we are acquiring the HotJobs business for $225 million in cash. At the same time, we have entered into an exclusive three-year North American traffic deal, which will be effective upon the closing of the acquisition. Unless it will be the careers site in the personal assistant on Yahoo!'s homepage in the U.S. and Canada.In the United States, our payments for traffic are performance based and will be based on clicks and expressions of interest or EOIs with annual floors and ceilings. EOIs are defined as the start of the applying process. As you know over the past several years, we have been focusing on increasing our applies proposed and improving the quality and relevance of those applies, because that is what our clients value most. And this traffic deal was designed specifically to drive applies.In addition to the Canadian traffic deal, the agreement affords us the exclusive right to negotiate other international traffic deals. Yahoo! has important international properties in many of our key markets, such as U.K., India, France and Brazil among others. And we are very hopeful that we will be able to work with our new partners at Yahoo! to build what we have done together in North America into a truly mutually-beneficial global partnership.The transactions are extremely important for Monster. While there are a number of agreements, which all stand on their own, the two most important are the purchase of the HotJobs assets and the traffic deals. Both of those transactions are integral to our strategy.As you know, Monster's strategy is based on the combination of precision matching, 6Sense technology, global scale and breadth of product. As a result of this transaction, Monster's scale will substantially increase in a profitable manner, and Yahoo! and Monster's seekers and HotJobs and Monster's clients will gain access to more opportunities and more relevant opportunities, all accomplished in substantially less time. More employer and seeker matches will be made.Specifically for Monster's perspective, the traffic deal will clearly establish a number one traffic position for Monster in the U.S. and the purchase of HotJobs will substantially increase the number of clients we serve. And we believe in areas which are complementary and additive to Monster's historic strengths. With alliances with HotJobs newspaper partners will provide Monster with approximately 600 additional access point for millions of consumers to reach Monster's precision job search technology. The Canadian traffic deal is important in its own right to our Canadian business, but in addition, we trust that it provides us a template to broaden our relationship with Yahoo! on a global basis.As we have commented in our press release, the transaction is subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. While our both parties are eager to consummate the transaction as quickly as possible, our financial model is based on a closing some time during the third quarter. Thereafter, there will be a period of integration while we work together with Yahoo! to migrate the HotJobs business to the Monster platform.We'd now like to briefly discuss our financial modeling of the HotJobs business. I will discuss at a high level our revenue, non-traffic operating costs, traffic costs, transition costs and then conclude with the estimated impact on Monster's financial results in 2010 and 2011.On the revenue side, HotJobs revenue in 2009 was down in line with the industry. However, our model is based on the assumption that HotJobs revenue will flatten out during 2010 and grow in line with the industry in future years. We also believe that Monster can better serve HotJobs client base with our broader product line and new 6Sense premium product range. But while we believe there is real potential revenue upside for the client base we are acquiring, our financial model does not depend on any revenue synergies and in fact, contemplates some revenue dyssynergies as a result of potential client overlap.Based on our projections, the HotJobs business when integrated into Monster, will represent an increase in our North American segment of between 20% and 25% on a full year basis.Now on marketing operating expense. Since we're acquiring limited fixed assets, and we are assuming little costs other than direct personnel cost, mostly sales, and amortization of intangibles. We estimate that at close, approximately 275 HotJobs staff will become Monster's. Since HotJobs and Monster are in similar businesses, it is logical that there will be cross synergies to be realized, but in line with our own operating expense strategy, we will be maintaining much of the sales resource to service our expanded client base.Marketing spend resulting from the traffic deal. Our modeling assumes that the revenue stream resulting from the acquisition will fully cover the payments pursuant to the traffic deal. As mentioned, the traffic deal is based on clicks and EOIs, and is heavily weighted towards EOIs. The deal is subject to an annual cap and floor. We are confident that Yahoo! will deliver clicks and EOIs at a level which earn the full capped amount, and our model assumes full payment of the capped amount. And the amount that Yahoo! delivers traffic in excess of the capped amount, our employers and seekers will of course benefit.Transitional costs. There will be a number of truly one-time costs associated with the acquisition and integration of the asset. Among those are fees associated with the transaction, the company was represented by Stone Key and Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Allen and Company has provided a fairness opinion. In addition, there will be retention and severance costs as well as technology integration costs.Based on these assumptions and based on the economy as we see it today, we believe that in 2010, the transaction will be breakeven to pro forma earnings per share and will be cash flow neutral after absorbing the one-time costs associated with the transaction and the transition. In 2011 and beyond, the transaction will be meaningful, accretive to revenue, EBITDA and EPS. Considering the form of the currency of the acquisitions, which as you know is $225 million in cash, the company has been guided by the principle that Monster has substantial value, which is not fully reflected in our share price. And thus, we have jealously guarded our equity.Given the current liquidity position, the improvement in the composition of our liquidity as a result of our settlement with RBC, the improvement in the capital markets and most importantly, the outlook for our business and the acquisition, we believe we have comfortable liquidity to finance the transaction in cash and continue to invest in the franchise as appropriate. I will now turn the call back to Sal to wrap up."

Before taking questions, let me take a few minutes to summarize our key message points.In the past three years, we have made significant progress in rebuilding and repositioning Monster for the long term. Without question, the first quarter will be physical from a P&L perspective. However, we are convinced that it is the right thing to do, to build business for the longer term.We see our financial performance improving beyond the first quarter of 2010, after the non-recurring seasonal investments are made. We are seeing improved customer trends around the globe. This improvement, combined with trajectory of our business reinforces our commitment, to continue to invest in Monster, to increase sales and position us to benefit as the economy strengthens. We've never been more encouraged and more optimistic about Monster's future.In the event that the economy loses its momentum, I guarantee you, the company will not lose this momentum. But in case the economy does lose its momentum, we will act quickly and decisively to curtail certain investments during the short term. We've successfully done this in the past, and we're prepared to take this action again if it's warranted.The acquisition of HotJobs and the traffic agreement with Yahoo!, will provide even greater scale for our global platform, new customers and millions of engaged seekers. It leverages all we've done at a time when the economy is rebounding.Now anytime you do a transaction of this type particularly with the complexity of both an acquisition, as well as the traffic deal deliver dozens of employees, dozens of people here in Monster, they have been involved and spent countless hours to make this happen. That team was led by Tim Yates, Mike Miller and Mark Stoever, and I'd like to just thank them for their efforts. This was a long and interesting negotiation. I'm sure the people at Yahoo! would say in exactly the same thing at this point. And then there's plenty of work to be done between now and the close with the transaction. But I did want to take a minute to thank everyone on the team once again led by Tim, Mike and Mark for their efforts.I'd also like to thank all of our customers, our shareholders, our associates for their support and confidence. In particular, our global associates delivered an did an outstanding job in a really tough environment. They remain our greatest asset without question. With that, we'll open it up for questions."

First of all, what we've been doing is shifting resource. We started during the second half of last year and they're accelerating that. And as I mentioned in my comments, we put a senior member of our organization in charge of moving into markets particularly in Eastern Europe more aggressively than we have and certainly, in Latin America. Countries, for example, like Brazil, we think, present enormous opportunity and we need to capture some of that activity. In Asia, the story is the same. Obviously, we're well-anchored with our businesses in India, in China, with ChinaHR, and we're very proud of our team and our business in Korea. But there's still plenty of opportunities to further develop our footprint in countries where we are in existence.  For example, Singapore, Malaysia, et cetera, and it's a country where we do not have a presence and expand that presence. The Yahoo! transaction I think impacts in several ways. One is that first of all, we do have and given our position as unquestionably the number one global firm in our industry that this gives opportunity for us to better service our multinational customers, both outside and inside the United States, by being able to offer a broader array of seekers, of candidates for jobs and satisfy their needs even more abruptly than we've been able to in the past. In addition to that, as Tim mentioned in his comments and I think I mentioned in mine, the agreement also calls for us to be able to particularly where Yahoo! is strong, which is in many countries, is to set up traffic deals, traffic agreements if you will, perhaps similar to what we've done here in the United States in other countries, which will in turn improve the seeker inventory, the candidates if you will come into Monster and promote growth in those areas. So we're particularly interested in continuing the relationship with Yahoo!. Obviously, with regard to the traffic here in Canada and here in the United States. But we're anxious to proceed to see where other opportunities exist for us to be able to make the partnership even stronger and greater than it is today. I'm sorry I didn't capture the second part of the question."

Just for the job perspective of what the rollout if you will of the products looks like. So we already rolled out Power Resume Search in U.K. in beta in December. That's going well. We are planning to launch which are selling at full-blown in this coming quarter. Canada was launched just a couple of weeks ago. France is going live the end of Q1. We're also looking at a couple of additional markets overseas, going right after that. We're also going to launch it in Australia later in the year. So we have several more market we're getting ready to do. The important thing for us, we'll start launching it at four languages and changing that. So both Sal and Steve mentioned the product looks and feels great to the customers, and they're responding amazingly to both here and overseas in our markets. So we're planning to launch this product. On top of it, we have several other products that will use 6Sense technology to launch in a subsequent two or three quarters. And we think it's going to be as big or differentiated marketplace as the Power Resume Search is today. So when we originally made this acquisition, I think we thought and looked at it as a great benefit in terms of query improvement to search, but I think we'll discover their last view for quarters that it's such a powerful technology ingredient, that allow us to power multiple products and really differentiate us from our competitors."

On the other hand, on a year-over-year basis, the deferred revenue starting the year is quite a bit less. So as that rolls through the remainder of the year, that will have an impact, which is being made up by an increase in sales activity. So that's what leads to a saying that sales activity for the year, up 15% to 20%. But in Q1, because of the reduction in deferred revenue roll-off and Q1 not being a strong seasonal period to being flattish. So in second quarter, we gave you some thought about the full year.

We saw a significant increase in sales in virtually every country, virtually across every product, postings included. I do not believe that we saw anything that was pushed into Q4 from a usage basis that was pulled in, or do I see anything in January to indicate that the trend that we're describing is breaking. We've been very, very cautious over the past year, year plus, to indicate where the market is and where we see activity, levels of activity, et cetera. And we've been very cautious and not overstating what we see. I think that the Q4 surprised us to be quite honest in terms of the robustness of the buy that was out there. I think a good measure of it was greater confidence once again in the economy. I think a piece of it was due to the fact that the mix of product that we've delivered and the value proposition, most recently aided by 6Sense, I think is such that there is really growing evidence now. It's always hard to measure that we are taking market share from the competition, from what we can tell. No one else from the numbers that have been released and they are sketchy, this is an interesting industry. It's very hard to get any kind of metrics on what the competition is really doing. But based on everything we can see, we took market share and our growth in Q4, was greater than any of our significant competitors. And I think again that's largely due to a number of things. It's due to the enhanced sales force, we've been investing, we've been educating, we've been training, et cetera, it's obviously the mix of product and the work that we've been doing there and it's greater customer satisfaction across the board. It's from customer service to the way our people are transacting with customers. I think we've enhanced that methodology considerably. So I think there's a bunch of factors at play and I think they bleed into what we're seeing in January so far. And obviously, I don't think anyone would say the economy is robustly rebounding. But I think that as we've said for some time, I think we will really reap the benefits of what we've done when the economy truly rebounds totally on a robust level. And in the interim, we are working hard to take market share and grow the business organically. And right now, we're starting to get a push from both. I think we're getting it from the improvements we've made and we're getting it from the improvement in the employment scene here and internationally."

Again take that for what it's worth in the sense that although what we see is very encouraging, it is based on approximately six weeks or so of selling maybe a little bit longer and we've got a long way to go. But as of this point, the vast majority of what we're selling is 6Sense technology. And I think the momentum of that will build as more people expose to it, as they see what it can do, the efficiency that it brings, both with commercial the enterprise company, as well as with recruiters. We haven't talked about it this evening, but this presents a sea change to the world with recruiters. And because it can make them either more efficient or it could potentially be a real threat. The technology is so strong that I think the recruitment industry has to reconsider and I'm talking about recruitment firms, has to reconsider their business model in light of what we've developed. So it is going to be very interesting as time goes on and as we move forward. But I think the momentum on this is just building. You also have to remember that the number of customers here in the United States, we've introduced it in the United States but there was significant change in the technology that's used by different company. And we've migrated roughly about half at this point to the technology that would allow them to use Trovix. Over the next -- during this quarter, we will migrate the remainder. So the result we're talking about are only with less about half or so of the customers having availability to actually use the product. So I think there's much more to come. And we have beta tested it in Europe, for example, the U.K. and let's just say we're very anxious to introduce it, and to put it into play there and to be able to actually sell it, which will come in the near term, the next few months."

Good afternoon, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter and Year End 2009 Conference Call. I will cover the following topics in my remarks this afternoon: A quick review of Monster's growth strategy, our current business trends, a summary review of fourth quarter performance, today's announcement of our entry into a definitive agreement with Yahoo! to acquire HotJobs and the traffic agreement with Yahoo! and the areas of focus as we enter 2010. Tim will then provide financial details on the fourth quarter of 2009 and further perspective on the Yahoo! announcement, as well as context for the first quarter and full year 2010. I will then make brief summary remarks and then we'll take your questions.We were pleased to see many of you at our Investor Conference in New York City three months ago. At that time, we updated you on the progress we've made in transforming Monster and demonstrated our innovative precision search technology powered by Trovix, which we've now branded 6Sense.This new search engine powers the suite of products that delivers precise, relative results that match seekers with job opportunity faster and better than ever before. This revolutionary product exemplifies the innovative approach we've taken in reviewing every aspect of our business. It is a culmination of our initiative to position the company for long-term sustainable growth. Let me take a few minutes to quickly summarize these initiatives.We have largely rebuilt our infrastructure, creating a solid platform for future growth. We've overhauled the seeker experience and introduced new career management resources and tools for many of the job seekers who visit Monster around the globe. We've expanded the audience for our employers' job postings through our innovative media products, including Career Ad Network product. We significantly enhanced our networking capability through the integration of our Monster Affinity Communities. We've expanded our reach through key alliances and partnerships with offline and online media. We've established a wider geographic footprint in large geographic markets in Asia. And now with today's announcement regarding the proposed acquisition of HotJobs from Yahoo! and the traffic agreement with Yahoo!, we have substantially added quality traffic, while significantly increasing our customer base. The new tools and applications available to our customers, both employers and seekers, are unique to Monster and distinguish us from the competition. We have changed the industry by creating the best search technology in the Recruitment business.All of these positive initiatives have generated strong momentums as we enter a better environment in 2010. We are very proud of these accomplishments, particularly given that we achieved them during a deep global recession and are gratified by our customers' support.As the global economy appears to be recovering from recession, we have seen positive signs of continued stability and improvement. Several major economic indicators, including GDP, employment and online recruitment data, suggest that U.S. and Europe are in early stages of recovery. For example, the U.S. GDP increased on an annual rate of 5.7% in the fourth quarter of '09. Additionally, the Monster Employment Index for the U.S. and Europe consistently show more positive trends.As a result, companies are fighting their interest in acquiring talent and filling critical skilled positions. Conversations with our customers are becoming increasingly more positive, as they look to rehire and create jobs during this period of high-labor productivity.It's becoming evident that companies will need to expand their workforce to keep up with demand as the economy recovers. The combination of a strengthening economic environment with strategic initiatives we have implemented at Monster as a result of significant improvements in our operations and provide a superior value proposition to our customers.However, as you know, the unemployment rate remains historically high and demand is substantially down from normal level. But there is no question that we are in a far better place today than we were at this time last year. The psychology of the market has clearly improved, customers are showing more optimism and job creation is now the nation's top priority.On a personal note, I have been honored and privileged to have made several trips to the White House recently as part of the President's plans to create jobs in America. These meetings have provided valuable insight into the thinking of business leaders and their future needs to expand their workforce. While there was still many obstacles to overcome, the tone of these business leaders have become more positive and upbeat as the economy's been strengthening.In looking at the fourth quarter results, sales came in better than our forecast. The recruitment market is large and highly competitive and fragmented, and we are increasingly confident that we are gaining share from targeted competitors. While we expected a sequential seasonal lift in sales, the increase we experienced was a pleasant surprise. Our deferred revenue balance, excluding ChinaHR, increased sequentially for the first time in almost two years and as a precursor to higher revenue over time. Both revenue and the bottom line were in line with our expectations. Our international revenues showed a sequential increase in the fourth quarter, as certain larger European countries contributed to the momentum that we experienced in our Asia business beginning in the third quarter. In the U.S., key indicators have improved, and it is clear we are winning the competitive battle.There were number of strategic factors that came together to drive those performance. Monster have seen the benefits of the many changes made to improve and enhance our customer experience. Seekers have become more engaged on the site as a result of the new career management resource tools and the ability to view more relevant jobs quicker.Our ability to offer expanded portfolio of products, including media products through our Career Ad Network, provide more exposure and better results for our customers' postings. The results of our Power Resume Search product, which was introduced during the last week in October in the U.S., so far has been absolutely outstanding.Customers are finding that they are operating more efficiently by saving time and money, as we deliver more relevant and qualified candidates. This efficiency and improved results have allowed us to capture a premium price for the product. We are very excited about the potential for this product as it gains traction and as we rollout the product in certain markets in Europe, Asia and Australia this year. The bottom line is that we have seen improved results due to customers' acceptance of our new products and expanded portfolio, only by the improvement in employment as a result of a better economy. We're extremely pleased to also announce today a definitive agreement with Yahoo! to acquire HotJobs and at the same time enter into a multi-year traffic deal to be the exclusive career site on Yahoo!'s U.S. and Canadian homepage. The agreement also provides Monster with the exclusivity to negotiate similar traffic agreement with Yahoo! properties on a global basis.I'd like to provide a high-level overview of what this deal brings to Monster and Ted will provide additional details in our financial perspective. Essentially, the transaction positions Monster to add high-quality, relevant job seekers efficiently, while at the same time, significantly expanding our customer base. This transaction will bring Monster superior technology and expertise, including its recently introduced 6Sense search technology to a deeper combined pool of job seekers and employers.This combined offering will be made even more robust as future job seekers and employers are brought to the Monster's site to increase traffic from the vast Yahoo! network. The traffic deal will establish a number one traffic position for Monster in the U.S.The opportunity to work with an additional 600 billion weekly newspapers to both companies alliances, with newspaper publishers is exciting and presents an opportunity for significant growth going forward. These media partners represent approximately half of U.S. daily and weekly market newspaper circulation and our further access into local markets and job sectors.The transaction will be accretive to our earnings in 2011 and break even on a pro forma basis in 2010. Our liquid balance sheet provides a strong financial foundation to execute this transaction and allows us to continue to finance future investments without compromising our financial strength.A deeper pool of employers and job seekers ensures more and better quality matches, making the business more attractive and providing more value than with each company could achieve separately. With this added value and with the accretive aspects of the transactions, we believe that employers, job seekers, our newspaper partners and shareholders will realize substantial benefits from this new partnership once the deal closes and for the longer term. Finally, while this transaction directly strengthens our U.S. operations, Monster's customers will benefit as they recruit talent from a larger U.S. seeker base. We are entering the new year a much stronger company. We have innovative products, superior technology, improved customer service and vastly improved go-to market strategy. We're confident we will build on the strong foundation by continuing to invest in areas that will contribute to future growth and we certainly have many initiatives in place to build on our success.Let me just highlight a few. Innovation will continue to be the cornerstone of Monster's growth strategy. We believe there are many opportunities to broaden the application for our 6Sense technology and we are intrigued with the potential. On the marketing front, we'll continue to support and promote our brand creatively and efficiently. Our new marketing campaign, Get a Monster Advantage, is a three-tier platform aimed at giving both job seekers and employers a way to search better, plan better and connect better. The campaign highlights Monster's innovative resources designed to match people with the right job and employers with the right talent. You will see an important part of the campaign during Sunday's Super Bowl. I don't want to give away too much but watch for the beaver with the fiddle that migrates from pond to a hot tub. I think you'll find them entertaining.We have spent a considerable amount of time internally, crafting a multi-year geographic expansion that enable Monster to enter developing countries efficiently and effectively. The center is being led by Rob Brouwer, who was a key member of the team to establish Monster's current leadership position in Europe. The strength of our European management team allows Rob to assume responsibility for this important initiative. We believe there is huge opportunity to expand the Monster brand to countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia, which have large employee populations and growing economies. This planned expansion is underway and will accelerate throughout the year. We will continue to be disciplined and follow a strategic plan that allows us to build on the strong foundation we've created. Monster has tremendous opportunity to expand its products, its market and its geographic presence. As the economy continues to improve, we are poised to take advantage of those opportunities. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Tim. Tim?"
124878,84647480,55168,"Monster Worldwide, Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb-03-2010",2010-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Monster Worldwide, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Sal, and good afternoon, everyone. As we have in prior quarters, first, I will walk through our pro forma income statement, then I will highlight the adjustments which reconcile our pro forma results to our GAAP results. After a brief discussio",3400,"Thank you, Sal, and good afternoon, everyone. As we have in prior quarters, first, I will walk through our pro forma income statement, then I will highlight the adjustments which reconcile our pro forma results to our GAAP results. After a brief discussion of our operating segments, I will comment on our cash and liquidity, then I will build on the comments we made in our Investor Day presentation in late October about 2010 and in particular, the first quarter. And finally, I will discuss the transaction we announced today with Yahoo!.Throughout our conversation, I will be distinguishing between sales, which represent contractual bookings received during the quarter and accounted for in deferred revenue, and revenue, or the amount of revenue recognized during the period consistent with our revenue recognition policies.Pro forma revenue during the quarter was $213 million, essentially flat with the third quarter and down 27% from last year's $293 million. Currency favorably impacted revenue during the quarter by $7.7 million on a year-over-year basis. This positive impact was largely offset by an unfavorable impact on operating expense as a result of currency adjustments of $5.9 million.Pro forma operating expenses at $213 million were essentially flat with the third quarter and lower than last year's fourth quarter by $38 million or 15%. Pro forma interest was a loss of $1 million during the quarter compared with a positive $1.6 million in the prior year quarter. Our pro forma consolidated tax rate was 33% versus 29% in the third quarter and 34% last year. Pro forma income from continuing operations was a loss of $1.5 million or $0.01 per share, compared with a $28.3 million profit in the prior year and $0.24 per share. I will now walk through this quarter's pro forma adjustments, which had a negative impact on GAAP net income of $600,000 or slightly over $0.01 per share. The pretax adjustments are: $2.9 million charge on the salary and related line, resulting from realignment of staff; a $6.3 million benefit on the office and general line, resulting from our settlement with a former officer of the company in a litigation matter, which was partially offset by real estate consolidation charges; a $6.1 million charge on the interest and other line, resulting from the settlement of our litigation with RBC related to our auction rate securities portfolio and additional charges to value the portfolio on a consistent basis. We will discuss that settlement when we discuss our liquidity position.Total pro forma operating expense during the quarter was $213 million, essentially even with the third quarter and a 15% improvement year-over-year. Within that, total salary and related expense was down 14% year-over-year, reflecting the net reduction of headcount of approximately 1,300 including China, as well as a lower level of incentive compensation and commissions in 2009. On a sequential basis, salary and related was up 5% as a result of one-time benefits in the third quarter and an increase in commissions, combined with negative currency impact in the fourth quarter. Total advertising and commercial expense at $45 million was down 14% versus the prior year, but was consistent with the level of spend in the prior quarter. Total office and general expense was $56 million in the quarter, 18% lower than last year and 5% lower sequentially. The North American operating segment had revenue of $91 million, a 33% year-over-year and a 4.5% sequential decrease. Despite this decline, segment generated $4.3 million of operating income. On a sequential revenue basis within the North American segment, our Canadian and government channels were slightly up, our enterprise channel was essentially flat and the SMB and staffing channels continue to lag again on a revenue basis.More importantly, on a sequential sales basis, during the quarter, our enterprise, staffing, healthcare and telesales or SMB channels were significantly up, our eComm channel declined slightly due to seasonality and our government channel was down on a sequential sales basis as a result of the significant number of larger sales closed during the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our government channel was our single-percentage strongest performer.Revenue for the International segment was $88 million, representing a 29% year-over-year decline but a 4% increase on a sequential basis. Operating income was $300,000, consistent with the prior quarter. On a sequential revenue basis, a number of our international markets were up, including China, Korea, France, Italy and Sweden. While the U.K., Germany and the Netherlands continue to show lower sequential revenue. However, the pace of the decline slowed dramatically. On a sequential sales basis, all countries showed an increase. Revenue from the IAS segment was $34 million in the quarter, a 3% increase year-over-year and a 2.5% sequential decrease. Operating income was $5 million. As you know, a portion of the revenue of the IAS segment is related to the creators and jobs market and thus, throughout the year, has been suffering from the same headwinds as our other Careers business. The weakness in the Careers business, however, during the year, has been substantially offset by strength in our other advertising platforms, in particular, in the lead generation area. On a sequential basis, third quarter is particularly strong in our Education and Military businesses as a result of the strong September back-to-school's selling season, which they both benefit from.Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. Throughout this difficult period, a tough priority has been to preserve cash. At year end, we had net cash and securities of $250 million versus $234 million at the end of the third quarter. Including our undrawn revolving credit, the company has total liquidity of $550 million.During the quarter, the company settled its litigation with RBC with regard to the auction rate securities. RBC agreed to and has immediately repurchase at a discount the securities we have bought through that. Under certain circumstances, Monster will receive additional proceeds if any of the securities repurchased by RBC are refinanced at a level higher than we received.In addition to the charge taken to reflect this settlement, the company decided to mark to market the remaining auction rates, which were not acquired through RBC to the price reflected in the settlement. With our settlements with RBC and UBS, we have substantially resolved the liquidity of our ARS portfolio.Pro forma EBITDA during the quarter was $27 million and capital expenditures were $10 million, a reflection of the maturing of our investment cycle. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $306 million, up 15% from last year's last quarter's level of $266 million. As Sal mentioned, this is the first time that deferred revenue, excluding the impact of the acquisition of ChinaHR, has increased on a sequential basis since December of 2007, and is concrete evidence that the business is improving.Summarizing the quarter, revenue and earnings per share loss were consistent with our expectations; several of our channels and key countries showed sequential revenue increases; and all of our countries and most of our channels showed solid increase in sequential sales.Our cost and headcount remain under tight control. This composition of our liquidity has been enhanced, as a result of our settlement with RBC. The increase in deferred revenue is somewhat greater than we anticipated going into the quarter. The continued firming in the economy, combined with strong competitive results, fueled by strong acceptance of our new products are resulting in gains in sales.As we move into 2010, there are many encouraging signs in our business. The economy has stabilized around the world and our clients' budgets and hiring plans are beginning to loosen up. The cumulative effect of the improvements we have made to our seeker experience and to our employer tools is resulting in increasingly improved results for our clients. And as a result, we are confident that we are gaining share.The fourth quarter is historically a strong renewal season. But certainly in 2008, as a result of the recession, the renewal season was not as robust as in prior years. This year, on the other hand, fourth quarter sales were at the higher end of our own expectations, leading to a greater increase in the deferred revenue balance than anticipated.We are confident that in the execution of our business plan and in the fact that the macro global economy is slowly improving. As the economy improves, as hiring picks up, as recruiting dollars continue to migrate from offline to online on a global basis and as our sales increase, there is a powerful upside to our revenue.Because much of our investment in product technology and infrastructure is in place, a substantial portion of that incremental revenue will drop to the bottom line. So despite continuing headwinds in the general economy, with global unemployment remaining at historically high levels, we approached 2010 with considerable optimism.But as we discussed at some length in our Investor Day meeting, recognized revenue will lag sales as a result of the depth of the recession in 2009. Our comments about the first quarter and more particularly about the full year are based on the environment as we see it today, which assumes a continuing slow improvement in the global economy. These comments do not reflect potential impact on our proposed acquisition of HotJobs, which I'll discuss separately. And please recall that they pertain to our pro forma results, consistent with prior practices and do not reflect any one-time charges, which may occur or other costs associated with continuing realignment of the business.As you know, our deferred revenue increased in the fourth quarter to $306 million. We started 2009 with a deferred revenue balance of $414 million, so we start the year with over $100 million less in deferred revenue. While we expect annual sales for 2010 to increase by 15% to 20%, the first $100 million of that increase goes to replace the reduction in deferred revenue.As a result, on an annual basis, we expect revenue will be flat on a year-over-year basis plus or minus a few percent. And because the first quarter is somewhat slower from a seasonal point of view, we expect revenue in Q1 to be flat to slightly down on a sequential basis. For comparison purposes, the first quarter of 2009 was down 13% sequentially and that, of course, included a higher level of deferred revenue runoff.Turning to operating expense. The first quarter has a higher level of salary expense primarily as a result of increased benefit expense in the U.S. In addition, marketing expense will run higher in the first quarter, as we rollout our 6Sense products and we execute our marketing campaign at the Super Bowl. Because of these two major factors, operating expense during Q1 will increase in the range of 10% to 15%, but both of these expenses will not reoccur in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect pro forma operating expense to be up 3% to 6% on a year-over-year basis. This annual increase of 3% to 6% reflects the effect of the increase in operating expense in Q1, which I have described, and the potential reintroduction of some incentive compensation later in the year, assuming the economies continue to improve as we forecast.We will, of course, continue to stringently control operating expense and we will continue to refine the mix of our spend with a greater percentage of 2010 spend going to sales and marketing than in recent years. As you know, over the past several years, we have spent significantly to improve our product, our infrastructure and our seeker experience. At this stage of our evolution, while we fully intend to continue to innovate our product, it is only natural that an increased percentage go towards getting our new product fully to the market. I want to reiterate here that the economies and the markets continue to have a higher degree of uncertainty than normal and we are mindful of that in providing this commentary. We are, of course, monitoring the situation on a real-time basis and we are not committing ourselves to measure new fixed cost spending.While we currently believe that the growing rebound in the business warrants relaxing the operating expense controls of recent years a bit, we are equally prepared to go the other way in the event that the business does not progress as we currently forecast. To summarize, and again, these comments are made before the impact of the proposed acquisition of HotJobs, we expect sales to be up in the 15% to 20% range for the year, with annual operating expenses up 3% to 6%. Both of these expectations are consistent with our longer-term belief that revenue can grow at 15% per annum and that a substantial portion of incremental revenue will drop to the bottom line.The lag between sales and recognized revenue reflects the lower level of deferred revenue coming into the year, thus, revenue for the full year will be flat plus or minus a few percent. For the first quarter, on a sequential basis, we expect revenue to be flat to slightly down and operating expenses to be up 10% to 15%, reflecting seasonal spending. Thereafter, operating expenses return to a more normal level. Our forecast do not imply any significant drawdown in cash with the exception of the proposed acquisition of HotJobs and as the business builds, our cash will begin to build.Turning now to our transactions with Yahoo! that were announced today. We are extremely pleased to announce that we signed a definitive agreements with Yahoo! to acquire HotJobs and at the same time, enter into a multi-year traffic deal to be the exclusive career site on Yahoo!'s U.S. and Canadian homepage. I'm going to outline the major terms of the transaction, the strategic rationale for it, discuss the timing and finally, review the financial attributes.Outline of the major terms, we are acquiring the HotJobs business for $225 million in cash. At the same time, we have entered into an exclusive three-year North American traffic deal, which will be effective upon the closing of the acquisition. Unless it will be the careers site in the personal assistant on Yahoo!'s homepage in the U.S. and Canada.In the United States, our payments for traffic are performance based and will be based on clicks and expressions of interest or EOIs with annual floors and ceilings. EOIs are defined as the start of the applying process. As you know over the past several years, we have been focusing on increasing our applies proposed and improving the quality and relevance of those applies, because that is what our clients value most. And this traffic deal was designed specifically to drive applies.In addition to the Canadian traffic deal, the agreement affords us the exclusive right to negotiate other international traffic deals. Yahoo! has important international properties in many of our key markets, such as U.K., India, France and Brazil among others. And we are very hopeful that we will be able to work with our new partners at Yahoo! to build what we have done together in North America into a truly mutually-beneficial global partnership.The transactions are extremely important for Monster. While there are a number of agreements, which all stand on their own, the two most important are the purchase of the HotJobs assets and the traffic deals. Both of those transactions are integral to our strategy.As you know, Monster's strategy is based on the combination of precision matching, 6Sense technology, global scale and breadth of product. As a result of this transaction, Monster's scale will substantially increase in a profitable manner, and Yahoo! and Monster's seekers and HotJobs and Monster's clients will gain access to more opportunities and more relevant opportunities, all accomplished in substantially less time. More employer and seeker matches will be made.Specifically for Monster's perspective, the traffic deal will clearly establish a number one traffic position for Monster in the U.S. and the purchase of HotJobs will substantially increase the number of clients we serve. And we believe in areas which are complementary and additive to Monster's historic strengths. With alliances with HotJobs newspaper partners will provide Monster with approximately 600 additional access point for millions of consumers to reach Monster's precision job search technology. The Canadian traffic deal is important in its own right to our Canadian business, but in addition, we trust that it provides us a template to broaden our relationship with Yahoo! on a global basis.As we have commented in our press release, the transaction is subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. While our both parties are eager to consummate the transaction as quickly as possible, our financial model is based on a closing some time during the third quarter. Thereafter, there will be a period of integration while we work together with Yahoo! to migrate the HotJobs business to the Monster platform.We'd now like to briefly discuss our financial modeling of the HotJobs business. I will discuss at a high level our revenue, non-traffic operating costs, traffic costs, transition costs and then conclude with the estimated impact on Monster's financial results in 2010 and 2011.On the revenue side, HotJobs revenue in 2009 was down in line with the industry. However, our model is based on the assumption that HotJobs revenue will flatten out during 2010 and grow in line with the industry in future years. We also believe that Monster can better serve HotJobs client base with our broader product line and new 6Sense premium product range. But while we believe there is real potential revenue upside for the client base we are acquiring, our financial model does not depend on any revenue synergies and in fact, contemplates some revenue dyssynergies as a result of potential client overlap.Based on our projections, the HotJobs business when integrated into Monster, will represent an increase in our North American segment of between 20% and 25% on a full year basis.Now on marketing operating expense. Since we're acquiring limited fixed assets, and we are assuming little costs other than direct personnel cost, mostly sales, and amortization of intangibles. We estimate that at close, approximately 275 HotJobs staff will become Monster's. Since HotJobs and Monster are in similar businesses, it is logical that there will be cross synergies to be realized, but in line with our own operating expense strategy, we will be maintaining much of the sales resource to service our expanded client base.Marketing spend resulting from the traffic deal. Our modeling assumes that the revenue stream resulting from the acquisition will fully cover the payments pursuant to the traffic deal. As mentioned, the traffic deal is based on clicks and EOIs, and is heavily weighted towards EOIs. The deal is subject to an annual cap and floor. We are confident that Yahoo! will deliver clicks and EOIs at a level which earn the full capped amount, and our model assumes full payment of the capped amount. And the amount that Yahoo! delivers traffic in excess of the capped amount, our employers and seekers will of course benefit.Transitional costs. There will be a number of truly one-time costs associated with the acquisition and integration of the asset. Among those are fees associated with the transaction, the company was represented by Stone Key and Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Allen and Company has provided a fairness opinion. In addition, there will be retention and severance costs as well as technology integration costs.Based on these assumptions and based on the economy as we see it today, we believe that in 2010, the transaction will be breakeven to pro forma earnings per share and will be cash flow neutral after absorbing the one-time costs associated with the transaction and the transition. In 2011 and beyond, the transaction will be meaningful, accretive to revenue, EBITDA and EPS. Considering the form of the currency of the acquisitions, which as you know is $225 million in cash, the company has been guided by the principle that Monster has substantial value, which is not fully reflected in our share price. And thus, we have jealously guarded our equity.Given the current liquidity position, the improvement in the composition of our liquidity as a result of our settlement with RBC, the improvement in the capital markets and most importantly, the outlook for our business and the acquisition, we believe we have comfortable liquidity to finance the transaction in cash and continue to invest in the franchise as appropriate. I will now turn the call back to Sal to wrap up."

Before taking questions, let me take a few minutes to summarize our key message points.In the past three years, we have made significant progress in rebuilding and repositioning Monster for the long term. Without question, the first quarter will be difficult from a P&L perspective. However, we are convinced that it is the right thing to do to build the business for the longer term.We see our financial performance improving beyond the first quarter of 2010, after the non-recurring seasonal investments are made. We are seeing improved customer trends around the globe. This improvement, combined with trajectory of our business, reinforces our commitment to continue to invest in Monster, to increase sales and position us to benefit as the economy strengthens. We've never been more encouraged and more optimistic about Monster's future.In the event that the economy loses its momentum, I guarantee you the company will not lose this momentum. But in case the economy does lose its momentum, we will act quickly and decisively to curtail certain investments during the short term. We've successfully done this in the past, and we're prepared to take this action again, if it's warranted.The acquisition of HotJobs and the traffic agreement with Yahoo! will provide even greater scale for our global platform, new customers and millions of engaged seekers. It leverages all we've done at a time when the economy is rebounding.Now, anytime you do a transaction of this type, particularly with the complexity of both an acquisition, as well as the traffic deal, there are dozens of employees, dozens of people here at Monster that have been involved and spent countless hours to make this happen. That team was led by Tim Yates, Mike Miller and Mark Stoever, and I'd like to just thank them for their efforts. This was a long and interesting negotiation. I'm sure the people at Yahoo! would say exactly the same thing at this point. And then there's plenty of work to be done between now and the close with the transaction. But I did want to take a minute to thank everyone on the team, once again led by Tim, Mike and Mark, for their efforts.I'd also like to thank all of our customers, our shareholders, our associates for their support and confidence. In particular, our global associates delivered and did an outstanding job in a really tough environment. They remain our greatest asset without question. With that, we'll open it up for questions."

First of all, what we've been doing is shifting resource. We started during the second half of last year and they're accelerating that. And as I mentioned in my comments, we put a senior member of our organization in charge of moving into markets particularly in Eastern Europe more aggressively than we have and certainly, in Latin America. Countries, for example, like Brazil, we think, present enormous opportunity and we need to capture some of that activity. In Asia, the story is the same. Obviously, we're well-anchored with our businesses in India, in China, with ChinaHR, and we're very proud of our team and our business in Korea. But there's still plenty of opportunities to further develop our footprint in countries where we are in existence.  For example, Singapore, Malaysia, et cetera, and it's a country where we do not have a presence and expand that presence. The Yahoo! transaction I think impacts in several ways. One is that first of all, we do have and given our position as unquestionably the number one global firm in our industry that this gives opportunity for us to better service our multinational customers, both outside and inside the United States, by being able to offer a broader array of seekers, of candidates for jobs and satisfy their needs even more abruptly than we've been able to in the past. In addition to that, as Tim mentioned in his comments and I think I mentioned in mine, the agreement also calls for us to be able to particularly where Yahoo! is strong, which is in many countries, is to set up traffic deals, traffic agreements if you will, perhaps similar to what we've done here in the United States in other countries, which will in turn improve the seeker inventory, the candidates if you will come into Monster and promote growth in those areas. So we're particularly interested in continuing the relationship with Yahoo!. Obviously, with regard to the traffic here in Canada and here in the United States. But we're anxious to proceed to see where other opportunities exist for us to be able to make the partnership even stronger and greater than it is today. I'm sorry I didn't capture the second part of the question."

Just for the job perspective of what the rollout if you will of the products looks like. So we already rolled out Power Resume Search in U.K. in beta in December. That's going well. We are planning to launch which are selling at full-blown in this coming quarter. Canada was launched just a couple of weeks ago. France is going live the end of Q1. We're also looking at a couple of additional markets overseas, going right after that. We're also going to launch it in Australia later in the year. So we have several more market we're getting ready to do. The important thing for us, we'll start launching it at four languages and changing that. So both Sal and Steve mentioned the product looks and feels great to the customers, and they're responding amazingly to both here and overseas in our markets. So we're planning to launch this product. On top of it, we have several other products that will use 6Sense technology to launch in a subsequent two or three quarters. And we think it's going to be as big or differentiated marketplace as the Power Resume Search is today. So when we originally made this acquisition, I think we thought and looked at it as a great benefit in terms of query improvement to search, but I think we'll discover their last view for quarters that it's such a powerful technology ingredient, that allow us to power multiple products and really differentiate us from our competitors."

On the other hand, on a year-over-year basis, the deferred revenue starting the year is quite a bit less. So as that rolls through the remainder of the year, that will have an impact, which is being made up by an increase in sales activity. So that's what leads to a saying that sales activity for the year, up 15% to 20%. But in Q1, because of the reduction in deferred revenue roll-off and Q1 not being a strong seasonal period to being flattish. So in second quarter, we gave you some thought about the full year.

We saw a significant increase in sales in virtually every country, virtually across every product, postings included. I do not believe that we saw anything that was pushed into Q4 from a usage basis that was pulled in, or do I see anything in January to indicate that the trend that we're describing is breaking. We've been very, very cautious over the past year, year plus, to indicate where the market is and where we see activity, levels of activity, et cetera. And we've been very cautious and not overstating what we see. I think that the Q4 surprised us to be quite honest in terms of the robustness of the buy that was out there. I think a good measure of it was greater confidence once again in the economy. I think a piece of it was due to the fact that the mix of product that we've delivered and the value proposition, most recently aided by 6Sense, I think is such that there is really growing evidence now. It's always hard to measure that we are taking market share from the competition, from what we can tell. No one else from the numbers that have been released and they are sketchy, this is an interesting industry. It's very hard to get any kind of metrics on what the competition is really doing. But based on everything we can see, we took market share and our growth in Q4, was greater than any of our significant competitors. And I think again that's largely due to a number of things. It's due to the enhanced sales force, we've been investing, we've been educating, we've been training, et cetera, it's obviously the mix of product and the work that we've been doing there and it's greater customer satisfaction across the board. It's from customer service to the way our people are transacting with customers. I think we've enhanced that methodology considerably. So I think there's a bunch of factors at play and I think they bleed into what we're seeing in January so far. And obviously, I don't think anyone would say the economy is robustly rebounding. But I think that as we've said for some time, I think we will really reap the benefits of what we've done when the economy truly rebounds totally on a robust level. And in the interim, we are working hard to take market share and grow the business organically. And right now, we're starting to get a push from both.

Again take that for what it's worth in the sense that although what we see is very encouraging, it is based on approximately six weeks or so of selling maybe a little bit longer and we've got a long way to go. But as of this point, the vast majority of what we're selling is 6Sense technology. And I think the momentum of that will build as more people expose to it, as they see what it can do, the efficiency that it brings, both with commercial the enterprise company, as well as with recruiters. We haven't talked about it this evening, but this presents a sea change to the world with recruiters. And because it can make them either more efficient or it could potentially be a real threat. The technology is so strong that I think the recruitment industry has to reconsider and I'm talking about recruitment firms, has to reconsider their business model in light of what we've developed. So it is going to be very interesting as time goes on and as we move forward. But I think the momentum on this is just building. You also have to remember that the number of customers here in the United States, we've introduced it in the United States but there was significant change in the technology that's used by different company. And we've migrated roughly about half at this point to the technology that would allow them to use Trovix. Over the next -- during this quarter, we will migrate the remainder. So the result we're talking about are only with less about half or so of the customers having availability to actually use the product. So I think there's much more to come. And we have beta tested it in Europe, for example, the U.K. and let's just say we're very anxious to introduce it, and to put it into play there and to be able to actually sell it, which will come in the near term, the next few months."

Our first quarter operating results highlight a number of key points. Foremost, our strategy is working. We are differentiating Monster by using innovative technology and new products to create significant value for our customers and for job seekers. We are doing this globally which provides a powerful competitive advantage. 
Second, product innovation is driving growth. Around the world we are seeing significant increases in renewal rates, win back of old customers and new customers. In the U.S. our Power Resume Search product was a key contributor to these positive trends. Our global expansion strategy is also working. As economies around the world begin to recover we are seeing growth in portions of every sector. The investments we have made in our sales force and in customer service continue to show results, positioning us well as the economies rebound. 
In response to Monster’s strengthened value proposition, customers are increasing their purchases even before the economy goes into full recovery. We continue to gain global market share. In the U.S. we have successfully reversed the negative trends that existed in previous years. Outside of the U.S. we continue to build our strong leadership position.  
As a result, our underlying fundamentals are strong. As you can see from our first quarter results we continue to be on track or slightly ahead of our quarterly financial and operating metrics. Bookings increased 17% year-over-year which was better than our internal expectations. Quarterly revenues of $215 million were just above our expectations and marked the first sequential increase since first quarter of 2008. 
In this quarter in North America and Europe alone we added over 7,500 more customers than in the same period last year. Net cash increased to $262 million at the end of the first quarter. 
[Audio Interruption] 
To all those listening I apologize for the interruption. We are not exactly sure what happened but hopefully you can hear me now. 
As I was saying, bookings increased 17% year-over-year which was better than our internal expectations. Quarterly revenues of $215 million were just above our expectations and marked the first sequential increase since the first quarter of 2008. This quarter in North America and Europe alone we added over 7,500 more customers than in the same period last year. 
Net cash increased to $262 million at the end of the first quarter. Let me spend a few moments discussing the key drivers behind these results. I would like to start by highlighting the role of product innovation. Our strategy is based on the premise that clients will pay a premium price for a differentiated, high value product. While still early the ongoing rollout of Power Resume Search in the U.S. is the best demonstration that this strategy is working. 
Our Sixth Sense technology allows us to use great precision to solve the main problems of the recruitment process today. Companies see too many irrelevant resumes while seekers see too many irrelevant jobs. During this quarter bookings of Power Resume Search, our first Sixth Sense product already accounted for close to 40% of the resume database bookings even though it was only available for slightly more than half of our U.S. revenue base. 
Since product launch, close to 6,700 purchases of which over 1,400 are new have shown a willingness to pay a premium price. Power Job Search, the seeker product equivalent to Power Resume Search, is also helping both our job postings and Resume Search businesses gain market share by making the job seeker search faster and more productive. The continuing rollout of Power Resume Search will drive new customer bookings throughout the year. As of a few weeks ago we were live in the United Kingdom and are pleased with the early results and level of interest. In January we launched a beta product in Canada and as of March are in beta in France. By September we will launch a beta in Australia. 
No other existing product whether from traditional job boards or new competitors can deliver the reach, precision, speed or efficiency of Power Resume Search. None of our North American or global competitors have a comparable product. Ultimately we believe that continued product introductions based on Sixth Sense technology will lead to growth in new areas as well allowing the clients an end-to-end talent acquisition and internal management solution. We expect this to [offer] Monster another point of differentiation in the market. 
Before we made these technology investments our products were becoming stale. We were losing market share and we could only compete by cutting price. Now we can compete on quality and differentiation and not play the price cutting game. 
Let me take a few minutes now to talk about what we are seeing in the job market globally and how this is affecting our business. Country by country we are seeing different rates of recovery. Having a globally diverse business means we are able to benefit in regions where economies are recovering more quickly. In the U.S. the economic environment is pointing in the right direction. We have seen a dramatic take up in small business segments where the recession first showed itself with quarterly e-com bookings growth up 25% both sequentially and year-over-year. Traditionally small business growth is a precursor to recovery in medium and large businesses. Therefore we believe we will see more pickup in these areas as the year progresses. 
In Asia we are seeing a quicker, more robust improvement in the job market than other parts of the globe. Year-over-year bookings have more than doubled in Korea. They are up 67% in China and 36% in India. In each of these countries we are benefiting from a combination of improved operating performance, innovation and economic recovery in local markets. We believe that both the larger countries and developing countries in Asia represent a significant growth opportunity for us. 
Overall, the recession in Europe began later in the U.S. but in some countries we are seeing an earlier recovery. Based on year-over-year bookings we are seeing that the U.K. has stabilized. France, Belgium, Italy are all experiencing double digit growth. Scandinavia is up over 50% although operating from a small base. However, Germany, our largest European market along with the Netherlands, appears to be lagging the recovery. 
In developing markets we are making headway in organizing our approach and we will continue to invest selectively. We don’t anticipate a significant short-term return but believe these investments will be a meaningful contributor to growth in the coming years. Over the next few quarters we expect the global economy to improve and become stronger. This improvement combined with continuing new product introductions will benefit Monster. 
I would like to take a moment now to discuss market share growth and the current competitive environment. We are increasingly confident the company has reversed the long-term decline in market share. Based on internal estimates we believe we have increased global online recruitment share between 2-3 percentage points during 2009 and now have over 30% market share. 
Regionally we increased share in all markets in which Monster participates. We believe these market share gains have continued into 2010. Market share data is difficult to analyze conclusively on a quarterly basis. However, each quarter we carefully evaluate our competitive wins and losses as we consummate new bookings. We are confident we are winning as we compete for business. This will become increasingly clear in the quarters ahead as bookings turn into revenues. 
Our broad and differentiated product suite has been the key to these market share gains. For example, we have been able to offer combined packages of our new, Sixth Sense product with existing offerings like our Career Ad Network (CAN) which over the last 12 months averaged a monthly reach of over 75 million people. Moreover, to better demonstrate the value proposition of our combined product suite to customers we recently commissioned an independent third party study to validate the full impact of Career Ad Network. We long believe that our CAN product drives a high level of job seekers to our customer’s job postings and corporate career sites. 
Because job seekers don’t come to those jobs and career sites in a direct manner the full value of CAN was often underestimated by our customers. The independent study conclusively demonstrated the number of applicants influenced by CAN was substantially higher than customers perceived. We are rapidly making the tracking technology used in this study available to our customers to help reinforce how Monster adds value and positively impacts their ongoing talent search. 
Our IAF business is also starting to pick up momentum. During the quarter IAF had 4% revenue growth and more significantly 12% bookings growth. We are working on a number of innovations in this area that will drive this growth. 
I also want to provide a quick update on our proposed acquisition of Hot Jobs. Tim will also give some additional details in his remarks. We are progressing through the SEC review. We remain optimistic that the transaction will close in the third quarter. As we have become more involved with the planning for the closing we are firmly convinced about the positive impact this transaction will have. Monster will be able to apply its Sixth Sense technology to the Hot Jobs seeker and client base. The combination will increase the scale of the offering, both in terms of the number of job seekers coming to the site as well as the number of job postings offered. 
With the addition of the Hot Jobs network of more than 600 daily and weekly newspapers, Monster’s alliances with local papers will grow to approximately 1,000, giving Monster reach and putting Monster brands in front of readers in all 50 states. Also the additional newspaper alliances through their online and print classified ads will further Monster’s ability to connect job seekers with small, local businesses particularly in healthcare, education, skilled and hourly job categories. 
Our estimates are still preliminary but we expect the Hot Jobs acquisition will add as much as $0.06 to $0.12 per share in 2011 after having paid Yahoo! for their traffic. Although it has been difficult we have invested prudently and significantly in Monster. We consistently have invested for the long-term and we are beginning to see the positive results of our strategy. We will continue to invest where the opportunities present themselves while staying within the 3-6% expense growth projection. 
With that I would like to turn it over to Tim to provide a few more details on our financial results. Tim?

I would like to start with a couple of housekeeping points. First, starting this quarter we are providing numeric disclosure of bookings.

First, starting this quarter we are providing numeric disclosure of bookings. Bookings, which we have referred to as sales in the past and which we will henceforth refer to as bookings, represents the dollar volume of contractual orders received during the relevant period. Bookings are recognized to GAAP revenue consistent with our revenue recognition policies which have not changed. 
Second, we are providing a range of guidance for the second quarter and full-year on bookings, pro forma revenue and pro forma earnings per share. Finally, we are providing summary slides to guide the conversation. You can see these slides I hope on the webcast and they are available for download on our Investor Relations website. 
Turning now to slide 1, Q2 2010 Pro Forma Income Statement. Revenue was up 1% sequentially at $215 million and was somewhat higher than our expectation of flat to slightly down. The 15% year-over-year decrease is the lowest percentage decrease in five quarters. Operating expense during the quarter was $239 million, a 12% sequential increase and a 6% year-over-year decrease. 
On a year-over-year basis, revenue was favorably impacted by $7.2 million of foreign exchange rates while operating expenses were negatively impacted by $6.7 million of currency or a net currency benefit of $500,000. Interest expense was $900,000. Our equity loss primarily related to our investment in CareerOne Australia was $800,000. Net loss was $17.3 million or $0.14 per share and EBITDA during the quarter was $2.7 million. 
Slide 2 is our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. Reconciling items in the quarter were $6.4 million in salary and related line representing severance associated with targeted, global headcount reductions and $4.4 million on the office and general line representing transaction expenses associated with the proposed acquisition of Hot Jobs. 
Slide 3 is our Q1 2010 Expense Trends. The pro forma expense increase of $26 million or 12% on a sequential basis was consistent with the additional spending that we discussed last quarter. As we have commented, most of that increase is related to specific events which occur in the first quarter and will not be repeated for the remainder of the year. During the quarter marketing expenses increased by $14.3 million reflecting spending associated with the launch of our Sixth Sense product including Super Bowl advertising. 
Salary and related expense was $10 million higher reflecting the combination of greater seasonal benefit, U.S. FICA tax for example, and the recommencement of an accrual for incentive compensation both of which increases were partially offset by continued tight control of headcount. On a year-over-year basis total operating expenses was 6% lower and headcount was 12% lower than in previous years. 
Slide 4 is our bookings and revenue trends for the past 9 quarters. I want to use this slide to discuss the current trends in the business and so we will be focusing most of our comments on bookings. Briefly to walk through this slide, the green line represents the year-over-year percentage increase or decrease in bookings and the blue line represents the year-over-year percentage increase or decrease in pro forma revenue. The numbers at the top are the 9 quarters of bookings and pro forma revenues. 
You will note from this slide the lag phenomenon between bookings and revenue which we have been discussing extensively over the past year. Total bookings in the quarter were $219 million, 17% over last year’s first quarter. This was the first year-over-year increase since the first quarter of 2008. As Sal has noted, we believe this increasingly strong performance is the result of a number of factors. Certainly the improvement in the global economies are helping but equally the improvements we have made in our customer value proposition over the last several years which is now most easily seen in Power Resume Search are allowing us to win increased business against competitors. 
From a geographic point of view we had year-over-year growth in bookings in all of our major regions and in most of our major countries. The countries that lag are Germany and the Netherlands, reflecting a continued conservative posture being adopted by our clients in those countries. From a channel point of view in the United States we experienced strong growth in our government, field sales and e-com channels with more modest growth in our telesales and newspaper channels. 
Our government channel is experiencing very strong performance and we believe we have significant opportunities to expand that business both in the United States and globally. Growth in those channels more than offset decreased activity in our staffing and healthcare channels. In all channels and geographies we noted significant improvement in customer renewal rates as well as an increase in new and win back customers and a firming of pricing. 
Slide 4 is our Q1 2010 segment performance slide. I would briefly like to point out a few highlights. Total Career revenue was up 2% sequentially. Within that North America was up 7% while Career international was 3% lower on a sequential basis. Excluding currency impacts, the international segments revenue was essentially flat on a sequential basis and was negatively impacted by the slower recovery of Germany and the Netherlands. While we believe that over time the best measurement of market share is global revenue, and as Sal has commented, we believe we are gaining share on that basis. We will also note that our North American Careers segment was up 7% and that compares favorably on a sequential basis to those of our competitors who are primarily U.S. operations. 
The combined Careers business bears most of the expense of the increased marketing spend in Q1 and their operating margin was directly impacted by that spend. Revenue in IAF for the quarter was $1 million lower or 3% on a sequential basis, 4% higher on a year-over-year basis. Sequential increases in our [regen] business was more than offset by a decline in our display business particularly in recruitment advertising. Operating income in this segment was $3 million lower than the fourth quarter, $1 million of that decrease resulting from reduced revenue and $2 million came from increase in operating expense. We continue to invest in the people and content which drive our IAF segment; military, the affinity sites, our education site, advertising on the Monster site as well as the international expansion of those capabilities. We are confident that these assets represent a significant opportunity for revenue growth as the global economies improve. 
Slide 6 is key balance sheet and cash flow items. Net cash ended the quarter with $252 million and was up $12 million from year-end. Our strategy throughout this downturn has been to preserve our cash position while we continued to invest in our business in order to be well positioned as the economy and our clients recover. We believe we have achieved the first part of this objective and are in fact very well positioned as the economies recover. 
Specifically during the quarter while GAAP EBITDA was a loss of $8 million. Net cash provided by operations was $36 million. This relatively strong cash flow provided by operations largely reflects the seasonally high level of fourth quarter bookings and positive contribution from working capital. Deferred revenue was essentially flat at $305 million. This compares favorably to the first quarter of 2009 when deferred revenue was down 17% on a sequential basis. Given the strong $40 million in deferred in Q4 we are encouraged to have maintained substantially all of that increase in this year’s first quarter. Since many of our clients pay cash when they sign their contracts, as bookings increase cash and deferred revenue will increase but we caution this will not be linear and will dependent upon when during the year bookings are closed. 
In addition our cash provided by operations will also be impacted by the timing of certain other cash flow items. For example, in the second quarter we have some international tax payments which will have a modest, less than $10 million, negative impact on our net cash position. We do, however, believe that both net cash and deferred revenue will be substantially higher at year-end excluding the impact of the Hot Jobs acquisition. 
We define total liquidity as a combination of our gross cash and securities and the amount unused on our $250 million revolving credit. The availability under that credit agreement is based on a multiple of trailing 12 months EBITDA. It is because of this lagging phenomenon that we chose to amend our credit agreement in August of 2009 to provide additional financial flexibility. At the end of the first quarter our total liquidity was comprised of $312 million of gross cash and liquidities and $206 million of unused and available revolving credit. We anticipate total liquidity will bottom in the second or third quarter and provide ample liquidity to finance the acquisition of Hot Jobs and the ongoing operations of the company. 
To summarize the first quarter revenue was slightly better than our expectations and was our first sequential quarterly increase since the first quarter of 2008. Bookings during the quarter were up 17% year-over-year and at the higher end of our internal expectations and continuing to demonstrate the success in the market of our products as well as the improving economic environment. Operating expense increase of 12% on a sequential basis, was in the middle of the 10-15% range we provided last quarter and reflects a number of seasonal expenditures which are not anticipated to recur for the remainder of the year. Net cash increased to $262 million. 
I would now like to turn to our guidance for the second quarter and for the full-year. Please note the guidance covers our anticipated pro forma results and of course guidance is based on our current view of the global economy and job markets which forecasts progressive improvement throughout the year. Thereafter I will provide commentary on the economics if our proposed acquisition of Hot Jobs. These economics are not included in our guidance as the timing of the closure of the acquisition has some degree of uncertainty. 
Slide 7 is full-year pro forma guidance. We currently anticipate that bookings for the year will grow between 15-20% on a year-over-year basis with a dollar range of $930-970 million. As a result, we currently anticipate revenue will be flat plus or minus a few percent resulting in a dollar range of $890-925 million. Operating expense on a full-year basis are currently expected to increase between 3-6% on a year-over-year basis. As a result of these forecasts, loss per share is currently anticipated to be between $0.12 and $0.20. 
The results of the first quarter are consistent with these annual expectations. The current trends in our bookings lead us to believe we may come in at the higher end of our range on bookings but the flow through to revenue is heavily dependent on timing and product mix. As the year goes by we will be able to narrow the revenue and EPS ranges as appropriate. 
Slide 8 is second quarter 2010 pro forma guidance. Bookings are anticipated to be in a range of $202-210 million representing a year-over-year increase of 15-20% over last year’s level of $175 million. During normal years the second quarter from a bookings point of view has tended to be somewhat lower than the first quarter and somewhat lower than the fourth quarter. We currently anticipate revenue in a range of $210-220 million, a year-over-year decrease of 2-6%. Again, this is consistent with the run off of deferred and a normally somewhat slower second quarter. As we look forward we anticipate year-over-year revenue increases in Q3 and Q4. 
Based on these forecasts loss per share would be $0.02 to $0.06 as we do not anticipate material changes in interest income or expense lines and the equities lines during the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Based on our current visibility we anticipate being in the middle of these ranges. What I would also like to point out is $0.01 per share is equivalent to $1.8 million on a pre-tax basis. 
This completes the slides. I will now turn to Hot Jobs. As we have noted we have received a request for additional information from the SEC and we and Yahoo! are preparing our responses. We continue to anticipate a closing of the transaction in the third quarter of 2010. We would like to provide the following financial commentary on the Hot Jobs business. 
On a full-year basis in 2011 based on our modeling we currently anticipate between $20-40 million of EBITDA after, as Sal has noted, paying for the costs of the traffic we receive from Yahoo! under the traffic deal. This would result in between $0.06 to $0.12 in earnings per share including all amortization and estimated interest charges associated with the acquisition. We also believe there is potential upside to this forecast for two primary reasons. First, while the forecast bears the cost of the traffic pay to Yahoo! the substantial increase in traffic will be available to all of Monster’s clients, both the Hot Jobs clients and Monster’s existing clients, and will make us even more competitive as we compete in the market. 
Second, while we believe Monster can better serve the Hot Jobs client base with our global product line and Sixth Sense premium product range our revenue model does not build in those potential revenue synergies. The impact on a pro forma and GAAP earnings in 2010 is heavily dependent on when the transaction closes. In 2010 we anticipate pro forma EBITDA in a range of $5 million on a quarterly basis and around $0.01 per share per quarter. Again that is dependent upon when the transaction actually closes. This estimate accommodates a certain amount of additional operating expenses in the first couple of quarters as we integrate the business. 
We anticipate a total of $25 million of deal related and one-time costs associated with the closing and integration of the business. This includes the $4 million incurred in the first quarter and the remainder of this amount will be incurred between now and up to six months after the transaction closes. We are encouraged by the strong results that the Hot Jobs team is producing on an interim basis as we work together on the integration planning. 
Now I would like to turn the call back to Sal for his wrap up.

Most economies around the world are in some stage of improvement and we are seeing the benefits of our investment efforts in the acceptance of new products, gains in global market share and the positive impact of improved service. Monster’s investment in innovation has been made to address our customer’s needs and differentiate us from the competitors. 
No competitor in the market has a product suite that can compare with ours. As a result, we see our products taking hold. Bookings are picking up momentum and we continue to be able to command premium pricing in a price competitive market. While we are not completely out of the woods yet. I am increasingly confident of our future and very comfortable with the guidance we have provided. 
We are committed to achieving bookings growth of 15-20% for the quarter. We are currently comfortable at the middle of that range. Hopefully we will be at the high end of the range for all of 2010. We believe we can achieve this growth while holding operating expense to between 3-6% for the year. 
Finally, I want to thank our shareholders for their ongoing support and interest in Monster, our numerous customers both new and existing for their embrace of our products. I would also like to thank all of our associates for their ongoing dedication and hard work.

So I think that customers do not seem to be having much difficulty. We are not seeing a significant increase in customer service calls or to our technology folks in terms of requests for assistance in learning to use it which is further evidenced by the fact we have over 1,500 new customers that have not bought search from us before which have now bought Power Resume Search and as I said both paid the price as well as are finding it fairly straightforward to use.

I think the bookings we are seeing today, the increase in the bookings, is partially as I indicated in my comments, due to the improvement in a number of economies around the world. But it is also being pushed here in the U.S. because of Sixth Sense. So I think it is benefiting bookings. I think we are seeing new customers come to Monster because of the power of Sixth Sense and realizing the power the product has. 
I think over time you will see some more of that come in the U.K. where we have just introduced it. I think if we step out of beta in Canada and go into beta in France we will see some benefits start to accrue there. That could push the momentum of the bookings. Again, as both Tim and James have indicated it really depends on when those bookings occur and how it builds up into deferred that will give more punch into revenue. Definitely as we build up the bookings and which then goes up to deferred this is all going to be beneficial as we go into 2011 and create the momentum that we need there. 
What has really happened here and Sixth Sense is going to help this but the economy and a lot of other products are also going to help. As we went through the heart of the recession, I almost said depression and believe me at points in time it did feel like a depression, we depleted our deferred revenue. We depleted our backlog if you will that converts to revenue. What you are seeing overall now and we are very happy to see happening is with the 17% growth in bookings is we are beginning to replenish, adjusting for seasonality because Q4 is always a very big quarter for us. Q1 is lighter. Q2 is probably the lightest quarter of the year and then it begins to build up into Q3 and going into Q4. 
What we are hoping and what we are seeing with the kinds of increases, the 15-20% increase we are forecasting right now on bookings will be the replenishment of hat deferred which will put us in a much better position going into 2011. If we are surprised and the economies pick up even more strongly than what we are seeing right now obviously these numbers could be pushed up. I think we would be pushing it at this point. We just don’t have enough clarity to forecast that at this point. I think we are comfortable where we are.

Our first quarter operating results highlights a number of key points. Foremost, our strategy is working. We are differentiating Monster by using innovative technology and new product to create significant value for our customers and for job seekers. We are doing this globally, which provide a powerful competitive advantage. Second, product innovation is driving growth. Around the world, we have seen significant increases in renewal rates, win backs of old customers and new customers. In the U.S., our Power Resume Search product was a key contributor to these positive trend.
Our global expansion strategy is also working. As economies around the world begin to recover, we are seeing growth in portions of every sector. The investments we've made in our sales force and in customer service continue to show results, positioning us well as economies rebound. In response to Monster's strengthened value proposition, customers are increasing their purchases even before the economy goes into full recovery. We continue to gain global market share. In the U.S., we have successfully reversed the negative trend that existed in previous years. Outside the U.S., we continue to build our strong leadership position.
As a result, our underlying fundamentals are strong. As you can see, our first-quarter results, we continue to be on track or slightly ahead of our quarterly financial and operating metric. Bookings increased 17% year-over-year, which was better than our internal expectations. Quarterly revenues of $215 million were just above our expectation and marked the first sequential increase since first quarter of 2008.
In this quarter, in North America and Europe alone, we added over 7,500 more customers than in the same period last year. Net cash increased to $262 million at the end of the first quarter.
[Audio Gap]
To all those listening I apologize for the interruption. We're not exactly sure what happened but hopefully you can hear me now. 
As I was saying, bookings increased 17% year-over-year, which was better than our internal expectations. Quarterly revenues of $215 million were just above our expectation and marked the first sequential increase since the first quarter of 2008. In this quarter in North America and Europe alone, we added over 7,500 more customers than in the same period last year. Net cash increased to $262 million at the end of the first quarter.
Let me spend a few moments discussing the key drivers behind these results. I'd like to start by highlighting the role of product innovation. Our strategy is based on the premise that clients will pay a premium price for a differentiated, high-value product. While still early, the ongoing roll out of Power Resume Search in the U.S. is the best demonstration that this strategy is working.
Our 6Sense technology allows us to use great position to solve the main problem in the recruitment process today. Companies see too many irrelevant resumes, while seekers see too many irrelevant jobs. During this quarter, bookings of Power Resume Search, our first 6Sense product, already accounted for close to 40% of the resume database bookings, even though it was only available to slightly more than half of our U.S. revenue base.
Since product launch, close to 6,700 purchases, of which over 1,400 are new, have shown a willingness to pay a premium price. Power Job Search, the seeker product equivalent to Power Resume Search, is also helping both our job posting and resume search businesses gain market share by making the job seeker search faster and more productive. 
The continuing roll out of Power Resume Search will drive new customer bookings throughout the year. As of a few weeks ago, we were live in the United Kingdom and are pleased with the early results and level of interest. In January, we launched a beta product in Canada and as of March, are in beta with France. By September, we will launch a beta in Australia. No other existing products, whether from traditional job boards or new competitor can deliver the reach, precision, speed or efficiency of Power Resume Search. None of our North American or global competitor have a comparable product. Ultimately, we believe that continued product introductions, based on 6Sense technology will lead to growth in new areas as well, allowing the clients an end-to-end talent acquisition and internal management solution. We expect this offer Monster another point of differentiation in the market.
Before we made this technology investment, our products were becoming stale. We were losing market share, and we could only compete by cutting price. Now we can compete on quality and differentiation and not play the price-cutting game.
Let me take a few minutes now to talk about what we're seeing in the job market globally and how this is affecting our business. Country-by-country, we're seeing different rates of recovery. Having a globally diverse business means we're able to benefit in regions where economies are recovering more quickly. 
In the U.S., the economic environment is pointing in the right direction. We are seeing a dramatic pickup in small business segments where the recession first showed itself, with quarterly eComm [eCommerce] bookings growth of 25%, both sequentially and year-over-year. Traditionally, small business growth is a precursor to recovery in medium and large businesses. Therefore, we believe we will see more pick-up in these areas as the year progresses.
In Asia, we're seeing a quicker, more robust improvement in job markets than other parts of the globe. Year-over-year bookings have more than doubled in Korea. They are up 67% in China and 36% in India. In each of these countries, we're benefiting from a combination of improved operating performance, innovation and economic recovery in local markets. We believe that both the larger countries and developing countries in Asia represent a significant growth opportunity for us.
Overall, the recession in Europe began later than in the U.S. But in some countries, we're seeing an earlier recovery. Based on year-over-year bookings, we're seeing that the UK has stabilized. France, Belgium, Italy, are all experiencing double-digit growth. Scandinavia is up over 50%, although operating from a small base. However, Germany, our largest European market, along with the Netherlands, appears to be lagging the recovery.
In developing markets, we're making headway in organizing our approach, and we will continue to invest selectively. We don't anticipate a significant short-term return but believe these investments will be a meaningful contributor to growth in the coming year. Over the next few quarters, we expect the global economy to improve and become stronger. This improvement, combined with continuing new product introductions will benefit Monster. 
I'd like to take a moment now to discuss market share growth and the current competitive environment. We are increasingly confident that the company has reversed the long-term decline in market share. Based on our internal estimates, we believe we have increased global online recruitment share between two and three percentage points during 2009, and now have over 30% market share. Regionally, we increased share in all markets in which 
Monster participates. We believe these market share gains have continued into 2010.
Market share data is difficult to analyze conclusively on a quarterly basis. However, each quarter, we carefully evaluate our competitive wins and losses as we consummate new bookings. We are confident that we are winning as we compete for business. This will become increasingly clear in the quarters ahead as bookings turn into revenue. Our broad and differentiated product suite has been the key to this market share gain. For example, we've been able to offer combined packages of our new 6Sense product with existing offerings like our Career Ad Network or CAN, which over the last 12 months averaged a monthly reach of over 75 million people.
Moreover, to better demonstrate the value proposition of our combined product suite to customers, we recently commissioned an independent third-party study to validate the full impact of Career Ad Network. We long believe that our CAN product drives a high level of job seekers to our customers job postings and corporate career sites. Because job seekers don't come to those jobs and careers site in a direct manner, the full value of CAN was often underestimated by our customers. The independent study conclusively demonstrated the number of applicants influenced by CAN was substantially higher than customers perceived. We are rapidly making the tracking technology used in this study available to our customers to help reinforce how Monster adds value and positively impact their ongoing talent search.
Our IAF [Internet Advertising & Fees] business is also starting to pick up momentum. During the quarter, IAF had 4% revenue growth and more significantly, 12% booking growth. We're working on a number of innovations in this area that will drive future growth. 
I also want to provide a quick update on our proposed acquisition of HotJobs. Tim will also give some additional details in his remarks.
We are progressing through the SEC review. We remain optimistic that the transaction will close in the third quarter. As we've become more involved with the planning for the closing, we're firmly convinced about the positive impact this transaction will have. Monster will be able to apply its 6Sense technology to the HotJobs seeker and client base. The combination will increase the scale of the offering, both in terms of the number of job seekers coming to the site, as well as the number of job postings offered. 
With the addition of the HotJobs network of more than 600 daily and weekly newspapers, Monster's alliances with local papers will grow to approximately 1,000, giving Monster reach and putting Monster brand in front of readers in all 50 states. Also, the additional newspaper alliances, through their own line of print classified ads, will further Monster's ability to connect job seekers with small and local businesses, particularly in healthcare, education, skilled and hourly job categories. Our estimates are still preliminary. But we expect that HotJobs acquisition will add as much as $0.06 to $0.12 per share in 2011 after having paid Yahoo! for their traffic.
Although it's been difficult, we've invested prudently and significantly in Monster. We consistently have invested for the long term, and we are beginning to see the positive results of our strategy. We will continue to invest when the opportunity presents itself while staying within the 3% to 6% expense growth projection. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Tim to provide a few more details on our financial results. Tim?"

First, starting this quarter, we are providing numeric disclosure of bookings. Bookings, which we have referred to as sales in the past, of which we will henceforth refer to as bookings, represent the dollar volume of contractual orders received during the relevant period. Bookings are recognized to GAAP revenue consistent with our revenue recognition policies, which have not changed. Second, we are providing a range of guidance in the second quarter and full year on bookings, pro forma revenue and pro forma earnings per share. And finally, we're providing summary slides to guide the conversation. You can see these slides, I hope, on the webcast. And they are available for download on our Investor Relations website.
Turning now to Slide 1 or Q1 2010 pro forma income statement. Revenue was up 1% sequentially at $215 million and was somewhat higher than our expectation of flat to slightly down. The 16% year-over-year decrease is the lowest percentage decrease in five quarters. Operating expense during the quarter was $239 million, a 12% sequential increase and a 6% year-over-year decrease. On a year-over-year basis, revenue was favorably impacted by $7.2 million of foreign exchange rates, while operating expenses were negatively impacted by $6.7 million of currency or net currency benefit of $500,000.
Interest expense was $900,000. Our equity loss, primarily related to our investment in CareerOne Australia was $800,000. Net loss was $17.3 million or $0.14 per share, and EBITDA during the quarter was $2.7 million.
Slide 2 is our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. The reconciling items in the quarter were: $6.4 million on the salary and related line, representing severance associated with targeted, global headcount reductions; $4.4 million on the office and general line, representing transaction expenses associated with the proposed acquisition of HotJobs.
Slide 3 is our Q1 2010 expense trend. The pro forma expense increase of $26 million or 12% on a sequential basis was consistent with the additional spending that we discussed last quarter. As we have commented, most of that increase is related to specific events, which occurred in the first quarter and will not be repeated for the remainder of the year. During the quarter, marketing expenses increased by $14.3 million, reflecting spending associated with the launch of our 6Sense product, including Super Bowl advertising.
Salary and related expense was $10 million higher, reflecting the combination of greater seasonal benefits, U.S. FICA tax, for example, and the recommencement of an accrual for incentive compensation, both of which increases were partially offset by continued tight control of headcount. On a year-over-year basis, total operating expense was 6% lower, and headcount was 12% lower than in the previous year.
Slide 4 is our bookings and revenue trend for the past nine quarters. I want to use this slide to discuss the current trends in the business. And so, we'll be focusing most of our comments on bookings. Briefly, to walk through this slide, the green line represents the year-over-year percentage increase or decrease in bookings. And the blue line represents the year-over-year percentage increase or decrease in pro forma revenue. The numbers at the top are the nine quarters of bookings and pro forma revenue. You will note on this slide, the lag phenomenon between bookings and revenue, which we have been discussing extensively over the past year. 
Total bookings in the quarter were $219 million, 17% over last year's first quarter. This was the first year-over-year increase since the first quarter of 2008. As Sal has noted, we believe this increasingly strong performance is a result of a number of factors. Certainly, the improvement in the global economies are helping. But equally, the improvements we have made in our customer value proposition over the last several years, which is now most easily seen in Power Resume Search, are allowing us to win increased business against competitors.
From a geographic point of view, we had year-over-year growth in bookings in all of our major regions and in most of our major countries. The countries that lag are Germany and the Netherlands, reflecting a continued conservative posture being adopted by our clients in those countries. From a channel point of view in the United States, we experienced strong growth in our government, field sales and eComm channels with more modest growth in our telesales and newspaper channels. 
Our government channel is experiencing very strong performance, and we believe that we have significant opportunity to expand that business, both in the United States and globally. Growth in those channels more than offset decreased activity in our staffing and healthcare channels. In all channels and geographies, we noted significant improvement in customer renewal rates, as well as an increase in new and win-back customers and a firming in pricing.
Slide 4 (sic) [Slide 5] is our Q1 2010 segment performance slide. I'd briefly like to point out a few highlights. Total Career revenue was up 2% sequentially. Within that, North America was up 7%, while Career International was up 3% lower on a sequential basis. Excluding currency impact, the International segment's revenue was essentially flat on a sequential basis and was negatively impacted by the slower recovery from Germany and the Netherlands. While we believe that over time, the best measurement of market share is global revenue, and as Sal has commented, we believe we are gaining share on that basis. You will also note that our North American Career's segment was up 7%. And that compares favorably on a sequential basis to those of our competitors who are primarily U.S. operations.
The combined Careers business bears most of the expense of the increased marketing spend in Q1, and their operating margin was directly impacted by that spend. Revenue in IAF for the quarter was $1 million lower or 3% on a sequential basis and 4% higher on a year-over-year basis. Sequential increases in our Legend [ph] business were more than offset by a decline in our Display business, particularly in recruitment advertising. 
Operating income in the segment is $3 million lower in the fourth quarter. $1 million of that decrease resulted from reduced revenue, and $2 million came from an increase in operating expense. We continue to invest in the people and content, which drive our IAF segment, military, the Affinity sites, our education sites, advertising on the Monster site, as well as an international expansion of those capabilities. We are confident that these assets represent a significant opportunity for revenue growth as the global economies improve
Slide 6 is key balance sheet and cash flow items. Net cash ended the quarter at $262 million and was up $12 million from year end. Our strategy throughout this downturn has been to preserve our cash position, while we continue to invest in our business in order to be well-positioned as the economy and our clients recover. We believe we achieved the first part of this objective and are in fact very well-positioned as the economies recover. 
Specifically during the quarter, while GAAP EBITDA was a loss of $8 million, net cash provided by operations was $36 million. This relatively strong cash flow provided by operations largely reflects the seasonally high level of fourth quarter bookings and a positive contribution from working capital. Deferred revenue was essentially flat at $305 million. This compares favorably to the first quarter of 2009 when deferred revenue was down 17% on a sequential basis. Given the strong $40 million increase in deferred in Q4, we are encouraged to maintain substantially all of that increase in this year's first quarter. 
Since many of our clients pay cash when they sign their contract, as bookings increase, cash and deferred revenue will increase. But we caution that this will not be linear and will be dependent on when during the year bookings are closed. In addition, our cash, provided by operation will also be impacted by the timing of certain other cash flow item. For example in the second quarter, we have some international tax payment, which will have a modest, less than $10 million negative impact on our net cash position. We do, however, believe that both net cash and deferred revenue will be substantially higher at year end, excluding the impact of the HotJobs acquisition.
We define total liquidity as the combination of our gross cash and securities and the amount unused on our $250 million revolving credit. The availability under that credit agreement is based on a multiple of trailing-12-month EBITDA. It was because of this lagging phenomenon that we chose to amend our credit agreement in August of 2009 to provide additional financial flexibility. 
At the end of the first quarter, our total liquidity was comprised of $312 million of gross cash and securities and $206 million of unused and available revolving credit. We anticipate the total liquidity will bottom in the second or third quarter and provide ample liquidity to finance the acquisition of HotJobs and the ongoing operations of the company. 
So to summarize the first quarter, revenue was slightly better than our expectations and was our first sequential quarterly increase since the first quarter of 2008. Bookings during the quarter were up 17% year-over-year and were at the higher end of our internal expectations and continued to demonstrate the success in the market of our products, as well as the improving economic environment. Operating expense increased to 12% on a sequential basis, was in the middle of the 10% to 15% range we provided last quarter and reflects a number of seasonal expenditures, which are not anticipated to reoccur for the remainder of the year. Net cash increased to $262 million.
I would now like to turn to our guidance for the second quarter and for the full year. Please note that guidance covers our anticipated pro forma results. And of course, guidance is based on our current view of the global economies and job markets, which forecast the progressive improvement throughout the year. Thereafter, I will provide commentary on the economics of our proposed acquisition of HotJobs. These economics are not included in our guidance, as the timing of the closing of the acquisition has some degree of uncertainty.
Slide 7 is full year pro forma guidance. We currently anticipate that bookings for the year will grow between 15% and 20% on a year-over-year basis or a dollar range of $930 million to $970 million. As a result, we currently anticipate that revenue will be flat, plus or minus a few percent, resulting in a dollar range of $890 million to $925 million. 
Operating expense on a full year basis are currently expected to increase between 3% and 6% on a year-over-year basis. As a result of these forecasts, loss per share is currently anticipated to be between $0.12 and $0.20. The results of the first quarter are consistent with these annual expectation. Current trends in our bookings lead us to believe that we may come in at the higher end of our range on bookings. But the flow-through to revenue is heavily dependent on timing and product mix. As the year goes by, we will be able to narrow the revenue and EPS ranges as appropriate.
Slide 8 is second quarter 2010 pro forma guidance. Bookings are anticipated to be in the range of $202 million to $210 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 15% to 20% over last year's level of $175 million. During normal years, the second quarter, from a bookings point of view, has tended to be somewhat lower than the first quarter and certainly lower than the fourth quarter. 
We currently anticipate revenue in the range of $210 million to $220 million, a year-over-year decrease of 2% to 6%. Again, this is consistent with the run-off of deferred and a normally somewhat slower second quarter. As we look forward, we anticipate year-over-year revenue increases in Q3 and Q4. Based on these forecasts, loss per share would be $0.02 to $0.06, as we do not anticipate material changes in the interest income or expense line and the equity lines during the second quarter compared to the first quarter. 
Based on our current visibility, we anticipate being in the middle of these ranges. But I would also like to point out that $0.01 per share is equivalent to $1.8 million on a pretax basis. 
This completes the slides, and I will now turn to HotJobs. As we have noted, we have received a request for additional information from the SEC and we and Yahoo! are preparing our responses. We continue to anticipate a closing of the transaction in the third quarter of 2010. We'd like to provide the following financial commentary on the HotJobs business.
On a full year basis in 2011, based on our modeling, we currently anticipate between $20 million and $40 million of EBITDA after, as Sal has noted, paying for the cost of the traffic we have received from Yahoo! under the traffic deal. This would result in between $0.06 to $0.12 in earnings per share, including all amortization and estimated interest charges associated with the acquisition. 
We also believe that there is potential upside to this forecast for two primary reasons. First, while the forecast bears the cost of the traffic paid to Yahoo!, the substantial increase in traffic will be available to all of Monster's clients, both the HotJobs clients and Monster's existing clients, and will make us even more competitive as we compete in the market. Second, while we believe that Monster can better serve the HotJobs client base with our broader global product line and 6Sense premium product range, our revenue model does not build in those potential revenue synergies. 
The impact on a pro forma and GAAP earnings in 2010 is heavily dependent on when the transaction closes. In 2010, we anticipate pro forma EBITDA in the range of $5 million on a quarterly basis and around $0.01 per share for the quarter. But again, that is dependent on when the transaction actually closes. This estimate accommodates a certain amount of additional operating expenses in the first couple of quarters as we integrate the business.
We anticipate a total of $25 million of deal-related and one-time costs associated with the closing and the integration of the business. This includes the $4 million incurred in the first quarter, and the remainder of this amount will be incurred between now and up to six months after the transaction closes. We are encouraged by the strong results that the HotJobs team is producing on an interim basis as we work together on the integration planning. 
Now I would like to turn the call back to Sal for his wrap-up."

Most economies around the world are in some stage of improvement. And we have seen the benefits of our investment efforts in the acceptance of new products, gains in global market share and the positive impact of improved service. Monster's investment in innovation has been made to address our customers' needs and differentiate us from the competitors. No competitor in the market has a product suite that can compare with ours. As a result, we see our products taking hold. Bookings are picking up momentum, and we continue to be able to command premium pricing in a price-competitive market. While we're not completely out of the woods yet, I'm increasingly confident of our future and very comfortable with the guidance that we've provided. 
We are committed to achieving booking growth of 15% to 20% for the quarter. We are currently comfortable at the middle of that range. Hopefully, we will be at the high end of the range for all of 2010. We believe we can achieve this growth while holding operating expense to between 3% and 6% for the year. 
Finally, I want to thank our shareholders for their ongoing support and interest in Monster, our numerous customers, both new and existing, for their embrace of our products. I'd also like to thank all of our associates for their ongoing dedication and hard work. Our performance would not have been possible without their commitment, and I look forward to continuing the momentum we've built together.

Meaning, the assuming flattish revenue growth for the year, what is the contribution from the pricing benefit from 6Sense relative to volume increases for postings and the database?"

I think that the bookings that we're seeing today, the increase in the bookings, is partially, as I indicated in my comments, due to the improvement in a number of economies around the world. But it is also being pushed here in the U.S. because of 6Sense. So I think that it's benefiting bookings. I think that we're seeing new customers come to Monster because of the power of 6Sense and realizing the power that product has. I think over time, you'll see some more of that come in, in the U.K., where we've just introduced it. I think if we step out of beta in Canada and go into beta in France, we'll see some benefits start to accrue there. And that could push the momentum of the booking. And again, as both Tim and James have indicated, it really depends on when those bookings occur, how it builds up into deferred, that will give more punch into revenue. Definitely, as we build up the bookings, and which then of course, goes up the deferred, this is all going to be beneficial as we go into 2011 and create the momentum that we need there. What's really happened here and 6Sense is going to help us in the economy, and a number of other products are also going to help. As we went through the heart of the recession -- I almost said the word depression, believe me, a point in time, it did feel like a depression. We depleted our deferred revenue. We depleted our backlog, if you will, that converts to revenue. What you are seeing overall now, and what we're very happy to see happening is with the 17% growth in bookings, is that we're beginning to replenish, adjusted for seasonality because Q4 is always a very big quarter for us, and Q1 is a little bit lighter. Q2 is probably the lightest quarter of the year, then it begins to build up into Q3 and going into Q4. So what we're hoping and what we're seeing with the kinds of increases, the 15% to 20% increase that we're forecasting right now on bookings, will be the replenishment of that deferred, which will put us in a much better position going into 2011. And if we're surprised and economies pick up even more strongly than what we're seeing right now, obviously, these numbers could be pushed up. But I think it would be pushing it at this point. We just don't have enough clarity to forecast that at this point. I think we're comfortable where we are."

So to Sal's point, we have $100 million that we have to make up, and the 15% to 20% bookings growth is covering that. So the flat to slightly down or up is making up that $100 million coming into the year. So that's important to realize that as well, when talking about the growth."

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us on our second quarter conference call. Before we get in into a discussion of the quarter, I'd like to welcome Kathy Paladino, who has joined us as Head of North American Sales. Kathy was most recently President of Motorola's Enterprise Mobility Division, a $2-billion division at Motorola. Prior to Motorola's acquisition of Symbol, Kathy was Head of Worldwide Sales at Symbol, which she led the company to its highest sales volume ever. Kathy previously spent eight years at Cisco Systems, leading its U.S. Cable and Emerging Services Provider business.
Steve Cooker, who previously managed our U.S. sales team, will be leading our Global Government Solutions business. Steve has over 10 years of experience in this sector. The Government sector is a large market opportunity for us, and we are well positioned to expand our presence internationally and domestically with local state and federal agencies. Having both Kathy and Steve as part of our senior management team will substantially increase our firepower in the important North American and Global Government markets.
During the second quarter, we demonstrated solid execution. Our strategy of using Monster's innovative technology and product portfolio to create significant value for our customers and job seekers is making progress. The clearest evidence of our progress is that bookings increased to $208 million, up 19% year-over-year, and we're at the high end of our expectations. This performance was achieved despite the increased global macroeconomic uncertainty and the negative impact of currency translation. 
At the highest level, our value proposition is simple. We provide to our clients the broadest range of the most relevant candidate, and we do this efficiently and in a manner which maximizes the return on investments. Our customers are recognizing that Monster is much more than a job board, as we compete against general and vertical job boards and newer forms of competition. We are able to deliver a portfolio of products and services that provide compelling solutions to each of our clients. 
Our ability to offer these solutions is based on several key competitive strengths. We reach a wider audience of the active and passive seekers than any of our traditional competitors. We do this with our recruitment sites, professional communities and through our Career Ad Network. Our scale will only be enhanced with the completion of the pending acquisition of Yahoo! HotJobs. The combination of our scale and ability to precisely match the appropriate candidate with the right job as a result of our proprietary 6Sense technology is unsurpassed in the industry. Our broad product array, including media products, can be customized and packaged to meet client requirements.
Our unmatched global reach is a competitive strength to servicing international enterprise client. Our technology investments we have made ensure the privacy and security of the data shared by our seekers and our employers. 
Our sales force is now using the full scope of our product and service offering to create an enhanced solution for our client. As a result, our clients are allocating their highest share of their recruitment spend with Monster. Based on our bookings growth, coupled with an analysis of our win-loss trend, we believe we are gaining market share. There were a number of key indicators of that success in the market.
I know that the bookings in the quarter increased by 19% with a 57% increase in Asia, a 20% increase in Europe and 15% increase in North America. We have also seen strong performance in most of our verticals. In North America, our e-Commerce business, which is used by small businesses and is a leading indicator of economic health, had a 32% year-over-year growth. Year-to-date, our retention rate for existing customers and our rate of acquisition of new customers substantially improved over last year in all countries and geography. 
In the first half of the year, we booked business with more than 100,000 accounts in North America and Europe of which more than 30,000 were new accounts. We have also seen more of our customers purchase all cycles to replenish depleted hosting inventories. Power Resume Search or PRS became available to all of our clients in North America and in the United Kingdom in early Q3. During Q2, PRS accounted for 40% of our search license bookings in those countries. Considering it commands a 30% premium price, the result has been impressive and demonstrates the strength of the product offering. Ultimately, we believe PRS will be adopted by the majority of our larger customers. In September, we are moving from beta to launch in France and are on plan for beta testing in Australia.
In the quarter, Career Ad Network or CAN continues to show solid results for our customers in North America. Our penetration in France, Netherlands and Italy is increasing, and there is opportunity for growth both in Germany and the United Kingdom. I would now like to outline our top priorities over the next several quarters.
We will continue to aggressively communicate our enhanced value proposition to the market, and this will enable us to continue to gain share. With respect to the HotJobs acquisition and the regulatory review, we are pleased with the progress and currently expect to close the transaction in the third quarter. Once successfully integrated with Monster, our seeker audience will significantly expand, our client base will be broader and both seekers and employers will benefit from the increased scale and array of products and solutions and precision of our 6Sense technology.
We will continue to focus on developing additional products and services powered by our 6Sense technology. We know that 6Sense technology is superior for analyzing and processing resume and profile data. We are developing solutions that allow our customers to use the technology not only for sourcing and hiring candidates from Monster but to manage an entire candidate flow from all other sources. We are developing solutions that will assist our customers in managing their talent beyond just recruiting. We are encouraged by the feedback we are getting from our customers. In fact, MRINetwork, a large and progressive staffing company, has already purchased our solution, giving us further confidence of its future success.
From a financial perspective, we are focused on improving profitability. We are pleased to report that pro forma EBITDA in Q2 was $28 million compared to just $3 million in Q1. As we look forward, I'd like to comment on the economic environment as we see it today and our 2010 outlook. It is an understatement that the outlook for the global economies remain highly uncertain, difficult to predict and volatile. While it's true that a number of key economies around the world remain fragile, we subscribe to the current consensus view that we will not have a double-digit recession. With that in mind, we stay vigilant and continue to be disciplined on spending. 
Most of our customers' sentiment has turned positive regarding business investment and expanding the labor force. Our customers, on a global basis, are indicating that they expect to spend more amounts to products and services. We believe this is partially reflective of the recovering economy but also reflective of Monster's improved performance. Customers have cited our broad product portfolio and excellent customer service as reasons to increase their spend with Monster. 
Monster's most productive way, outsourcing talent. Some of our customers use our products to improve their internal efficiencies; some use our products to source new talent; some to replace a normal level of churn; and for many, it's a combination of all those reasons. For the accounts which reduced their spend or did not renew, most tell us they don't have the budget or the need. They are not going to a competitor. We continue to believe that the most important near-term indicator of our success is booking. 
Based on our current view of the global economy, we believe the year-over-year increase in bookings in 2010 will be in the upper part of the 15% to 20% range. This is expected to translate into 2010 revenue in the range of $890 million to $925 million. For operating expenses, as most of you know, we have eliminated over $200 million of cost over the last three years, while at the same time rebuilt our sales force, our products, the technology platform and customer service. 
We have essentially rebuilt Monster. We are now focusing resources on getting our product to the market, expanding the Monster brand globally and growing the company on a profitable basis. With that in mind and based on our spend in Q2, we expect total operating expenses in 2010 to be flat to up 2% versus our previous guidance of up 3% to 6%. For 2010, we are now forecasting a loss of $0.14 per share to a loss of $0.06 per share that compares to our previous guidance of a loss of $0.20 per share to a loss of $0.12 per share. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tim for a more detailed review of the financial and our outlook. Tim?"

Turning now to Slide 1 or Q2 Pro Forma Income Statement. Revenue of $215 million was flat on a sequential basis and down 4% on a year-over-year basis. This result was at the midpoint of our guidance range. Operating expense of $213 million was down 11% sequentially and down 1% on a year-over-year basis. On a year-over-year basis, revenue was negatively impacted by $800,000 of currency translation, while operating expenses were favorably impacted by $600,000 or an insignificant net currency impact of $200,000. Interest expense was $1 million. Equity loss, primarily reflecting our investment in CareerOne Australia, was $800,000. Net loss was $200,000 or breakeven. EBITDA on a pro forma basis was $28.4 million, an EBITDA margin of 13%.
Slide 2 is our GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation. The reconciling items were $500,000 expense on the salary and related line representing severance expense, $5.2 million expense on the office and general line, representing costs associated with the HotJobs transaction primarily legal fees and costs associated with the FTC review process and positive $1.9 million interest income representing partial recoveries on our auction rate securities. These pro forma adjustments total negative $2.8 million after tax in the quarter.
Slide 3 is our Q2 2010 Pro Forma Expense Trend slide. Total operating expense during the quarter was $213 million, down 11% from the prior quarter and down 1% from the prior year. Total headcount in the quarter was 5,546, a reduction of 453 from last year at this time. Total salary and related expense was down 6% from the prior quarter, reflecting the normal reductions in employee benefit expense incurred during the first quarter. Marketing expense was down 21% from the prior quarter, reflecting the anticipated reduction in spending associated with the 6Sense product launch, including Super Bowl advertising incurred in Q1. Office and general expense was down 11% sequentially, reflecting our continuing expense disciplines.
Slide 4 is Bookings and Revenue Trend. As Sal noted, bookings increased year-over-year by 19% at the upper end of our range. As anticipated and reflecting a somewhat slower second quarter, bookings were 5% lower on a sequential basis. The strength of our bookings was broadly spread across our geographies in China. Asia, the smallest absolute dollar contributor to our bookings, experienced the strongest year-over-year growth at 57%. Within Asia, Korea remains our strongest contributor on a percentage year-over-year growth basis with bookings up 86%. We also experienced strong year-over-year bookings growth in India, 63% and China, 37%. 
New York region produced the second strongest percentage growth on a year-over-year basis at 20%. All major countries in Europe showed year-over-year bookings growth. During the second quarter, Sweden remained our largest percentage gain contributor, up 79%. Importantly, Germany's bookings picked up this quarter and were up 28%, joining France, Italy and Switzerland with growth above 20%. The Netherlands and Belgium experienced year-over-year growth around 10%. United Kingdom had the slowest growth in the region, up 2% year-over-year, and we believe this below-average growth primarily reflects continuing macro-economic concerns in that market.
North America was the slowest growing of our major regions this quarter but still had a healthy 16% year-over-year increase. Sal noted that we continue to experience strong year-over-year growth in our e-Comm channel, up 32%. Overall, we experienced strong performance from our commercial clients whether serviced by our field or telesales organizations with the strongest results from our larger enterprise clients who utilize the broadest range of our products.
As we have previously noted, the results of our large Government business are lumpier than the rest of our business. After an extremely strong Q1 in terms of year-over-year growth, our Government business was up only 3% year-over-year in the second quarter. Our staffing channel and our healthcare channel both experienced subpar results during the quarter. We expect the HotJobs acquisition to strengthen our position in both the staffing and healthcare verticals.
Slide 5 shows the results of our operating segments. Reiterating a general caveat, since we moved to a global functional organization, we view the results of our Career business more on a global basis than on a geographic basis, and a number of cost allocations are spread based on revenue or activity-based allocations methodologies. That having been said, the revenue of the combined Careers business was up 1% sequentially. And operating income of the combined Careers business was $13.5 million, producing an operating margin of 7.4% and an EBITDA margin of 18%. 
On a sequential basis, the operating margin of both our Careers North America and our Career International segments showed significant improvement; a 19-point improvement in margin for North America and an 8.5-point improvement in the margin of our International segment. We know, of course, that North America's margins improved more than International during the quarter. There were several primary reasons for this difference and two have occurred. First, we spent a greater share of our reduced marketing spend in the European markets during this quarter, and we feel this is being rewarded by strong bookings growth and significant increase in new clients. Second, as we have noted in the past, we are modestly picking up our marketing spend in China. And finally, based on our internal allocation methodologies, a greater percentage of our allocated costs fit the International segment this quarter.
Our IAF business continues to experience mixed performance. This quarter, we had strong performance in our Customer Lead Generation and Display businesses, but the segment is negatively impacted by a reduction in military recruitment spend, which directly impacted our Military.com business. 
Slide 6 is Key Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Items. And most of the significant cash flow items for the quarter were consistent with our expectations. GAAP EBITDA was $22.7 million. Net cash provided by operations was $6.7 million compared to a use of $13.6 million in last year's second quarter. Capital expenditures were $11.9 million. Deferred revenue, at $280 million, was a decrease of $25 million. The major factors contributing to this reduction in deferred were revenue was greater than bookings during the quarter again, so somewhat more was taken out of the deferred revenue account that was put in. Deferred revenue was negatively impacted by currency translation. And most importantly, as we noted last quarter, we expect this deferred revenue will be substantially higher at year end. Our net cash was $251 million, and our total liquidity was $493 million. 
So to summarize the quarter, as Sal noted, the quarter represented continued strong execution of our plans and our most major financial and operational metrics for the quarter was somewhat better than our own expectations coming into the quarter and demonstrates strong progress. Bookings increased 19% year-over-year, while operating expenses were 1% lower on the same basis. This ability to significantly grow the business while controlling expense is a clear indication of the operating leverage potential in the business. Earnings per share were essentially breakeven versus our guidance range of a loss of $0.02 to $0.06. Pro forma EBITDA was $28.4 million, producing an EBITDA margin of 13%. And our total liquidity position remains very strong. 
As we look forward, while we continue to be mindful of the crosscurrents in the markets, we also believe that our ability to execute our plan and provide superior value to our client is becoming increasingly evident. With that as backdrop, we'd like to provide the following guidance for the full year and the third quarter. Please note that this guidance does not include the impact from the proposed acquisition of HotJobs.
Slide 7 summarizes our full year guidance. We are maintaining the full year range for our guidance for bookings of $930 million to $970 million, a 15% to 20% year-over-year increase. Since last quarter, currency has negatively impacted our bookings outlook, but that negative has been made up by increased anticipated customer demand. So we continue to believe that we'll be at the higher end of the bookings range for the year. We are also maintaining our revenue range of $890 million to $925 million, plus or minus 2% on a year-over-year basis. Of course, where we fall within that range is heavily dependent on the timing and mix of bookings as well as the future direction on currency. And we are still going against the headwinds of reduced deferred revenue. 
Q1 2009 deferred revenue was $345 million. Q1 2010 deferred revenue was $305 million, roughly a $10 million per quarter negative impact on revenue. Based on these assumptions and on the actual results for the quarter, we believe EPS will be a loss of $0.14 to $0.06 compared to last quarter's guidance of a loss of $0.20 to $0.12. In order to achieve this EPS result while holding our revenue estimate flat, as Sal noted, we are tightening the outlook for our year-over-year expense growth to flat to plus 2% versus our prior expectation of a 3% to 6% increase.
Slide 8 is our Q3 2010 Guidance. We anticipate bookings to be in the range of $215 million to $225 million, a 16% to 21% year-over-year increase. Revenue will be $218 million to $228 million, a 1% to 6% increase year-over-year, our first quarterly revenue increased since Q3 2008. Gross or earnings per share will be between a loss of $0.02 and a profit of $0.02.  We'd like to update the financial parameters we have been previously provided on the acquisition of the projects. On a full year 2011 basis, we expect the acquisition to contribute between $20 million and $40 million of EBITDA and between $0.06 and $0.12 of earnings per share. That expectation has not changed. We currently anticipate it closing in the third quarter. Of course, the exact timing will have an impact on the results of Q3. 
We do not know at this time how many weeks during the quarter we will benefit from being able to include the HotJobs results in our results. And of course, from a revenue recognition point of view, we get different results depending on exactly when in the quarter we closed. We will, of course, fully disclose the impact of the HotJobs acquisition on our Q3 reporting results. 
For the fourth quarter, as we have previously indicated, we expect that the acquisition would modestly contribute to pro forma EBITDA and EPS. We estimate total acquisition-related costs to be around $30 million, including the $9.6 million which has already been incurred in Q1 and Q2. The major reason for the increase from our prior estimate of $25 million are incremental costs related to our presentations to the SEC. In fact, in his comments, Sal noted a number of the business benefits we believe the HotJobs acquisition will bring. 
In addition to the profitability I have just articulated, it is important to remember that the cost of the increased traffic under the Yahoo! traffic deal is fully covered in our outlook of $20 million to $40 million of EBITDA. And that traffic will benefit all Monster's clients and make us more competitive in the market, but our profitability outlook does not include any of that potential benefit. 
In addition, we believe that current HotJobs clients will benefit from Monster's superior product offering and we'll be able to extend our business with those clients. One simple example of that is our Power Resume Search, where HotJobs does not have a comparable product offering. 
Before turning the call back to Sal, I'd like to announce that Bob Jones, our longtime Head of Investor Relations, has decided to return to the IR Consulting business, and Monster is very pleased to be one of his initial clients. Lori Chaitman, who is with us on the call today, will assume responsibilities as Head of IR for Monster. Most recently, Lori was a senior member of the Motorola IR team and Head of IR at Symbol prior to the acquisition. We are happy to have Lori join us, and we wish Bob the best of luck in his new endeavors. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Sal to wrap up."

Our ability to provide unique solutions to customers is differentiating us from both traditional and new competitors. As we mentioned, bookings are expected to grow at the high end of the 15% to 20% range. 
Customer retention and rate of acquisition of new customers are improving. Customers have indicated that they will allocate more of their recruitment budget to Monster's products and solutions. These two points are testament that the investments we have made are creating significant value for our customers. Irrespective of the pace of the economic recovery, we will continue to focus on penetrating our customer base, we'll enhance value proposition and gain market share globally. As we successfully execute our product strategy and maintain our discipline on cost, we will improve the financial performance of the company. 
Before we take questions, I want to thank our customers, employees and shareholders for their ongoing support. We look forward to what's ahead. Thank you very much. Operator, will you please open up to questions."

It's just not significant to us at all. I think the encouraging thing is that in spite of the news and as it continue to filter out about what the situation was in Greece and in a few other countries, particularly in Europe, what we actually saw is business kept on increasing in momentum and the sentiment in Europe actually continue to improve. The exception to that is the U.K., in terms of momentum of growth. But even there, we've stabilized and we're up very slightly, certainly not where we'd like to be yet. But the overall mood in Europe is positive. One of the most interesting things that we noticed during the quarter is that we would have expected more negative reaction given the momentum of the news in Europe. But the news in Europe seem to have more of a cooling effect here in the United States than it seems to have Europe itself. Now we think that's obviously a temporary phenomenon. What we're seeing so far in July gives us a hope that both the performance here in the United States and in Europe will continue to improve. In terms of the competitive environment, as I noted before, competition is certainly out there. We have competition in virtually every market that we participate in. Fortunately, we do not have any competitors that are on a global scale such as ourselves. We are very unique in that sense. The breadth of the geographic reach of the company is unique. But in each of the markets we play, there is certainly competition and it is significant. With regard to the professional social network, we simply have not seen any type of significant impact on our business. As I've said before, I think, certainly, that they're being utilized by some of our customers. It's a technique. It's a methodology that certainly has a place within the recruitment process. But in terms of impact in our business, we just haven't seen any significant impact at all."

One is, in our IAF business, our major site is Military.com, and that's a pretty good significant percentage of the total IAF revenue. It's revenue model is display and lead generation advertising, a lot of which is on the part of the uniformed services as they try to fill their own staffing, people for the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines. And one of the by-products of the current weakness in the job market is the fact that the military isn't able to fill its quarterly [ph] at lower level of advertising spend. And we're seeing that to some extent and that impacts our IAF revenue line. Our Government business, which is part of Careers, is, on full year basis, will be up significantly. And this is where we provide recruiting services to the government directly through a variety of different vehicles. For example, the private label of the government's own USAJOBS website. That's just one example. That tends to be larger contracts than our normal run-off-the-mill business. And so when one closes at any given quarter, you can change the result relatively significantly on a percentage basis. It's a pretty good-sized piece of our North American Careers business."

I think that, as you see, we're continuing to be encouraged by the fact that our e-Commerce business continue to grow and continue to be the momentum that had ended Q1 with. We're up to about 32% growth year-on-year in e-Comm. And as we've noted in prior calls, e-Comm was the first business to really suffer and begin to feel the effects of the recession. And we're hopeful that the robustness of that recovery will continue to flow into a midsized company and into our big customer base. Having said that, we seek, across the country, significant growth. Some regions are growing at a faster clip than others. And so the momentum is good. The channel, the pipeline of transaction continues to build and gives us reason to be somewhat more optimistic with regard to Q3 and beyond. So I think that although we're gratified, maybe the best way to express it, in the 16% growth here in the U.S., obviously, we're anxious to see the growth continue to accelerate from that number. We believe that we'll end up at the high end of the range we've given. I'm hopeful that by Q4, barring any large unforeseen event, that we can even go above the 20% for the quarter, Q4. The momentum appears to be there, certainly, at this time. There is some, I think, customers -- the overall view out there is customers are much more optimistic, certainly, than they were a year ago. That would be an understatement, because the psychology, et cetera, is much more positive. So I think that there is still some hesitation because of the uncertainty. Best way for me to express it is you read the Wall Street Journal on a given day and the story is positive versus the next day that it's negative, so there is some hesitation. But I think plans for our company is to grow, we see every study we look at indicates that customers are planning to hire, in some cases, to replenish the resources that they've reduced during the heart of the recession, in many cases, to add talent.

Of our Search business, 6Sense represented approximately 35% to 40% of the entire market. And that's particularly interesting in the sense that we could not sell it to all of our customers for the entire quarter. We finished making it available to our customers, actually, in the very beginning of Q3. So we're hopeful. We're very happy with its adoption to date. We're hopeful that, that continues to expand, given that it's available to a wider and wider audience. It's also an interesting sell, in terms of it is higher priced, it's a minimum of 30% premium in price to classic search or our traditional search products. And it is, as you might expect, a slightly longer-term sell. It's really an indication -- a sell that's predicated on proving the value of the ROI of the product. So given that factor, given that it wasn't available for most of Q2, there's still a number of our customers where we're very happy with the results at this time. And just as an aside, as I've said, we introduced it in the United Kingdom this quarter, and the results there are very similar to what we have seen here in the United States. And the momentum is starting off slowly at the beginning of Q2 and build as we got to the end of the quarter. And overall, their results were similar to the results here in the United States. Okay? And we're really anxious to now introduce, in the next few quarters, the next generations of products using the 6Sense technology as its core.

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us on our second quarter conference call. Before we get in into a discussion of the quarter, I'd like to welcome Kathy Paladino, who has joined us as Head of North American Sales. Kathy was most recently President of Motorola's Enterprise Mobility Division, a $2-billion division at Motorola. Prior to Motorola's acquisition of Symbol, Kathy was Head of Worldwide Sales at Symbol, which she led the company to its highest sales volume ever. Kathy previously spent eight years at Cisco Systems, leading its U.S. Cable and Emerging Services Provider business.
Steve Cooker, who previously managed our U.S. sales team, will be leading our Global Government Solutions business. Steve has over 10 years of experience in this sector. The Government sector is a large market opportunity for us, and we are well positioned to expand our presence internationally and domestically with local state and federal agencies. Having both Kathy and Steve as part of our senior management team will substantially increase our firepower in the important North American and Global Government markets.
During the second quarter, we demonstrated solid execution. Our strategy of using Monster's innovative technology and product portfolio to create significant value for our customers and job seekers is making progress. The clearest evidence of our progress is that bookings increased to $208 million, up 19% year-over-year, and we're at the high end of our expectations. This performance was achieved despite the increased global macroeconomic uncertainty and the negative impact of currency translation. 
At the highest level, our value proposition is simple. We provide to our clients the broadest range of the most relevant candidate, and we do this efficiently and in a manner which maximizes the return on investments. Our customers are recognizing that Monster is much more than a job board, as we compete against general and vertical job boards and newer forms of competition. We are able to deliver a portfolio of products and services that provide compelling solutions to each of our clients. 
Our ability to offer these solutions is based on several key competitive strengths. We reach a wider audience of the active and passive seekers than any of our traditional competitors. We do this with our recruitment sites, professional communities and through our Career Ad Network. Our scale will only be enhanced with the completion of the pending acquisition of Yahoo! HotJobs. The combination of our scale and ability to precisely match the appropriate candidate with the right job as a result of our proprietary 6Sense technology is unsurpassed in the industry. Our broad product array, including media products, can be customized and packaged to meet client requirements.
Our unmatched global reach is a competitive strength to servicing international enterprise client. Our technology investments we have made ensure the privacy and security of the data shared by our seekers and our employers. 
Our sales force is now using the full scope of our product and service offering to create an enhanced solution for our client. As a result, our clients are allocating their highest share of their recruitment spend with Monster. Based on our bookings growth, coupled with an analysis of our win-loss trend, we believe we are gaining market share. There were a number of key indicators of that success in the market.
I know that the bookings in the quarter increased by 19% with a 57% increase in Asia, a 20% increase in Europe and 15% increase in North America. We have also seen strong performance in most of our verticals. In North America, our e-Commerce business, which is used by small businesses and is a leading indicator of economic health, had a 32% year-over-year growth. Year-to-date, our retention rate for existing customers and our rate of acquisition of new customers substantially improved over last year in all countries and geography. 
In the first half of the year, we booked business with more than 100,000 accounts in North America and Europe of which more than 30,000 were new accounts. We have also seen more of our customers purchase all cycles to replenish depleted hosting inventories. Power Resume Search or PRS became available to all of our clients in North America and in the United Kingdom in early Q3. During Q2, PRS accounted for 40% of our search license bookings in those countries. Considering it commands a 30% premium price, the result has been impressive and demonstrates the strength of the product offering. Ultimately, we believe PRS will be adopted by the majority of our larger customers. In September, we are moving from beta to launch in France and are on plan for beta testing in Australia.
In the quarter, Career Ad Network or CAN continues to show solid results for our customers in North America. Our penetration in France, Netherlands and Italy is increasing, and there is opportunity for growth both in Germany and the United Kingdom. I would now like to outline our top priorities over the next several quarters.
We will continue to aggressively communicate our enhanced value proposition to the market, and this will enable us to continue to gain share. With respect to the HotJobs acquisition and the regulatory review, we are pleased with the progress and currently expect to close the transaction in the third quarter. Once successfully integrated with Monster, our seeker audience will significantly expand, our client base will be broader and both seekers and employers will benefit from the increased scale and array of products and solutions and precision of our 6Sense technology.
We will continue to focus on developing additional products and services powered by our 6Sense technology. We know that 6Sense technology is superior for analyzing and processing resume and profile data. We are developing solutions that allow our customers to use the technology not only for sourcing and hiring candidates from Monster but to manage an entire candidate flow from all other sources. We are developing solutions that will assist our customers in managing their talent beyond just recruiting. We are encouraged by the feedback we are getting from our customers. In fact, MRINetwork, a large and progressive staffing company, has already purchased our solution, giving us further confidence of its future success.
From a financial perspective, we are focused on improving profitability. We are pleased to report that pro forma EBITDA in Q2 was $28 million compared to just $3 million in Q1. As we look forward, I'd like to comment on the economic environment as we see it today and our 2010 outlook. It is an understatement, that the outlook for the global economies remain highly uncertain, difficult to predict and volatile. While it's true that a number of key economies around the world remain fragile, we subscribe to the current consensus view that we will not have a double-digit recession. With that in mind, we stay vigilant and continue to be disciplined on spending. 
Most of our customers' sentiment has turned positive regarding business investment and expanding the labor force. Our customers, on a global basis, are indicating that they expect to spend more amounts to products and services. We believe this is partially reflective of the recovering economy, but also reflective of Monster's improved performance. Customers have cited our broad product portfolio and excellent customer service as reasons to increase their spend with Monster. 
Monster's most productive way, outsourcing talent. Some of our customers use our products to improve their internal efficiency. Some use our products to source new talent. Some to replace a normal level of churn and for many, it's a combination of all those reasons. For the accounts, which reduced their spend or did not renew, most tell us they don't have the budget or the need. They are not going to a competitor. We continue to believe that the most important near-term indicator of our success is booking. 
Based on our current view of the global economy, we believe the year-over-year increase in bookings in 2010 will be in the upper part of the 15% to 20% range. This is expected to translate into 2010 revenue in the range of $890 million to $925 million. For operating expenses, as most of you know, we have eliminated over $200 million of cost over the last three years, while at the same time rebuilt our sales force, our products, the technology platform and customer service. 
We have essentially rebuilt Monster. We are now focusing resources on getting our product to the market, expanding the Monster brand globally and growing the company on a profitable basis. With that in mind and based on our spend in Q2, we expect total operating expenses in 2010 to be flat to up 2% versus our previous guidance of up 3% to 6%. For 2010, we are now forecasting a loss of $0.14 per share to a loss of $0.06 per share that compares to our previous guidance of a loss of $0.20 per share to a loss of $0.12 per share. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tim for more detailed review of the financial and our outlook. Tim?"

As I did last quarter, I will be using slides to guide our conversations through the financials.

Turning now to Slide 1 or Q2 Pro Forma Income Statement. Revenue of $215 million was flat on a sequential basis and down 4% on a year-over-year basis. This result was at the midpoint of our guidance range. Operating expense of $213 million was down 11% sequentially and down 1% on a year-over-year basis. 
On a year-over-year basis, revenue was negatively impacted by $800,000 of currency translation, while operating expenses were favorably impacted by $600,000 or an insignificant net currency impact of $200,000. Interest expense was $1 million. Equity loss, primarily reflecting our investment in CareerOne Australia, was $800,000. Net loss was $200,000 or breakeven. EBITDA on a pro forma basis was $28.4 million, an EBITDA margin of 13%.
Slide 2 is our GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation. The reconciling items were $500,000 expense on the salary and related line, representing severance expense; $5.2 million expense on the office and general line, representing costs associated with the HotJobs transaction, primarily legal fees and costs associated with the FTC review process; and positive $1.9 million interest income, representing partial recoveries on our auction rate securities. These pro forma adjustments totaled negative $2.8 million after tax in the quarter.
Slide 3 is our Q2 2010 Pro Forma Expense Trend slide. Total operating expense during the quarter was $213 million, down 11% from the prior quarter and down 1% from the prior year. Total headcount in the quarter was 5,546, a reduction of 453 from last year at this time. Total salary and related expense was down 6% from the prior quarter, reflecting the normal reduction in employee benefit expense incurred during the first quarter. Marketing expense was down 21% from the prior quarter, reflecting the anticipated reduction in spending associated with the 6Sense product launch, including Super Bowl advertising incurred in Q1. Office and general expense was down 11% sequentially, reflecting our continuing expense disciplines.
Slide 4 is Bookings and Revenue Trend. As Sal noted, bookings increased year-over-year by 19% at the upper end of our range. As anticipated and reflecting a somewhat slower second quarter, bookings were 5% lower on a sequential basis. The strength of our bookings was broadly spread across our geographies in China. Asia, the smallest absolute dollar contributor to our bookings, experienced the strongest year-over-year growth at 57%. Within Asia, Korea remains our strongest contributor on a percentage year-over-year growth basis with bookings up 86%. We also experienced strong year-over-year bookings growth in India, 63% and China, 37%. 
New York region produced the second strongest percentage growth on a year-over-year basis at 20%. All major countries in Europe showed year-over-year bookings growth. During the second quarter, Sweden remained our largest percentage gain contributor, up 79%. Importantly, Germany's bookings picked up this quarter and were up 28%, joining France, Italy and Switzerland with growth above 20%. The Netherlands and Belgium experienced year-over-year growth around 10%. United Kingdom had the slowest growth in the region, up 2% year-over-year, and we believe this below-average growth, primarily reflects continuing macroeconomic concerns in that market.
North America was the slowest growing of our major regions this quarter, but still had a healthy 16% year-over-year increase. Sal noted that we continue to experience strong year-over-year growth in our e-Comm channel, up 32%. Overall, we experienced strong performance from our commercial clients whether serviced by our field or telesales organization, with the strongest results from our larger enterprise clients, who utilize the broadest range of our products.
As we have previously noted, the results of our large Government business are lumpier than the rest of our business. After an extremely strong Q1 in terms of year-over-year growth, our Government business was up only 3% year-over-year in the second quarter. Our staffing channel and our healthcare channel both experienced subpar results during the quarter. We expect the HotJobs acquisition to strengthen our position in both the staffing and healthcare verticals.
Slide 5 shows the results of our operating segments. Reiterating a general caveat, since we moved to a global functional organization, we view the results of our Career business more on a global basis than on a geographic basis, and a number of cost allocations are spread based on revenue or activity-based allocations methodologies. That having been said, the revenue of the combined Careers business was up 1% sequentially. And operating income of the combined Careers business was $13.5 million, producing an operating margin of 7.4% and an EBITDA margin of 18%. 
On a sequential basis, the operating margin of both our Careers North America and our Career International segments showed significant improvement; a 19-point improvement in margin for North America and an 8.5-point improvement in the margin of our International segment. We know, of course, that North America's margins improved more than International during the quarter. There were several primary reasons for this difference and two have occurred. First, we spent a greater share of our reduced marketing spend in the European markets during this quarter, and we feel this is being rewarded by strong bookings growth and significant increase in new clients. Second, as we have noted in the past, we are modestly picking up our marketing spend in China. And finally, based on our internal allocation methodologies, a greater percentage of our allocated costs fit the International segment this quarter.
Our IAF business continues to experience mixed performance. This quarter, we had strong performance in our Customer Lead Generation and Display businesses, but the segment is negatively impacted by a reduction in military recruitment spend, which directly impacted our Military.com business. 
Slide 6 is Key Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Items. And most of the significant cash flow items for the quarter were consistent with our expectations. GAAP EBITDA was $22.7 million. Net cash provided by operations was $6.7 million compared to a use of $13.6 million in last year's second quarter. Capital expenditures were $11.9 million. Deferred revenue, at $280 million, was a decrease of $25 million. The major factors contributing to this reduction in deferred were revenue was greater than bookings during the quarter again, so somewhat more was taken out of the deferred revenue account that was put in. Deferred revenue was negatively impacted by currency translation. And most importantly, as we noted last quarter, we expect this deferred revenue will be substantially higher at year end. Our net cash was $251 million, and our total liquidity was $493 million. 
So to summarize the quarter, as Sal noted, the quarter represented continued strong execution of our plans and our most major financial and operational metrics for the quarter was somewhat better than our own expectations coming into the quarter and demonstrates strong progress. Bookings increased 19% year-over-year, while operating expenses were 1% lower on the same basis. This ability to significantly grow the business while controlling expense is a clear indication of the operating leverage potential in the business. Earnings per share were essentially breakeven versus our guidance range of a loss of $0.02 to $0.06. Pro forma EBITDA was $28.4 million, producing an EBITDA margin of 13%. And our total liquidity position remains very strong. 
As we look forward, while we continue to be mindful of the crosscurrents in the markets, we also believe that our ability to execute our plan and provide superior value to our client is becoming increasingly evident. With that as backdrop, we'd like to provide the following guidance for the full year and the third quarter. Please note that this guidance does not include the impact from the proposed acquisition of HotJobs.
Slide 7 summarizes our full year guidance. We are maintaining the full year range for our guidance for bookings of $930 million to $970 million, a 15% to 20% year-over-year increase. Since last quarter, currency has negatively impacted our bookings outlook, but that negative has been made up by increased anticipated customer demand. So we continue to believe that we'll be at the higher end of the bookings range for the year. We are also maintaining our revenue range of $890 million to $925 million, plus or minus 2% on a year-over-year basis. Of course, where we fall within that range is heavily dependent on the timing and mix of bookings as well as the future direction on currency. And we are still going against the headwinds of reduced deferred revenue. 
Q1 2009 deferred revenue was $345 million. Q1 2010 deferred revenue was $305 million, roughly a $10 million per quarter negative impact on revenue. Based on these assumptions and on the actual results for the quarter, we believe EPS will be a loss of $0.14 to $0.06 compared to last quarter's guidance of a loss of $0.20 to $0.12. In order to achieve this EPS result while holding our revenue estimate flat, as Sal noted, we are tightening the outlook for our year-over-year expense growth to flat to plus 2% versus our prior expectation of a 3% to 6% increase.
Slide 8 is our Q3 2010 Guidance. We anticipate bookings to be in the range of $215 million to $225 million, a 16% to 21% year-over-year increase. Revenue will be $218 million to $228 million, a 1% to 6% increase year-over-year, our first quarterly revenue increased since Q3 2008. Gross or earnings per share will be between a loss of $0.02 and a profit of $0.02.  We'd like to update the financial parameters we have been previously provided on the acquisition of the projects. On a full year 2011 basis, we expect the acquisition to contribute between $20 million and $40 million of EBITDA and between $0.06 and $0.12 of earnings per share. That expectation has not changed. We currently anticipate it closing in the third quarter. Of course, the exact timing will have an impact on the results of Q3. 
We do not know at this time how many weeks during the quarter we will benefit from being able to include the HotJobs results in our results. And of course, from a revenue recognition point of view, we get different results depending on exactly when in the quarter we closed. We will, of course, fully disclose the impact of the HotJobs acquisition on our Q3 reporting results. 
For the fourth quarter, as we have previously indicated, we expect that the acquisition would modestly contribute to pro forma EBITDA and EPS. We estimate total acquisition-related costs to be around $30 million, including the $9.6 million which has already been incurred in Q1 and Q2. The major reason for the increase from our prior estimate of $25 million are incremental costs related to our presentations to the SEC. In fact, in his comments, Sal noted a number of the business benefits we believe the HotJobs acquisition will bring. 
In addition to the profitability I have just articulated, it is important to remember that the cost of the increased traffic under the Yahoo! traffic deal is fully covered in our outlook of $20 million to $40 million of EBITDA. And that traffic will benefit all Monster's clients and make us more competitive in the market, but our profitability outlook does not include any of that potential benefit. 
In addition, we believe that current HotJobs clients will benefit from Monster's superior product offering and we'll be able to extend our business with those clients. One simple example of that is our Power Resume Search, where HotJobs does not have a comparable product offering. 
Before turning the call back to Sal, I'd like to announce that Bob Jones, our longtime Head of Investor Relations, has decided to return to the IR Consulting business, and Monster is very pleased to be one of his initial clients. Lori Chaitman, who is with us on the call today, will assume responsibilities as Head of IR for Monster. Most recently, Lori was a senior member of the Motorola IR team and Head of IR at Symbol prior to the acquisition. We are happy to have Lori join us, and we wish Bob the best of luck in his new endeavors. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Sal to wrap up."

It's just not significant to us at all. I think the encouraging thing is that in spite of the news and as it continue to filter out about what the situation was in Greece and in a few other countries, particularly in Europe, what we actually saw is business kept on increasing in momentum and the sentiment in Europe actually continue to improve. The exception to that is the U.K., in terms of momentum of growth. But even there, we've stabilized and we're up very slightly, certainly not where we'd like to be yet. But the overall mood in Europe is positive. One of the most interesting things that we noticed during the quarter is that we would have expected more negative reaction given the momentum of the news in Europe. But the news in Europe seem to have more of a cooling effect here in the United States than it seems to have Europe itself. Now we think that's obviously a temporary phenomenon. What we're seeing so far in July gives us a hope that both the performance here in the United States and in Europe will continue to improve. In terms of the competitive environment, as I noted before, competition is certainly out there. We have competition in virtually every market that we participate in. Fortunately, we do not have any competitors that are on a global scale such as ourselves. We are very unique in that sense. The breadth of the geographic reach of the company is unique. But in each of the markets we play, there is certainly competition and it is significant. With regard to the professional social network, we simply have not seen any type of significant impact on our business. As I've said before, I think, certainly, that they're being utilized by some of our customers. It's a technique. It's a methodology that certainly has a place within the recruitment process. But in terms of impact in our business, we just haven't seen any significant impact at all."

We took certain costs out last year, particularly in terms of incentive compensation, things of that nature, which we've begun to restore on a limited basis.

One is, in our IAF business, our major site is military.com, and that's a pretty good significant percentage of the total IAF revenue. It's revenue model is display and lead generation advertising, a lot of which is on the part of the uniformed services as they try to fill their own staffing, people for the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines. And one of the by-products of the current weakness in the job market is the fact that the military has been able to fill its quota at a lower level of advertising spend. And we're seeing that to some extent and that impacts our IAF revenue line. Our Government business, which is part of Careers, is on full year basis, will be up significantly. And this is where we provide recruiting services to the government directly through a variety of different vehicles. For example, the private label of the government's own USAJOBS website. That's just one example. That tends to be larger contracts than our normal run-off-the-mill business. And so when one closes at any given quarter, you can change the result relatively significantly on a percentage basis. It's a pretty good-sized piece of our North American Careers business."

I think that, as you see, we're continuing to be encouraged by the fact that our e-Commerce business continue to grow and continue to be the momentum that had ended Q1 with. We're up to about 32% growth year-on-year in e-Comm. And as we've noted in prior calls, e-Comm was the first business to really suffer and begin to feel the effects of the recession. And we're hopeful that the robustness of that recovery will continue to flow into a midsized company and into our big customer base. Having said that, we seek, across the country, significant growth. Some regions are growing at a faster clip than others. And so the momentum is good. The channel, the pipeline of transaction continues to build and gives us reason to be somewhat more optimistic with regard to Q3 and beyond. So I think that although we're gratified, maybe the best way to express it, in the 16% growth here in the U.S., obviously, we're anxious to see the growth continue to accelerate from that number. We believe that we'll end up at the high end of the range we've given. I'm hopeful that by Q4, barring any large unforeseen event that we can even go above the 20% in Q4, for the quarter Q4. The momentum appears to be there certainly at this time. There is some, I think, customers -- the overall view out there is customers are much more optimistic, certainly, than they were a year ago. That will be an understatement, the psychology, et cetera, is much more positive. So I think that there is still some hesitation because of the uncertainty. Best way for me to express it is you read the Wall Street Journal on a given day and the story is positive versus the next day that it's negative, so there is some hesitation. But I think plans for our company is to grow, we see every study we look at indicates that customers are planning to hire, in some cases, to replenish the resources that they've reduced during the heart of the recession, in many cases, to add talent.

Of our Search business, 6Sense represented approximately 35% to 40% of the entire market. And that's particularly interesting in the sense that we could not sell it to all of our customers for the entire quarter. We finished making it available to our customers, actually, in the very beginning of Q3. So we're hopeful. We're very happy with its adoption to date. We're hopeful that, that continues to expand, given that it's available to a wider and wider audience. It's also an interesting sell, in terms of it is higher priced, it's a minimum of 30% premium in price to classic search or our traditional search products. And it is, as you might expect, a slightly longer-term sell. It's really an indication -- a sell that's predicated on proving the value of the ROI of the product. So given that factor, given that it wasn't available for most of Q2, there's still a number of our customers where we're very happy with the results at this time. And just as an aside, as I've said, we introduced it in the United Kingdom this quarter, and the results there are very similar to what we have seen here in the United States. And the momentum is starting off slowly at the beginning of Q2 and build as we got to the end of the quarter. And overall, their results were similar to the results here in the United States. Okay?

My commen",2047,"Thank you,, Lori. Good evening, and thank you, all for joining us for our third quarter conference call.
During the quarter, we continue to build momentum with strong bookings growth across all geographies and within our major vertical markets. My comments will focus on Monster alone unless otherwise noted. Tim will comment on Monster and HotJobs. In the quarter were reported bookings of $229 million, a year-over-year increase of 23%, exceeded the high end of our guidance despite a negative currency impact. In-line revenue of $223 million, in-line earnings per share of $0.01. $300 million in deferred revenue, a sequential increase of $20 million. 
Our ability to achieve this financial result is based on two factors. First, despite the continuing uncertainty of the globally economy, there has been signs of recovery. And second, our customers are recognizing the effectiveness of our enhanced portfolio of recruitment solutions. We believe that our global market reach, combined with our value-added solutions, are unrivaled in the marketplace and are fueling our strong bookings growth. I want to talk first about our global reach, why it is so significant and how it can be enhanced through the Yahoo! Trovix deals and HotJobs acquisition. Next, I'll talk about our enhanced service offering, highlighting power resume search and our Career Ad Network. Then I will discuss the performance benefits when you combine scale with the position of our innovative products. Lastly, I'll wrap with comments on the global economy and to some expected future performance.
Let me say a few words about our global reach. Including incremental fabric resulting from the Yahoo! Trovix deal, more than 47 million people now visit Monster and Monster partner site on a monthly basis. Aiding in our Career Ad Network, we are able to reach approximately 117 million active and passive job seekers on a monthly basis. 
With HotJobs, we now have over 1,000 newspaper alliances with local presence in all 50 states. These alliances are important to our customers as they significantly expand Monster's global reach. Monster own global language sites in 56 countries and have the number one or two market share position in most of the developed markets. 
We have recently launched a Monster site in Brazil and are encouraged by the early results. One of the primary objectives of the HotJobs and Yahoo! transactions was to provide us additional seeker and client scale in the U.S. Though we've only been operating together for a short time, the integration is going well and we are very pleased with the performance and commitment of the HotJobs team. 
Tim will discuss in his comments that the financial results are consistent with our expectations. We are on track to launch the integrated website in the first quarter of 2011. And we are accelerating the integration of our sales team so that all clients fully understand the powerful value proposition, which is a combination of HotJobs and Monster provide. 
The scale and global reach alone are not sufficient. When that scale is combined with the precision of our 6Sense technology and our unique and customizable product solutions, we have a far superior value proposition for our clients. I'd like to update you on two of those solutions. Our resume search or PRS and career ad network or CAN. 
In Q3, PRS accounted for approximately 45% of search license bookings in North America. In the United Kingdom, PRS was available for the first full quarter and accounted for approximately 40% of the search license bookings. 
We recently introduced PRS in France, and while it's been just a few weeks, the significant customer interest and feedback has been positive. Our [indiscernible] in Australia is underway and we are on track for a commercial launch early next year. In 2011, we plan to launch PRS in additional countries around the world. 
As you know, we are maintaining a significant price premium over classic and we are gratified that so many of our clients see its value. Given our results for PRS to date, we believe it will be the predominant search tool used by our customers. None of our competitors offer a comparable product. 
CAN is the industry's largest recruitment focus ad network. It distributes our customer job advertisement to course a broad array of targeted websites in a very effective way of expanding our fine pool of active and passive seekers. Our customers who use CAN generally in conjunction with the traditional posting products, find a substantial almost double increase in their views and applies. And we find we gained incremental revenue and market share compared to simply offering a traditional job posting. 
Among our major competitors, only HotJobs had a comparable product offered and we are now able to offer fine to combined power of both Monster and Yahoo! networks. We are executing on a global strategy by fully developing 10 in 14 of our top global markets. 
As a result of the combination of unsurpassed scale and product solution offerings, we believe we offer our clients a superior return in their investments when buying from Monster. This is beginning to be evident in our results. 
On a global basis, our renewal rates and our rate of acquisition of new customers has substantially improved and more customers are buying more of our product offerings. In North America and Europe over the first nine months, we booked business with 20,000 more clients, a 16% increase over last year. 
On a global basis, bookings were up 23% before HotJobs. Asia was up 36%, positively impacted by 4% of currency translation. North America was up 31%. Europe was up 17% after absorbing 11% negative impact from currency. 
The bookings of our combined career business increased 28% and accounted for 86% of our total bookings. 
Bookings in our IAF business, which accounted for the remaining 14%, were flat compared to last year, but up sequentially in line with prior year's experience. The flat year-over-year trend was due largely to the reduction of spend from the on-services who have cut the recruitment budget. 
We are very encouraged by the client's reception for all the work we have done over the past three years and our primary objective is to fully execute on the delivery of our value proposition for our global client base.
PRS and CAN are helping us to meet the proven needs of our customers better than any of our competitors, but we are, by no means, finished. For example, we are continuing to develop new products based on our 6Sense technology. For example, our 6Sense enterprise suite is a talent management solution that enables our customers to manage their entire resume base, selecting from multiple sources. In addition to the pile with MRINetwork we mentioned on our last quarterly earnings call, we have had over 100 conversations with potential customers who have expressed serious interest in the product capability and we are working with key potential clients to refine the product. We plan to launch this product family in the second quarter of 2011.
I would now like to take a few moments to provide some historical concepts on the macro factors which have influenced our business over the past several years and how we currently see the economy, the job market, and most importantly, Monster's business evolving for the remainder of 2010 and 2011. 
Before 2008, it was generally agreed that companies will likely to say an increasing global skill shortage over the next several decades. Demographic trends such as the [indiscernible] population, increasing job specialization and the impact of technology drove the belief that talents would be an increasing demand and it will be more difficult to match the right candidate to the right job. 
But then came the financial meltdown and the great recession. Companies around the world touched that. They did not replace voluntary attrition, which itself, slowed down because most employees who had jobs wanted to hold on to them. And all budgets including recruiting were flat. Of course, the combination of these factors had a direct and dramatic effect on Monster. Our bookings began to decline on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter of 2008 and bottomed at a 46% year-over-year decline in the first quarter of 2009. 
Starting in the third quarter of 2009 and through the middle of 2010, business began to stabilize. During this difficult time period, we remained committed to our investment in technology and product innovation. A year ago, in October, we highlighted the economic flows currents [ph] and the  unusually high degree of the economic and business uncertainty, which was affecting us and our clients. At that time, we laid out a financial framework for 2010, which was later confirmed for our annual guidance. 
We are pleased that Monster is currently on track to meet or exceed that guidance. Bookings for the fourth quarter are currently expected to increase 20% to 24% bringing year-over-year growth to 20% to 21%. This compares favorably to our bookings guidance range of 15% to 20% for the year. 
Because of the fall off in deferred revenue, we knew the revenue growth will lag bookings growth, and therefore, we guided revenue to plus or minus 2%. Our current year-over-year growth for the fourth quarter is currently expected to be in the range of 13% to 17%, bringing the full year to flat to down 2% compared to 2009. Our initial outlook on operating expense contemplated a 3% to 6% growth year-over-year. We knew that we wanted to make some incremental investments in our franchise and our people while our business was beginning to rebound. They have been able to make most of those investments while holding operating expense essentially flat or up 1% in 2010. 
For EPS, inclusive of a modest contribution from HotJobs, we have now at our expected loss on a per share basis in the range of a loss of $0.05 to $0.09. While we are pleased to have better exceeded our financial parameters during 2010, we fully expect that the profitability pay off from the investments we have been making will begin to be harvested in the quarters ahead. As we look forward, we are continuing to live in a political and macroeconomic environment, which is highly uncertain, and unemployment continues to be suddenly high. But despite those uncertainties, our business on a global basis has continued to firm throughout the year. 
Clients around the world are beginning to realize that they need to increase their staffing levels and that job churn is beginning to pick up. So our clients are working harder to retain and attract talent. At the same time, hope for profitability and liquidity has continued to improve, and companies has the budget dollars to spend if they choose to. 
Our clients are beginning to refocus on the talent gap, and Monster is ideally situated to capitalize on that trend, even in this [indiscernible] economic environment we are experiencing today. In an environment with global economies continuing to show moderate GDP growth and where unemployment rates continue to be slow to improve, we believe Monster will produce strong financial results as a primary indication for 2011, bookings, including HotJobs, are expected to grow in the 20% to 25% range year-over-year, which was on top of the 23% to 24% growth expected in 2010. 
Based on our outlook for bookings in the fourth quarter, we expect to end the year with a substantially higher deferred revenue balance, which gives us a great start for 2011.
With expected bookings growth in the range of 20% to 25%, revenue is expected to increase at a similar rate. We remain committed for longer-term operating margin potential of 25%. During 2011, we conservatively believe that at least 50% of incremental revenue will drop to the operating income line. As a reminder, operating expenses increased sequentially from Q4 into Q1. And while we expect to see that trend in Q1 2011, we currently do not anticipate as much as a sequential increase as we experienced in the first quarter of 2010. We are also currently expect to be modestly profitable in the first quarter of 2011. We will provide guidance for 2011 when we release our fourth quarter earnings. Now I'd like to turn it over to Tim for additional financial detail."

As we did last quarter, I'll be using slides to guide our conversation. Before turning to the first slide, I would like to point out that this quarter, we are breaking out the impact of HotJobs and we are updating our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year to clearly demonstrate its impact. 
Year-over-year and sequential percentage changes shown on the slides compare Monster's results excluding HotJobs. Turning to Slide 1 for Q3, pro forma income statement. Revenue was $231 million. Excluding $8 million from HotJobs, revenue was $223 million, up 4% sequentially and year-over-year. This result was at the midpoint of our guidance range. 
Operating expense was $225 million. Excluding $6 million from HotJobs, OpEx was $219 million, up 3% sequentially and 4% year-over-year. Combined revenue was negatively impacted by $4 million of currency translation while operating expenses were favorably impacted by $3 million for a net negative currency impact of $1 million on a year-over-year basis. 
Interest expense was $1.6 million. Equity loss primarily reflecting our investment in CareerOne Australia was $873,000. Net income of $2 million includes $1 million from HotJobs.
Earnings per share of $0.02 includes $0.01 per share from HotJobs. Excluding HotJobs, EPS came in at the higher end of our negative $0.02 to positive $0.02 per share guidance.
Slide 2 is our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. The larger reconciling items were $8.6 million expense on the office in general line representing costs associated with the HotJobs transaction, primarily legal and professional service fees. We continue to forecast the total of $30 million in onetime acquisition and integration costs related to HotJobs. To date, we have incurred $18 million of the $30 million and expect to have the great majority of these onetime costs behind us by the end of the fourth quarter, $1.8 million revenue adjustment representing from purchase accounting related to the acquisition. In total, pro forma adjustments were negative $7.7 million after-tax in the quarter.
Slide 3 is Q3 2010 pro forma expense trends slide. The breakdown of expenses was the following. Total salary and related expense was $119 million. Excluding $2 million from HotJobs, salary and related was up 2% in the prior quarter, reflecting an increase in stock based compensation. Marketing expense was $52 million. Excluding $3.3 million from HotJobs, marketing was up 3% sequentially as a result of higher spending in China, Germany and the U.K. and to support a higher level of revenue in IAF. 
Office and general expense was $55 million. Excluding $745,000 from HotJobs, O&G was up 4% from the prior quarter. Total headcount in the quarter was 5,792 including 207 employees from HotJobs. 
Slide 4 is bookings and revenue trend. Combined bookings increased 26%. Excluding HotJobs, Monster's bookings increased 23% compared to last year. The strength of our year-over-year bookings growth was broadly spread across our geographies and channels. Asia, the smaller absolute dollar contributor, experienced the fastest growth at 36% and was positively impacted by 4% in currency. Within Asia, Career remains our strongest contributor on a percentage growth basis with bookings up 44%. We also experienced strong bookings growth in China, 32%; and India, 30%. North America, excluding bookings from HotJobs, produced the second strongest percentage growth at 31%. Overall, we experienced strong performance from our enterprise clients, both in our field and telesales channels. We also saw strong results from staffing, e-commerce and the government channel. 
Europe region increased 17%, negatively impacted by 11% of currency translation with all major current countries experiencing bookings growth. During the third quarter, Sweden remained our largest percentage gain contributor, up 45%. Importantly, Germany's bookings continue to build momentum with an increase of 26%, joining France, Belgium, Switzerland with double-digit growth. While growth in the U.K. and the Netherlands has lagged the other European countries, business in both markets has definitely begun to pick up and we are expecting strong year-over-year growth in both markets in Q4.
Slide 5 shows the results of our operating segments. For the purpose of this discussion, I will focus on the non-GAAP results inclusive of HotJobs. 
As discussed, combined revenue on a year-over-year basis is up 7%. Within that, our combined Careers business was up 8%, with North American Careers up 15% and the International segment up 2%. 
The revenue of the International segment was negatively impacted by 5% of currency adjustment and by the fact that the economic recovery in some key markets lagged the rest of the global recovery. For example, you will recall that bookings in Germany were essentially flat in the first quarter of this year and bookings in the United Kingdom have continued to lag. These lower growth rates in bookings then flow through revenue over the next several quarters. IRS revenue was up 1%, and Sal has commented on the trends impacting that segment. 
Our combined operating margin was 2.4% during the quarter and was comprised of 19% operating margin in North America, a negative 6.4% operating margin in the International segment. The margin of the International segment is negatively impacted by the comparably later ramp up in revenue I noted above and by the fact that the segment absorbs our continuing investment in China and developing markets. As we have previously commented, we believe that both China and the developing markets represent substantial medium-term opportunities for the company. And we also believe that the International segment will produce very attractive operating margin as revenue in our more-developed markets ramps up. 
IAF had an operating margin of 5.5%. We have continued to maintain most of the cost structure to handle a significantly larger level of revenue, and we'd point out that a relatively small amount of incremental revenue has a significant impact on the operating margin of the IAF segment. 
Finally, corporate expenses were $11.6 million, representing 5% of operating margin. Corporate expenses may have some minor variability from quarter-to-quarter, but will reduce as a percentage of revenue as revenue rebounds.
Slide 6 is key balance sheet and cash flow items. And most of the significant cash flow items for the quarter were consistent with our expectation. GAAP EBITDA was $24.6 million, pro forma EBITDA was $35.6 million, a 15% EBITDA margin. Net cash provided by operations was $18.6 million compared to $11.8 million in last year's third quarter. Capital expenditures was $16.2 million. 
Deferred revenue, including HotJobs, was $313 million. Excluding HotJobs, deferred revenue was $299 million, a sequential increase of approximately $20 million from the prior quarter. We expect that deferred revenue will be significantly higher at year-end. Our net cash was $36 million and our total liquidity comprised of gross cash, and credit available was $259 million.
Summarizing the quarter, our strategy is working, our financial results are meeting or surpassing the expectations we have laid out, and this is the first quarter since Q1 of 2008 when bookings, revenue and deferred revenue all had been up on a year-over-year basis. Sal has already provided guidance for Q4 and the year for Monster on a stand-alone basis, and I will build on that guidance by adding the expected impact of HotJobs. 
As Sal noted, we are moving quickly to integrate the HotJobs segment, and going forward, it will be increasingly difficult to provide meaningful stand-alone financials. So while we fully expect to report to you on our success with the HotJobs client base, we do not intend to separately breakout its income statement starting with the fourth quarter.
Slide 7 summarizes our fourth quarter guidance. We currently expect that Monster's bookings will be up between 20% to 24%, and HotJobs will have bookings of between $18 million and $22 million. This results in a combined bookings range of $328 million to $342 million, a 27% to 32% year-over-year growth. Monster revenue will be up 13% to 17%, and HotJobs will be between $18 million and $22 million, resulting in a combined fourth quarter revenue of $258 million to $272 million, a 21% to 28% year-over-year growth. 
Combined fourth quarter earnings per share will be in the range of $0.04 to $0.08.
Slide 8 is the result in full-year guidance. We currently anticipate that bookings
[Audio Gap]
a 23% to 24% increase. Revenue excluding HotJobs will be $893 million to $903 million flat to down 2%. Including HotJobs, revenue will be $919 million to $933 million, a 1% to 3% increase. Including HotJobs, EPS for the year would be minus $0.09 to minus $0.05 range. Now I would like to turn the call back to Sal."

I think, first of all, while economies are still on a strong, as any of us would like to see them around the world, they are picking up. The momentum, clearly, in Europe, United States, North America and Asia is significantly more positive than it was a year ago. If you look at even the Monster MEI reports, you'll see that in virtually every industry, whether it be in Europe or in North America, our MEI in India shows a significant growth year-over-year, as I said, virtually across every industry. So while economies are as strong as we like them, they are gaining strength. In addition to that, I think that our investment, what we've been working on for the past several years, are really starting to take hold with our customers. While we still have work to do and by no means of stopping, I think in what we built and what customers are seeing as us providing solutions rather than just transactional support is really taking hold, and I think that's working in our favor. And I think it's taking market share away from our competitors. So I think, really, bottom line is the combination of both of the economy around the world improving, as well as the fact that Monster and its products, its service, the talent of our sales force as the investments we made in our sales forces essentially are all coming together to produce better results. And I think that it gives us confidence that those results will continue throughout 2011. Just a little bit more color on what's happening, most recently what we're seeing. A year ago, it was very hard to find customers who were planning major recruitment drives, most of which you've read in the paper and what we were seeing is the many customers who were talking about layoffs, some of them in the thousands of people. Right now, what we're starting to see is customers, that a dozen or so that I'm thinking -- that I've seen over two, three weeks, all of which are interested and are planning major recruitment campaigns in these scenarios of their business in the coming years in the field of technology in the field of -- just across-the-board in a number of industries. And the recruitment efforts that go into the thousands of people for a company. So we are encouraged by that. That's something that we have not seen in a while, certainly not on that scale, and that's just one observation or one example, if you will, of what appears to be going on out there, But I also mentioned PRS in my comments. 45% or so in the U.S., 40% in the U.K. is how resume research sell in the search area at a premium price. So customers realize the benefit of that, that service or that product brings to the table. So it's really a combination of things."

They're coming from somewhere else that they bought before. So I think that we are taking market share. And essentially for CareerBuilder, I think we're taking market share from CareerBuilder.

But given where the market, what we're seeing in the marketplace now, given the comments I just finished making with regard to the momentum we see around the world, et cetera, we feel we're going to be conservative and we feel that our estimate for increasing revenue next year in the range of 20% to 25% is certainly within the range of what we can do. I think we're going to continue to watch our expenses very closely. It's what we've always done and we will continue to do that. And we will spend some money when we feel we've earned it, but not until that time. And we intend to bring margin and profitability to our shareholders just as quickly as we can without sacrificing the future. And so I think it's hard to forecast right now, from where we sit today, to forecast when we will be at 25% margin. But having said that, we intend to get there and we intend to get there as fast as we can. And I think that's going to happen. Because of the investments we've we made, they are going to pay off now. We have a significant confidence that that's going to happen. And if we prudently watch the expenses, we'll get there. Now I hate to be negative, but if the economy should, in the middle of next year or at some point in time, take another nose dive around the world, then I think the effect on Monster will be a little bit more muted than it was this last time because of the products and the products that we plan on introducing in the coming months. But I think that it will still, obviously, have an impact. But whether it's, as Tim said, 2.5 years or whether it's in the next year and a half, it's very difficult to predict right now. But I think that we are in the right track, and I think you can do the numbers. Even if we return next year a 20% to 25% increase in revenue and only half of that, and that's a conservative number, goes to the bottom line, I think you can do the arithmetic and see there's quite a transition from where we were this year."

So that will flow through next year with no increase in headcount. The second factor is investments in China and the developing markets, which I categorize as medium-term opportunities. And what the major developing markets we're talking about, the Eastern Europe and Brazil, we are doing quite well in terms of all the metrics we watched. The results of those are improving, we'd consider to be improving into 2011, offset by, perhaps, some additional spend. But the net of all of that will be an improvement in the investment next year.

So have you seen that or is that a source of risk as you look forward? And then secondly, Sal, maybe qualitatively, can you talk a little bit about, you gave one example of the conversations you're having with clients as you try to shift them from HotJobs to kind of the combined basis. But what's been kind of the retention of that client base and the ability to bring the pricing up relative to HotJobs old pricing? Just maybe qualitatively how that's meeting your expectations post the deal?"

Its been building throughout the year and really accelerated I guess in Q2 and its continued into Q3. So we've been preparing and looking for, as business changes, as the methodology changes, as the concerns change for us to change with it and be ready to move into different forums, different client base, et cetera, in addition to our traditional ones to broaden ourselves and diversify in the education space. Overall, our education revenue has stayed relatively flat to slightly improved, and I mean very slightly, which given the term well that's been in the industry, particularly on the pool profits side, we feel very good about that. Now I understand that this coming Monday or Tuesday, the government is going to release more guidance on what's involved, what they want in terms of governance on lead generation and quality of candidate in essence. We're obviously very keen to see that and understand it. But we are really prepared and this is something we've been tackling and dealing with for the past six months, I would say, roughly. And I think on a fairly good position. We'll see what that doctor in test say and then we'll continue to maneuver around it. With regard to pricing at HotJobs et cetera, right now the discussion has been centered much more on the solution, the quality of the product mix and a full-blown solution and we haven't seen any -- most importantly, we haven't seen any significant departures of customers et cetera. And what we have seen -- and in terms of pricing, we see the Monster pricing basically continuing before stabilizing and staying stable. And for the most part, the HotJobs pricing either will improve in where we're be able to introduce a high-quality product, a model product, a different product or staying the same. So we don't see -- we're certainly not seeing a deterioration on the Monster's side or the HotJobs side. In tandem, they seem to be moving along sort of evenly, if you will. I caution, and this has always been -- its a risk in the transaction. We thought it's a risk, in all of Tim's numbers et cetera that we allowed for, and I think fairly conservatively when we enter the transaction, that there could be some breakage. But we haven't seen that yet, but it's early. It's only been two months or so now since the closing of the transaction. And so in the next months, next few quarters, we'll ultimately tell the tale. But as of right now, we don't have any serious concerns. We're watching it carefully. It's something we've been on guard for since conceptualizing the transactions, to be honest with you. But it's not something that surprise us or hurt us to this point in time."

124878,114511122,83089,"Monster Worldwide, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Monster Worldwide, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Lori. Good evening and thank you all for joining us for our third quarter conference call. During the quarter we continued to build momentum with strong bookings growth across all geographies and within our major vertical markets.My comments",2035,"Thank you, Lori. Good evening and thank you all for joining us for our third quarter conference call. During the quarter we continued to build momentum with strong bookings growth across all geographies and within our major vertical markets.
My comments will focus on Monster alone, unless otherwise noted. Tim will comment on Monster and Hotjobs in the quarter we reported. Bookings of $229 million a year-over-year increase of 23% exceeded the high end of our guidance, despite the negative currency impact, in line revenue of $223 million, in line earnings per share of $0.01; $300 million in deferred revenue, a sequential increase of $20 million.
Our ability to achieve these financial results is based on two factors. First, despite the continuing uncertainty of the global economy, there have been signs of recovery.
Second, our customers are recognizing the effectiveness of our enhanced portfolio of recruitment solutions. We believe that our global market reach combined with our value-added solutions are unrivaled in the marketplace and are fueling a strong bookings growth.
I want to talk first about our global reach, why it is so significant, and how we can be enhanced through the Yahoo! traffic deal and Hotjobs acquisition.
Next, I’ll talk about our enhanced service offering highlighting, Power Resume Search, and our Career Ad Network. And then I will discuss the performance benefits when you combine scale with the precision of our innovative products. Lastly, I will wrap-up with comments on the global economy and build us on our expected future performance.
Let me say a few words about our global reach. Including incremental traffic resulting from the Yahoo! traffic deal, more than 47 million people now visit Monster and Monster-partnered sites on a monthly basis.
In our Career Ad Network, we are able to reach approximately 117 million active and passive job seekers on a monthly basis. With HotJobs, we now have over 1,000 newspaper alliances with local presence in all 50 states.
These alliances are important to our customers as they significantly expand Monster’s local reach. Monster-owns local language sites in 56 countries and has the number one or two market share position in most of the developed markets. We have recently launched a Monster site in Brazil and are encouraged by the early results.
One of the primary objectives of the HotJob and Yahoo! transaction was to provide us additional seeker and client scale in the U.S. While we have only been operating together for a short time, the integration is going well and we are very pleased with the performance and commitments of the HotJobs team.
Tim will discuss in his comments that the financial results are consistent with our expectation. We are on track to launch the integrated Web site in the first quarter of 2011 and we are accelerating integration of our sales team, so they’ll all try and fully understand the powerful value proposition which the combination of HotJobs and Monster provide.
But scale and global reach alone are not sufficient. When that scale is combined with the precision of our 6Sense technology and our unique and customizable product solutions, we have a far superior value proposition for our clients.
I’d like to update you on two of those solutions, Power Resume Search or PRS, and Career Ad Network or CAN. In Q3, PRS accounted for approximately 45% of search license booking in North America. In the United Kingdom, PRS was available for the first full quarter and accounted for approximately 40% of the search license booking.
We recently introduced PRS in France, and while it’s been just a few weeks, there’s significant customer interest, and feedback has been positive. Our beta test in Australia is underway and we’re on track for a commercial launch early next year.
In 2011, we plan to launch PRS in additional countries around the world. As you know, we are maintaining a significant price premium over classic and we’re gratified that so many of our clients see its value. Given our results for PRS to-date, we believe it will be the predominant search tool used by our customers. None of our competitors offers a comparable product.
CAN is the industry’s largest recruitment focused ad network. It distributes our customer job advertisement across a broad array of targeted Web sites and is a very effective way of expanding our clients’ pool of active and passive seekers.
Our customers use CAN generally in conjunction with the traditional posting product find a substantial almost double increase in the views and apply. We gained incremental revenue and market share compared to simply offering a traditional job posting.
Among our major competitors, only HotJobs had a comparable product offering, and we are now able to offer clients a combined power of both Monster and Yahoo! networks. We’re executing on a global strategy by fully developing CAN in 14 of our top global markets.
As a result of the combination of unsurpassed scale and product solution offerings, we believe we offer our clients a superior return on their investments when buying from Monsters. This is beginning to be evident in our results.
On a global basis, our renewal rate and our rate of acquisition of new customers have substantially improved, and more customers are buying more of our product offerings.
In North America and Europe over the first nine months we booked business with 20,000 more clients, a 16% increase over last year. On a global basis, bookings were up 23% before HotJobs. Asia was up 36%, positively impacted by 4% of currency translation. North America was up 31%. Europe was up 17% after observing 11% negative impact from currency.
The bookings of our combined career business increased 28% and accounted for 86% of our total bookings. Bookings in our IAF business, which accounted for the remaining 14% were flat compared to last year, but up sequentially in line with prior year’s experience. The flat year-over-year trend was due largely due to reduction on spend from the armed services, who have cut the recruitment budgets.
We are very encouraged by the client’s reception for all the work we have done over the past three years, and our primary objective is to fully execute on the delivery of our value proposition for our global client base.
PRS and CAN are helping us meet the recruitment needs of our customers better than any of our competitors aware by no means finish. For example, we are continuing to develop new products based on our six sense technology. For example, our Six Sense enterprise suite is a talent management solution that enabled our customers to manage their entire resume base collected from multiple sources.
In addition to the pilot with MRA network we mentioned on our last quarterly earnings call we have had over a 100 conversations with potential customers who have expressed serious interest in the product capability, and we are working with key potential clients to refine the product. We plan to launch this product family in the second quarter of 2011.
I would now like to take a few moments to provide some historical concept. On the macro factors which have influenced our business over the past several years, and how we currently see the economy, the job market, and most importantly, Monster’s business evolving for the remainder of 2010 and 2011.
Before 2008, I would generally agree that companies were likely to take an increasing global skill shortage over the next several decades. Demographic trends such as the aging population, increasing job specialization and the impact of technology drove the belief that talent would be in increasing demand and it would be more difficult to match the right candidate to the right job, but then came the financial meltdown and the great recession.
Companies around the world trudged back. They did not replace voluntary attrition which itself slowed down because most employees who had jobs wanted to hold on to them, and old budgets, including recruiting were slashed.
Of course the combination of these factors had a direct and dramatic effect on Monster. Our bookings began to decline on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter of 2008 and bottomed at a 46% year-over-year decline in the first quarter of 2009. Starting in the third quarter of 2009 and through the middle of 2010 business began to stabilize.
During this difficult time period, we remained committed to our investment in technology and product innovation. A year ago, in October, we highlighted the economic crosscurrent and the unusually high degree of economic and business uncertainty which was affecting us and our clients. At that time, we laid out a financial framework for 2010, which was later confirmed for our annual guidance.
We are pleased that Monster is currently on track to meet or exceed that guidance. Bookings for the fourth quarter are currently expected to increase 20% to 24%, bringing year-over-year growth to 20% to 21%. This compares favorably for our bookings guidance range of 15% to 20% for the year.
Because of the falloff in deferred revenue, we knew that revenue growth will lag bookings growth, and therefore we guided revenue to plus or minus 2%. Our current year-over-year growth for the fourth quarter is currently expected to be in the range of 13% to 17%, bringing the full year to flat to down 2% compared to 2009.
Our initial outlook on operating expense contemplated a 3% to 6% growth year-over-year. We knew that we wanted to make some incremental investments in our franchise and our people while our business was beginning to rebound. We’ve been able to make most of those investments while holding operating expense essentially flat or up 1% in 2010.
For EPS, inclusive of a modest contribution from HotJobs, we have narrowed our expected loss on a per share basis in the range of a loss of $0.05 to $0.09. While we are pleased to have met or exceeded our financial parameters during 2010, we fully expect that the profitability payoff from the investments we have been making will begin to be harvested in the quarters ahead.
As we look forward, we’re continuing to live in a political and macroeconomic environment which is highly uncertain and unemployment continues to significantly high. But despite those uncertainties, our business on a global basis has continued to firm throughout the year.
Clients around the world are beginning to realize that they need to increase their staffing levels and the job churn is beginning to pick up. So our clients are working harder to retain inside talent.
At the same time, corporate profitability and liquidity has continued to improve, and companies have the budget dollars to spend if they choose to. Our clients are beginning to refocus on the talent guy. Monster is ideally situated to capitalize on that front even in this toughest economic environment we are experiencing today.
In an environment where the global economies continued to show moderate GDP growth, and where unemployment rates continued to be slow to improve we believe Monster will produce strong financial result as a primary indication for 2011 bookings, including HotJobs are expected to grow in the 20% to 25% range year-over-year, which is on top of the 23% to 24% growth expected in 2010.
Based on our outlook for bookings in the fourth quarter, we expect to end the year with a substantially higher deferred revenue balance which gives us a great start for 2011. With respect to bookings growth in the range of 20% to 25%, revenue was expected to increase at a similar rate. We remain committed for longer term operating margin percentile of 25%.
During 2011, we conservatively believe that at least 50% of incremental revenue will drop to the operating income line. As a reminder, operating expenses increased sequentially from Q4 into Q1.
While we expect to see that trend in Q1 2011, we currently do not anticipate as much as the sequential increase has we experienced in the first quarter of 2010. We also currently expect to be modestly profitable in the first quarter of 2011. We will provide guidance for 2011 when we release our fourth quarter earnings.
Now, I’d like to turn it over to Tim for additional financial detail.

As we did last quarter, I will be using slides to guide our conversation. Before turning to the first slide I would like to point out that this quarter, we are breaking out the impact of HotJobs and we are updating our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year to clearly demonstrate its impact. Year-over-year and sequential percentages changes shown on the slides compare Monster’s results, excluding HotJobs.
Turning to slide one, Q3 pro forma income statement; revenue was $231 million, excluding 8 million from HotJobs revenue was $223 million, up 4% sequentially and year-over-year. This result was at the midpoint of our guidance range.
Operating expense was $225 million, excluding $6 million from HotJobs, OpEx was $219 million, up 3% sequentially and 4% year-over-year. Combined revenue was negatively impacted by $4 million of currency translation, while operating expenses was favorably impacted by $3 million for a net negative currency impact of $1 million on a year-over-year basis.
Interest expense was $1.6 million. Equity loss primarily reflecting our investments in CareerOne of Australia was $873,000. Net income of $2 million includes $1 million from HotJobs.
Earnings per share of $0.02 includes $0.01 per share from HotJobs. Excluding HotJobs, EPS came in at the higher end of our negative $0.02 to positive $0.02 per share of guidance.
Slide #two is our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. The larger reconciling items were, $8.6 million expense on the office and general line, representing costs associated with the HotJobs transaction, primarily legal and professional service fees.
We continue to forecast a total of $30 million in one-time acquisition and integration costs related to HotJobs. To-date, we have incurred $18 million of the $30 million and expect to have the great majority of these one-time costs behind us by the end of the fourth quarter.
$1.8 million revenue adjustment representing from purchase accounting related to the acquisition. In total, pro forma adjustments were negative $7.7 million after-tax in the quarter.
Slide three is Q3, 2010 pro forma expense trends line. The breakdown of expenses was the following; total salary and related expense was $119 million. Excluding $2 million from HotJobs, salary and related was up 2% from the prior quarter reflecting an increase in stock-based compensation.
Marketing expense was $52 million. Excluding $3.3 million from HotJobs, marketing was up 3% sequentially as a result of higher spending in China, Germany and the U.K., and to support a higher level of revenue in IAF.
Office and general expense was $55 million. Excluding $745,000 from HotJobs, O&G was up 4% from the prior quarter. Total headcount in the quarter was 5,792 including 207 employees from HotJobs.
Slide #four is bookings and revenue trend. Combined bookings increased 26%, excluding HotJobs, Monster’s bookings increased 23% compared to last year. The strength of our year-over-year bookings growth was broadly spread across our geographies and channels. Asia, the smallest absolute dollar contributor experienced the fastest growth at 36%, and was positively impacted by 4% from currency.
Within Asia, Korea remains our strongest contributor on a percentage growth basis with bookings up 44%. We also experienced strong bookings growth in China, 32%, and India, 30%.
North America, excluding booking from our HotJobs, produced the second strongest percentage growth at 31%. Overall, we experienced strong performance from our enterprise clients, both in our field and telesales channels. We also saw strong results from staffing, e-commerce and the government channel.
Europe region increased 17%, negatively impacted by 11% of currency translation with all major countries experiencing bookings growth. During the third quarter, Sweden remained our largest percentage gain contributor, up 45%.
Importantly, Germany’s bookings continued to build momentum with an increase of 26%, joining France, Belgium, and Switzerland with double-digit growth. While growth in the U.K. and the Netherlands has lagged the other European countries, business in both markets has definitely begun to pick up and we are expecting strong year-over-year growth in both markets in Q4.
Slide five shows the results of our operating segments. So the purpose of this discussion, I will focus on the non-GAAP, our non-GAAP results inclusive of HotJobs. As discussed, combined revenue on a year-over-year basis is up 7%, within that our combined careers business was up 8%, with North American careers up 15%, and the International segment up 2%.
The revenue of the International segment was negatively impacted by 5% of currency adjustment and by the fact that the economic recovery in some key markets lagged the rest of the global recovery.
For example, you’ll recall that bookings in Germany were essentially flat in the first quarter of this year, and bookings in United Kingdom have continued to lag, these lower growth rates in bookings then flow through revenue over the next several quarters. IAF revenue was up 1% and Sal has commented on the trends impacting that segment.
Our combined operating margin was 2.4% during the quarter and was comprised of 19% operating margin in North America, a negative 6.4% operating margin in the International segment. The margin of the International segment is negatively impacted by the comparably later ramp up in revenue, I noted above, and by the fact that the segment observes our continuing investment in China and developing markets.
As we have previously commented, we believe both China and the developing markets represent substantial medium-term opportunities for the company, and we also believe that the International segment will produce very attractive operating margins as revenue in our more developed markets ramps up.
IAF had an operating margin of 5.5%. We have continued to maintain most of the cost structure to handle a significantly larger level of revenue and would point out that a relatively small amount of incremental revenue has a significant impact on the operating margin of the IAF segment.
Finally, corporate expenses were $11.6 million, representing 5% of operating margin. Corporate expenses may have some minor variability from quarter-to-quarter, but will reduce as a percentage of revenue as revenue rebounds.
Slide six is key balance sheet and cash flow items. Most of the significant cash flow items for the quarter were consistent with our expectation. GAAP EBITDA was $24.6 million, pro forma EBITDA was $35.6 million, at 15% EBITDA margin.
Net cash provided by operations was $18.6 million compared to $11.8 million in last year’s third quarter. Capital expenditures were $16.2 million.
Deferred revenue including HotJobs was $313 million. Excluding HotJobs deferred revenue was $299 million, a sequential increase of approximately $20 million from the prior quarter. We expected deferred revenue will be significantly higher at year end.
Our net cash was $36 million and our total liquidity comprised of gross cash and credit available was $259 million.
Summarizing the quarter, our strategy is working. Our financial results are meeting or surpassing the expectations we have laid out, and this is the first quarter since Q1 of 2008 when bookings, revenue and deferred revenue all have been up on a year-over-year basis.
Sal has already provided guidance for Q4 and the year for Monster on a standalone basis, and I would build on that guidance by adding the expected impact of HotJobs.
As Sal noted, we are moving quickly to integrate the HotJobs business, and going forward, it will be increasingly difficult to provide meaningful standalone financials. So, while we fully expect to report to you on our success with the HotJobs client base, we do not intend to separately breakout its income statement starting with the fourth quarter.
Slide seven summarizes our fourth quarter guidance. We currently expect that Monster’s bookings will be up between 20% to 24%, and HotJobs will have bookings of between $18 million and $22 million. This results in a combined booking range of $328 million to $342 million, a 27% to 32% year-over-year growth.
Monster revenue will be up 13% to 17% and HotJobs will be between $18 million and $22 million, resulting in a combined fourth quarter revenue of $258 million to $272 million and 21% to 28% year-over-year growth. Combined fourth quarter earnings per share will be in the range of $0.04 to $0.08.
Slide eight is the resultant full year guidance. We currently anticipate that bookings (inaudible) a 23% to 24% increase.
Revenue, excluding HotJobs, was $893 million to $903 million, flat to down 2%. Including HotJobs, revenue will be $919 million to $933 million, a 1% to 3% increase. Including HotJobs, EPS for the year would be minus $0.09 to minus $0.05 range.
Now, I would like to turn the call back to Sal.

So, I think really the bottom line is the combination of both, as the economy around the world improving as well as the fact that Monster and its products, its service, the talent of our sales forces, the investment we’ve made in our sales forces, et cetera all coming together to produce the results. I think that it gives us confidence that those results will continue throughout 2011. Just a little bit more color on most recently what we’re seeing. A year ago, it was very hard to find customers who were planning major recruitment drives; most of which we read in the paper and what we were seeing is many customers who were talking about laid off some of them in the thousands of people.
Right now, what we’re trying to see is there’s about half a dozen or so that I think over the past two, three weeks all of which are interested and are planning major recruitment campaigns in different areas of their business, in the coming year both in the field of technology, just across the board in the number of industries. The recruitment efforts, they are going to the thousands of people per company.
So, we are encouraged by that. That’s something that we have not seen in a while, certainly not on that scale and that’s just none observation or one example if you will of what’s appears to be going on out there. But I also mentioned PRS in my comments; 45% or so in the U.S., 40% in the U.K. is Power Resume Search sales in the search area at a premium price so the customers realize the benefit that that service or that product brings to the table. So, it’s really a combination of things. Tim, anything?

Revenue I don’t believe is a current measure of the business, because it’s really much more of a lagging indicator. I think what’s current and what’s showing the momentum of the business clearly is booking, and based on what we are seeing, the conversations in the customers office, the movement of customers; customers coming back to Monster that haven’t dealt with us in some time, the fact that we have 20,000 new customers this year versus last. Those customers are not buying for the first time in this industry. They’re coming from somewhere else that they were before.
So, I think that we are taking market share and it’s not just a Career Builders exercise. I think we’re taking market share from Career Builders. I think we are having some impact on the Dices of the world if you will. I think we’re having impacts overseas on some of our competitors there for example, StepStone in Germany and Eastern Europe for that matter. So, I think it’s really across a very broad swap. Tim?

You’re making a significant step in the direction, obviously back in the direction of significant profitability. If you extrapolated that just mathematically, you’re talking about two and a half to three years. But I’m not forecasting that in terms of exactly precisely, because we want to continue to look at the portfolio of businesses we have. But at the minimum, Sal will add to this.

But what we’re seeing in the marketplace, now given the comment, I’ve just finished making with regard to the momentum we see around the world etc., We are given to be conservative, and we feel that our estimate for increasing revenue next year in the range of 20% to 25% is certainly within the range of what we can do.
I think we’re going to continue to watch our expenses very closely as we’ve always done and we will continue to do that. We will spend some money when we feel we’ve earned it, but not until that time. We intend to bring margin and profitability to our shareholders just as quickly as we can without sacrificing the future. So, I think that it’s hard to forecast right now from where we sit today, to forecast when we will be at 25% margin.
Having said that, we intend to get there, and we intend to get there as presently as we can. And I think that’s going to happen because of the investments we’ve made, they are going to pay off now, we have a significant confidence, but that’s going to happen. If we prudently watch the expenses, we’ll get there. Now, I hate to be netting them, but if the economy should in the middle of next year or at some point in time take another notes out around the world, then I think that the effect on amounts that will be a little bit more muted than it was this last time because of the product and the products that we plan on introducing in the coming months. But I think that it will still, obviously have an impact.
As Tim said, in 2.5 years or whether it’s in the next year and a half it’s very difficult to predict right now, but I think that we are on the right track and I think you can do the numbers. Even if we return next year a 20% to 25% increase in revenue and only half of that and that’s a conservative number goes to the bottom line. I think you can do the arithmetic and see those quite a transition from where we were this year.

So, we feel that given this time of the year, we have some visibility into what to expect and we are doing our planning for next year and have some visibility and we have a business that builds momentum. Our deferred balance by the end of this year will be significantly higher than a year ago. We expect deferred to be up year-over-year, if you couldn’t hear that, what James just said is, going into this year, our deferred balance was a little under, I think $300 million, about $305 million.
This year we plan on entering 2011, approximately $100 million better than that. So, that gives us quite a bit more momentum going into 2011 than we had going into this year, and the momentum of the business as I said before really is increasing around the world, and you couple that with the product that’s been delivered and are now taking hold with the customers, the products that we’ve already seen very strong indications of interest although we haven’t introduced them yet to the market, it gives us confidence that numbers in that range are within our grasp.
Now, I hedge all of this, all right, with the fact that if there is some sort of cataclysmic event in the world, if economies around the world go in reverse, again, in a significant way, these numbers most likely will not be achievable. But given the economy we have today, given the unemployment rates that we have today that will stabilize at these levels, we firmly believe we’ll able to get to these kind of numbers.

We’re seeing more adoption in the sense of customers seeing PRS is a methodology, to some degree, it is a change in how companies do search for talent, and it’s a longer term sell. It is not a sell that in one conversation happens for the most part, okay?
So, as customers are becoming more knowledgeable and are seeing more the value of the product and the benefits that it may bring, and as they’re listening more to what’s coming down the pike in terms of future products, precision search product predicated on the 6Sense technology, the momentum and the conversation is moving less to price and more to the benefits that the technology brings to the table.
So, that’s working well for us and based on what we’re seeing now, that’s most likely going to continue. If I caught off the correctly, with regard to posting, and call it, more traditional product, we’re not seeing any significant change. Obviously an individual customer, the price may go up or go down based on volume of what they’re purchasing et cetera. But as an overall matter across the board, things are pretty much even, prices are relatively stable, and maybe in a few cases I think we’re starting see some improvement.

I can tell you that this is very occurring.
There is one example I have in mind right now there was a large staffing company transactions where there was business that have been done with that customer both from HotJobs as well as from the Monster’s side. Thankfully, the overall transaction when you added the historical HotJobs and historical Monster the new transaction was a bit higher in total, but exactly what you could attribute to HotJobs and what you could attribute to Monster really gets very vague and even we would give you numbers, it really would be meaningless.

The decline or the concern regarding the education activity is not phenomenon of Q3, it’s been building throughout the year and really accelerated, I guess, in Q2 and has continued into Q3. So we’ve been preparing and looking for as business changes, as the methodology changes, as the concerns change for us to change with it and be ready to move into different form, different client base, et cetera, in addition to our traditional ones to broaden ourselves and diversify in the education space.
Overall, our education revenue has stayed relatively flat to slightly improved and I mean, very slightly which given the turmoil that’s been in the industry, particularly on the full profits side, we feel very good about that. Now, I understand that this coming Monday or Tuesday, the government is going to release more guidance on what’s involved or what they want in terms of governance on lead generation and quality of candidate in essence.
We’re obviously very keen to see that and understand it but we are really prepared and this is something we’ve been tackling and dealing with for the past six months I would say roughly. I think I’m in a fairly good position. We’ll see what the doctor, in fact, has to say and then we’ll continue to maneuver around it.
With regard to pricing and HotJobs, et cetera, right now the discussion has been centered much more on the solution, the quality of the product mix, and a full-blown solution, and most importantly, we haven’t seen any significant departures of customers, etc., and what we have seen and in terms of pricing, the Monster pricing basically continuing, as I said, before stabilizing and staying stable, and for the most part, the HotJobs pricing either improving where we’re able to introduce higher quality products or more products, different products or staying the same.
We’re certainly not seeing a deterioration on the Monster’s side or the HotJobs side, all right. In tandem, they seem to be moving along evenly, if you will. I caution and it’s a risk in the transaction, we thought it’s a risk, and all of Tim’s numbers, et cetera, that we allowed for, okay, I think fairly conservatively, when we entered the transaction that there could be some breakage, but we haven’t seen that yet, but it’s early.
It’s only been two months or so now since the closing of the transaction, and as next month, next few quarters. As of right now, where we don’t have any serious concern. We’re watching it carefully. It’s something we’ve been on guard for since conceptualizing the transaction to be honest with you. But it’s not something that surprised us or hurt us to this point in time.

Good evening, and thank you all for joining us for our third quarter conference call.During the quarter, we continue to build momentum with strong bookings growth across all geographies and within our major vertical markets. My comments",2046,"Thank you, Lori. Good evening, and thank you all for joining us for our third quarter conference call.
During the quarter, we continue to build momentum with strong bookings growth across all geographies and within our major vertical markets. My comments will focus on Monster alone unless otherwise noted. Tim will comment on Monster and HotJobs. In the quarter we reported bookings of $229 million, a year-over-year increase of 23%, exceeded the high end of our guidance despite the negative currency impact. In-line revenue of $223 million, in-line earnings per share of $0.01. $300 million in deferred revenue, a sequential increase of $20 million. 
Our ability to achieve this financial result is based on two factors. First, despite the continuing uncertainty of the global economy, there have been signs of recovery. And second, our customers are recognizing the effectiveness of our enhanced portfolio of recruitment solutions. We believe that our global market reach, combined with our value-added solutions, are unrivaled in the marketplace and are fueling our strong bookings growth. I want to talk first about our global reach, why it is so significant and how it can be enhanced through the Yahoo! Traffic deal and HotJobs acquisition. Next, I'll talk about our enhanced service offering, highlighting power resume search and our Career Ad Network. Then I will discuss the performance benefits when you combine scale with the precision of our innovative products. Lastly, I'll wrap up with comments on the global economy and throw in some expensive future performance.
Let me say a few words about our global reach. Including incremental fabric resulting from the Yahoo! Traffic deal, more than 47 million people now visit Monster and Monster partner site on a monthly basis. Adding in our Career Ad Network, we are able to reach approximately 117 million active and passive job seekers on a monthly basis. 
With HotJobs, we now have over 1,000 newspaper alliances with local presence in all 50 states. These alliances are important to our customers as they significantly expand Monster's local reach. Monster owns global language sites in 56 countries and has the number one or two market share position in most of the developed markets. 
We have recently launched a Monster site in Brazil and are encouraged by the early results. One of the primary objectives of the HotJobs and Yahoo! transactions was to provide us additional seeker and client scale in the U.S. Though we have only been operating together for a short time, the integration is going well and we are very pleased with the performance and commitment of the HotJobs team. 
Tim will discuss in his comments that the financial results are consistent with our expectations. We are on track to launch the integrated website in the first quarter of 2011. And we are accelerating the integration of our sales team so that all clients fully understand the powerful value proposition which the combination of HotJobs and Monster provide. 
But scale and global reach alone are not sufficient. When that scale is combined with the precision of our 6Sense technology and our unique and customizable product solutions, we have a far superior value proposition for our clients. I'd like to update you on two of those solutions. Our resume search or PRS and Career Ad Network or CAN. 
In Q3, PRS accounted for approximately 45% of search license bookings in North America. In the United Kingdom, PRS was available for the first full quarter and accounted for approximately 40% of the search license bookings. 
We recently introduced PRS in France, and while it's been just a few weeks, the significant customer interest and feedback has been positive. Our beta test in Australia is underway and we are on track for a commercial launch early next year. In 2011, we plan to launch PRS in additional countries around the world. 
As you know, we are maintaining a significant price premium over classic and we are gratified that so many of our clients see its value. Given our results for PRS to date, we believe it will be the predominant search tool used by our customers. None of our competitors offers a comparable product. 
CAN is the industry's largest recruitment focus ad network. It distributes our customer job advertisements across a broad array of targeted websites in a very effective way of expanding our fine pool of active and passive seekers. Our customers who use CAN generally in conjunction with the traditional posting products, find a substantial almost double increase in their views and applies. And we find we gain incremental revenue and market share compared to simply offering a traditional job posting. 
Among our major competitors, only HotJobs had a comparable product offered and we are now able to offer our clients the combined power of both Monster and Yahoo! networks. We are executing on a global strategy by fully developing 10 in 14 of our top global markets. 
As a result of the combination of unsurpassed scale and product solution offerings, we believe we offer our clients a superior return on their investments when buying from Monster. This is beginning to be evident in our results. 
On a global basis, our renewal rates and our rate of acquisition of new customers is substantially improved and more customers are buying more of our products offered. In North America and Europe over the first nine months, we booked business with 20,000 more clients, a 16% increase over last year. 
On a global basis, bookings were up 23% before HotJobs. Asia was up 36%, positively impacted by 4% of currency translation. North America was up 31%. Europe was up 17% after absorbing 11% negative impact from currency. 
The bookings of our combined career business increased 28% and accounted for 86% of our total bookings. 
Bookings in our IAF business, which accounted for the remaining 14%, were flat compared to last year, but up sequentially in line with prior year's experience. The flat year-over-year trend was due largely to the reduction of spend from the on-services who have cut the recruitment budget. 
We are very encouraged by the clients' reception for all the work we have done over the past three years and our primary objective is to fully execute on the delivery of our value proposition to our global client base.
PRS and CAN are helping us meet the recruitment needs of our customers better than any of our competitors, but we are, by no means finished. For example, we are continuing to develop new products based on our 6Sense technology. For example, our 6Sense enterprise suite is a talent management solution that enables our customers to manage their entire resume base, selected from multiple sources. In addition to the piles with MRINetwork we mentioned on our last quarterly earnings call, we have had over 100 conversations with potential customers who have expressed serious interest in the product capability and we are working with key potential clients to refine the product. We plan to launch this product family in the second quarter of 2011.
I would now like to take a few moments to provide some historical concepts on the macro factors which have influenced our business over the past several years and how we currently see the economy, the job market, and most importantly, Monster's business evolving for the remainder of 2010 and 2011. 
Before 2008, it was generally agreed that companies were likely to face an increasing global skill shortage over the next several decades. Demographic trends such as the aging population, increasing job specialization and the impact of technology drove the belief that talents would be an increasing demand and it will be more difficult to match the right candidate to the right job. 
But then came the financial meltdown and the great recession. Companies around the world touched that. They did not replace voluntary attrition, which itself, slowed down because most employees who had jobs wanted to hold on to them. And all budgets including recruiting were flat. Of course, the combination of these factors had a direct and dramatic effect on Monster. Our bookings began to decline on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter of 2008 and bottomed at a 46% year-over-year decline in the first quarter of 2009. 
Starting in the third quarter of 2009 and through the middle of 2010 business began to stabilize. During this difficult time period we've remained committed to our investment in technology and product innovation. A year ago, in October, we highlighted the economic cross currents and the unusually high degree of economic and business uncertainty, which was affecting us and our clients. At that time, we laid out a financial framework for 2010, which was later confirmed for our annual guidance. 
We are pleased that Monster is currently on track to meet or exceed that guidance. Bookings for the fourth quarter are currently expected to increase 20% to 24% bringing year-over-year growth to 20% to 21%. This compares favorably to our bookings guidance range of 15% to 20% for the year. 
Because of the fall off in deferred revenue, we knew that revenue growth would lag bookings growth, and therefore, we guided revenue to plus or minus 2%. Our current year-over-year growth for the fourth quarter is currently expected to be in the range of 13% to 17%, bringing the full year to flat to down 2% compared to 2009. Our initial outlook on operating expense contemplated a 3% to 6% growth year-over-year. We knew that we wanted to make some incremental investments in our franchise and our people while our business was beginning to rebound. We have been able to make most of those investments while holding operating expense essentially flat or up 1% in 2010. 
For EPS, inclusive of a modest contribution from HotJobs, we have now at our expected loss on a per share basis in the range of a loss of $0.05 to $0.09. While we are pleased to have better exceeded our financial parameters during 2010, we fully expect that the profitability pay off from the investments we have been making will begin to be harvested in the quarters ahead. As we look forward, we are continuing to live in a political and macroeconomic environment which is highly uncertain, and unemployment continues to be suddenly high. But despite those uncertainties, our business on a global basis has continued to firm throughout the year. 
Clients around the world are beginning to realize that they need to increase their staffing levels and that job churn is beginning to pick up. So our clients are working harder to retain and attract talent. At the same time, hope for profitability and liquidity has continued to improve, and companies have the budget dollars to spend if they choose to. 
Our clients are beginning to refocus on the talent gap, and Monster is ideally situated to capitalize on that trend, even in this trepid economic environment we are experiencing today. In an environment with global economies continuing to show moderate GDP growth and where unemployment rates continue to be slow to improve, we believe Monster will produce strong financial results. As a primary indication for 2011, bookings, including HotJobs, are expected to grow in the 20% to 25% range year-over-year, which was on top of the 23% to 24% growth expected in 2010. 
Based on our outlook for bookings in the fourth quarter, we expect to end the year with a substantially higher deferred revenue balance, which gives us a great start for 2011.
With expected bookings growth in the range of 20% to 25%, revenue is expected to increase at a similar rate. We remain committed to longer-term operating margin potential of 25%. During 2011 we conservatively believe that at least 50% of incremental revenue will drop to the operating income line. As a reminder, operating expenses increased sequentially from Q4 into Q1. And while we expect to see that trend in Q1 2011, we currently do not anticipate as much as the sequential increase as we experienced in the first quarter of 2010. We are also currently expect to be modestly profitable in the first quarter of 2011. We will provide guidance for 2011 when we release our fourth quarter earnings. Now I'd like to turn it over to Tim for additional financial detail."

As we did last quarter, I will be using slides to guide our conversation. Before turning to the first slide, I would like to point out that this quarter, we are breaking out the impact of HotJobs and we are updating our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year to clearly demonstrate its impact. 
Year-over-year and sequential percentage changes shown on the slides compare Monster's results excluding HotJobs. Turning to Slide 1 for Q3, pro forma income statement. Revenue was $231 million. Excluding $8 million from HotJobs, revenue was $223 million, up 4% sequentially and year-over-year. This result was at the midpoint of our guidance range. 
Operating expense was $225 million. Excluding $6 million from HotJobs, OpEx was $219 million, up 3% sequentially and 4% year-over-year. Combined revenue was negatively impacted by $4 million of currency translation while operating expenses were favorably impacted by $3 million for a net negative currency impact of $1 million on a year-over-year basis. 
Interest expense was $1.6 million. Equity loss primarily reflecting our investment in CareerOne Australia was $873,000. Net income of $2 million includes $1 million from HotJobs.
Earnings per share of $0.02 includes $0.01 per share from HotJobs. Excluding HotJobs, EPS came in at the higher end of our negative $0.02 to positive $0.02 per share guidance.
Slide 2 is our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. The larger reconciling items were $8.6 million expense on the office in general line representing costs associated with the HotJobs transaction, primarily legal and professional service fees. We continue to forecast the total of $30 million in onetime acquisition and integration costs related to HotJobs. To date, we have incurred $18 million of the $30 million and expect to have the great majority of these onetime costs behind us by the end of the fourth quarter, $1.8 million revenue adjustment representing from purchase accounting related to the acquisition. In total, pro forma adjustments were negative $7.7 million after-tax in the quarter.
Slide 3 is Q3 2010 pro forma expense trends slide. The breakdown of expenses was the following. Total salary and related expense was $119 million. Excluding $2 million from HotJobs, salary and related was up 2% from the prior quarter, reflecting an increase in stock based compensation. Marketing expense was $52 million. Excluding $3.3 million from HotJobs, marketing was up 3% sequentially as a result of higher spending in China, Germany and the U.K. and to support a higher level of revenue in IAF. Office and general expense was $55 million. Excluding $745,000 from HotJobs, O&G was up 4% from the prior quarter. Total headcount in the quarter was 5,792 including 207 employees from HotJobs. 
Slide 4 is bookings and revenue trend. Combined bookings increased 26%. Excluding HotJobs, Monster's bookings increased 23% compared to last year. The strength of our year-over-year bookings growth was broadly spread across our geographies and channels. Asia, the smallest absolute dollar contributor, experienced the fastest growth at 36% and was positively impacted by 4% in currency. Within Asia, Career remains our strongest contributor on a percentage growth basis with bookings up 44%. We also experienced strong bookings growth in China, 32%; and India, 30%. North America, excluding bookings from HotJobs, produced the second strongest percentage growth at 31%. Overall, we experienced strong performance from our enterprise clients, both in our field and telesales channels. We also saw strong results from staffing, e-commerce and the government channel. 
Europe region increased 17%, negatively impacted by 11% of currency translation with all major current countries experiencing bookings growth. During the third quarter, Sweden remained our largest percentage gain contributor, up 45%. Importantly, Germany's bookings continued to build momentum with an increase of 26%, joining France, Belgium, Switzerland with double-digit growth. While growth in the U.K. and the Netherlands has lagged the other European countries, business in both markets has definitely begun to pick up and we are expecting strong year-over-year growth in both markets in Q4.
Slide 5 shows the results of our operating segments. For the purpose of this discussion, I will focus on the non-GAAP results inclusive of HotJobs. As discussed, combined revenue on a year-over-year basis is up 7%. Within that, our combined Careers business was up 8%, with North American Careers up 15% and the International segment up 2%. 
The revenue of the International segment was negatively impacted by 5% of currency adjustment and by the fact that the economic recovery in some key markets lagged the rest of the global recovery. For example, you will recall that bookings in Germany were essentially flat in the first quarter of this year and bookings in the United Kingdom have continued to lag. These lower growth rates in bookings then flow through revenue over the next several quarters. IRS revenue was up 1%, and Sal has commented on the trends impacting that segment. 
Our combined operating margin was 2.4% during the quarter and was comprised of the 19% operating margin in North America, a negative 6.4% operating margin in the International segment. The margin of the International segment is negatively impacted by the comparably later ramp up in revenue I noted above and by the fact that the segment absorbs our continuing investment in China and developing markets. As we have previously commented, we believe that both China and the developing markets represent substantial median-term opportunities for the company. And we also believe that the International segment will produce very attractive operating margins as revenue in our more-developed markets ramps up. 
IAF had an operating margin of 5.5%. We had continued to maintain most of the cost structure to handle a significantly larger level of revenue, and we point out that a relatively small amount of incremental revenue has a significant impact on the operating margin of the IAF segment. Finally, corporate expenses were $11.6 million, representing 5% of operating margin. Corporate expenses may have some minor variability from quarter-to-quarter, but will reduce as a percentage of revenue as revenue rebounds.
Slide 6 is key balance sheet and cash flow items. And most of the significant cash flow items for the quarter were consistent with our expectation. GAAP EBITDA was $24.6 million, pro forma EBITDA was $35.6 million, a 15% EBITDA margin. Net cash provided by operations was $18.6 million compared to $11.8 million in last year's third quarter. Capital expenditures was $16.2 million. 
Deferred revenue, including HotJobs, was $313 million. Excluding HotJobs, deferred revenue was $299 million, a sequential increase of approximately $20 million from the prior quarter. We expect that deferred revenue will be significantly higher at year-end. Our net cash was $36 million and our total liquidity comprised of gross cash and credit available was $259 million.
Summarizing the quarter, our strategy is working, our financial results are meeting or surpassing the expectations we have laid out, and this is the first quarter since Q1 of 2008 when bookings, revenue and deferred revenue all have been up on a year-over-year basis. Sal has already provided guidance for Q4 and the year for Monster on a stand-alone basis, and I will build on that guidance by adding the expected impact of HotJobs. 
As Sal noted, we are moving quickly to integrate the HotJobs segment, and going forward, it would be increasingly difficult to provide meaningful stand-alone financials. So while we fully expect to report to you on our success with the HotJobs client base, we do not intend to separately breakout its income statement starting with the fourth quarter.
Slide 7 summarizes our fourth quarter guidance. We currently expect that Monster's bookings will be up between 20% to 24%, and HotJobs will have bookings of between $18 million and $22 million. This results in a combined bookings range of $328 million to $342 million, a 27% to 32% year-over-year growth. Monster revenue will be up 13% to 17%, and HotJobs will be between $18 million and $22 million, resulting in a combined fourth quarter revenue of $258 million to $272 million, a 21% to 28% year-over-year growth. 
Combined fourth quarter earnings per share will be in the range of $0.04 to $0.08.
Slide 8 is the result in full-year guidance. We currently anticipate that bookings
[Audio Gap]
a 23% to 24% increase. Revenue excluding HotJobs will be $893 million to $903 million flat to down 2%. Including HotJobs, revenue will be $919 million to $933 million, a 1% to 3% increase. Including HotJobs, EPS for the year would be minus $0.09 to minus $0.05 range. Now I would like to turn the call back to Sal."

I think, first of all, while economies still aren't as strong as any of us would like to see them around the world, they are picking up. The momentum, clearly, in Europe, the United States, North America and Asia is significantly more positive than it was a year ago. If you look at even the Monster MEI reports, you'll see that in virtually every industry, whether it be in Europe or in North America, and then our MEI in India shows a significant growth year-over-year, as I said, virtually across every industry. So while economies are as strong as we like them, they are gaining strength. In addition to that, I think that our investments, what we've been working on for the past several years, are really starting to take hold with our customers. While we still have work to do and by no means of stopping, I think from what we've built and what customers are seeing as us providing solutions rather than just transactional support is really taking hold, and I think that's working in our favor. And I think it's taking market share away from our competitors. So I think, really, the bottom line is the combination of both the economy around the world improving, as well as the fact that Monster and its products, its service, the talents of our sales forces, the investments we made in our sales forces et cetera are all coming together to produce better results. And I think that it gives us confidence that those results will continue throughout 2011. 
Just a little bit more color on what's happening, most recently what we're seeing. A year ago, it was very hard to find customers who were planning major recruitment drives, most of which you've read in the paper and what we were seeing is many customers were talking about layoffs, some of them in the thousands of people. Right now, what we're starting to see is customers, there's about half a dozen or so that I think --  over the past two, three weeks, all of which are interested and are planning major recruitment campaigns in different areas of their business in the coming year in the field of technology, in the field of -- just across-the-board in a number of industries. And the recruitment efforts that go into the thousands of people per company. So we are encouraged by that. That's something that we have not seen in a while, certainly not on that scale, and that's just one observation or one example, if you will, of what appears to be going on out there. But I also mentioned PRS in my comments. 45% or so in the U.S., 40% in the U.K. is how resume search sells in the search area at a premium price. Because customers realize the benefit that, that service or that product brings to the table. So it's really a combination of things."

But given where the market, what we're seeing in the marketplace now, given the comments I just finished making with regard to the momentum we see around the world, et cetera, we feel we're going to be conservative and we feel that our estimate for increasing revenue next year in the range of 20% to 25% is certainly within the range of what we can do. I think we're going to continue to watch our expenses very closely. It's what we've always done and we will continue to do that. We will spend some money when we feel we've earned it, but not until that time. And we intend to bring margin and profitability to our shareholders just as quickly as we can without sacrificing the future.

We have a significant confidence that, that's going to happen. And if we prudently watch the expenses, we'll get there. Now I hate to be negative, but if the economy should, in the middle of next year or at some point in time, take another nose dive around the world, then I think that the effect on Monster will be a little bit more muted than it was this last time because of the products and the products that we plan on introducing in the coming months. But I think that it will still, obviously, have an impact. But whether it's, as Tim said, in 2.5 years or whether it's in the next year and a half, it's very difficult to predict right now. But I think that we are on the right track, and I think you can do the numbers. Even if we return next year a 20% to 25% increase in revenue and only half of that, and that's a conservative number, goes to the bottom line, I think you can do the arithmetic and see there's quite a transition from where we were this year."

On the high side, 5% would be HotJobs. Those numbers will stay. We just can't account for it in terms of showing how much is the contribution from one versus the other as time goes on. As the sales forces are converging and salespeople of HotJobs and salespeople of Monster are working together to present a solution, an overall solution to a customer, it gets very difficult to say how much is the HotJobs versus how much will be Monster. I can tell you that this is already occurring. As one example I have in mind right now, there was a large staffing company transaction where there was business that had been done with that customer, both from HotJobs as well as from the Monster side. Thankfully, the overall transaction when you added the historical HotJobs and historical Monster, the new transaction was a bit higher in total. But exactly what you could attribute to HotJobs and what you could attribute to Monster, really gets very vague. And even if we would give you numbers, it really would be meaningless."

Its been building throughout the year and really accelerated I guess in Q2 and its continued into Q3. So we've been preparing and looking for, as business changes, as the methodology changes, as the concerns change for us to change with it and be ready to move into different forms, different client base, et cetera, in addition to our traditional ones to broaden ourselves and diversify in the education space. Overall, our education revenue has stayed relatively flat to slightly improved, and I mean very slightly, which given the turmoil that's been in the industry, particularly on the for profits side, we feel very good about that. Now I understand that this coming Monday or Tuesday, the government is going to release more guidance on what's involved, what they want in terms of governance on lead generation and quality of candidate in essence. We're obviously very keen to see that and understand it. But we are really prepared and this is something we've been tackling and dealing with for the past six months, I would say, roughly. And I think are in a fairly good position. We'll see what the doctor in tests say and then we'll continue to maneuver around it. With regard to pricing in HotJobs et cetera, right now the discussion has been centered much more on the solution, the quality of the product mix and a full-blown solution and we haven't seen any -- most important, we haven't seen any significant departures of customers et cetera. And what we have seen,  and in terms of pricing, we see the Monster pricing basically continuing as I said before stabilizing and staying stable. And for the most part, the HotJobs pricing either we're improving where we're be able to introduce a high-quality product, a model product, a different product or staying the same. So we don't see -- we're certainly not seeing a deterioration on the Monster side or the HotJobs side. In tandem, they seem to be moving along sort of evenly, if you will. I caution, and this has always been -- it's a risk in the transaction. We thought it's a risk, in all of Tim's numbers et cetera that we allowed for, and I think fairly conservatively when we enter the transaction, that there could be some breakage. But we haven't seen that yet, but it's early. It's only been two months or so now since the closing of the transaction. And so in the next months, next few quarters, will ultimately tell the tale. But as of right now, we don't have any serious concerns. We're watching it carefully. It's something we've been on guard for since conceptualizing the transactions, to be honest with you. But it's not something that surprises or hurt us to this point in time."

124878,114511122,84013,"Monster Worldwide, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Monster Worldwide, Inc.","Executives","Thank you,, Lori. Good evening, and thank you all for joining us for our third quarter conference call.During the quarter, we continue to build momentum with strong bookings growth across all geographies and within our major vertical markets. My comment",2047,"Thank you,, Lori. Good evening, and thank you all for joining us for our third quarter conference call.
During the quarter, we continue to build momentum with strong bookings growth across all geographies and within our major vertical markets. My comments will focus on Monster alone unless otherwise noted. Tim will comment on Monster and HotJobs. In the quarter we reported bookings of $229 million, a year-over-year increase of 23%, exceeded the high end of our guidance despite the negative currency impact. In-line revenue of $223 million, in-line earnings per share of $0.01. $300 million in deferred revenue, a sequential increase of $20 million. 
Our ability to achieve this financial result is based on two factors. First, despite the continuing uncertainty of the global economy, there have been signs of recovery. And second, our customers are recognizing the effectiveness of our enhanced portfolio of recruitment solutions. We believe that our global market reach, combined with our value-added solutions, are unrivaled in the marketplace and are fueling our strong bookings growth. I want to talk first about our global reach, why it is so significant and how it can be enhanced through the Yahoo! Traffic deal and HotJobs acquisition. Next, I'll talk about our enhanced service offering, highlighting power resume search and our Career Ad Network. Then I will discuss the performance benefits when you combine scale with the precision of our innovative products. Lastly, I'll wrap up with comments on the global economy and throw in some expensive future performance.
Let me say a few words about our global reach. Including incremental fabric resulting from the Yahoo! Traffic deal, more than 47 million people now visit Monster and Monster partner site on a monthly basis. Adding in our Career Ad Network, we are able to reach approximately 117 million active and passive job seekers on a monthly basis. 
With HotJobs, we now have over 1,000 newspaper alliances with local presence in all 50 states. These alliances are important to our customers as they significantly expand Monster's local reach. Monster owns global language sites in 56 countries and has the number one or two market share position in most of the developed markets. 
We have recently launched a Monster site in Brazil and are encouraged by the early results. One of the primary objectives of the HotJobs and Yahoo! transactions was to provide us additional seeker and client scale in the U.S. Though we have only been operating together for a short time, the integration is going well and we are very pleased with the performance and commitment of the HotJobs team. 
Tim will discuss in his comments that the financial results are consistent with our expectations. We are on track to launch the integrated website in the first quarter of 2011. And we are accelerating the integration of our sales team so that all clients fully understand the powerful value proposition which the combination of HotJobs and Monster provide. 
But scale and global reach alone are not sufficient. When that scale is combined with the precision of our 6Sense technology and our unique and customizable product solutions, we have a far superior value proposition for our clients. I'd like to update you on two of those solutions. Our resume search or PRS and Career Ad Network or CAN. 
In Q3, PRS accounted for approximately 45% of search license bookings in North America. In the United Kingdom, PRS was available for the first full quarter and accounted for approximately 40% of the search license bookings. 
We recently introduced PRS in France, and while it's been just a few weeks, the significant customer interest and feedback has been positive. Our beta test in Australia is underway and we are on track for a commercial launch early next year. In 2011, we plan to launch PRS in additional countries around the world. 
As you know, we are maintaining a significant price premium over classic and we are gratified that so many of our clients see its value. Given our results for PRS to date, we believe it will be the predominant search tool used by our customers. None of our competitors offers a comparable product. 
CAN is the industry's largest recruitment focus ad network. It distributes our customer job advertisements across a broad array of targeted websites in a very effective way of expanding our fine pool of active and passive seekers. Our customers who use CAN generally in conjunction with the traditional posting products, find a substantial almost double increase in their views and applies. And we find we gain incremental revenue and market share compared to simply offering a traditional job posting. 
Among our major competitors, only HotJobs had a comparable product offered and we are now able to offer our clients the combined power of both Monster and Yahoo! networks. We are executing on a global strategy by fully developing 10 in 14 of our top global markets. 
As a result of the combination of unsurpassed scale and product solution offerings, we believe we offer our clients a superior return on their investments when buying from Monster. This is beginning to be evident in our results. 
On a global basis, our renewal rates and our rate of acquisition of new customers is substantially improved and more customers are buying more of our products offered. In North America and Europe over the first nine months, we booked business with 20,000 more clients, a 16% increase over last year. 
On a global basis, bookings were up 23% before HotJobs. Asia was up 36%, positively impacted by 4% of currency translation. North America was up 31%. Europe was up 17% after absorbing 11% negative impact from currency. 
The bookings of our combined career business increased 28% and accounted for 86% of our total bookings. 
Bookings in our IAF business, which accounted for the remaining 14%, were flat compared to last year, but up sequentially in line with prior year's experience. The flat year-over-year trend was due largely to the reduction of spend from the on-services who have cut the recruitment budget. 
We are very encouraged by the clients' reception for all the work we have done over the past three years and our primary objective is to fully execute on the delivery of our value proposition to our global client base.
PRS and CAN are helping us meet the recruitment needs of our customers better than any of our competitors, but we are, by no means finished. For example, we are continuing to develop new products based on our 6Sense technology. For example, our 6Sense enterprise suite is a talent management solution that enables our customers to manage their entire resume base, selected from multiple sources. In addition to the piles with MRINetwork we mentioned on our last quarterly earnings call, we have had over 100 conversations with potential customers who have expressed serious interest in the product capability and we are working with key potential clients to refine the product. We plan to launch this product family in the second quarter of 2011.
I would now like to take a few moments to provide some historical concepts on the macro factors which have influenced our business over the past several years and how we currently see the economy, the job market, and most importantly, Monster's business evolving for the remainder of 2010 and 2011. 
Before 2008, it was generally agreed that companies were likely to face an increasing global skill shortage over the next several decades. Demographic trends such as the aging population, increasing job specialization and the impact of technology drove the belief that talents would be an increasing demand and it will be more difficult to match the right candidate to the right job. 
But then came the financial meltdown and the great recession. Companies around the world touched that. They did not replace voluntary attrition, which itself, slowed down because most employees who had jobs wanted to hold on to them. And all budgets including recruiting were flat. Of course, the combination of these factors had a direct and dramatic effect on Monster. Our bookings began to decline on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter of 2008 and bottomed at a 46% year-over-year decline in the first quarter of 2009. 
Starting in the third quarter of 2009 and through the middle of 2010 business began to stabilize. During this difficult time period we've remained committed to our investment in technology and product innovation. A year ago, in October, we highlighted the economic cross currents and the unusually high degree of economic and business uncertainty, which was affecting us and our clients. At that time, we laid out a financial framework for 2010, which was later confirmed for our annual guidance. 
We are pleased that Monster is currently on track to meet or exceed that guidance. Bookings for the fourth quarter are currently expected to increase 20% to 24% bringing year-over-year growth to 20% to 21%. This compares favorably to our bookings guidance range of 15% to 20% for the year. 
Because of the fall off in deferred revenue, we knew that revenue growth would lag bookings growth, and therefore, we guided revenue to plus or minus 2%. Our current year-over-year growth for the fourth quarter is currently expected to be in the range of 13% to 17%, bringing the full year to flat to down 2% compared to 2009. Our initial outlook on operating expense contemplated a 3% to 6% growth year-over-year. We knew that we wanted to make some incremental investments in our franchise and our people while our business was beginning to rebound. We have been able to make most of those investments while holding operating expense essentially flat or up 1% in 2010. 
For EPS, inclusive of a modest contribution from HotJobs, we have now at our expected loss on a per share basis in the range of a loss of $0.05 to $0.09. While we are pleased to have better exceeded our financial parameters during 2010, we fully expect that the profitability pay off from the investments we have been making will begin to be harvested in the quarters ahead. As we look forward, we are continuing to live in a political and macroeconomic environment which is highly uncertain, and unemployment continues to be suddenly high. But despite those uncertainties, our business on a global basis has continued to firm throughout the year. 
Clients around the world are beginning to realize that they need to increase their staffing levels and that job churn is beginning to pick up. So our clients are working harder to retain and attract talent. At the same time, hope for profitability and liquidity has continued to improve, and companies have the budget dollars to spend if they choose to. 
Our clients are beginning to refocus on the talent gap, and Monster is ideally situated to capitalize on that trend, even in this trepid economic environment we are experiencing today. In an environment with global economies continuing to show moderate GDP growth and where unemployment rates continue to be slow to improve, we believe Monster will produce strong financial results. As a primary indication for 2011, bookings, including HotJobs, are expected to grow in the 20% to 25% range year-over-year, which was on top of the 23% to 24% growth expected in 2010. 
Based on our outlook for bookings in the fourth quarter, we expect to end the year with a substantially higher deferred revenue balance, which gives us a great start for 2011.
With expected bookings growth in the range of 20% to 25%, revenue is expected to increase at a similar rate. We remain committed to longer-term operating margin potential of 25%. During 2011 we conservatively believe that at least 50% of incremental revenue will drop to the operating income line. As a reminder, operating expenses increased sequentially from Q4 into Q1. And while we expect to see that trend in Q1 2011, we currently do not anticipate as much as the sequential increase as we experienced in the first quarter of 2010. We are also currently expect to be modestly profitable in the first quarter of 2011. We will provide guidance for 2011 when we release our fourth quarter earnings. Now I'd like to turn it over to Tim for additional financial detail."

As we did last quarter, I will be using slides to guide our conversation. Before turning to the first slide, I would like to point out that this quarter, we are breaking out the impact of HotJobs and we are updating our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year to clearly demonstrate its impact. 
Year-over-year and sequential percentage changes shown on the slides compare Monster's results excluding HotJobs. Turning to Slide 1 for Q3, pro forma income statement. Revenue was $231 million. Excluding $8 million from HotJobs, revenue was $223 million, up 4% sequentially and year-over-year. This result was at the midpoint of our guidance range. 
Operating expense was $225 million. Excluding $6 million from HotJobs, OpEx was $219 million, up 3% sequentially and 4% year-over-year. Combined revenue was negatively impacted by $4 million of currency translation while operating expenses were favorably impacted by $3 million for a net negative currency impact of $1 million on a year-over-year basis. 
Interest expense was $1.6 million. Equity loss primarily reflecting our investment in CareerOne Australia was $873,000. Net income of $2 million includes $1 million from HotJobs.
Earnings per share of $0.02 includes $0.01 per share from HotJobs. Excluding HotJobs, EPS came in at the higher end of our negative $0.02 to positive $0.02 per share guidance.
Slide 2 is our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. The larger reconciling items were $8.6 million expense on the office in general line representing costs associated with the HotJobs transaction, primarily legal and professional service fees. We continue to forecast the total of $30 million in onetime acquisition and integration costs related to HotJobs. To date, we have incurred $18 million of the $30 million and expect to have the great majority of these onetime costs behind us by the end of the fourth quarter, $1.8 million revenue adjustment representing from purchase accounting related to the acquisition. In total, pro forma adjustments were negative $7.7 million after-tax in the quarter.
Slide 3 is Q3 2010 pro forma expense trends slide. The breakdown of expenses was the following. Total salary and related expense was $119 million. Excluding $2 million from HotJobs, salary and related was up 2% from the prior quarter, reflecting an increase in stock based compensation. Marketing expense was $52 million. Excluding $3.3 million from HotJobs, marketing was up 3% sequentially as a result of higher spending in China, Germany and the U.K. and to support a higher level of revenue in IAF. Office and general expense was $55 million. Excluding $745,000 from HotJobs, O&G was up 4% from the prior quarter. Total headcount in the quarter was 5,792 including 207 employees from HotJobs. 
Slide 4 is bookings and revenue trend. Combined bookings increased 26%. Excluding HotJobs, Monster's bookings increased 23% compared to last year. The strength of our year-over-year bookings growth was broadly spread across our geographies and channels. Asia, the smallest absolute dollar contributor, experienced the fastest growth at 36% and was positively impacted by 4% in currency. Within Asia, Career remains our strongest contributor on a percentage growth basis with bookings up 44%. We also experienced strong bookings growth in China, 32%; and India, 30%. North America, excluding bookings from HotJobs, produced the second strongest percentage growth at 31%. Overall, we experienced strong performance from our enterprise clients, both in our field and telesales channels. We also saw strong results from staffing, e-commerce and the government channel. 
Europe region increased 17%, negatively impacted by 11% of currency translation with all major current countries experiencing bookings growth. During the third quarter, Sweden remained our largest percentage gain contributor, up 45%. Importantly, Germany's bookings continued to build momentum with an increase of 26%, joining France, Belgium, Switzerland with double-digit growth. While growth in the U.K. and the Netherlands has lagged the other European countries, business in both markets has definitely begun to pick up and we are expecting strong year-over-year growth in both markets in Q4.
Slide 5 shows the results of our operating segments. For the purpose of this discussion, I will focus on the non-GAAP results inclusive of HotJobs. As discussed, combined revenue on a year-over-year basis is up 7%. Within that, our combined Careers business was up 8%, with North American Careers up 15% and the International segment up 2%. 
The revenue of the International segment was negatively impacted by 5% of currency adjustment and by the fact that the economic recovery in some key markets lagged the rest of the global recovery. For example, you will recall that bookings in Germany were essentially flat in the first quarter of this year and bookings in the United Kingdom have continued to lag. These lower growth rates in bookings then flow through revenue over the next several quarters. IRS revenue was up 1%, and Sal has commented on the trends impacting that segment. 
Our combined operating margin was 2.4% during the quarter and was comprised of the 19% operating margin in North America, a negative 6.4% operating margin in the International segment. The margin of the International segment is negatively impacted by the comparably later ramp up in revenue I noted above and by the fact that the segment absorbs our continuing investment in China and developing markets. As we have previously commented, we believe that both China and the developing markets represent substantial median-term opportunities for the company. And we also believe that the International segment will produce very attractive operating margins as revenue in our more-developed markets ramps up. 
IAF had an operating margin of 5.5%. We had continued to maintain most of the cost structure to handle a significantly larger level of revenue, and we point out that a relatively small amount of incremental revenue has a significant impact on the operating margin of the IAF segment. Finally, corporate expenses were $11.6 million, representing 5% of operating margin. Corporate expenses may have some minor variability from quarter-to-quarter, but will reduce as a percentage of revenue as revenue rebounds.
Slide 6 is key balance sheet and cash flow items. And most of the significant cash flow items for the quarter were consistent with our expectation. GAAP EBITDA was $24.6 million, pro forma EBITDA was $35.6 million, a 15% EBITDA margin. Net cash provided by operations was $18.6 million compared to $11.8 million in last year's third quarter. Capital expenditures was $16.2 million. 
Deferred revenue, including HotJobs, was $313 million. Excluding HotJobs, deferred revenue was $299 million, a sequential increase of approximately $20 million from the prior quarter. We expect that deferred revenue will be significantly higher at year-end. Our net cash was $36 million and our total liquidity comprised of gross cash and credit available was $259 million.
Summarizing the quarter, our strategy is working, our financial results are meeting or surpassing the expectations we have laid out, and this is the first quarter since Q1 of 2008 when bookings, revenue and deferred revenue all have been up on a year-over-year basis. Sal has already provided guidance for Q4 and the year for Monster on a stand-alone basis, and I will build on that guidance by adding the expected impact of HotJobs. 
As Sal noted, we are moving quickly to integrate the HotJobs segment, and going forward, it would be increasingly difficult to provide meaningful stand-alone financials. So while we fully expect to report to you on our success with the HotJobs client base, we do not intend to separately breakout its income statement starting with the fourth quarter.
Slide 7 summarizes our fourth quarter guidance. We currently expect that Monster's bookings will be up between 20% to 24%, and HotJobs will have bookings of between $18 million and $22 million. This results in a combined bookings range of $328 million to $342 million, a 27% to 32% year-over-year growth. Monster revenue will be up 13% to 17%, and HotJobs will be between $18 million and $22 million, resulting in a combined fourth quarter revenue of $258 million to $272 million, a 21% to 28% year-over-year growth. 
Combined fourth quarter earnings per share will be in the range of $0.04 to $0.08.
Slide 8 is the result in full-year guidance. We currently anticipate that bookings
[Audio Gap]
a 23% to 24% increase. Revenue excluding HotJobs will be $893 million to $903 million flat to down 2%. Including HotJobs, revenue will be $919 million to $933 million, a 1% to 3% increase. Including HotJobs, EPS for the year would be minus $0.09 to minus $0.05 range. Now I would like to turn the call back to Sal."

I think, first of all, while economies still aren't as strong as any of us would like to see them around the world, they are picking up. The momentum, clearly, in Europe, the United States, North America and Asia is significantly more positive than it was a year ago. If you look at even the Monster MEI reports, you'll see that in virtually every industry, whether it be in Europe or in North America, and then our MEI in India shows a significant growth year-over-year, as I said, virtually across every industry. So while economies are as strong as we like them, they are gaining strength. In addition to that, I think that our investments, what we've been working on for the past several years, are really starting to take hold with our customers. While we still have work to do and by no means of stopping, I think from what we've built and what customers are seeing as us providing solutions rather than just transactional support is really taking hold, and I think that's working in our favor. And I think it's taking market share away from our competitors. So I think, really, the bottom line is the combination of both the economy around the world improving, as well as the fact that Monster and its products, its service, the talents of our sales forces, the investments we made in our sales forces et cetera are all coming together to produce better results. And I think that it gives us confidence that those results will continue throughout 2011. 
Just a little bit more color on what's happening, most recently what we're seeing. A year ago, it was very hard to find customers who were planning major recruitment drives, most of which you've read in the paper and what we were seeing is many customers were talking about layoffs, some of them in the thousands of people. Right now, what we're starting to see is customers, there's about half a dozen or so that I think --  over the past two, three weeks, all of which are interested and are planning major recruitment campaigns in different areas of their business in the coming year in the field of technology, in the field of -- just across-the-board in a number of industries. And the recruitment efforts that go into the thousands of people per company. So we are encouraged by that. That's something that we have not seen in a while, certainly not on that scale, and that's just one observation or one example, if you will, of what appears to be going on out there. But I also mentioned PRS in my comments. 45% or so in the U.S., 40% in the U.K. is how resume search sells in the search area at a premium price. Because customers realize the benefit that, that service or that product brings to the table. So it's really a combination of things."

I think what's current and what's showing the momentum of the business, clearly, is bookings. And based on what we're seeing, the conversations in the customer's office, the movement of customers, customers coming back to Monster that haven't dealt with us in sometime, the fact that we have 20,000 new customers this year versus last. Those customers are not buying for the first time in this industry. They're coming from somewhere else that they bought before. So I think that we are taking market share. And it’s not just a CareerBuilder excise, I think we're taking market share from CareerBuilder. I think we're having some impact on the Dices of the world, if you will. I think we're having impact overseas on some of our competitors there, for example, Stepstone in Germany and Eastern Europe for that matter. So I think it really cuts a very broad swap."

But given where the market, what we're seeing in the marketplace now, given the comments I just finished making with regard to the momentum we see around the world, et cetera, we feel we're going to be conservative and we feel that our estimate for increasing revenue next year in the range of 20% to 25% is certainly within the range of what we can do. I think we're going to continue to watch our expenses very closely. It's what we've always done and we will continue to do that. We will spend some money when we feel we've earned it, but not until that time. And we intend to bring margin and profitability to our shareholders just as quickly as we can without sacrificing the future. And so I think that it's hard to forecast right now, from where we sit today, to forecast when we will be at a 25% margin. But having said that, we intend to get there and we intend to get there as fast as we can. And I think that's going to happen. Because of the investments we've made, they are going to pay off now. We have a significant confidence that, that's going to happen. And if we prudently watch the expenses, we'll get there. Now I hate to be negative, but if the economy should, in the middle of next year or at some point in time, take another nose dive around the world, then I think that the effect on Monster will be a little bit more muted than it was this last time because of the products and the products that we plan on introducing in the coming months. But I think that it will still, obviously, have an impact. But whether it's, as Tim said, in 2.5 years or whether it's in the next year and a half, it's very difficult to predict right now. But I think that we are on the right track, and I think you can do the numbers. Even if we return next year a 20% to 25% increase in revenue and only half of that, and that's a conservative number, goes to the bottom line, I think you can do the arithmetic and see there's quite a transition from where we were this year."

And you couple that with the products that has been delivered and are now are talking hold with the customers, the products that we've already seen very strong indications of interest, although we haven't introduced them yet to the market. It gives us confidence that numbers in that range are within our grasp. Now I hedge all of them with the fact that if there is some sort of product loose make event in the world, if economies around the world go in reverse again in a significant way, these numbers most likely will not be achievable.

And that pricing stability, as I indicated in my comment, is holding. We're seeing more adoption in the sense of customers seeing that -- PRS is a methodology. To some degree, it is a change in how companies do search for some talents and it's a longer-term sale. It is not a sale that in one conversation happens for the most part.

I can tell you that this is already occurring. As one example I have in mind right now, there was a large staffing company transaction where there was business that had been done with that customer, both from HotJobs as well as from the Monster side. Thankfully, the overall transaction when you added the historical HotJobs and historical Monster, the new transaction was a bit higher in total.

So we've been preparing and looking for, as business changes, as the methodology changes, as the concerns change for us to change with it and be ready to move into different forms, different client base, et cetera, in addition to our traditional ones to broaden ourselves and diversify in the education space. Overall, our education revenue has stayed relatively flat to slightly improved, and I mean very slightly, which given the turmoil that's been in the industry, particularly on the for profits side, we feel very good about that. Now I understand that this coming Monday or Tuesday, the government is going to release more guidance on what's involved, what they want in terms of governance on lead generation and quality of candidate in essence. We're obviously very keen to see that and understand it. But we are really prepared and this is something we've been tackling and dealing with for the past six months, I would say, roughly. And I think are in a fairly good position. We'll see what the doctor in tests say and then we'll continue to maneuver around it. With regard to pricing in HotJobs et cetera, right now the discussion has been centered much more on the solution, the quality of the product mix and a full-blown solution and we haven't seen any -- most important, we haven't seen any significant departures of customers et cetera. And what we have seen,  and in terms of pricing, we see the Monster pricing basically continuing as I said before stabilizing and staying stable. And for the most part, the HotJobs pricing either we're improving where we're be able to introduce a high-quality product, a model product, a different product or staying the same. So we don't see -- we're certainly not seeing a deterioration on the Monster side or the HotJobs side. In tandem, they seem to be moving along sort of evenly, if you will. I caution, and this has always been -- its a risk in the transaction. We thought it's a risk, in all of Tim's numbers et cetera that we allowed for, and I think fairly conservatively when we enter the transaction, that there could be some breakage. But we haven't seen that yet, but it's early. It's only been two months or so now since the closing of the transaction. And so in the next months, next few quarters, will ultimately tell the tale. But as of right now, we don't have any serious concerns. We're watching it carefully. It's something we've been on guard for since conceptualizing the transactions, to be honest with you.
