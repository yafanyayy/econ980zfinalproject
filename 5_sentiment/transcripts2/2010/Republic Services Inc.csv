Welcome everyone and thank you for joining us this afternoon. This is Jim O’Connor and I’d like to welcome everyone to Republic Services fourth quarter conference call.Don Slager, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Tod Holmes",594,"Good afternoon. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining us this afternoon. This is Jim O’Connor and I’d like to welcome everyone to Republic Services fourth quarter conference call.
Don Slager, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Tod Holmes, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ed Lang, our Treasurer are joining me as we discuss our fourth quarter performance.
I’d like to take a moment to remind everyone that some of the information that we discuss on today’s call contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties and maybe materially different from actual results. Our SEC filings discuss factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.
Additionally, the material we discuss today is time-sensitive. If in the future, you listen to a rebroadcast or a recording of this conference call, you should be sensitive to the date of the original call, which is February 11, 2010. Please note that this call is the property of Republic Services Incorporated. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Republic Services is strictly prohibited.
I’m pleased to report that we exceeded our original guidance for earnings per share, free cash flow, merger synergies and EBITDA margins. This solid performance was achieved during the significant economic downturn and the integration of two large solid waste companies.
We believe we are well positioned for strong results in 2010 due to our pricing discipline, cost controls, realization of merger synergies and our commitment to improve return on investor capital.
Let me give you some of financial highlights for the full year. Revenue, $8.2 billion; net income adjusted for merger related and debt refinancing expenses, $565 million or $1.48 per share. Full year EBITDA margins were 30.6%, this strong performance highlights the ability of our field organization to maintain pricing discipline and implement cost controls, while working through the integration process.
Core price for the full year was 3%. We continue to use our return on investment pricing tool to be sure all business activity meets our requirements. Volumes declined at 9.5% in 2009 due to the weak economic conditions particularly in construction business.
Full year adjusted free cash flow was $746 million or $1.96 per share, which is 132% of adjusted book earnings. Again, free cash flow is the best measurement of the quality of earnings. Our Board has approved $0.19 per share dividend payable April 15th, 2010.
During the fourth quarter, we issued $600 million of 12 year notes with a coupon of 5.25% and called approximately $1.1 billion of existing debt. This debt called was retired with the 12 year note issuance, bank borrowing and cash. Total debt reduction in 2009 was $740 million. We continue to look at liability management opportunities to realize future reductions in interest expense.
Also want to provide some information on our integration. During 2009, our integration schedule and subsequent financial savings ran ahead of plan. Target of $150 million is one year ahead of schedule. We expect run rate synergies achieved by the end of 2010 to be $165 million to $175 million. Our management team will continue to identify further margin improvement opportunities going into 2011.
We realized $115 million of those synergies that I just mentioned. During 2009, we expect to realize $40 to $45 million of additional synergies during 2010. Our field organization under Don’s leadership has far exceeded expectations regarding the amount and the timeliness of the synergies achieved. 
So now I’d like to have Don Slager, our President and Chief Operating Officer talk to those achievements.

I’d like to highlight a number of our achievements in the integration process. First, in our overlap markets which represent approximately 1/3rd of our revenue base, we have eliminated 70 routes through our optimization tools used to enhance labor productivity. We have redirected approximately 13,000 tons of waste per day within our transfer station and landfill network. All divisions are utilizing the same billing and operating system which is wile to driving further productivity initiatives. 
Looking at information technology, which is key to our long-term success, many of our large scale conversions are behind us. Our detailed planning efforts completed in 2008 provided the foundation for solid execution. In Q4, we moved all human resource and payroll systems to a single platform, which was fully operational for the first payroll in January, 2010. 
Additionally, we converted 63% of our divisions to a common billing and operating system. As I’ve said, we’ve completed 100% in overlap markets. We expect to finish the remaining conversions by the end of Q3, 2010. Over 70, 000 hours of training has been delivered to enhance the capability of our people. We will continue to make this investment and training to extract the value from the systems and processes implemented. 
I also want to comment on the overall performance of operations in 2009. We have some outstanding successes especially in the area of safety and productivity. Our accident and injury frequency decreased again in 2009 with 30% fewer claims in the previous year. Collection productivity improved despite a decrease in route density due to the weaker economy.
We’ve continued our progress toward automated collection in our residential business. In 2009, we converted more than 200 routes to automated collection service and plan to convert an additional 200 routes in 2010. By the end of 2010 we expect our residential system to be approximately 50% automated. 
I’d like to thank all of our field management and various integration teams for their ongoing efforts to achieve the most successful merger in the solid waste industry, while maintaining a focus on excellent customer service. 
I will now turn the call the over to Tod, for a recap of our forth quarter financial performance.

Fourth quarter 2009 revenue as reported rose by 61% to $2 billion from $1.240 billion last year, this increase of $755 million relates primarily to the merger with Allied on December 5 of last year.
Since we are measuring the performance of the operations on a combined company basis, the remainder of my comments assume the companies merged on January 1, 2008, therefore the prior year combined company financials data is included and can be reference in my comments, it’s particularly found on our website.
On a combined company basis there was a year-over-year decline in Q4 internal growth of 8.7% now this consists of core pricing growth of a positive 2.5%. Again, this quarter we see core pricing improvements in all line of business including collection at a positive 3%, industrial pricing of 2.7% was less than other lines of business, however, because temporary work had price increases less than average.
The total landfill price of 1.1% includes MSW landfill pricing of 3.1%, which is consistent with prior quarters. This however was partially offset by relatively flat construction and demolition pricing and lower special waste type event price work.
Price increases to our index based customers were pressured by lower CPI, which is simply a function of contractual terms. And again, approximately 50% of our revenue are tied to index-based pricing. Price increases to other customers remained strong, this will be the non-indexed based 50% of our customer base and again consistent with prior quarters. 
Commodity revenue increased by about 0.07%. We saw commodity prices up 37% to an average of $130 per ton in the current quarter from $75 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2008. Q4 MERS commodity volume of 421,000 tons reflects a 2% decrease from the prior year. And also Q4 average price increased $8 a ton from $95 in the third quarter of 2009 with prices actually ending the month of December higher than the average for the quarter.
Our fuel recovery fee actually decreased 2.2%, the reduction in fuel recovery fees relates to a decrease in fuel cost, the average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.74 in the fourth quarter from $2.97 in the fourth quarter of 2008 or approximately 8% low. Current fuel prices are very to close to that at $2.78 per gallon. 
Our volumes were down 9.7%. This also includes a decline of 100 basis points from the impact of hurricane Ike in the prior year. So excluding hurricane Ike, the volume loss was actually 8.7%, which is a sequential improvement of about 140 basis points, a little over 10% volume loss in the third quarter, so little bit better than the third quarter.
Residential and commercial volumes experienced low-to-mid single digit declines. Volume loss was most significant again in the industrial and landfill lines of our business, which experienced mid teen year-over-year volume declines, both reflection of the weak economy and also some weather related issues across the countries late in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Now let me turn to our fourth quarter year-over-year margins. Similar to internal growth, I will discuss fourth quarter year-over-year margins as if the companies had merged on January 1, 2008. Let me again remind you that we’ve posted this combined financial data on our website.
Fourth quarter 2009 EBITDA margin, excluding divestiture loss, restructuring charges, and cost to achieve synergies and remediation charges was 29.4% in the fourth quarter of ’09 compared to a combined margin of 26% in the prior year. This represents an improvement of 340 basis points.
In the fourth quarter of 2008, we had included the results of the DOJ divestitures that generally carried higher margins in the company average because of the concentration of landfills and commercial collection assets that had to be sold. The impact of these divestitures resulted in a year-over-year decrease in EBITDA margin of approximately 30 basis points.
Now, let me talk about some of the more significant changes in cost as a percentage of revenue. First fuel, fuel expense improved 10 basis points primarily due to an 8% decrease in the cost of fuel as I mentioned earlier. Again, average diesel prices decreased to $2.74 in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $2.97 in the fourth quarter of 2008. And again current prices are fairly close to the fourth quarter ’09 of $2.78 a gallon.
More than offsetting the decrease in the fuel cost was a decrease in related fuel recovery fee revenue resulting in a net decrease in EBITDA margin of 100 basis points. And I would remind everybody that those recoveries to use lag by one month either going down or going up.
Second, cost of good sold, the 20 basis point increase in expense relates to increases in rebased to customers for volume deliver to our MERS. Cost of goods sold at our MERS increased approximately 10% to an average of $27 a ton for about $24 a ton in the prior year.
Commodity revenue (inaudible) more than offset this increase in cost resulting in an increase spread of approximately $26 per ton. The net impact was a favorable 40 basis point improvement on EBITDA margin.
Third, labor. The 10 basis point improvement in margin relates to a 70 basis point benefit from finalizing actuarial assumptions associated with new the combined health and welfare plans and this is partially offset by cost increasing as a percentage revenue in the post collection business. Again, we merged both of our health plans mid-year in 2009. Labor is relatively fixed in the post production line of business and does not decrease proportionately with volumes. 
Fourth, disposal expense. Disposal expense decreased in absolute dollars, but increased by 50 basis points as a percentage of revenue. These variable cost decreases in the collection business as volumes declined, but we are impacted by changes in the post collection business whether relatively fixed. Therefore, as post collection revenues decrease as result of volume loss, these costs increased as a percentage of total revenue. 
Next transportation and subcontract expense, the 140 basis point improvements in margin results from four factors. First, synergy related cost reductions from redirecting waste streams to our more efficient disposal network; second, internalizing national accounts collection work that was historically subcontracted before the merger. Third, impact of volume mix depending on changes in volume in the business; and then fourth would be lower fuel surcharges.
Finally, let me talk about SG&A. The 250 basis point improvement in margin for SG&A relates to the following. 170 basis point increase primarily associated with one-time items in Q4 2008 including conforming bad debt policies of $19.6 million and then also a year-over-year reduction and legal settlements of about $14.6 million.
Additionally, there were favorable actuarial adjustments to our health and welfare benefits in the current year of about $4.4 million. And again we combined both plans on July 1st and then ended up in the later part of the year getting a better track record of combined experience and then actuarial rate base on that combined experience. The second SG&A item is 60 basis points increase realized from synergy related headcount and overhead reductions as a result of the merger.
Let me bring it all together here, again 340 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion and it can be summarized as follows. First, the impact of the divestitures was a negative 30 basis points. Second, the net fuel impact was a negative 100 basis points. Third, the net commodity was a positive 40 basis points. Fourth, the actuarial adjustments to health and welfare plans, and that’s both in the direct LIBOR as well as in SG&A, was a positive 90 basis points.
Fifth, the impact of conforming bad debt policies in the prior year and the change in legal adjustments in the prior year was a positive 150 basis points. Sixth, the realization of synergies a positive 140 basis points; and finally, seventh, and this is really a part of our business. Price increases and cost controls partially offset by fixed cost and lower volumes, we had a positive 50 basis points there really in the core of our business. 
Depreciation and amortization and accretion increased by 130 basis points also year-over-year, of this increase 90 basis points relates to increased non-cash expenses associated with purchase accounting valuations of Allied assets and liabilities and connection with the merger.
Again we had to put a substantial amount of value, which was formally in goodwill and not amortized into landfill our space to be amortized. The remaining 40 basis point variants relates to this fixed cost relative to lower revenue.
Let me talk briefly about our interest expense. The company recorded non-cash interest expense of $41 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. This arises primarily from amortization on Allied debt that was reported that a significant discount. We also recorded a $102 million loss or $0.17 per share related to premiums paid and non-cash write-offs of discounts and fees associated with the recently completed note refinancing in tender. And again these refinancing have a very quick pay back, probably in the range of two to three years. So we’re advantage of this favorable interest rate environment. 
Now I’ll turn the call over to our Treasure, Ed Lang to further discuss financing initiatives. Ed?

During the fourth quarter we continue to execute our liability management strategies by calling approximately $1.1 billion of existing debt that would have been repaid over the next four years. We used cash investments, a new 12 year note for $600 million at a coupon of 5.25% and bank borrowings to retire the call debt. As Todd mentioned, this high coupon debt, because this was high coupon debt that that was called the average cash payback period is less than two years.
The public has three benefits from this refinancing effort. First lower cash interest expense; second, extinguishment of the debt discount associated with these maturities, as you member the debt discount was a result of the purchase accounting required at merger close; and third, extending debt maturities.
The negative impact of the cash premium and the extinguishment of a discount was $0.17 of EPS. The 2010 EPS benefit of this refinancing is approximately $0.07 of EPS. Republic issued another call of debt maturing in 2014 earlier this week for planning purposes we have assumed that we can refinance this debt at existing rates and included this positive $0.01 EPS impact in our guidance.
There will be one-time costs of approximately $52 million or $0.08 of EPS to retire this maturity. Of this charge only $9 million relates to cash premiums paid and $43 million relates to a non-cash write-off of the debt discount. We will continue to take advantage of other liability management opportunities since credit markets remain attractive. 
In 2010, we expect total interest expense to be in a range of $500 million to $550 million with non-cash interest of approximately $100 million. This excludes any premiums paid or discounts written-off in connection with early extinguishments.
I will now discuss free cash flow. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $746 million which consisted of cash provided by operating activities of $1.4 billion less property and equipment received of $862 million plus proceeds from the sale of property of $32 million plus merger related expenditures net of tax of $75 million plus divestiture related tax payments of $105 million and this equals the adjusted free cash flow of $746 million.
We defined adjusted free cash flow based on CapEx received during the period. We have included a reconciliation of the timing difference between CapEx received versus paid on page 13 of our 8-K filings.
Now I’ll talk about our balance sheet. At December 31, our accounts receivable balance was $865.1 million and our days sales outstanding was 39 or 24 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $7 billion at December 31. During 2009, total debt was reduced by $740 million and excess credit availability under our bank facility is approximately $800 million.
Now, I’ll turn the call back to, Jim.

During 2010, we will be focused on the same performance metrics in order to deliver higher return on invested capital and improve margin performance. 2010 financial guidance, which is based on economic conditions and commodity values remain consistent with levels exiting the fourth quarter of 2009.
Our financial guidance then for 2010, we anticipate that our full year adjusted EPS will be in a range $1.63 to $1.67. We expect internal price growth to be 2% to 2.5% and volume declines of 3% to 4%. Our pricing is impacted by the lower CPI statistics since approximately 50% our revenue is index priced. Some of our contracts use a trailing 12 month average to reset pricing, others use a single month-over-month to reset. We do expect commodity prices to be positive this year. 
Our adjusted cash flow guidance is $700 to $725 million. This guidance assumes determination of bonus depreciation expense. If bonus depreciation is extended into 2010, adjusted free cash low would be $750 to $775 million.
Our planned capital received is $775 million. Anticipated full year EITDA margin is 31% before integration cost. We expect to achieve 165 to $175 million dollar of run rate merger synergies by year end and anticipate further opportunities in 2011. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 42%.
Now before going to Q&A, I’d like to comment on the exceptional performance of our entire organization. Don and I have recently concluded the annual planning process. And we were impressed with our fuels organization’s ability to adjust to the merger integration process and the economic environment.
We identified opportunities to further expand margins over the next two to three years including opportunities and procurement national accounts and lot optimization. We’ll build on everything we’ve learned during the past year and take advantage of the revenue growth opportunities and the operating leverage that exist in our business when the economy recovers.
Our success and working as a single team as allowed us to execute the most successful integration solid waste industry. Our detailed planning efforts laid the ground work for the only large waste industry integration that is delivered shareholder value and exceeded its synergy guidance both in terms of financial performance and the timing of completion. 
As we look back in 2009 it was a very challenging year due to the historically weak economy, the public team overcame the weak business environment successfully integrated two large companies and are now on track to achieve record financial performance in the coming year. I'm confident in the operating leverage that exists in our broad business platform and look forward to continued improvement in 2010. 
So with that operator I’d like to open the call for questions.

We’re looking at something that’s in the high 7s basically. And that assumes that the IREX bonus depreciation again for corporate America which is in the budget proposal that was presented. Somewhere as Jim has stated in that $750 million to $775 million range. Which means then you consider about $300 million for dividend that today’s rate, we’ve got something like 450 to 475 to be available to pay down debt and also available at some point to buyback stock.
Now, I think we’ve always said that we’re looking for debt-to-EBITDA coverage somewhere in the range of 2.5 times. And as we approach that we’ll be proactive and talking with credit rating agencies about cash utilization strategy, because dividends increase maybe a component although certainly we are above the S&P 500 right now.

I think the company’s view is we will pay down the debt, we need to continue to move towards this 2.5 times range, see how the year is moving and talk to the credit rating agencies to make sure they feel comfortable with our strategy. But certainly given the valuation, share repurchase is something that we fell is attractive in future.

The first half of last year fuel prices were very low. So that's a little bit of a negative. So when we look at it, you got kind of those rollover effects of those negative items and then there is two positive components, one is the synergy that you spoke to Jonathan, maybe it's 40 or 50 basis points of benefit some of which is we’re securing intent and some of which is a positive rollover from ’09.

Welcome everyone and thank you for joining us this afternoon. This is Jim O’Connor and I’d like to welcome everyone to Republic Services first quarter conference call.
Don Slager, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Tod Holmes, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ed Lang, our Treasurer are joining me as we discuss our first quarter performance.
I’d like to take a moment to remind everyone that some of the information that we discuss on today’s call contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties and may be materially different from actual results. Our SEC filings discuss factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.
Additionally, the material we discuss today is time-sensitive. If in the future, you listen to a rebroadcast or a recording of this conference call, you should be sensitive to the date of the original call, which is April 29, 2010. Please note that this call is the property of Republic Services Incorporated. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Republic Services is strictly prohibited.
I’m pleased to report that we have a strong start in 2010.  We’re on track to perform at the upper end of our EPS guidance and we’ve started to see positive signs in our industrial permanent and landfill business.  Don will give you some details on these volume increases later in the call.
We believe we are well positioned for positive results in 2010 due to our pricing discipline, cost controls, realization of merger synergies, and our commitment to improve return on invested capital.
The financial highlights for the first quarter are revenue of approximately $2 billion.  Net income adjusted primarily for merger related and debt refinancing expenses was $158 million or $0.41 per share.  Adjusted EBITA margins were 31.7%.  This record performance highlights the ability of our field organization to maintain pricing discipline and a cost competitive structure while working through the integration process.
We also saw significant improvement in our risk costs which is a result of our focus on safety.  Core price increase for the first quarter was 2.2%.  We continue to use our return on investment pricing tools to be sure all business activity meets our requirements.
Volumes declined approximately 6.2% after accounting for weather conditions which was better than our expectations.  We also benefited from strong pricing for recycled paper, particularly OCC which had an average price of $145 per ton in the quarter.  Currently OCC is selling for approximately $135 per ton.
Adjusted free cash flow was $245 million or $0.64 per share which is 156% of adjusted book earnings.  Remember, free cash flow is the best measure of the quality of earnings.  Our board has approved also a dividend of $0.19 per share payable July 15, 2010.  During the first quarter Republic issued $1.5 billion of debt which Ed Lang, our Treasurer, will talk to later in the call.
As a result of the refinancing activity completed in 2009 and 2010 we have achieved total financing synergies of approximately $30 million.  Therefore, we are increasing our synergy guidance to $185 million to $190 million.
Don Slager, our President and Chief Operating Officer, has been leading Republic through the integration and cost savings process and has far exceeded expectations both in the amount and the timeliness of the synergies achieved.  So now I’d like to turn the call over to Don.

We exited the first quarter with annual run rate synergies of $180 million.  This includes $150 million from operating and SG&A savings and $30 million from debt refinancing.  We continue to outperform against our original goal of $150 million in annual run rate synergies.
Throughout the integration process, additional opportunities have been identified which create value for our shareholders.  The senior management team recently developed plans for these post-integration business initiatives which fall into two broad categories.  First, profitable growth and second, operational effectiveness.  The opportunities in profitable growth include enhancements to our pricing systems and tools, our sales support systems and sales reporting, customer service and call centers, and national accounts management capability.
The opportunities within operational effectiveness includes benefits from disposal optimization, repair and maintenance systems and processes, data dashboards and decision support tools for our field managers, and ePro which is our electronic procurement system.   
We are investing $8 million this year in these initiatives.  We expect to realize and additional $40 million to $60 million in annual run rate earnings from these efforts by 2013. We recently had our first corporate wide management conference that included 500 leaders from throughout the organization. We used this meeting to discuss and to reinforce five priorities for 2010 which include:
First, safety.  Our number one priority is to offer a safe, respectful, and rewarding workplace for our employees.  We have continued our strong performance regarding claim frequency in 2010 and have started to see this multi year improvement reflected in our self insurance reserves.
Second, customer experience.  All of our marketing and service efforts have a single focus:  putting the customer first.  We will continue to improve our service quality and service offerings to be sure we are exceeding our customers’ expectations.
Third, targeted profitable growth.  We are using our return on investment models to analyze our marketplaces in order to get the full value of our national business platform, including our disposal network.  We continue to maintain our pricing discipline as we grow our business.  As a result, we will have significant operating leverage as the economy recovers.
Fourth, integration and synergy capture.  Our ability to integrate our business platform and extract significant cost savings has exceeded our expectations by approximately 25%.  We will complete the final phase of the integration this fall.
Fifth is something we call durability.  We are utilizing innovative management tools and practices in our field operations to achieve and maintain a high performance level. We have made extra effort during the integration process to validate that our training programs and support systems stand up to our high standards over time.
Our [key one] margin performance validates that our cost savings have been sustained. As we demonstrate continued success around these five priorities, we will create higher returns on capital and improved free cash flow performance.  As Jim mentioned, Republic achieved a record EBITDA margin of 31.7% in the quarter.
Finally, we are beginning to see improved volume in our cyclical revenue streams.  We are seeing the improvement across the country and from different industries, particularly in permanent industrial and landfill volumes.  Some examples of this increase in business activity are the following:
Petro chemical facilities along the Texas coast, automotive industry and RV manufacturers in the Midwest, steel manufacturers in the east and Midwest, and special waste projects in the west.
The business activity is encouraging and we’ll have a clearer picture for you during our mid-year guidance.  I’d like to thank our entire field area and region management teams for their commitment to our success.  We’ve had a great quarter. 
I will now turn the call over to Tod for a recap of the first quarter financial performance.

While we don’t provide specific quarterly financial guidance, with the recent completion of our debt refinancing that Ed will discuss later, we feel very comfortable with the upper end of our full year guidance range of $1.63 to $1.67 earnings per share.  
As is the practice in the past, we will provide updated complete guidance during our second quarter conference call in July.  Now let’s turn to the first quarter.  First quarter 2010 revenue was $1.960 billion as compared to $2.06 billion last year, a decrease of about 5%.
We divested of some operations in 2009 and that contributed to a 2.3% decline of that 5%. The remaining 2.7% decrease on a same store basis consists of the following factors:  first, core price growth of 2.2% and again this is within our guidance range.  We continue to see core price improvements in all of our collection lines of business.  This approximates 2.8% for the collection lines taken as a whole.  The MSW landfill business had positive pricing of 2.1%; however, this was partially offset by mix coming from relatively lower C&D and special waste event driven work.  Therefore, the net landfill price was positive 0.3%.
Core pricing again is in line with our expectations as we are seeing the impact of the lower price resets to our index based customer, which is simply a function of contractual terms. As we’ve mentioned in the past, approximately 50% of our revenues are tied to indexed based pricing.
Price increases for our non-indexed base customers remain strong and are relatively consistent with prior quarters.  Commodity revenue is a strong positive for the quarter.  Commodity revenue increased 1.8%.  Commodity prices increased approximately 98% to an average of $125 per ton in the current year from $63 a ton in the first quarter of the prior year.  
First quarter material recovery commodity volume of 422,000 tons reflects a 2% decrease from the prior year.  First quarter average price increase $27 per ton from $98 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2009 so a substantial year-over-year and also sequential improvement.  We are seeing our average commodity price decrease currently by about $17 per ton from March to April and this is driven primarily by a reduction in OCC prices of about $34 a ton.  
Our fuel recovery fee was an increase of 0.3% in revenue.  This increase relates to an increase in fuel costs. What we are seeing is the average price per gallon of diesel increase to $2.85 in the first quarter of 2010 from $2.19 in the prior year and $2.74 in the fourth quarter.  As I mentioned, our current fuel prices are slightly higher at $3.07 per gallon.
Volumes were down 7%.  This is a sequential improvement from fourth quarter 2009 of about 270 basis points.  You might recall that quarter was 9.7%.  The year-over-year change of 7% includes a 40 basis point decrease due to Hurricane Ike volumes in the prior year and then the adverse impact of weather in the first couple months of this quarter of 30 to 40 basis points
We saw a mid single digit decline in collection business, volume loss was in the low double digit range for industrial, driven primarily by the temporary business.  We’re starting to see an uptick of volumes in our permanent manufacturing customers as Don had indicated. The sequential increase in permanent hauls is consistent with pre-2009 changes in seasonality.
Additionally, the average weights of our industrial customers increased by about 3% compared to the prior year, again an indicator of increased customer activity.  Now our temporary business continues to be slow due to relatively low levels of construction activity and certainly the severe weather experienced in many of our markets earlier in the quarter may have had an impact.
Our landfill volumes declined by 8%.  Again, this was a substantial improvement over the first quarter of 2009 when those volumes were off 16%.  The trend continues to improve.  In the month of March special waste volume showed year-over-year of growth for the first time since the third quarter of 2008.
While it’s still too early to determine whether we’re seeing a sustained improvement in economically sensitive volumes, we’re monitoring volumes closely and will provide additional information in July as part of our mid-year guidance update.
Let’s talk briefly about our margins.  First quarter year-over-year margins for 2010 excluding divestiture losses, restructuring costs, and cost to achieve synergies was 31.7% compared to 30.4% in the prior year, an improvement of 30 basis points.  Excluding the impact of DOJ divestitures that generally carried a higher margin than the company average because of the concentration in landfill and small container collection business, the EBITDA margins actually improved by 40 basis points.
Let me comment on the significant changes in cost as a percentage of revenue and I would like to remind everyone that detail of our margin and our cost of operations by cost category are available on our website and will be included in our 10-Q filing.  First fuel.  Fuel expense increased 110 basis points due primarily to a 30% increase in the cost of diesel.  Again, the average price per gallon increased to $2.85 in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $2.19 in the first quarter of the prior year and as I mentioned earlier, current prices are $3.07 a gallon so we can expect a little more headwind from fuel.
Partially offsetting this increase in fuel cost was an increase in related fuel recovery fees resulting in a net decrease of EBITDA margin associated with fuel of 70 basis points.  Second, let’s talk about recycling cost of goods sold.  The 60 basis point increase in expense relates to increases and rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our murfs.  Cost of goods sold at our murfs increased to an average of almost $38 per ton from approximately $17 a ton in the prior year.  
Commodity revenue increases more than offset this increase in cost, thus resulting in an increased spread on commodities of approximately $41 per ton.  This is a net favorable impact of 80 basis points improvement in EBITDA margin for the quarter and again as Jim talked about commodity pricing we would expect to see this favorable benefit going forward.
Third, labor and related benefits.  The 20 basis point improvement in margin relates primarily to synergy related staff reductions due to [inaudible] consolidations and overlapped markets and an overall improvement in collection productivity.  
Fourth, maintenance and repairs.  There is a 70 basis point improvement in margin related to synergy related costs reductions and the timing of our fleet replacement plan.  2010 truck deliveries are more evenly weighted throughout the year, resulting in reduced fleet maintenance costs.
Fifth, transportation and subcontracts expenses.  We saw a 20 basis point improvement in margin, again resulting from synergy related cost reductions arising from redirected waste streams to our more efficient disposal network. 
Next, risk management.  A substantial improvement here.  There was a 100 basis point improvement in margin related to reductions in required reserves, and this again, as Don had indicated, is due to improved claims frequency rates, favorable claims development, and the realization of synergy related cost savings for third party premiums and surety costs.  I might mention we do an actuarial report this quarter and this may be a little bit lumpy but certainly we’re in a positive trend here. 
Finally, SG&A.  There’s a 20 basis point increase in expense and this primarily relates to an increase in cost associated with some legal matters partially offset by synergy related reductions in headcount and non-headcount cost, including travel professional fees, and facility costs.
Our Q1 2010 SG&A cost as a percentage of revenue excluding costs to achieve synergies approximated 10.2% compared to 10% in the prior year.  Looking forward, we believe that SG&A cost in the 10% range is appropriate.  These changes comprise the majority of the year-over-year margin improvement in EBITDA.  Let me briefly talk about tour DD&A which declined 50 basis points and that relates to a reduction in landfill amortization expense.
Expansions in permanent modifications were approved which extended the life and reduced cost at certain landfills, resulting in a favorable reduction in the per ton rate we charge our air space consumed.  DD&A as a percentage of revenue approximated 11.4%. 
Finally, our interest expense.  The company recorded non-cash interest expense of a little over $28 million in the first quarter of 2010.  This arises primarily from the amortization of Allied debt which as you will recall was recorded at a significant discount at the time of the merger.  During the quarter we also recorded a $132 million loss or $0.22 per share related to premiums paid in non-cash write offs of discounts and fees associated with the recently completed note refinancing and tender of $1.5 billion.
I’d like to take the opportunity to remind everyone of the impact the merger had on book earnings.  In purchase accounting, we were required in December of 2008 to re-value Allied’s fixed assets, intangible assets, environmental liabilities, and debt. AS a result, our DD&A as a percentage of revenue is 11.4% which is higher than both companies on a pre-merger basis and certainly higher than the industry average, but again, it’s not cash.
In addition, our non-cash interest expense for the quarter as I mentioned earlier was approximately $28 million.  As Jim mentioned earlier, cash flow is really the best measure of the quality of earnings and our adjusted free cash flow was $245 million or $0.64 per share, substantially above our book earnings.
Now I'll turn the call over to Ed to further discuss our financing initiatives.

During the first quarter we issued $850 million of 10 year debt at a 5% coupon and $650 million of 30 year debt at 6.2%.  With the financing proceeds of $1.5 billion, we called $1.025 of existing notes with an average interest rate of 6.8% that matures in 2014 and 2015.  We repaid a $300 million account with [Seawoof] Financing and we also repaid some of our existing bank debt.  
The positive impact from this refinancing was included in the high end of our 2010 earnings guidance provided in February.  Our 2010 interest expense guidance was $500 million to $515 million.  We are now at the lower end of this range.  We continue to look at additional debt refinancing opportunities which may further reduce interest expense.  
Now I’ll discuss free cash flow.  In the first quarter adjusted free cash was $245 million which consisted of 1) cash provided by operating activities of $299 million less property and equipment received of $128 million plus proceeds from the sale of property of $6 million plus merger related expenditures net of tax of $8 million plus legacy tax settlement related to BFI of $60 million.  This equals adjusted free cash of $254 million.
We define adjusted free cash flow based on capital expenditures received during the period.  We have included a reconciliation of the timing difference between capital expenditures received versus paid in our 8-K filing.  We remain comfortable with our adjusted cash flow guidance of $700 million to $725 million for the full year.
Now I’ll discuss our balance sheet.  At March 31, our accounts receivable balance was $851 million and our days sales outstanding was 40 days or 24 days net of deferred revenue.  Reported debt was approximately $7.1 billion at March 31.  During the quarter the principal amount of debt remained essentially flat while the reported amount of debt increased approximately $100 million due to the writeoff of debt discounts.
Excess credit availability under our bank facility is approximately $900 million.  Now I’ll turn the call back to Jim.

As we discussed we are increasing our year end weight for synergy guidance to $185 million to $190 million.  We are starting to see some positive signs in the cyclical revenue streams, particularly permanent industrial and landfill volumes.  We continue to achieve expected price increases and our volume performance in the first quarter was at the higher end of our expectations.  The fact that we are achieving record EBITDA margins in a business environment that has not fully recovered is a strong statement regarding the operating leverage that resides in our business platform. 
We have achieved significant financing synergies and have restructured our balance sheet that ensures a low cost of capital structure for the next 10 years.  Our focus continues on increasing shareholder value and that remains intact by this quarter’s results.  During the next two board meetings, we will review our cash utilization strategy regarding dividend payout and share repurchase while maintaining our conservative financial profile.

On the manufacturing side, we’re seeing in the Midwest, specifically Detroit and Indiana, also in the Mid-Atlantic states, so we’re seeing it kind of come back in the way that it left so it’s a good sign.  We’ve seen a little bit of seasonality but we’re also seeing some real what I would almost call a structural change in some of the manufacturing going from adding second shifts and producing additional loads.  It’s a good sign and we know in the manufacturing business that shows up pretty quickly in our waste volume so we’re happy to see it.

But service increases and decreases in the commercial system really tend to lag the economic changes.  So, you know, when we first saw the economy start to hurt, we saw service increases start to slow, and then we saw service decreases start to rise, and service increases stop altogether, so now we’ve seen service decreases really start to flatten out and stop.  We don’t really have any net change in that, but we are seeing - we have not yet seen the service increases return.  A little complicated maybe, but we’re waiting for it and we’re looking for it, and if the manufacturing continues to stay up, and some of these other segments start to come back, we should in due time see those increases come back to the commercial system.

Run rate by the time we get done with that is going to be, you know, maybe 180 basis points run rate by the time we get done with that is going to be maybe 100 basis points or so, so keep those two components in mind when we talk about synergies and margins.
I think it’s also important to recognize that we will start to be getting some incremental benefit from these strategic initiatives that Don talked to in his comments in 2011.  We’ll get more in 2012, and we’ll get the balance and the run rate in 2013.  So again, I think there’s a lot more value attraction from the cost side of the business.  Again, it’s a function of how much the field organization can absorb and how many initiatives they can effectively manage, and produce value for our shareholders. So again, when you really look at it, I think all along we said there was more than $150 million when I was saying $185 million to $190 million and we’ve now identified another $40 million to $60 million that we’ll start to extract over the next 2.5 years.

I’d like to take a moment to remind everyone that some of the information that we discuss on today’s call contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties and may be materially different from actual results. Our SEC filings discuss factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. 
Additionally, the material that we discuss today is time-sensitive. If in the future, you listen to a rebroadcast or a recording of this conference call, you should be sensitive to the date of the original call, which is April 29, 2010. Please note that this call is the property of Republic Services, Inc. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Republic Services is strictly prohibited.
I'm pleased to report that we had a strong start in 2010. We're on track to perform at the upper end of our EPS guidance, and we've started to see positive signs in our Industrial Permanent and Landfill business. Don will give you some details on these volume increases later in the call.
We believe we are well positioned for positive results in 2010 due to our pricing discipline, cost controls, realization of merger synergies and our commitment to improve return on invested capital. The financial highlights for the first quarter are revenue of approximately $2 billion; net income, adjusted primarily for merger-related and debt refinancing expenses, was $158 million or $0.41 per share; adjusted EBITDA margins were 31.7%. This record performance highlights the ability of our field organization to maintain pricing discipline in a cost-competitive structure, while working through the integration process. We also saw a significant improvement in our risk costs, which is a result of our focus on safety.
Core price increase for the first quarter was 2.2%. We continue to use our return on investment pricing tools to be sure all business activity meets our requirements. Volumes declined approximately 6.2% after accounting for weather conditions, which was better than our expectations. We also benefited from strong pricing from recycled paper, particularly OCC [old corrugated containers], which had an average price of $145 per ton in the quarter. Currently, OCC is selling for approximately $135 a ton.
Adjusted free cash flow was $245 million or $0.64 per share, which is 156% of adjusted book earnings. Remember, free cash flow is the best measure of the quality of earnings. 
Our board has approved also a dividend of $0.19 per share, payable July 15, 2010. During the first quarter, Republic issued $1.5 billion of debt, which Ed Lang, our Treasurer, will talk to later in the call.
As a result of the refinancing activity completed in 2009 and 2010, we have achieved total financing synergies of approximately $30 million. Therefore, we are increasing our synergy guidance to $185 million to $190 million. 
Don Slager, our President and Chief Operating Officer, has been leading Republic through the integration and cost savings process and has far exceeded expectations, both in the amount and the timeliness of the synergies achieved. So now I'd like to turn the call over to Don."

We exited the first quarter with annual run rate synergies of $180 million. This includes $150 million from operating and SG&A savings and $30 million from debt refinancing. We continue to outperform against our original goal of $150 million in annual run rate synergies. 
Throughout the integration process, additional opportunities have been identified, which create value for our shareholders. The senior management team recently developed plans for these post-integration business initiatives, which fall into two broad categories: first, profitable growth; and second, operational effectiveness. 
The opportunities in profitable growth include enhancements to our pricing systems and tools, our sales support systems and sales reporting, customer service and call centers and national accounts management capability. The opportunities within operational effectiveness includes benefits from disposal optimization, repair and maintenance systems and processes, data dashboards and decision support tools for our field managers and ePro, which is our electronic procurement system (sic) [electronic purchasing system].
We are investing $8 million this year in these initiatives. We expect to realize an additional $40 million to $60 million in annual run rate earnings from these efforts by 2013. 
We recently had our first corporate-wide management conference that included 500 leaders from throughout the organization. We used this meeting to discuss and to reinforce five priorities for 2010 which include, first, safety. Our number one priority is to offer a safe, respectful and rewarding workplace for our employees. We have continued our strong performance regarding claim frequency in 2010, and have started to see this multiyear improvement reflected in our self-insurance reserves. 
Second, customer experience. All of our marketing and service efforts have a single focus, putting the customer first. We will continue to improve our service quality and service offerings to be sure we are exceeding our customers' expectations. 
Third, targeted profitable growth. We are using our return-on-investment models to analyze our marketplaces in order to get the full value of our national business platform, including our disposal network. We continue to maintain our pricing discipline as we grow our business. As a result, we will have significant operating leverage as the economy recovers. 
Fourth, integration and synergy capture. Our ability to integrate our business platform and extract significant cost savings has exceeded our expectations by approximately 25%. We will complete the final phase of the integration this fall. 
Fifth is something we call durability. We are utilizing innovative management tools and practices in our field operations to achieve and maintain a high-performance level. We have made extra effort during the integration process to validate that our training programs and support systems stand up to our high standards over time.
Our Q1 margin performance validates that our cost savings have been sustained. As we demonstrate continued success around these five priorities, we will create higher returns on capital and improve free cash flow performance. As Jim mentioned, Republic achieved a record EBITDA margin of 31.7% in the quarter. 
And finally, we are beginning to see improved volume in our cyclical revenue streams. We are seeing the improvement across the country and from different industries, particularly in permanent, industrial and landfill volumes. Some examples of this increase in business activity are the following, petrochemical facilities along the Texas coast, automotive industry and RV manufacturers in the Midwest, steel manufacturers in the East and Midwest and special waste projects in the West.
The business activity is encouraging, and we'll have a clear picture for you during our midyear guidance. I'd like to thank our entire field, area and region management teams for their commitment to our success. We've had a great quarter. I will now turn the call over to Tod for a recap of the first quarter financial performance."

Before I review the financial details for the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to reaffirm our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year. While we don't provide specific quarterly financial guidance, with the recent completion of our debt refinancings that Ed will discuss later, we feel very comfortable with the upper end of our full year guidance range of $1.63 to $1.67 earnings per share. As is the practice in the past, we will provide updated complete guidance during our second quarter conference call in July.
Now let's turn to the first quarter. First quarter 2010 revenue was $1,960,000,000 as compared to $2.06 billion last year, a decrease of about 5%. We divested off some operations in 2009, and that contributed to 2.3% decline of that 5%. The remaining 2.7% decrease on a same-store basis consist of the following factors, first, core price growth of 2.2%. And again, this is within our guidance range. 
We continue to see core price improvements in all of our collection lines of business. This approximates 2.8% for the collection lines taken as a whole. The MSW [Municipal Solid Waste] Landfill business had positive pricing of 2.1%. However, this was partially offset by mix coming from relatively lower C&D [construction and demolition] and special waste event-driven work. Therefore, the net landfill price was positive 0.3%. 
Core pricing again is in line with our expectations, as we are seeing the impact of the lower price resets to our index-based customers, which is simply a function of contractual terms. As we mentioned in the past, approximately 50% of our revenues are tied to index-based pricing. Price increases for our non-indexed-based customers remain strong, and are relatively consistent with prior quarters. 
Now commodity revenue is a strong positive for the quarter. Commodity revenue increased 1.8%. Commodity prices increased approximately 98% to an average of $125 per ton in the current year, from $63 a ton in the first quarter of the prior year. First quarter material recovery commodity volume of 422,000 tons reflects a 2% decrease from the prior year. First quarter average price increased $27 per ton from $98 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2009, so substantial year-over-year and also a sequential improvement. We are seeing our average commodity price decrease currently by about $17 a ton from March to April, and this is driven primarily by a reduction in OCC prices of about $33 a ton.
Our fuel recovery fee was an increase of 0.3% in revenue. This increase relates to an increase in fuel cost. What we're seeing is the average price per gallon of diesel increased to $2.85 in the first quarter of 2010, from $2.19 in the prior year and $2.74 in the fourth quarter. And I might mention, our current fuel prices are slightly higher at $3.07 a gallon.
Volumes were down 7%. This is a sequential improvement from fourth quarter 2009 of about 270 basis points. You might recall that quarter was 9.7%. The year-over-year change of 7% includes a 40-basis-point decrease due to Hurricane Ike volumes in the prior year, and then the adverse impact of weather in the first couple of months of this quarter of 30 to 40 basis points.
We saw a mid single-digit decline in Collection business. Volume losses was in the low double-digit range for industrial, driven primarily by the Temporary business. We're starting to see an uptick of volumes in our permanent manufacturing customers, as Don had indicated. The sequential increase in permanent hauls is consistent with pre-2009 changes in seasonality. 
Additionally, the average rates of our industrial customers increased by about 3% compared to the prior year, again an indicator of increased customer activity. Now our Temporary business continues to be slow due to relatively low levels of construction activity and certainly, the severe weather experienced in many of our markets earlier in the quarter may have had an impact. 
Our landfill volumes, they declined by 8%. Again, this was a substantial improvement over the first quarter of 2009 when those volumes were off 16%, and the trend continues to improve. In the month of March, special waste volume showed year-over-year growth for the first time since the third quarter of 2008.
While it's still too early to determine whether we're seeing a sustained improvement in economically sensitive volumes, we're monitoring volumes closely.  And we'll provide additional information in July, as part of our midyear guidance update.
Now let's talk briefly about our margins. First quarter year-over-year margins for 2010, excluding divestiture losses, restructuring costs and cost-to-achieve synergies was 31.7% compared to 30.4% in the prior year, an improvement of 30 basis points. Excluding the impact of DOJ [U.S. Department of Justice] divestitures that generally carried a higher margin than the company average because of the concentration in Landfill and Small Container Collection business, the EBITDA margins actually improved by 40 basis points. 
Let me comment on the significant changes in cost as a percentage of revenue. And I would like to remind everyone that detail of our margin and our cost of operations by cost category are available on our website, and will be included in our 10-Q filing. 
First, fuel. Fuel expense increased 110 basis points due primarily to a 30% increase in the cost of diesel. Again, the average price per gallon increased to $2.85 in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $2.19 in the first quarter of the prior year. And as I've mentioned earlier, current price is at $3.07 a gallon, so we can expect a little more headwind from fuel. Partially offsetting this increase in fuel cost was an increase in related fuel recovery fees, resulting in a net decrease of EBITDA margin associated with fuel of 70 basis points. 
Second, let's talk about recycling cost of goods sold. The 60-basis-point increase in expense relates to increases in rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our MRFs [materials recovery facilities]. Cost of goods sold at our MRFs increased to an average of almost $38 a ton or approximately $17 a ton in the prior year. Commodity revenue increases more than offset this increase in cost and thus, resulting in an increased spread on commodities of approximately $41 per ton. This is a net favorable impact of 80 basis points improvement in EBITDA margin for the quarter. And again, as Jim talked about commodity pricing, we would expect to see this favorable benefit going forward.
Third, labor and related benefits. The 20-basis-point improvement in margin relates primarily to synergy-related staffing reductions, due to wealth consolidations in overlapped markets and an overall improvement in collection productivity. 
Fourth, maintenance and repairs. There is a 70-basis-point improvement in margin related to synergy-related costs reductions and the timing of our fleet replacement plan. 2010 truck deliveries are more evenly weighted throughout the year, resulting in reduced fleet maintenance costs. 
Fifth, transportation and subcontract expenses. We saw a 20-basis-point improvement in margin, again resulting from synergy-related cost reductions arising from redirected waste streams to our more efficient disposal network.
Next, risk management, a substantial improvement here. There was a 100-basis-point improvement in margin related to reductions in required reserves. And this again, as Don had indicated, is due to improved claims frequency rates, favorable claims development and the realization of synergy-related cost savings for third party premiums and surety costs. I might mention we do an actuarial report each quarter and this maybe a little bit lumpy, but certainly we're in a positive trend here.
Finally, SG&A. There is 20-basis-point increase in expense. And this primarily relates to an increase in costs associated with some legal matters, partially offset by synergy-related reductions in headcount and non-headcount costs, including travel, professional fees and facility costs. Our Q1 2010 SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue, excluding cost to achieve synergies, approximated  10.2% compared to 10% in the prior year. Looking forward, we believe that SG&A costs in the 10% range is appropriate. These changes comprise a majority of the year-over-year margin improvement in EBITDA. 
Now let me briefly talk about our DD&A, which declined 50 basis points, and that relates to a reduction in landfill amortization expense. Expansions and permanent modifications were approved, which extended the life and reduced costs at certain landfills, resulting in a favorable reduction in the per-ton rate we charge our airspace consumed. DD&A as a percentage of revenue approximated 11.4%. 
Finally, our interest expense. The company recorded noncash interest expense of a little over $28 million in the first quarter of 2010. And this arises primarily from the amortization of Allied debt which, as you will recall, was recorded as a significant discount at the time of the merger. During the quarter, we also recorded $132 million loss or $0.22 per share related to premiums paid in noncash write-offs of discounts and fees associated with the recently completed note refinancing and tender of $1.5 billion. 
I'd like to take an opportunity to remind everyone of the impact the merger had on book earnings. In purchase accounting, we were required in December of 2008 to revalue Allied's fixed assets, intangible assets, environmental liabilities and debt. As a result, our DD&A as a percentage of revenue is 11.4%, which is higher than both companies on a pre-merger basis and certainly higher than the industry average. But again, it's not cash. 
In addition, our noncash interest expense for the quarter, as I mentioned earlier, was approximately $28 million. As Jim mentioned earlier, cash flow is really the best measure of the quality of earnings. And our adjusted free cash flow was $245 million or $0.64 per share, substantially above our book earnings. Now I'll turn the call over to Ed to further discuss our financing initiatives."

First, talking about liability management. During the first quarter, we issued $850 million of 10-year debt at a 5% coupon and $650 million of 30-year debt at 6.2%. With the financing proceeds of $1.5 billion, we called a $1,025,000,000 of ex",345,"Thanks, Tod. First, talking about liability management. During the first quarter, we issued $850 million of 10-year debt at a 5% coupon and $650 million of 30-year debt at 6.2%. With the financing proceeds of $1.5 billion, we called a $1,025,000,000 of existing notes with an average interest rate of 6.8% that matured in 2014 and 2015. We repaid a $300 million account receivable financing, and we also repaid some of our existing bank debt. 
The positive impact from this refinancing was included in the high end of our 2010 earnings guidance provided in February. Our 2010 interest expense guidance was $500 million to $515 million. We are now at the lower end of this range. We continue to look at additional debt refinancing opportunities, which may further reduce interest expense.
Now I'll discuss free cash flow. In the first quarter, adjusted free cash was $245 million, which consisted of: one, cash provided by operating activities of $299 million, less property and equipment received of $128 million; plus proceeds from the sale of property of $6 million; plus merger-related expenditures, net of tax of $8 million; plus legacy tax settlement related to BFI of $60 million. And this equals adjusted free cash of $245 million.
We define adjusted free cash flow based on capital expenditures received during the period. We have included a reconciliation of the timing difference between capital expenditures received versus paid in our 8-K filing. We remain comfortable with our adjusted cash flow guidance of $700 million to $725 million for the full year.
Now I'll discuss our balance sheet. At March 31, our accounts receivable balance was $851 million, and our days sales outstanding was 40 days or 24 days net of deferred revenue. 
Reported debt was approximately $7.1 billion at March 31. During the quarter, the principal amount of debt remained essentially flat, while the reported amount of debt increased approximately $100 million due to the write off of debt discounts. Excess credit availability under our bank facility is approximately $900 million. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim."

We continue to achieve expected price increases, and our volume performance in the first quarter was at the higher end of our expectations. 
The fact that we are achieving record EBITDA margins in a business environment that has not fully recovered is a strong statement regarding the operating leverage that resides in our business platform. We have achieved significant financing synergies, and have restructured our balance sheet that ensures a low cost of capital structure for the next 10 years.
Our focus continues on increasing shareholder value, and that remains intact by this quarter's results.

Our SEC filings discuss factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.
Additionally, the material that we discuss today is time-sensitive.

Please note that this call is the property of Republic Services Incorporated. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Republic Services is strictly prohibited.
I am very pleased to report that Republic Services has again outperformed in the second quarter of 2010 due to our continued commitment on - to improving return on investment, expanding EBITDA margins, and generating additional free cash flow. We have seen a 370-basis point sequential improvement in our volume. And although core price is slightly due to the impact of CPI, total price exceeds costs and EBITDA margins continue to expand.
Accordingly, we are raising our EPS and free cash flow guidance. We are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $1.69 to $1.71 per share from $1.63 to $1.67 per share. Our adjusted free cash flow guidance is increasing by $25 million - the new range - to a new range of $725 million to $750 million.
Additionally, our Board of Directors has approved a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share, payable October 15th, 2010. This action represents the Board executing the first phase of our cash utilization strategy and we expect to finalize the second phase relating to share repurchase in the next Board meeting in early part of November. We will discuss the share repurchase plan at that time.
As we complete our integration process this year, Republic has significant operating leverage to benefit from the economic recovery and is positioned to achieve record margin performance.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Don Slager, our President and Chief Operating Officer, to discuss the second quarter highlights. Don?

Our second quarter results reflect our continued focus on safety, cost control, operating efficiency, customer service, and pricing.
Financial highlights for the second quarter are, we had revenue of approximately $2.1 billion, Republic had positive internal growth of 0.9%. This is the first time we have had positive internal growth since Q3 2008. We expect to have positive total revenue growth in the second half of 2010. Net income, adjusted primarily for merger related expenses, was $166.4 million or $0.43 per share. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.3%. This strong performance demonstrated the strength of our field organization to maintain the focus on pricing in a low-inflation environment and cost-competitive structure, while completing the integration process.
Our total price improvement, including fuel surcharges and higher commodity values, was 4.2%. Core price increase for the second quarter was 1.6%. Our pricing was down sequentially due to the impact of lower CPI on our index-based business, which represents 50% of total revenue. We continue to use our ROI pricing tools to be sure all business activity meets our requirements.
Our volumes declined year-over-year by 3.3%, which is a 370 basis points improvement versus first quarter. Our commercial collection business has started to see increases in service frequency and we continue to see volume improvement in our industrial and landfill lines of business. We expect that by the fourth quarter our volumes will be flat to slightly positive.
Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $402 million or $1.05 per share. This is a 124% of adjusted book earnings. As you know, free cash flow is the best measure of quality earnings. We remain on track to meet our synergy target of $185 million to $190 million by year-end. This strong performance has enabled us to increase our quarterly dividend and increase our earnings and free cash flow guidance as Jim just mentioned.
Before moving on to Tod's financial review, I would like to mention a few operational highlights in the quarter. First, we continue to experience positive results from our safety initiatives as accident frequency in the quarter is down more than 10% compared to last year. This is an area of keen focus for Republic and a continuance of a positive multiyear trend.
  Second, we are seeing a more normal seasonal increase in our temporary roll-off business. Although the level of business activity is down significantly from two years ago, we have not seen this level of sequential percentage increase since 2007.
Third, during the first half of 2010, we have continued to expand our fleet of alternative energy vehicles with the purchase of 155 natural gas trucks. We will take delivery of an additional 110 natural gas fuel trucks by the end of 2010. Fourth, we have brought two additional single-stream recycling facilities online in the Twin Cities and Buffalo marketplaces, and plan to complete one more in Central Florida by the end of the year.
I would like to thank our field operations for their commitment to achieving a high level of performance in all aspects of our business, their hard work and ability to execute. Our operating plan is clearly evidenced in our results.
I'll now turn the call over to Tod for a recap of second quarter financial performance.

After considering the impact of revenues from operations divested in 2009, same-store revenue increased $18.4 million or almost 1%. Again, as Don mentioned earlier, this is the first positive internal growth since the third quarter of 2008 and consists of the following.
Core price growth of 1.6%. In total, the collection lines of businesses saw a price increase of about 1.9% in the second quarter. This collection average includes commercial price of about 2%, industrial price of a little over 2.5%, and residential price of approximately 1.5%. I would like to remind everybody that our residential business has the largest percentage of index-based customers at over 70% index, and was impacted by the low CPI levels during the past 18 months. We still expect current-year CPI to be positive, but at lower levels than originally anticipated.
Now, our landfill pricing. Landfill pricing, overall, increased by 1%. This includes municipal solid waste of 2.7% and that was partially offset by positive, but relatively lower-priced C&D and special waste event driven work. Again, we expect to achieve 2% price for the full year, which is within our original guidance range. In the second half, we will benefit from continued strength in our open market price, we will anniversary out some lower 2009 index pricing, and we will benefit from a 1% increase in environmental recovery fees that began in July.
Now, let's talk briefly about recycling. Recycling commodity revenue had an increase of 1.5%. Prices increased approximately 67% to an average of $120 a ton in the current quarter from $72 per ton in the prior year. Second quarter MERS commodity volume of 464,000 tons was up sequentially by about 9%, however, was flat with the prior year. Currently, we are seeing July commodity prices of about $110 per ton, a decrease of $10 compared to the second quarter average.
Lastly, on the price side, fuel recovery fee increase of 1.1%. The increase in fuel recovery fees relates to an increase, obviously, in the fuel costs. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $3.03 in the second quarter of 2010 from a low $2.33 in the prior year and it was $2.85 in the first quarter. I might also mention that current fuel prices are $2.90 a gallon. So they've come down a little bit.
Now, let's talk about volumes. Volumes were down only about 3.3%. As Don said, we saw a sequential improvement from Q1 2010 of about 370 basis points. This is favorable to our original expectations where we thought the second quarter would be a negative 4% to 5%. Where is this relatively better performance coming from? Well, we are seeing improvement trends in the collection business. Last year, we saw collection volume declines of over 8% second quarter year-over-year; and this year, we are seeing declines have improved in the low-single digits at approximately 4% decline.
Volumes are also improving in all collection lines sequentially, led by industrial with a 520-basis point increase from the first quarter of 2010. This improvement reflects an increase in permanent hauls, primarily from manufacturing customers and also a more normal cyclical uptick from the temporary business. This level of seasonality was absent in the prior year. The sequential increase in commercial volumes is driven by continued improvement in net service changes and also an improvement in our retention rates.
Now, our landfill volumes year-over-year had growth of 2.5 - 2.6%. This is a substantial improvement from the first quarter where we saw a year-over-year volume loss of a negative 8%. Sequentially, we saw improvements in MSW, C&D, and most significantly, special waste volumes.
Now, let's talk briefly about our second quarter margins compared to the prior year. Second quarter EBITDA margin increased by 60 basis points excluding divestiture losses, restructuring charges, and costs to achieve synergies. Second quarter EBITDA margin was 31.3% compared to 30.7% in the prior year; and this margin, both the second quarter and year-to-date are somewhat ahead of our original guidance. Most importantly, this was widespread margin improvement that positively impacted most cost categories.
I'll briefly comment on some of the significant changes in costs as a percentage of revenue, the details of which are available on our website and will be included in our 10-Q filing, which is going out, I believe, today.
First, fuel. Fuel expense increased 90 basis points due to the 30% increase in the cost of diesel. As I mentioned earlier, diesel prices were $3.03 in the second quarter, up from $2.33 in the second quarter of '09. Partially offsetting the increase in fuel costs was an increase in the related fuel recovery fees revenue and this resulted in a net decrease in EBITDA margin of about 20 basis points.
Second, our recycling, cost of goods sold. We saw a 60-basis point increase relating to increases in rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our MERS. Cost of goods sold at our MERS increased to an average of $38 a ton from $20 a ton in the prior year. Commodity revenue increases were more than offset - excuse me, commodity revenue increases more than offset this cost increase and that resulted in an increased spread of about $30 per ton. The net impact was a favorable 60-basis point improvement to EBITDA margin coming from commodities.
Third, labor and related labor benefit costs. We saw a 40-basis point improvement in margin here and it's primarily due to synergy related staffing reductions, due to route consolidations in overlapped markets, favorable reductions in health care claims, and an overall improvement in the company's collection productivity.
Fourth, our transfer and disposal costs. We saw a 60-basis point improvement here. And again, this margin benefit is coming from incremental landfill volumes that typically carry little or no associated disposal costs.
Fifth, our maintenance and repair costs. We saw a 40-basis point improvement in margin here, primarily due to procurement-driven cost reductions and the benefit realized from our focus on fleet, and heavy maintenance - heavy equipment maintenance practices.
Sixth, our transportation and subcontract expenses. We saw a 20-basis point improvement here, resulting primarily from synergy related cost reductions where we redirected waste streams within our more efficient transfer and disposal network.
Next is risk management. As Don said, we've got good experience from a safety standpoint and we saw a 30-basis point improvement in margins related to required reserves due to improved frequency of claims, favorable claims development, and the - also, the realization of cost savings for third-party premiums and surety costs.
And finally, our SG&A. Typically our SG&A runs around 10% of revenue. We are seeing SG&A costs, excluding costs to achieve synergies, of approximately 9.8%. This compares to 10% of revenue in the prior year. This 20-basis point improvement in margin relates to the leverage benefit of reducing expenses by $5 million, while maintaining a constant revenue base. The favorable variance includes reductions in salaries and other SG&A expenses of about $9 million. However, this was partially offset by increases in bad debt provision.
As you might recall, last year we had very low bad debt in the second quarter due to some recoveries from companies coming out of bankruptcy. And this year, it is a more normal level of bad debt at about $8 million or 40 basis points of revenue. These changes comprised a majority of the year-over-year 60-basis point improvement in EBITDA margin.
Our DD&A also improved by 30 basis points and this primarily relates to a reduction in landfill amortization expense. The cumulative impact of expansions and permit modifications that extend the life and reduce construction costs resulted in a favorable reduction in the per rate charge for landfill airspace consumed. I might remind everybody, DD&A, as a percentage of revenue, approximated 11.3%. And this level of DD&A is higher than our capital spending as a percentage of revenue, due to the amortization of intangibles arising out of our merger.
Next is interest expense. Again, I also want to remain everyone that included in interest expense is about $24 million of non-cash amortization. As we continue to refinance our debt, the portion related to the Allied debt discount will decline.
Now, let me talk briefly about our free cash flow for the six months ended June 30th. Year-to-date free cash flow was $402 million. This consisted of cash from operating activities of $595 million; property and equipment received $328 million; we do expect that we will be at the full $790 million of capital spend by the end of the year, so that's unchanged; plus, proceeds from the sale of property of about $13 million; plus, the merger related expenditures net of tax of about $12 million; and then we also, as you will recall, had a tax settlement related to some legacy issues arising at BFI of $110 million that was paid in the first half of the year. And if we excluded that, the adjusted free cash flow would be $402 million.
Again, we define adjusted free cash flow based on CapEx received during the period and I would remind everybody that we have included a reconciliation of the timing difference between CapEx received versus CapEx paid and it's in our 8-K.
Now, turning to our balance sheet. At June 30th, our accounts receivable balance was $898 million and our day sales outstanding was just under 40 days or 25 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was $7.1 billion at June 30th and we had excess credit availability under our bank facility of approximately $930 million.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim.

As an organization, we believe that every successful company needs a plan to build, develop, and retain the appropriate level of management talent. Our Board of Directors has been focused on succession planning as a high priority for many years. One of the benefits of the merger was a much stronger talent base to draw from. When I announced my intention to retire, we began to execute the details of our plan with the goal to ensure a seamless transition. I am extremely confident that we are on the course to continue our track record of success and have full faith in Don to lead the next chapter of Republic's success.
Most of the investment community already knows Don. If you don't, I can tell you that he has a proven track record as a leader, extensive experience in the industry, and maybe most important, a deep sense of commitment to our company shareholders. Over the course of the next five months, I will be working with Don to transition responsibilities and ensure a smooth and orderly succession. I look forward to participating in the 2011 planning process and I am especially committed to finalizing and closing out the first successful large-scale merger in the solid waste industry before I leave Republic Services.

I welcome the opportunity to work with such a fine group of people. The entire team is committed to fulfilling the goals that Jim and I laid out for the company at the beginning of the year and likewise, they all share a strong belief in our company and our strategy.
Republic has a very clear management objective - several objectives that I would like to reiterate specifically. We will maintain a safe and high-quality work environment for our people. We will continually improve our customers' experience and ensure that we are meeting their needs and managing their waste streams effectively. We will improve our return on capital through a disciplined approach to cost management, pricing, and capital allocation. We will intelligently grow our business through superior market planning and strategic investments. We will achieve and maintain lasting operational excellence throughout the organization and we will continually develop our people, build our talent, and expand the organization's capability.
This of course all leads to our core objectives, which are to maintain a strong capital structure and generate consistent, high levels of free cash flow and return increasing amounts of free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.
There is nothing new in these objectives, so if it sounds like more of the same, well, it is. This focus has delivered significant total returns to stakeholders during the past 12 years and we are committed to staying on this path. I am confident that the Republic team will optimize the value and strength of our assets and our market position. We will continue to deliver on the benefits of the merger and further Republic's track record of solid execution and value creation.

I think our guidance is $185 million to $190 million and we will be at the $190 million probably as we wrap up this year. And we had talked in the past about some strategic projects, which the company is working on and we are actually spending P&L dollar today to focus on certain number of areas.

It's a function of - again, the SG&A discussion we had before, we are fully staffed, we don't have to add overhead to manage the new volume. So again, that incremental margin is a function of that.
And as CPI pricing - remember, when we are in - CPI is lower and we are in a low-cost inflation situation as well. And as Jim said in his comments, the real key is that our pricing activities produce more revenue than our total cost inflation, right, to continue that margin expansion. And we've talked about getting anywhere from 50 BPs to 150 BPs of price in addition to inflation and we are successful in doing that. And that's the key and so that - well, CPI doesn't worry us overall and if CPI comes back and the inflation is good and we will see that build back. But I think we are in good place for next year.

So that's just - we are carrying higher receivables in the summer months. Typically that drops off in November and December in a more normal seasonal cycle.
The other is, if you remember, at the end of last year our payables kind of spiked up in December and we paid a lot of cash out on payables. And so there is a normal cycle in payables also, which is another maybe $50 million or so. So I think those are a couple of the big items and it's really working capital.
And as we look at the year again, CapEx, we think is going to be pretty much in line with our guidance. Again, we move the free cash flow up, consistent with where the earnings was going and I think depending on what happens with taxes, there has been some noise about bonus depreciation. I'm not sure Congress can get its act together on anything, but if they did, maybe we would have some further upside if bonus depreciation we'll put back in for 2010.
  So we feel very comfortable with that $725 million to $750 million. And we think we are in a very strong position from a cash flow standpoint, we will be de-levering through the end of this year and in a strong cash flow position next year.

Our SEC filings discuss factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Additionally, the material that we discuss today is time sensitive.

Please note that this call is the property of Republic Services, Inc. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Republic Services is strictly prohibited.
I'm very pleased to report that Republic Services has again outperformed in the second quarter of 2010 due to our continued commitment on improving return on investment, expanding EBITDA margins and generating additional free cash flow. We have seen a 370 basis point sequential improvement in our volume. And although core price is slightly lower due to the impact of CPI [consumer price index], total price exceeds costs and EBITDA margins continue to expand.
Accordingly, we are raising our EPS and free cash flow guidance. We are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $1.69 to $1.71 per share from $1.63 to $1.67 per share. Our adjusted free cash flow guidance is increasing by $25 million to a new range of $725 million to $750 million.
Additionally, our board of directors has approved a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share, payable October 15, 2010. This action represents the board executing the first phase of our cash utilization strategy, and we expect to finalize the second phase relating to share repurchase in the next board meeting in early part of November. We'll discuss the share repurchase plan at that time.
As we complete our integration process this year, Republic has significant operating leverage to benefit from the economic recovery and is positioned to achieve record margin performance. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Don Slager, our President and Chief Operating Officer to discuss the second quarter highlights. Don?"

Our second quarter results reflect our continued focus on safety, cost control, operating efficiency, customer service and pricing. Financial highlights for the second quarter are: We had revenue of approximately $2.1 billion, Republic had positive internal growth of 0.9%. This is the first time we have had positive internal growth since Q3 2008. We expect to have positive total revenue growth in the second half of 2010.
Net income, adjusted primarily for merger-related expenses was $166.4 million or $0.43 per share. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.3%. This strong performance demonstrated the strength of our field organization to maintain the focus on pricing in a low-inflation environment and cost-competitive structure while completing the integration process.
Our total price improvement, including fuel surcharges and higher commodity values, was 4.2%. Core price increase for the second quarter was 1.6%. Our pricing was down sequentially due to the impact of lower CPI on our index-based business, which represents 50% of total revenue. We continue to use our ROI pricing tools to be sure all business activity meets our requirements.
Our volumes declined year-over-year by 3.3%, which is a 370 basis points improvement versus first quarter. Our Commercial Collection business has started to see increases in service frequency, and we continue to see volume improvement in our Industrial and Landfill lines of business. We expect that by the fourth quarter, our volumes will be flat to slightly positive.
Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $402 million or $1.05 per share. This is a 124% of adjusted book earnings. As you know, free cash flow is the best measure of quality earnings.
We remain on track to meet our synergy target of $185 million to $190 million by year end. This strong performance has enabled us to increase our quarterly dividend and increase our earnings and free cash flow guidance, as Jim just mentioned.
Before moving on to Tod's financial review, I would like to mention a few operational highlights in the quarter. First, we continue to experience positive results from our safety initiatives as accident frequency in the quarter is down more than 10% compared to last year. This is an area of keen focus for Republic and a continuance of a positive multi-year trend. 
Second, we are seeing a more normal seasonal increase in our Temporary Roll-off business. Although the level of business activity is down significantly from two years ago, we have not seen this level of sequential percentage increase since 2007.
Third, during the first half of 2010, we have continued to expand our fleet of alternative energy vehicles with the purchase of 155 natural gas trucks. We will take delivery of an additional 110 natural gas fuel trucks by the end of 2010.
Fourth, we have brought two additional single-stream recycling facilities online in the Twin Cities and Buffalo marketplaces and plan to complete one more in Central Florida by the end of the year.
I'd like to thank our field operations for their commitment to achieving a high level of performance in all aspects of our business, their hard work and ability to execute. Our operating plan is clearly evidenced in our results.
I'll now turn the call over to Tod for a recap of second quarter financial performance."

Second quarter 2010 revenue, as Don said, was $2.1 billion. After considering the impact of revenues from operations divested in 2009, same-store revenue increased $18.4 million or almost 1%.
Again, as Don mentioned earlier, this is the first positive internal growth since the third quarter of 2008 and consists of the following: Core price growth of 1.6%. In total, the Collection lines of businesses saw a price increase of about 1.9% in the second quarter. This Collection average includes commercial price of about 2%, industrial price, a little over 2.5% and residential price of approximately 1.5%. I'd like to remind everybody that our Residential business has the largest percentage of index-based customers at over 70% index and was impacted by the low CPI levels during the past 18 months. We still expect current year CPI to be positive, but at lower levels than originally anticipated. 
Now our Landfill Pricing. Landfill Pricing overall increased by 1%. This includes municipal solid waste of 2.7%, and that was partially offset by positive, but relatively lower priced C&D [Construction & Demolition] and Special Waste event-driven quarter. 
Again, we expect to achieve 2% price for the full year, which was within our original guidance range. In the second half, we will benefit from continued strength in our open market price. We will anniversary out some lower 2009 index pricing, and we will benefit from the 1% increase in Environmental Recovery Fees that began in July.
Now let's talk briefly about Recycling. Recycling commodity revenue had an increase of 1.5%. Prices increased approximately 67% to an average of $120 a ton in the current quarter from $72 per ton in the prior year. Second quarter MRFs [materials recovery facilities] commodity volume of 464,000 tons was up sequentially by about 9%. However, it was flat with the prior year. Currently, we're seeing July commodity prices of about $110 per ton, a decrease of $10 compared to the second quarter average.
Lastly, on the price side, Fuel Recovery Fee increase of 1.1%. The increase in Fuel Recovery Fees relates to an increase, obviously, in the fuel costs. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $3.03 in the second quarter of 2010 from a low $2.33 in the prior year, and it was $2.85 in the first quarter. I might also mention that current fuel prices are $2.90 a gallon, so they've come down a little bit.
Now let's talk about volumes. Volumes were down only about 3.3%. As Don said, we saw a sequential improvement from Q1 2010 of about 370 basis points. This is favorable to our original expectations where we thought the second quarter would be a negative 4% to 5%. Where is this relatively better performance coming from? While we're seeing improvement trends in the Collection business, last year, we saw a Collection volume declines of over 8% in the second quarter year-over-year. And this year, we're seeing declines have improved and in the low single digits at approximately 4% decline.
Volumes are also improving in all Collection lines sequentially led by Industrial, with a 520 basis point increase from the first quarter of 2010. This improvement reflects an increase in permanent costs, primarily from manufacturing customers and also a more normal cyclical uptick from the Temporary business. This level of seasonality was absent in the prior year. The sequential increase in commercial volumes is driven by continued improvement in net service changes and also an improvement in our retention rates.
Now our Landfill volumes year-over-year had growth of 2.6%. This is a substantial improvement from the first quarter where we saw a year-over-year volume loss of a negative 8%. Sequentially, we saw improvements in MSW [municipal solid waste], C&D and most significantly, Special Waste volumes.
Now let's talk briefly about our second quarter margins compared to the prior year. Second quarter EBITDA margin increased by 60 basis points, excluding divesture losses, restructuring charges and cost of cheap synergies. Second quarter EBITDA margin was 31.3% compared to 30.7% in the prior year, and this margin, both the second quarter and year-to-date, are somewhat ahead of our original guidance. Most importantly, this was widespread margin improvement that positively impacted most cost categories. I'll briefly comment on some of the significant changes in costs as a percentage of revenue. The details of which are available on our website and will be included in our 10-Q filing, which is going out, I believe, today.
First, fuel. Fuel expense increased 90 basis points due to the 30% increase in the cost of diesel. As I mentioned earlier, diesel prices were $3.03 in the second quarter, up from $2.33 in the second quarter of '09. Partially offsetting the increase in fuel costs was an increase in the related Fuel Recovery Fees revenue, and this resulted in a net decrease in EBITDA margin of about 20 basis points.
Second, our Recycling cost of goods sold. We saw a 60 basis point increase relating to increases in rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our MRFs. Cost of goods sold at our MRFs increased to an average of about $38 a ton from $20 a ton in the prior year. Commodity revenue increase more than offset this cost increase, and that resulted in an increased spread of about $30 per ton. The net impact was a favorable 60 basis point improvement to EBITDA margin from commodities.
Third, labor and related labor benefit costs. We saw a 40 basis point improvement margin here, and it's primarily due to synergy-related staffing reductions due to the route consolidations in overlapped markets, favorable reductions at healthcare claims and an overall improvement in the company's collection productivity.
Fourth, our transfer and disposal costs. We saw 60 basis point improvement here. And again, this margin benefit is coming from incremental landfill volumes that typically carry little or no associated disposal cost. 
Fifth, our maintenance and repair costs. We saw a 40 basis point improvement margin here, primarily due to procurement-driven cost reductions and the benefit realized from our focus on fleet and heavy equipment maintenance practices. 
Sixth, our transportation and subcontract expenses. We saw a 20 basis point improvement here, resulting primarily from synergy-related cost reductions where we redirected waste streams within our more efficient transfer and disposal network.
Next is risk management. As Don said, we've got good experience from a safety standpoint, and we saw a 30 basis point improvement in margins related to required reserves due to improved frequency of claims, favorable claims development and also the realization of cost savings for third party premiums and surety costs.
And finally, our SG&A. Typically, our SG&A runs around 10% of revenue. We're seeing SG&A cost, excluding costs to achieve synergies, of approximately 9.8%. This compares to 10% of revenue in the prior year. This 20 basis point improvement in margin relates to the leverage benefit of reducing expenses by $5 million while maintaining a constant revenue base.
The favorable variance includes reductions in salaries and other SG&A expenses of about $9 million. However, this was partially offset by increases in bad debt provision. You might recall last year, we had very low bad debts in the second quarter due to some recoveries from companies coming out of bankruptcy. And this year, it is a more normal level of bad debts at about $8 million or 40 basis points of revenue.
These changes comprised a majority of the year-over-year 60 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin. Our DD&A also improved by 30 basis points, and this primarily relates to a reduction in landfill amortization expense. The cumulative impact of expansions and permit modifications that extend the life and reduce construction costs resulted in a favorable reduction in a per-rate charge for our landfill airspace consumed. I might remind everybody, DD&A as a percentage of revenue approximated 11.3%, and this level of DD&A is higher than our capital spending as a percentage of revenue due to the amortization of intangibles arising out of our merger.
Next is interest expense. Again, I also want to remind everyone that included in interest expense is about $24 million of non-cash amortization. As we continue to refinance our debt, the portion related to the Allied debt discount will decline.
Now let me talk briefly about our free cash flow for the six months ended June 30. Year-to-date free cash flow was $402 million. This consisted of cash from operating activities of $595 million, property and equipment received of $328 million, and we do expect that we will be at the full $790 million of capital spend by the end of the year. So that's unchanged. Plus, proceeds from the sale of property of about $13 million, plus the merger-related expenditures net of tax of about $12 million. And then we also, as you will recall, had a tax settlement related to some legacy issues arising at BFI of $110 million that was paid in the first half of the year. And if we excluded that, the adjusted free cash flow would be $402 million.
Again, we define adjusted free cash flow based on CapEx received during the period, and I would remind everybody that we have included a reconciliation of the timing difference between CapEx received versus CapEx paid, and it's in our 8-K.
Now turning to our balance sheet. At June 30, our accounts receivable balance was $898 million, and our day sales outstanding was just under 40 days or 25 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was $7.1 billion at June 30, and we had excess credit availability under our bank facility of approximately $930 million. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim."

As an organization, we believe that every successful company needs a plan to build, develop and retain the appropriate level of management talent. Our board of directors has been focused on succession planning as a high priority for many years. One of the benefits of the merger was a much stronger talent base to draw from. When I announced my intention to retire, we began to execute the details of our plan, with the goal to ensure a seamless transition. I'm extremely confident that we are on the course to continue our track record of success, and I have full faith in Don to lead the next chapter of Republic's success.
Most of the investment community already knows Don. If you don't, I can tell you that he has a proven track record as a leader, extensive experience in the industry and maybe most important, a deep sense of commitment to our company shareholders. Over the course of the next five months, I'll be working with Don to transition responsibilities and ensure a smooth and orderly succession.
I look forward to participating in the 2011 planning process, and I'm especially committed to finalizing and closing out the first successful large-scale merger in the solid waste industry before I leave Republic Services. Now I'd like to turn it over to Don."

Our succession announcement and related plan was well received across the organization, and our transition plan is on track. As you already know, I selected Kevin Walbridge to join the management team at Phoenix, where he will serve as Executive Vice President of Operations. I'll be working closely with Kevin and his team as I transition my day-to-day operating responsibilities. I look forward to serving our employees, our customers and our shareholders as CEO on January 1. Jim and I had built a strong team at Republic, and I have great appreciation for their abilities and their contributions to our success. I welcome the opportunity to work with such a fine group of people. The entire team is committed to fulfilling the goals that Jim and I laid out for the company at the beginning of the year, and likewise, they all share a strong belief in our company and our strategy.
Republic has a very clear management objective, several objectives that I would like to reiterate specifically. We will maintain a safe and high-quality work environment for our people. We will continually improve our customers' experience and ensure that we are meeting their needs and managing their waste streams effectively. We will improve our return on capital through a disciplined approach to cost management, pricing and capital allocation. We will intelligently grow our business through superior market planning and strategic investments. We will achieve and maintain lasting operational excellence throughout the organization, and we will continually develop our people, build our talent and expand the organization's capability. This, of course, all leads to our core objectives, which are to maintain a strong capital structure and generate consistent high levels of free cash flow and return increasing amounts of free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. There is nothing new in these objectives. So if it sounds like more of the same, well, it is.
This focus has delivered significant total returns to stakeholders during the past 12 years, and we are committed to staying on this path. I'm confident that the Republic team will optimize the value and strength of our assets in our market position. We will continue to deliver on the benefits of the merger and further Republic's track record of solid execution and value creation. Thanks again to our field management team for delivering outstanding performance during the first half of 2010. With that, I will ask our operator to join the call as we open the lines for questions."

And the order of magnitude that we've been talking about the share repurchase to be is in the area of $300 million to $400 million to be acted on in the 2011 calendar year, and probably with a bias to the upper end of that."

There might be a little bit of upside, but I think the business is pretty well integrated by the end of probably October, we should be pretty much done with this. And you can also see that there's not a lot of costs to achieve synergy. So we're at in the second quarter maybe about $185 run rate. I think our guidance is $185 million to $190 million, and we'll be at the $190 million probably as we wrap up this year. And we had talked in the past about some strategic projects which the company is working on. We're actually spending P&L dollars today to focus on certain number of areas, but the benefits of those is really coming in probably in '12 and '13.

So again, that incremental margin is a function of that. And CPI pricing. Remember, when the CPI is low, we're in a low cost inflation situation as well. And as Jim said in his comments, the real key is that our pricing activity has produced more revenue than our total cost inflation, right, if you continue that margin expansion. And we've talked about getting anywhere from 50 bps to 150 bps of price additional to inflation, and we were successful in doing that, and that's the key so that -- well CPI doesn't worry us overall, and if CPI comes back, a little inflation is good, and we'll see that go back.

First of all, with the seasonal uptick here, I think we'll see it in the Q, our receivables went up by about maybe $60 million or close to $900 million. So that's just we're carrying higher receivables in the summer months. Typically, that drops off in November and December in a more normal seasonal cycle. The other is if you'll remember, at the end of last year, our payables kind of spiked up in December. We paid a lot of cash out on payables, and so there's a normal cycle in payables also which is another maybe $50 million or so. So I think those are a couple of big items, and it's really working capital. And as we look at the year again, the CapEx, we think is going to be pretty much in line with our guidance. Again, we move the free cash flow up consistent with where the earnings was going. And I think, depending on what happens with taxes, there has been some noise about bonus depreciation. I'm not sure Congress can get its act together on anything, but if they did, maybe we'd have some further upside if bonus appreciation were put back in for 2010. So we feel very comfortable with that 7.25% lifting. And we think we're in a very strong position.

I'm very pleased to report that Republic Services has again outperformed in the second quarter of 2010 due to our continued commitment on improving return on investment, expanding EBITDA margins and generating additional free cash flow. We have seen a 370 basis point sequential improvement in our volume. And although core price is slightly lower due to the impact of CPI [consumer price index], total price exceeds costs and EBITDA margins continue to expand.
Accordingly, we are raising our EPS and free cash flow guidance. We are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $1.69 to $1.71 per share from $1.63 to $1.67 per share. Our adjusted free cash flow guidance is increasing by $25 million to a new range of $725 million to $750 million.
Additionally, our board of directors has approved a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share, payable October 15, 2010. This action represents the board executing the first phase of our cash utilization strategy, and we expect to finalize the second phase relating to share repurchase in the next board meeting in early part of November. We'll discuss the share repurchase plan at that time.
As we complete our integration process this year, Republic has significant operating leverage to benefit from the economic recovery and is positioned to achieve record margin performance. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Don Slager, our President and Chief Operating Officer to discuss the second quarter highlights. Don?"

Our second quarter results reflect our continued focus on safety, cost control, operating efficiency, customer service and pricing. Financial highlights for the second quarter are: We had revenue of approximately $2.1 billion, Republic had positive internal growth of 0.9%. This is the first time we have had positive internal growth since Q3 2008. We expect to have positive total revenue growth in the second half of 2010.
Net income, adjusted primarily for merger-related expenses was $166.4 million or $0.43 per share. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.3%. This strong performance demonstrated the strength of our field organization to maintain the focus on pricing in a low-inflation environment and cost-competitive structure while completing the integration process.
Our total price improvement, including fuel surcharges and higher commodity values, was 4.2%. Core price increase for the second quarter was 1.6%. Our pricing was down sequentially due to the impact of lower CPI on our index-based business, which represents 50% of total revenue. We continue to use our ROI pricing tools to be sure all business activity meets our requirements.
Our volumes declined year-over-year by 3.3%, which is a 370 basis points improvement versus first quarter. Our Commercial Collection business has started to see increases in service frequency, and we continue to see volume improvement in our Industrial and Landfill lines of business. We expect that by the fourth quarter, our volumes will be flat to slightly positive.
Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $402 million or $1.05 per share. This is 124% of adjusted book earnings. As you know, free cash flow is the best measure of quality earnings.
We remain on track to meet our synergy target of $185 million to $190 million by year end. This strong performance has enabled us to increase our quarterly dividend and increase our earnings and free cash flow guidance, as Jim just mentioned.
Before moving on to Tod's financial review, I would like to mention a few operational highlights in the quarter. First, we continue to experience positive results from our safety initiatives as accident frequency in the quarter is down more than 10% compared to last year. This is an area of keen focus for Republic and a continuance of a positive multi-year trend. 
Second, we are seeing a more normal seasonal increase in our Temporary Roll-off business. Although the level of business activity is down significantly from two years ago, we have not seen this level of sequential percentage increase since 2007.
Third, during the first half of 2010, we have continued to expand our fleet of alternative energy vehicles with the purchase of 155 natural gas trucks. We will take delivery of an additional 110 natural gas fuel trucks by the end of 2010.
Fourth, we have brought two additional single-stream recycling facilities online in the Twin Cities and Buffalo marketplaces and plan to complete one more in Central Florida by the end of the year.
I'd like to thank our field operations for their commitment to achieving a high level of performance in all aspects of our business, their hard work and ability to execute. Our operating plan is clearly evidenced in our results.
I'll now turn the call over to Tod for a recap of the second quarter financial performance."
386225,107951498,70658,"Republic Services, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Republic Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Don. Second quarter 2010 revenue, as Don said, was $2.1 billion. After considering the impact of revenues from operations divested in 2009, same-store revenue increased $18.4 million or almost 1%.Again, as Don mentioned earlier, this is the firs",1609,"Thanks, Don. Second quarter 2010 revenue, as Don said, was $2.1 billion. After considering the impact of revenues from operations divested in 2009, same-store revenue increased $18.4 million or almost 1%.
Again, as Don mentioned earlier, this is the first positive internal growth since the third quarter of 2008 and consists of the following: Core price growth of 1.6%. In total, the Collection lines of businesses saw a price increase of about 1.9% in the second quarter. This Collection average includes commercial price of about 2%, industrial price, a little over 2.5% and residential price of approximately 1.5%. 
I'd like to remind everybody that our Residential business has the largest percentage of index-based customers at over 70% index and was impacted by the low CPI levels during the past 18 months. We still expect current year CPI to be positive, but at lower levels than originally anticipated. 
Now our Landfill Pricing. Landfill Pricing overall increased by 1%. This includes municipal solid waste of 2.7%, and that was partially offset by positive, but relatively lower priced C&D [Construction & Demolition] and Special Waste event-driven quarter. 
Again, we expect to achieve 2% price for the full year, which was within our original guidance range. In the second half, we will benefit from continued strength in our open market price. We will anniversary out some lower 2009 index pricing, and we will benefit from the 1% increase in Environmental Recovery Fees that began in July.
Now let's talk briefly about Recycling. Recycling commodity revenue had an increase of 1.5%. Prices increased approximately 67% to an average of $120 a ton in the current quarter from $72 per ton in the prior year. Second quarter MRFs [materials recovery facilities] commodity volume of 464,000 tons was up sequentially by about 9%. However, it was flat with the prior year. Currently, we're seeing July commodity prices of about $110 per ton, a decrease of $10 compared to the second quarter average.
Lastly, on the price side, Fuel Recovery Fee increase of 1.1%. The increase in Fuel Recovery Fees relates to an increase, obviously, in the fuel costs. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $3.03 in the second quarter of 2010 from a low $2.33 in the prior year, and it was $2.85 in the first quarter. I might also mention that current fuel prices are $2.90 a gallon, so they've come down a little bit.
Now let's talk about volumes. Volumes were down only about 3.3%. As Don said, we saw a sequential improvement from Q1 2010 of about 370 basis points. This is favorable to our original expectations where we thought the second quarter would be a negative 4% to 5%. Where is this relatively better performance coming from? While we're seeing improvement trends in the Collection business, last year, we saw a Collection volume declines of over 8% in the second quarter year-over-year. And this year, we're seeing declines have improved and in the low single digits at approximately 4% decline.
Volumes are also improving in all Collection lines sequentially led by Industrial, with a 520 basis point increase from the first quarter of 2010. This improvement reflects an increase in permanent costs, primarily from manufacturing customers and also a more normal cyclical uptick from the Temporary business. This level of seasonality was absent in the prior year. The sequential increase in commercial volumes is driven by continued improvement in net service changes and also an improvement in our retention rates.
Now our Landfill volumes year-over-year had growth of 2.6%. This is a substantial improvement from the first quarter where we saw a year-over-year volume loss of a negative 8%. Sequentially, we saw improvements in MSW [municipal solid waste], C&D and most significantly, Special Waste volumes.
Now let's talk briefly about our second quarter margins compared to the prior year. Second quarter EBITDA margin increased by 60 basis points, excluding divesture losses, restructuring charges and cost of cheap synergies. Second quarter EBITDA margin was 31.3% compared to 30.7% in the prior year, and this margin, both the second quarter and year-to-date, are somewhat ahead of our original guidance. Most importantly, this was widespread margin improvement that positively impacted most cost categories. I'll briefly comment on some of the significant changes in costs as a percentage of revenue. The details of which are available on our website and will be included in our 10-Q filing, which is going out, I believe, today.
First, fuel. Fuel expense increased 90 basis points due to the 30% increase in the cost of diesel. As I mentioned earlier, diesel prices were $3.03 in the second quarter, up from $2.33 in the second quarter of '09. Partially offsetting the increase in fuel costs was an increase in the related Fuel Recovery Fees revenue, and this resulted in a net decrease in EBITDA margin of about 20 basis points.
Second, our Recycling cost of goods sold. We saw a 60 basis point increase relating to increases in rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our MRFs. Cost of goods sold at our MRFs increased to an average of about $38 a ton from $20 a ton in the prior year. Commodity revenue increase more than offset this cost increase, and that resulted in an increased spread of about $30 per ton. The net impact was a favorable 60 basis point improvement to EBITDA margin from commodities.
Third, labor and related labor benefit costs. We saw a 40 basis point improvement margin here, and it's primarily due to synergy-related staffing reductions due to the route consolidations in overlapped markets, favorable reductions at healthcare claims and an overall improvement in the company's collection productivity.
Fourth, our transfer and disposal costs. We saw 60 basis point improvement here. And again, this margin benefit is coming from incremental landfill volumes that typically carry little or no associated disposal cost. 
Fifth, our maintenance and repair costs. We saw a 40 basis point improvement margin here, primarily due to procurement-driven cost reductions and the benefit realized from our focus on fleet and heavy equipment maintenance practices. 
Sixth, our transportation and subcontract expenses. We saw a 20 basis point improvement here, resulting primarily from synergy-related cost reductions where we redirected waste streams within our more efficient transfer and disposal network.
Next is risk management. As Don said, we've got good experience from a safety standpoint, and we saw a 30 basis point improvement in margins related to required reserves due to improved frequency of claims, favorable claims development and also the realization of cost savings for third party premiums and surety costs.
And finally, our SG&A. Typically, our SG&A runs around 10% of revenue. We're seeing SG&A cost, excluding costs to achieve synergies, of approximately 9.8%. This compares to 10% of revenue in the prior year. This 20 basis point improvement in margin relates to the leverage benefit of reducing expenses by $5 million while maintaining a constant revenue base.
The favorable variance includes reductions in salaries and other SG&A expenses of about $9 million. However, this was partially offset by increases in bad debt provision. You might recall last year, we had very low bad debts in the second quarter due to some recoveries from companies coming out of bankruptcy. And this year, it is a more normal level of bad debts at about $8 million or 40 basis points of revenue.
These changes comprised a majority of the year-over-year 60 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin. Our DD&A also improved by 30 basis points, and this primarily relates to a reduction in landfill amortization expense. The cumulative impact of expansions and permit modifications that extend the life and reduce construction costs resulted in a favorable reduction in a per-rate charge for our landfill airspace consumed. I might remind everybody, DD&A as a percentage of revenue approximated 11.3%, and this level of DD&A is higher than our capital spending as a percentage of revenue due to the amortization of intangibles arising out of our merger.
Next is interest expense. Again, I also want to remind everyone that included in interest expense is about $24 million of non-cash amortization. As we continue to refinance our debt, the portion related to the Allied debt discount will decline.
Now let me talk briefly about our free cash flow for the six months ended June 30. Year-to-date free cash flow was $402 million. This consisted of cash from operating activities of $595 million, property and equipment received of $328 million, and we do expect that we will be at the full $790 million of capital spend by the end of the year. So that's unchanged. Plus, proceeds from the sale of property of about $13 million, plus the merger-related expenditures net of tax of about $12 million. And then we also, as you will recall, had a tax settlement related to some legacy issues arising at BFI of $110 million that was paid in the first half of the year. And if we excluded that, the adjusted free cash flow would be $402 million.
Again, we define adjusted free cash flow based on CapEx received during the period, and I would remind everybody that we have included a reconciliation of the timing difference between CapEx received versus CapEx paid, and it's in our 8-K.
Now turning to our balance sheet. At June 30, our accounts receivable balance was $898 million, and our day sales outstanding was just under 40 days or 25 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was $7.1 billion at June 30, and we had excess credit availability under our bank facility of approximately $930 million. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim."

Don and I would like to comment on the process for executive transition here at Republic. As an organization, we believe that every successful company needs a plan to build, develop and retain the appropriate level of management talent. Our board of directors has been focused on succession planning as a high priority for many years. One of the benefits of the merger was a much stronger talent base to draw from. When I announced my intention to retire, we began to execute the details of our plan, with the goal to ensure a seamless transition. I'm extremely confident that we are on the course to continue our track record of success, and I have full faith in Don to lead the next chapter of Republic's success.
Most of the investment community already knows Don. If you don't, I can tell you that he has a proven track record as a leader, extensive experience in the industry and maybe most important, a deep sense of commitment to our company shareholders. Over the course of the next five months, I'll be working with Don to transition responsibilities and ensure a smooth and orderly succession.
I look forward to participating in the 2011 planning process, and I'm especially committed to finalizing and closing out the first successful large-scale merger in the solid waste industry before I leave Republic Services. Now I'd like to turn it over to Don."

Our succession announcement and related plan was well received across the organization, and our transition plan is on track. As you already know, I selected Kevin Walbridge to join the management team at Phoenix, where he will serve as Executive Vice President of Operations. I'll be working closely with Kevin and his team as I transition my day-to-day operating responsibilities. I look forward to serving our employees, our customers and our shareholders as CEO on January 1. Jim and I had built a strong team at Republic, and I have great appreciation for their abilities and their contributions to our success. I welcome the opportunity to work with such a fine group of people. The entire team is committed to fulfilling the goals that Jim and I laid out for the company at the beginning of the year, and likewise, they all share a strong belief in our company and our strategy.
Republic has a very clear management objective, several objectives that I would like to reiterate specifically. We will maintain a safe and high-quality work environment for our people. We will continually improve our customers' experience and ensure that we are meeting their needs and managing their waste streams effectively. We will improve our return on capital through a disciplined approach to cost management, pricing and capital allocation. We will intelligently grow our business through superior market planning and strategic investments. We will achieve and maintain lasting operational excellence throughout the organization, and we will continually develop our people, build our talent and expand the organization's capability. This, of course, all leads to our core objectives, which are to maintain a strong capital structure and generate consistent high levels of free cash flow and return increasing amounts of free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. There is nothing new in these objectives. So if it sounds like more of the same, well, it is.
This focus has delivered significant total returns to stakeholders during the past 12 years, and we are committed to staying on this path. I'm confident that the Republic team will optimize the value and strength of our assets in our market position. We will continue to deliver on the benefits of the merger and further Republic's track record of solid execution and value creation. Thanks again to our field management team for delivering outstanding performance during the first half of 2010. With that, I will ask our operator to join the call as we open the lines for questions."

So I don't necessarily have -- I can't say 2/3 of our contracts are reset in the second half and 1/3 in the first half. I don't have that statistic."

And I think we've been clear to say that in a number of conferences that we've been at. And the order of magnitude that we've been talking about the share repurchase to be is in the area of $300 million to $400 million to be acted on in the 2011 calendar year, and probably with a bias to the upper end of that."

I think our guidance is $185 million to $190 million, and we'll be at the $190 million probably as we wrap up this year. And we had talked in the past about some strategic projects which the company is working on. We're actually spending P&L dollars today to focus on a certain number of areas, but the benefits of those really come in probably in '12 and '13.

So again, that incremental margin is a function of that. And CPI pricing. Remember, when the CPI is low, we're in a low cost inflation situation as well. And as Jim said in his comments, the real key is that our pricing activity has produced more revenue than our total cost inflation, right, if you continue that margin expansion. And we've talked about getting anywhere from 50 bps to 150 bps of price additional to inflation, and we were successful in doing that, and that's the key so that -- well CPI doesn't worry us overall, and if CPI comes back, a little inflation is good, and we'll see that go back.

First of all, with the seasonal uptick here, I think we'll see it in the Q, our receivables went up by about maybe $60 million or close to $900 million. So that's just we're carrying higher receivables in the summer months. Typically, that drops off in November and December in a more normal seasonal cycle. The other is if you'll remember, at the end of last year, our payables kind of spiked up in December. We paid a lot of cash out on payables, and so there's a normal cycle in payables also which is another maybe $50 million or so. So I think those are a couple of big items, and it's really working capital. And as we look at the year again, the CapEx, we think is going to be pretty much in line with our guidance. Again, we move the free cash flow up consistent with where the earnings was going. And I think, depending on what happens with taxes, there has been some noise about bonus depreciation. I'm not sure Congress can get its act together on anything, but if they did, maybe we'd have some further upside if bonus appreciation were put back in for 2010. So we feel very comfortable with that 7.25% lifting. And we think we're in a very strong position.

We have seen a 370 basis point sequential improvement in our volume. And although core price is slightly lower due to the impact of CPI [consumer price index], total price exceeds costs and EBITDA margins continue to expand.
Accordingly, we are raising our EPS and free cash flow guidance. We are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $1.69 to $1.71 per share from $1.63 to $1.67 per share. Our adjusted free cash flow guidance is increasing by $25 million to a new range of $725 million to $750 million.
Additionally, our board of directors has approved a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share, payable October 15, 2010. This action represents the board executing the first phase of our cash utilization strategy, and we expect to finalize the second phase relating to share repurchase in the next board meeting in early part of November. We'll discuss the share repurchase plan at that time.
As we complete our integration process this year, Republic has significant operating leverage to benefit from the economic recovery and is positioned to achieve record margin performance. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Don Slager, our President and Chief Operating Officer to discuss the second quarter highlights. Don?"

Our second quarter results reflect our continued focus on safety, cost control, operating efficiency, customer service and pricing. Financial highlights for the second quarter are: We had revenue of approximately $2.1 billion, Republic had positive internal growth of 0.9%. This is the first time we have had positive internal growth since Q3 2008. We expect to have positive total revenue growth in the second half of 2010.
Net income, adjusted primarily for merger-related expenses was $166.4 million or $0.43 per share. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.3%. This strong performance demonstrated the strength of our field organization to maintain the focus on pricing in a low-inflation environment and cost-competitive structure while completing the integration process.
Our total price improvement, including fuel surcharges and higher commodity values, was 4.2%. Core price increase for the second quarter was 1.6%. Our pricing was down sequentially due to the impact of lower CPI on our index-based business, which represents 50% of total revenue. We continue to use our ROI pricing tools to be sure all business activity meets our requirements.
Our volumes declined year-over-year by 3.3%, which is a 370 basis points improvement versus first quarter. Our Commercial Collection business has started to see increases in service frequency, and we continue to see volume improvement in our Industrial and Landfill lines of business. We expect that by the fourth quarter, our volumes will be flat to slightly positive.
Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $402 million or $1.05 per share. This is 124% of adjusted book earnings. As you know, free cash flow is the best measure of quality earnings.
We remain on track to meet our synergy target of $185 million to $190 million by year end. This strong performance has enabled us to increase our quarterly dividend and increase our earnings and free cash flow guidance, as Jim just mentioned.
Before moving on to Tod's financial review, I would like to mention a few operational highlights in the quarter. First, we continue to experience positive results from our safety initiatives as accident frequency in the quarter is down more than 10% compared to last year. This is an area of keen focus for Republic and a continuance of a positive multi-year trend. 
Second, we are seeing a more normal seasonal increase in our Temporary Roll-off business. Although the level of business activity is down significantly from two years ago, we have not seen this level of sequential percentage increase since 2007.
Third, during the first half of 2010, we have continued to expand our fleet of alternative energy vehicles with the purchase of 155 natural gas trucks. We will take delivery of an additional 110 natural gas fuel trucks by the end of 2010.
Fourth, we have brought two additional single-stream recycling facilities online in the Twin Cities and Buffalo marketplaces and plan to complete one more in Central Florida by the end of the year.
I'd like to thank our field operations for their commitment to achieving a high level of performance in all aspects of our business, their hard work and ability to execute. Our operating plan is clearly evidenced in our results.
I'll now turn the call over to Tod for a recap of the second quarter financial performance."

Second quarter 2010 revenue, as Don said, was $2.1 billion. After considering the impact of revenues from operations divested in 2009, same-store revenue increased $18.4 million or almost 1%.
Again, as Don mentioned earlier, this is the first positive internal growth since the third quarter of 2008 and consists of the following: Core price growth of 1.6%. In total, the Collection lines of businesses saw a price increase of about 1.9% in the second quarter. This Collection average includes commercial price of about 2%, industrial price, a little over 2.5% and residential price of approximately 1.5%. 
I'd like to remind everybody that our Residential business has the largest percentage of index-based customers at over 70% index and was impacted by the low CPI levels during the past 18 months. We still expect current year CPI to be positive, but at lower levels than originally anticipated. 
Now our Landfill Pricing. Landfill Pricing overall increased by 1%. This includes municipal solid waste of 2.7%, and that was partially offset by positive, but relatively lower priced C&D [Construction & Demolition] and Special Waste event-driven quarter. 
Again, we expect to achieve 2% price for the full year, which was within our original guidance range. In the second half, we will benefit from continued strength in our open market price. We will anniversary out some lower 2009 index pricing, and we will benefit from the 1% increase in Environmental Recovery Fees that began in July.
Now let's talk briefly about Recycling. Recycling commodity revenue had an increase of 1.5%. Prices increased approximately 67% to an average of $120 a ton in the current quarter from $72 per ton in the prior year. Second quarter MRFs [materials recovery facilities] commodity volume of 464,000 tons was up sequentially by about 9%. However, it was flat with the prior year. Currently, we're seeing July commodity prices of about $110 per ton, a decrease of $10 compared to the second quarter average.
Lastly, on the price side, Fuel Recovery Fee increase of 1.1%. The increase in Fuel Recovery Fees relates to an increase, obviously, in the fuel costs. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $3.03 in the second quarter of 2010 from a low $2.33 in the prior year, and it was $2.85 in the first quarter. I might also mention that current fuel prices are $2.90 a gallon, so they've come down a little bit.
Now let's talk about volumes. Volumes were down only about 3.3%. As Don said, we saw a sequential improvement from Q1 2010 of about 370 basis points. This is favorable to our original expectations where we thought the second quarter would be a negative 4% to 5%. Where is this relatively better performance coming from? While we're seeing improvement trends in the Collection business, last year, we saw a Collection volume declines of over 8% in the second quarter year-over-year. And this year, we're seeing declines have improved and in the low single digits at approximately 4% decline.
Volumes are also improving in all Collection lines sequentially led by Industrial, with a 520 basis point increase from the first quarter of 2010. This improvement reflects an increase in permanent costs, primarily from manufacturing customers and also a more normal cyclical uptick from the Temporary business. This level of seasonality was absent in the prior year. The sequential increase in commercial volumes is driven by continued improvement in net service changes and also an improvement in our retention rates.
Now our Landfill volumes year-over-year had growth of 2.6%. This is a substantial improvement from the first quarter where we saw a year-over-year volume loss of a negative 8%. Sequentially, we saw improvements in MSW [municipal solid waste], C&D and most significantly, Special Waste volumes.
Now let's talk briefly about our second quarter margins compared to the prior year. Second quarter EBITDA margin increased by 60 basis points, excluding divesture losses, restructuring charges and cost of cheap synergies. Second quarter EBITDA margin was 31.3% compared to 30.7% in the prior year, and this margin, both the second quarter and year-to-date, are somewhat ahead of our original guidance. Most importantly, this was widespread margin improvement that positively impacted most cost categories. I'll briefly comment on some of the significant changes in costs as a percentage of revenue. The details of which are available on our website and will be included in our 10-Q filing, which is going out, I believe, today.
First, fuel. Fuel expense increased 90 basis points due to the 30% increase in the cost of diesel. As I mentioned earlier, diesel prices were $3.03 in the second quarter, up from $2.33 in the second quarter of '09. Partially offsetting the increase in fuel costs was an increase in the related Fuel Recovery Fees revenue, and this resulted in a net decrease in EBITDA margin of about 20 basis points.
Second, our Recycling cost of goods sold. We saw a 60 basis point increase relating to increases in rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our MRFs. Cost of goods sold at our MRFs increased to an average of about $38 a ton from $20 a ton in the prior year. Commodity revenue increase more than offset this cost increase, and that resulted in an increased spread of about $30 per ton. The net impact was a favorable 60 basis point improvement to EBITDA margin from commodities.
Third, labor and related labor benefit costs. We saw a 40 basis point improvement margin here, and it's primarily due to synergy-related staffing reductions due to the route consolidations in overlapped markets, favorable reductions at healthcare claims and an overall improvement in the company's collection productivity.
Fourth, our transfer and disposal costs. We saw 60 basis point improvement here. And again, this margin benefit is coming from incremental landfill volumes that typically carry little or no associated disposal cost. 
Fifth, our maintenance and repair costs. We saw a 40 basis point improvement margin here, primarily due to procurement-driven cost reductions and the benefit realized from our focus on fleet and heavy equipment maintenance practices. 
Sixth, our transportation and subcontract expenses. We saw a 20 basis point improvement here, resulting primarily from synergy-related cost reductions where we redirected waste streams within our more efficient transfer and disposal network.
Next is risk management. As Don said, we've got good experience from a safety standpoint, and we saw a 30 basis point improvement in margins related to required reserves due to improved frequency of claims, favorable claims development and also the realization of cost savings for third party premiums and surety costs.
And finally, our SG&A. Typically, our SG&A runs around 10% of revenue. We're seeing SG&A cost, excluding costs to achieve synergies, of approximately 9.8%. This compares to 10% of revenue in the prior year. This 20 basis point improvement in margin relates to the leverage benefit of reducing expenses by $5 million while maintaining a constant revenue base.
The favorable variance includes reductions in salaries and other SG&A expenses of about $9 million. However, this was partially offset by increases in bad debt provision. You might recall last year, we had very low bad debts in the second quarter due to some recoveries from companies coming out of bankruptcy. And this year, it is a more normal level of bad debts at about $8 million or 40 basis points of revenue.
These changes comprised a majority of the year-over-year 60 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin. Our DD&A also improved by 30 basis points, and this primarily relates to a reduction in landfill amortization expense. The cumulative impact of expansions and permit modifications that extend the life and reduce construction costs resulted in a favorable reduction in a per-rate charge for our landfill airspace consumed. I might remind everybody, DD&A as a percentage of revenue approximated 11.3%, and this level of DD&A is higher than our capital spending as a percentage of revenue due to the amortization of intangibles arising out of our merger.
Next is interest expense. Again, I also want to remind everyone that included in interest expense is about $24 million of non-cash amortization. As we continue to refinance our debt, the portion related to the Allied debt discount will decline.
Now let me talk briefly about our free cash flow for the six months ended June 30. Year-to-date free cash flow was $402 million. This consisted of cash from operating activities of $595 million, property and equipment received of $328 million, and we do expect that we will be at the full $790 million of capital spend by the end of the year. So that's unchanged. Plus, proceeds from the sale of property of about $13 million, plus the merger-related expenditures net of tax of about $12 million. And then we also, as you will recall, had a tax settlement related to some legacy issues arising at BFI of $110 million that was paid in the first half of the year. And if we excluded that, the adjusted free cash flow would be $402 million.
Again, we define adjusted free cash flow based on CapEx received during the period, and I would remind everybody that we have included a reconciliation of the timing difference between CapEx received versus CapEx paid, and it's in our 8-K.
Now turning to our balance sheet. At June 30, our accounts receivable balance was $898 million, and our day sales outstanding was just under 40 days or 25 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was $7.1 billion at June 30, and we had excess credit availability under our bank facility of approximately $930 million. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim."

Don and I would like to comment on the process for executive transition here at Republic. As an organization, we believe that every successful company needs a plan to build, develop and retain the appropriate level of management talent. Our board of directors has been focused on succession planning as a high priority for many years. One of the benefits of the merger was a much stronger talent base to draw from. When I announced my intention to retire, we began to execute the details of our plan, with the goal to ensure a seamless transition. I'm extremely confident that we are on the course to continue our track record of success, and I have full faith in Don to lead the next chapter of Republic's success.
Most of the investment community already knows Don. If you don't, I can tell you that he has a proven track record as a leader, extensive experience in the industry and maybe most important, a deep sense of commitment to our company shareholders. Over the course of the next five months, I'll be working with Don to transition responsibilities and ensure a smooth and orderly succession.
I look forward to participating in the 2011 planning process, and I'm especially committed to finalizing and closing out the first successful large-scale merger in the solid waste industry before I leave Republic Services. Now I'd like to turn it over to Don."

Our succession announcement and related plan was well received across the organization, and our transition plan is on track. As you already know, I selected Kevin Walbridge to join the management team at Phoenix, where he will serve as Executive Vice President of Operations. I'll be working closely with Kevin and his team as I transition my day-to-day operating responsibilities. I look forward to serving our employees, our customers and our shareholders as CEO on January 1. Jim and I had built a strong team at Republic, and I have great appreciation for their abilities and their contributions to our success. I welcome the opportunity to work with such a fine group of people. The entire team is committed to fulfilling the goals that Jim and I laid out for the company at the beginning of the year, and likewise, they all share a strong belief in our company and our strategy.
Republic has a very clear management objective, several objectives that I would like to reiterate specifically. We will maintain a safe and high-quality work environment for our people. We will continually improve our customers' experience and ensure that we are meeting their needs and managing their waste streams effectively. We will improve our return on capital through a disciplined approach to cost management, pricing and capital allocation. We will intelligently grow our business through superior market planning and strategic investments. We will achieve and maintain lasting operational excellence throughout the organization, and we will continually develop our people, build our talent and expand the organization's capability. This, of course, all leads to our core objectives, which are to maintain a strong capital structure and generate consistent high levels of free cash flow and return increasing amounts of free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. There is nothing new in these objectives. So if it sounds like more of the same, well, it is.
This focus has delivered significant total returns to stakeholders during the past 12 years, and we are committed to staying on this path. I'm confident that the Republic team will optimize the value and strength of our assets in our market position. We will continue to deliver on the benefits of the merger and further Republic's track record of solid execution and value creation. Thanks again to our field management team for delivering outstanding performance during the first half of 2010. With that, I will ask our operator to join the call as we open the lines for questions."

We have seen some marginal increases in our Small Container business through service increases. We've seen our Industrial Permanent and as in Tod's and Don's comments, we pointed out, and we're starting to see some increased landfill volumes especially surrounding Special Waste. So we are seeing some improvement in the economy. We do believe that the business does have operating leverage in it going forward. But I think, as Don said, it's just a little early to tell right now, when we still really look at kind of earnings being almost 50-50 versus in a traditional year when we saw a traditional seasonality, it was 48-50 of earnings. So, I think, look, we believe the economy is getting a little bit better. We believe that the business, from a pricing perspective, is operating online. We'll be at the lower end of our guidance in pricing for full year. So I mean, all in all, I believe that this is a great quarter, and again, the business is operating just as we saw it would, other than the idea that the CPI has got a headwind."

And I think we've been clear to say that in a number of conferences that we've been at.

So again, that incremental margin is a function of that. And CPI pricing. Remember, when the CPI is low, we're in a low cost inflation situation as well. And as Jim said in his comments, the real key is that our pricing activity has produced more revenue than our total cost inflation, right, if you continue that margin expansion. And we've talked about getting anywhere from 50 bps to 150 bps of price additional to inflation, and we were successful in doing that, and that's the key so that -- well CPI doesn't worry us overall, and if CPI comes back, a little inflation is good, and we'll see that go back.

First of all, with the seasonal uptick here, I think we'll see it in the Q, our receivables went up by about maybe $60 million or close to $900 million. So that's just we're carrying higher receivables in the summer months. Typically, that drops off in November and December in a more normal seasonal cycle. The other is if you'll remember, at the end of last year, our payables kind of spiked up in December. We paid a lot of cash out on payables, and so there's a normal cycle in payables also which is another maybe $50 million or so. So I think those are a couple of big items, and it's really working capital. And as we look at the year again, the CapEx, we think is going to be pretty much in line with our guidance. Again, we move the free cash flow up consistent with where the earnings was going. And I think, depending on what happens with taxes, there has been some noise about bonus depreciation. I'm not sure Congress can get its act together on anything, but if they did, maybe we'd have some further upside if bonus appreciation were put back in for 2010.

I'm very pleased to report that we continue to achieve record performance in a weak but stable economy. We are raising our free cash flow guidance to $800 million due to the benefit of bonus depreciation. We're on target to achieve the revised upward earnings guidance of $1.69 to $1.71 we provided you in July. We remain on track to meet or exceed the full year EBITDA margin guidance, and we continue to see improvement in year-over-year volumes. 
Based on our strong earnings and cash flow visibility, our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of $400 million. In less than two years since the closing of our merger, we have completed the first successful large implementation integration in the solid waste industry on a timely basis. All operating locations are on a single IT platform. We have achieved $190 million of run rate synergies and exceeded our goal by 27%, and we have repaid $1.1 billion of debt and have the highest credit ratings in the industry. And we returned to Republic's long-term strategy of paying free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchase now and our annual dividend. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Don Slager to discuss our third quarter highlights."

Our third quarter results reflect our continued focus on safety, cost control, systems integration and intelligently pricing our business. Financial highlights for the third quarter and year-to-date are revenue of approximately $2.1 billion.",433,"Thanks, Jim. Our third quarter results reflect our continued focus on safety, cost control, systems integration and intelligently pricing our business. Financial highlights for the third quarter and year-to-date are revenue of approximately $2.1 billion. This is the second consecutive quarter with [ph] positive internal growth. Net income adjusted primarily for merger-related expenses was $173 million, or $0.45 per share. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the third quarter was 30.8%. As Jim just mentioned, we are on track to meet or exceed our full year EBITDA margin guidance. 
Our field organization has maintained their focus on pricing, and continues to achieve open market pricing in excess of inflation. Core price increase for the third quarter was 1.5%. If we adjust for a few isolated areas were required to divest of operations, core price was approximately 2%.
Our total price improvement, including fuel surcharges and higher commodity values was 2.6%. We continue to use our ROI pricing tools to be sure all business activity meets our requirements. Our volumes declined year-over-year by 2.5%, which is an 80 basis point improvement versus the second quarter. The areas that showed the strongest volume improvement were in the Commercial and Industrial businesses, with sequential improvements of 110 and 230 basis points respectively. 
Landfill special waste continues to be strong, which resulted in year-over-year volume growth in the Landfill business for the second quarter in a row. Third quarter adjusted free cash flow was $177 million and $579 million on a year-to-date basis. Adjusted free cash flow per share of $1.51 for the year is 117% of adjusted book earnings. As you know, free cash flow is the best measure of the quality of earnings.
I would now like to mention a few of our achievements in the quarter that demonstrate our ongoing focus on cost controls. We continue to experience positive results from our safety initiatives, as accident frequency is down more than 15% compared to last year. Ensuring a safe environment is key to our long-term success. Our field management has continued to achieve labor productivity gains over the prior year, and reduce labor costs in an absolute dollars, as well as a percentage of revenue.
We adjusted our maintenance headcount to the proper ratio of collection routes. This resulted in a lower maintenance cost per engine hour and reduction in maintenance costs as a percentage of revenue. I would like to thank our field operations for their commitment to achieving high-level of performance in all aspects of our business. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tod for a recap of our third quarter financial performance."

Third quarter of 2010 revenue, as Don indicated was $2.06 billion. After considering the impact of revenue from divested operations, same-store revenue increased by $2.4 million consisting of the following: Core price growth of a positive 1.5",1702,"Thanks, Don. Third quarter of 2010 revenue, as Don indicated was $2.06 billion. After considering the impact of revenue from divested operations, same-store revenue increased by $2.4 million consisting of the following: Core price growth of a positive 1.5%. In total, the collection line of business saw a price increase of 1.6% and the disposal business saw a price increase of 1.1%, with all lines of business reporting positive price increases in the third quarter. By now, a pricing was down sequentially, and this includes the impact of lower CPI in our indexed base business. As you know, approximately 50% of our customer contracts contain pricing restrictions. The majority tied to CPI.
Within the Collection business, these restrictions are rated to Residential and Commercial businesses. The pricing on these contracts has been negatively impacted by the low levels of CPI. Our original 2010 guidance assumed the full year CPI of about 2.5%, and the most recent CPI for the month of September was 1.1%. 
Our landfill prices increased by 1.2%. Now this includes MSW, up 2.2%, partially offset by positive but relatively lower-priced Construction & Demolition and special waste event driven work. It's important to note that the majority of our MSW volume is tied to index-based pricing.
We expect our full year 2010 price to approximate 1.6%. Commodity revenue, increase of 0.6%. Our commodity prices increased approximately 29% to an average of $119 per ton in the current quarter from $92 per ton in the prior year. Our third quarter commodity volume of 455,000 tons was down sequentially about 2% and relatively flat with the prior year.
Current October commodity prices are approximately $134 a ton, an increase of $15 compared to the third quarter average. Now a fuel recovery fee had an increase of 0.5%. The increase in Fuel Recovery Fees relates to an increase in fuel costs. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $2.94 in the third quarter of 2010 from $2.60 in the prior year, with current fuel prices at $3.07 per gallon.
Turning to our volumes. Our volumes were down 2.5%, this is a sequential improvement from the second quarter of about 80 basis points. We continue to see improvements in the Collection business, which is now down less than 3% over the prior year. You will recall last year, we saw a collection volume declines of over 8%. 
Volumes are also improving in all collection lines sequentially, led by industrial with a 230 basis point increase from the second quarter of 2010. This improvement reflects an increase in permanent hauls, primarily for manufacturing customers, and a more normal cyclical uptick from the temporary business. 
Now our landfill volumes had year-over-year growth of 1.4%. Last year, we saw landfill volume declines of over 18%. This improvement in volume is due to an increase in special waste received at our landfills.
Now I'll turn to our third quarter year-over-year margins. Third quarter 2010 EBITDA margins decreased by 10 basis points to 30.8%, from 30.9% in the prior year. EBITDA margins exclude divestiture losses, restructuring charges, cost of achieve synergies and prior-year remediation recoveries. The decline in margin is driven by a 100 basis point increase in risk-insurance expense. As we said before, we do actuarial adjustments on a quarterly basis, and reserve adjustments tend to be lumpy. 
In the third quarter of 2009, we benefited from adjustments to prior period plans that did not repeat to the same level in the current third quarter. Year-to-date insurance expense is less in 2010 than 2009 and lower as a percentage of revenue. The increase in the current quarter was due to the timing, again, of actuarial adjustments. Excluding the change in risk insurance expense, our third quarter EBITDA margins improved 90 basis points over the prior year. 
Now I'll comment on some of the other changes in costs as a percentage of revenue. The details, of which are available on our website, and will be included in our 10-Q filing which are coming out in the next couple of days.
First, fuel. The unfavorable fuel expense increase of 40 basis points was due to the 13% increase in the cost of diesel. And again, I indicated diesel prices of $2.94 in the third quarter versus $2.60 in the third quarter of the prior year. Partially offsetting this increase in fuel costs was an increase in related Fuel Recovery Fee revenue, resulting in a net decrease in EBITDA margin of about 10 basis points. 
Second, recycling cost of goods sold. The unfavorable 30 basis point increase in expense relates to increases in rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. Cost of goods sold at our recycling facilities increased to an average of $36 per ton from $27 in the prior year. Commodity revenue increases more than offset this increase in cost, resulting in an increase spread of approximately $18 per ton. The net impact was a favorable 30 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin.
Third, labor and related benefits cost. The 10 basis point improvement in margin is primarily due to the synergy-related staffing reductions due to route consolidations in overlap markets, favorable reductions in health care claims and an overall improvement in collection productivity. 
Fourth, transfer and disposal cost. The 50 basis point improvement, again, primarily relates to the margin benefit of incremental landfill volumes that carry a little or no associated disposal cost. 
Next, transportation and subcontract expenses. The 20 basis point improvement in margin results from synergy-related cost reductions from redirecting waste streams within our more efficient transfer and disposal network. 
And finally, SG&A. SG&A, excluding cost to achieve synergies was approximately 9.8% compared to 10.5% in the prior year. The 70 basis point improvement in margin relates to the leverage benefit of reducing expenses while maintaining the revenue base, and a reduction also in incentive compensation expense. Looking ahead, we believe SG&A should be in the range of approximately 10%.
These cost improvements collectively as a percentage of revenue are enabling us to meet or exceed our full year EBITDA margin guidance of 31%. Now let me turn to my attention to depreciation, depletion and amortization. This improved 40 basis points, which primarily relates to a reduction in landfill amortization expense and accretion. The accumulative impact of expansions and permit modifications that extended the life and reduced construction costs resulted in a favorable reduction in the per ton rate we charge as landfill aerospace is consumed. DD&A, as a percentage of revenue, approximated 11.2%. DD&A is higher than capital expenditures, as a percentage of revenue, due to the amortization of intangibles resulting from the merger.
Looking at other aspects of our income statement, interest expense. I want to remind you that in interest expense, we have $24.3 million of non-cash amortization. As we continue to refinance our debt, the portion related to the Allied debt discount of approximately $11 million will decline. 
Now I'll discuss our free cash flow for the 9 months ended September 30. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $579 million, which consist of cash provided by operating activities of $964 million, less property and equipment receives of $535 million, plus the proceeds from the sale of used equipment of $17 million, plus merger-related expenditures net of tax of 16, plus divestiture-related tax payments of $6 million, plus the legacy tax settlement related to BFI of $111 million. That equals the adjusted free cash flow of $579 million.
As Jim discussed earlier, we are raising our 2010 adjusted free cash flow guidance to $800 million. This includes the impact of the benefit from bonus depreciation expense of approximately $50 million, and also an increase in capital spending of about $45 million. Our previous guidance for capital spend was $790 million. And as a result of bonus depreciation, we are now planning to spend $835 million this year. Again, the $800 million of adjusted free cash flow includes both of these items.
Just to remind you, we define free cash flow based upon capital expenditures received during the period, and we have included a reconciliation of the timing difference between capital expenditures received versus paid in our 8-K filing. 
Now let me talk briefly about our balance sheet. At September 30, our accounts receivable balance was $896 million and our days sales outstanding was 40 days, or 25 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $6.9 billion at September 30 and excess credit availability under our bank facility is approximately $1.4 billion. 
Onto our taxes. The tax rate included in adjusted EPS for the third quarter was lower than the full year estimate due to the closing out of certain state tax positions in the quarter. We expect full year 2010 tax rate for adjusted earnings to approximate 40.6%. Now this full year tax rate estimate includes the benefit of 1.1% arising from favorably resolving certain federal and state tax items.
Before I turn the call back over to Don, I'd like to share a few comments about Jim, since this is his last conference call before he retires. Jim took over Republic in 1998. Revenues were about $1.4 billion, and we had about 10,000 employees. Since that time, revenues have increased over $8 billion. Margins have improved by 250 basis points and free cash flow has increased by almost 800%. And in the process, we were able to complete a very successful merger with Allied Waste and Republic Services. 
Now there's always a downside. And on the downside, Jim's handicap has led from 3 to 9, that's an unfavorable variance of 600 basis points. My outlook is, this will improve over the next few years. I think if Jim didn't retire soon, his handicap would be as high as mine, and that's trouble. In all seriousness, look, I speak for all of Republic employees. We've had 13 years of Jim's leadership, challenging our actions and business plans, open to debate, willing to accept other points of view, dealing directly and honestly with issues both good and bad. His legacy is strong. It's a strong team and a clear vision for the future of Republic. So thank you, Jim. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Don."

As we have said many times, this is a business that regularly produces earnings growth in the mid- to high-single digit percentage range. With the stock buyback, earnings growth can be in the low double-digit range. This has been Republic's track record, one of steady and consistent earnings growth. 
2010 earnings growth will be higher than usual because of the realization of synergies, including the benefit from refinancing activities. And since the majority of the synergy benefit has already been realized, about $0.01 of additional EPS benefit will roll over into 2011. 
Our approach to the business remain steady and consistent. Based on what we see in the economic and business environment, we expect 2011 EPS to grow by about 10%, which includes the benefit of our share repurchase program. We are currently in the middle of our 2011 business planning process, and we'll provide detailed guidance for 2011 in our Q4 earnings call in February. 
As you know, Jim will be retiring as CEO at the end of the year, now I'll become CEO at that time. We have had an orderly transition process during the past four months. Kevin Walbridge, who I recently named Executive Vice President in Operations, is now officed here in Phoenix. Kevin is an exceptional operating executive with deep industry experience. He is now actively involved in operating reviews and detailed planning as we develop our future business plan.
This plan will constantly advance safety while gaining productivity. This plan will persistently price our assets and services while protecting our business and getting our share of market opportunity. This plan will continually elevate customer experience and employee engagement while controlling costs. As I said before, steady and consistent. 
We have an outstanding team at Republic, and we're maintaining our focus on improving return on invested capital, increasing free cash flow and returning our strong free cash flow to shareholders. 
Before I turn the call over to Jim to wrap up our review of the quarter, I'd like to thank him publicly for his leadership in building a great company. I want to thank him personally for his support and guidance that he has given me over the past several years. And on behalf of the entire team expressed our appreciation for his many years of devotion to the people and to the owners of Republic Services. Thank you, Jim."

When we talk about churn internally, we're talking about the spread between what we sell new business at and what we lose business at. So when we talk about defection, some people sometimes use that word churn to describe defection. Defection is the amount of business that we lose in a given year. And part of that defection is structural, which is bankruptcies and businesses closing. Part of that defection is competitive. So our defection rate has been consistent over the last several quarters, it's actually down just slightly. So when we haven't seen much change really in the makeup of that defection being generally half competitive and half being structural. On the churn, we've seen pretty consistent rates in the dollar per unit that we're losing revenue at. And I would say on a multi-quarter basis pretty consistent in what we're losing or we're residing a new business at. So not much movement there overall."

And there is a little bit of a lag of, but we've had some resets as we move through the year, particularly in the summer months and through the fall, which we believe drives that number down. So CPI is certainly a significant factor here. And again, it lags as it works through its way through our business.

So if you think of our business, 40 states, we managed it through 28 area of teams, but we're in 200 marketplaces, a little bit over 200 marketplaces across the United States. So when we look at in isolation several markets, there are a couple of markets that are really driving some pricing pressures, some negative price. And one of those is L.A., it's a very competitive marketplace. It has been for many years. We've got a very great landfill position there. We've talked to many of you before about the fact that there is a big municipal landfill in the marketplace that used to close by 11:00. Today, they're open all day long. That changes the dynamic in the marketplace. We had to divest over landfill in that market as position of the merger that causes a certain competitive aspect with the new dynamic in the marketplace that will take a couple of years to sort of settle itself out. So again, that at another market, Houston. And again, a very competitive marketplace, another divestiture market. We've had some activity there. We've had -- we shared with you, I think, many quarters ago now, we had to take a price reduction in one of our large municipal transfer station contracts there, and we're about to anniversary there I think the next quarter I think. And so those things tend to play havoc with our numbers, but in the other marketplaces, and that was my comment earlier, when you factor out those isolated issues in the broad section of our marketplaces, we're getting 2% PI. And so our goal is always to, in absolute terms, get a spread between absolute inflation and absolute price, right. And so that's how we get margin expansion. If you look at our numbers, you're seeing margin expansion. So when we talk about price, remember, we're talking about absolute price, which includes the effects of churn, includes the effects of mix, okay. It's a pure price number. And so as long as we can continue to price that spread between real inflation and real price, we're going to continue to give you margin expansion, and that's what you're seeing in our numbers today."

So it's land clearing for development of a government facility. So I don't know that, that necessarily reflects a change in our outlook on commercial construction because it's the government. Normally, when we start to see nice special waste jobs because their clearing soil from old industrial sides of building the commercial real estate, again, that's more of a private sector issue. We haven't begun to see any of that yet. The other large job is a mandated cleanup that EPA mandated. And so they're really wasn't a lot of flexibility in that. One of the things we think about in special waste is when, let's say, a large industry maybe a steel mill has a stockpile of special waste and their budgets free up a little bit and they have some discretionary spending, and then they'll start to move some of that material. So it tends to be an indicator of discretionary spending easing up, but we'll keep you posted."

And as far as our service decreases, we haven't seen any further signs of service decreasing, but have not yet seen the signs of life on the increasing side. So what we'd like to be able to tell you is that, at some point, we'll see container weights improve. So as customers throw out more waste, the container waste per pounds pretty are decreased, and that converts it at some point to service increases. But we're watching diligently for that, just have not seen yet any movement. On the volume side, we did see some decline in MSW at the landfill, which is driven our volume numbers a little bit. And that's what we would kind of describe as competitive MSW. In a couple of cases, where we've had, in one case, a large competitor who has had their own landfill but it was 70 to 80 miles away, I think, and for many years, they run to a contract with us. The contract was below market. The contract came to term. We try to negotiate a price that was more consistent with market, they elected to drive the extra distance their own landfill. We've got a few other examples like that. We've got a landfill that we sold in the divestiture in the Midwest to a competitor. And the first thing they did with it was go out and secure some waste in the market so they could pay the mortgage on that new landfill. And not unexpected, we've seen this happening in the past. And these things take a little while but to settle down, but it did show up in our volume this quarter."

If you think back to mid-October, November, we'd almost been through one year with the merger. We were able to get our hands around what is really two different sets of actuarial numbers and able to adjust that based upon the excellent safety performance of the company. So we took about a $21 million positive actuarial adjustment in the third quarter of last year. And then, of course, our risk costs have continued to trend down. But where we are at this quarter, there was no big positive benefit. So that really highlights that one-time year-over-year change."

And so that mix tends to play a little havoc with us there, but it's kind of a 12-month lag that worked our way through of all that about CPI noise. But nevertheless, our focus, as I said, is to get in absolute terms that spread. And as we've said many times, we think we can get 50 bips into a 150 bips of price in that spread between true inflation and price. When the economy's tough and challenged and CPI is low and customers are sensitive, it will be closer to 50 bips. The economy's screaming and inflation is high and people are less concerned, we get better pricing. And so that's where we're going to focus."

But I'll tell you, we look at it a little differently across lines of business. And we've talked about the fact that we've had to reprice some of our large residential business because of CPI, the timing of CPI because customers have come to us and said, ""Look, I'm willing to extend the contract, but I need a price concessions."" We've been successful price over the years. We've got a good partnership. We've done some of that. So we make intelligent price decisions with our existing customer base just to keep our business. It's really profitable work. We're  through the days of pricing that negative tail that we used to talk about. It's a waste in the landfills. And you said it, Corey, these landfills they're expensive to built, to develop, they're expensive to operate. The environmental rules continued to get more stringent. We're going to spend a couple of million dollars a year or next year more in air quality, controls and testing. That's going to continue to impact the price of landfills. These landfills are expensive to own into infinity and it's a release to landfill pricing. We continue to move landfill pricing up. As I said earlier, we talked about some of the volume, and we're down year-over-year in MSW and the landfill. And some of that is directly related to the fact that we priced that business and some of that volume, those customers have chosen to leave and move on to another disposal site, in many cases, many miles farther than ours. And we've allowed  that business to leave. And we're going to continue to take that approach. These landfills are too costly and too valuable just to get the air space and so on. So we're going to continue to do that. But I'd like to see our price be higher at the landfill? Absolutely I would. And we're looking at that as well.

I'm very pleased to report that we continue to achieve record performance in a weak but stable economy. We are raising our free cash flow guidance to $800 million due to the benefit of bonus depreciation. We're on target to achieve the revised upward earnings guidance of $1.69 to $1.71 we provided you in July. We remain on track to meet or exceed the full year EBITDA margin guidance, and we continue to see improvement in year-over-year volumes. 
Based on our strong earnings and cash flow visibility, our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of $400 million. In less than two years since the closing of our merger, we have completed the first successful large implementation integration in the solid waste industry on a timely basis. All operating locations are on a single IT platform. We have achieved $190 million of run rate synergies and exceeded our goal by 27%, and we have repaid $1.1 billion of debt and have the highest credit ratings in the industry. And we returned to Republic's long-term strategy of paying free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchase now and our annual dividend. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Don Slager to discuss our third quarter highlights.

Our third quarter results reflect our continued focus on safety, cost control, systems integration and intelligently pricing our business.

Our third quarter results reflect our continued focus on safety, cost control, systems integration and intelligently pricing our business. Financial highlights for the third quarter and year-to-date are revenue of approximately $2.1 billion. This is the second consecutive quarter with [ph] positive internal growth. Net income adjusted primarily for merger-related expenses was $173 million, or $0.45 per share. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the third quarter was 30.8%. As Jim just mentioned, we are on track to meet or exceed our full year EBITDA margin guidance. 
Our field organization has maintained their focus on pricing, and continues to achieve open market pricing in excess of inflation. Core price increase for the third quarter was 1.5%. If we adjust for a few isolated areas were required to divest of operations, core price was approximately 2%.
Our total price improvement, including fuel surcharges and higher commodity values was 2.6%. We continue to use our ROI pricing tools to be sure all business activity meets our requirements. Our volumes declined year-over-year by 2.5%, which is an 80 basis point improvement versus the second quarter. The areas that showed the strongest volume improvement were in the Commercial and Industrial businesses, with sequential improvements of 110 and 230 basis points respectively. 
Landfill special waste continues to be strong, which resulted in year-over-year volume growth in the Landfill business for the second quarter in a row. Third quarter adjusted free cash flow was $177 million and $579 million on a year-to-date basis. Adjusted free cash flow per share of $1.51 for the year is 117% of adjusted book earnings. As you know, free cash flow is the best measure of the quality of earnings.
I would now like to mention a few of our achievements in the quarter that demonstrate our ongoing focus on cost controls. We continue to experience positive results from our safety initiatives, as accident frequency is down more than 15% compared to last year. Ensuring a safe environment is key to our long-term success. Our field management has continued to achieve labor productivity gains over the prior year, and reduce labor costs in an absolute dollars, as well as a percentage of revenue.
We adjusted our maintenance headcount to the proper ratio of collection routes. This resulted in a lower maintenance cost per engine hour and reduction in maintenance costs as a percentage of revenue. I would like to thank our field operations for their commitment to achieving high-level of performance in all aspects of our business. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tod for a recap of our third quarter financial performance.

Third quarter of 2010 revenue, as Don indicated was $2.06 billion. After considering the impact of revenue from divested operations, same-store revenue increased by $2.4 million consisting of the following: Core price growth of a positive 1.5",1702,"Thanks, Don. Third quarter of 2010 revenue, as Don indicated was $2.06 billion. After considering the impact of revenue from divested operations, same-store revenue increased by $2.4 million consisting of the following: Core price growth of a positive 1.5%. In total, the collection line of business saw a price increase of 1.6% and the disposal business saw a price increase of 1.1%, with all lines of business reporting positive price increases in the third quarter. By now, a pricing was down sequentially, and this includes the impact of lower CPI in our indexed base business. As you know, approximately 50% of our customer contracts contain pricing restrictions. The majority tied to CPI.
Within the Collection business, these restrictions are rated to Residential and Commercial businesses. The pricing on these contracts has been negatively impacted by the low levels of CPI. Our original 2010 guidance assumed the full year CPI of about 2.5%, and the most recent CPI for the month of September was 1.1%. 
Our landfill prices increased by 1.2%. Now this includes MSW, up 2.2%, partially offset by positive but relatively lower-priced Construction & Demolition and special waste event driven work. It's important to note that the majority of our MSW volume is tied to index-based pricing.
We expect our full year 2010 price to approximate 1.6%. Commodity revenue, increase of 0.6%. Our commodity prices increased approximately 29% to an average of $119 per ton in the current quarter from $92 per ton in the prior year. Our third quarter commodity volume of 455,000 tons was down sequentially about 2% and relatively flat with the prior year.
Current October commodity prices are approximately $134 a ton, an increase of $15 compared to the third quarter average. Now a fuel recovery fee had an increase of 0.5%. The increase in Fuel Recovery Fees relates to an increase in fuel costs. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $2.94 in the third quarter of 2010 from $2.60 in the prior year, with current fuel prices at $3.07 per gallon.
Turning to our volumes. Our volumes were down 2.5%, this is a sequential improvement from the second quarter of about 80 basis points. We continue to see improvements in the Collection business, which is now down less than 3% over the prior year. You will recall last year, we saw a collection volume declines of over 8%. 
Volumes are also improving in all collection lines sequentially, led by industrial with a 230 basis point increase from the second quarter of 2010. This improvement reflects an increase in permanent hauls, primarily for manufacturing customers, and a more normal cyclical uptick from the temporary business. 
Now our landfill volumes had year-over-year growth of 1.4%. Last year, we saw landfill volume declines of over 18%. This improvement in volume is due to an increase in special waste received at our landfills.
Now I'll turn to our third quarter year-over-year margins. Third quarter 2010 EBITDA margins decreased by 10 basis points to 30.8%, from 30.9% in the prior year. EBITDA margins exclude divestiture losses, restructuring charges, cost of achieve synergies and prior-year remediation recoveries. The decline in margin is driven by a 100 basis point increase in risk-insurance expense. As we said before, we do actuarial adjustments on a quarterly basis, and reserve adjustments tend to be lumpy. 
In the third quarter of 2009, we benefited from adjustments to prior period plans that did not repeat to the same level in the current third quarter. Year-to-date insurance expense is less in 2010 than 2009 and lower as a percentage of revenue. The increase in the current quarter was due to the timing, again, of actuarial adjustments. Excluding the change in risk insurance expense, our third quarter EBITDA margins improved 90 basis points over the prior year. 
Now I'll comment on some of the other changes in costs as a percentage of revenue. The details, of which are available on our website, and will be included in our 10-Q filing which are coming out in the next couple of days.
First, fuel. The unfavorable fuel expense increase of 40 basis points was due to the 13% increase in the cost of diesel. And again, I indicated diesel prices of $2.94 in the third quarter versus $2.60 in the third quarter of the prior year. Partially offsetting this increase in fuel costs was an increase in related Fuel Recovery Fee revenue, resulting in a net decrease in EBITDA margin of about 10 basis points. 
Second, recycling cost of goods sold. The unfavorable 30 basis point increase in expense relates to increases in rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. Cost of goods sold at our recycling facilities increased to an average of $36 per ton from $27 in the prior year. Commodity revenue increases more than offset this increase in cost, resulting in an increase spread of approximately $18 per ton. The net impact was a favorable 30 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin.
Third, labor and related benefits cost. The 10 basis point improvement in margin is primarily due to the synergy-related staffing reductions due to route consolidations in overlap markets, favorable reductions in health care claims and an overall improvement in collection productivity. 
Fourth, transfer and disposal cost. The 50 basis point improvement, again, primarily relates to the margin benefit of incremental landfill volumes that carry a little or no associated disposal cost. 
Next, transportation and subcontract expenses. The 20 basis point improvement in margin results from synergy-related cost reductions from redirecting waste streams within our more efficient transfer and disposal network. 
And finally, SG&A. SG&A, excluding cost to achieve synergies was approximately 9.8% compared to 10.5% in the prior year. The 70 basis point improvement in margin relates to the leverage benefit of reducing expenses while maintaining the revenue base, and a reduction also in incentive compensation expense. Looking ahead, we believe SG&A should be in the range of approximately 10%.
These cost improvements collectively as a percentage of revenue are enabling us to meet or exceed our full year EBITDA margin guidance of 31%. Now let me turn to my attention to depreciation, depletion and amortization. This improved 40 basis points, which primarily relates to a reduction in landfill amortization expense and accretion. The accumulative impact of expansions and permit modifications that extended the life and reduced construction costs resulted in a favorable reduction in the per ton rate we charge as landfill aerospace is consumed. DD&A, as a percentage of revenue, approximated 11.2%. DD&A is higher than capital expenditures, as a percentage of revenue, due to the amortization of intangibles resulting from the merger.
Looking at other aspects of our income statement, interest expense. I want to remind you that in interest expense, we have $24.3 million of non-cash amortization. As we continue to refinance our debt, the portion related to the Allied debt discount of approximately $11 million will decline. 
Now I'll discuss our free cash flow for the 9 months ended September 30. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $579 million, which consist of cash provided by operating activities of $964 million, less property and equipment receives of $535 million, plus the proceeds from the sale of used equipment of $17 million, plus merger-related expenditures net of tax of 16, plus divestiture-related tax payments of $6 million, plus the legacy tax settlement related to BFI of $111 million. That equals the adjusted free cash flow of $579 million.
As Jim discussed earlier, we are raising our 2010 adjusted free cash flow guidance to $800 million. This includes the impact of the benefit from bonus depreciation expense of approximately $50 million, and also an increase in capital spending of about $45 million. Our previous guidance for capital spend was $790 million. And as a result of bonus depreciation, we are now planning to spend $835 million this year. Again, the $800 million of adjusted free cash flow includes both of these items.
Just to remind you, we define free cash flow based upon capital expenditures received during the period, and we have included a reconciliation of the timing difference between capital expenditures received versus paid in our 8-K filing. 
Now let me talk briefly about our balance sheet. At September 30, our accounts receivable balance was $896 million and our days sales outstanding was 40 days, or 25 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $6.9 billion at September 30 and excess credit availability under our bank facility is approximately $1.4 billion. 
Onto our taxes. The tax rate included in adjusted EPS for the third quarter was lower than the full year estimate due to the closing out of certain state tax positions in the quarter. We expect full year 2010 tax rate for adjusted earnings to approximate 40.6%. Now this full year tax rate estimate includes the benefit of 1.1% arising from favorably resolving certain federal and state tax items.
Before I turn the call back over to Don, I'd like to share a few comments about Jim, since this is his last conference call before he retires. Jim took over Republic in 1998. Revenues were about $1.4 billion, and we had about 10,000 employees. Since that time, revenues have increased over $8 billion. Margins have improved by 250 basis points and free cash flow has increased by almost 800%. And in the process, we were able to complete a very successful merger with Allied Waste and Republic Services. 
Now there's always a downside. And on the downside, Jim's handicap has led from 3 to 9, that's an unfavorable variance of 600 basis points. My outlook is, this will improve over the next few years. I think if Jim didn't retire soon, his handicap would be as high as mine, and that's trouble. In all seriousness, look, I speak for all of Republic employees. We've had 13 years of Jim's leadership, challenging our actions and business plans, open to debate, willing to accept other points of view, dealing directly and honestly with issues both good and bad. His legacy is strong. It's a strong team and a clear vision for the future of Republic. So thank you, Jim. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Don.

As we have said many times, this is a business that regularly produces earnings growth in the mid- to high-single digit percentage range. With the stock buyback, earnings growth can be in the low double-digit range. This has been Republic's track record, one of steady and consistent earnings growth. 
2010 earnings growth will be higher than usual because of the realization of synergies, including the benefit from refinancing activities. And since the majority of the synergy benefit has already been realized, about $0.01 of additional EPS benefit will roll over into 2011. 
Our approach to the business remain steady and consistent. Based on what we see in the economic and business environment, we expect 2011 EPS to grow by about 10%, which includes the benefit of our share repurchase program. We are currently in the middle of our 2011 business planning process, and we'll provide detailed guidance for 2011 in our Q4 earnings call in February. 
As you know, Jim will be retiring as CEO at the end of the year, now I'll become CEO at that time. We have had an orderly transition process during the past four months. Kevin Walbridge, who I recently named Executive Vice President in Operations, is now officed here in Phoenix. Kevin is an exceptional operating executive with deep industry experience. He is now actively involved in operating reviews and detailed planning as we develop our future business plan.
This plan will constantly advance safety while gaining productivity. This plan will persistently price our assets and services while protecting our business and getting our share of market opportunity. This plan will continually elevate customer experience and employee engagement while controlling costs. As I said before, steady and consistent. 
We have an outstanding team at Republic, and we're maintaining our focus on improving return on invested capital, increasing free cash flow and returning our strong free cash flow to shareholders. 
Before I turn the call over to Jim to wrap up our review of the quarter, I'd like to thank him publicly for his leadership in building a great company. I want to thank him personally for his support and guidance that he has given me over the past several years. And on behalf of the entire team expressed our appreciation for his many years of devotion to the people and to the owners of Republic Services. Thank you, Jim.

You, we have achieved many successes during that period of time and delivered a total return to our shareholders of over 178%. During that same period, the S&P had a total return of 26%. 
More importantly, I've had the privilege of being the CEO of an organization that has the strongest management team, has met the challenges of economic uncertainty, set industry standards for financial transparency and disclosure, and never lost its commitment to developing future leaders and reinvesting in the best operating platform in the industry. 
I've worked with Don and known Don for much longer than the two years that the company have come together. I have total confidence in Don's leadership and in his ability to take the company to the next plateau. And as I can tell you, he is as focused as I have been in continuing to improve shareholder value.
Thanks again to our field management team for delivering our standard results in 2010. And, again, thanks to everyone out there for taking me along for the ride.

When we talk about churn internally, we're talking about the spread between what we sell new business at and what we lose business at. So when we talk about defection, some people sometimes use that word churn to describe defection. Defection is the amount of business that we lose in a given year. And part of that defection is structural, which is bankruptcies and businesses closing. Part of that defection is competitive. So our defection rate has been consistent over the last several quarters, it's actually down just slightly. So when we haven't seen much change really in the makeup of that defection being generally half competitive and half being structural. On the churn, we've seen pretty consistent rates in the dollar per unit that we're losing revenue at. And I would say on a multi-quarter basis pretty consistent in what we're losing or we're residing a new business at. So not much movement there overall.

So if you think of our business, 40 states, we managed it through 28 area of teams, but we're in 200 marketplaces, a little bit over 200 marketplaces across the United States. So when we look at in isolation several markets, there are a couple of markets that are really driving some pricing pressures, some negative price. And one of those is L.A., it's a very competitive marketplace. It has been for many years. We've got a very great landfill position there. We've talked to many of you before about the fact that there is a big municipal landfill in the marketplace that used to close by 11:00. Today, they're open all day long. That changes the dynamic in the marketplace. We had to divest over landfill in that market as position of the merger that causes a certain competitive aspect with the new dynamic in the marketplace that will take a couple of years to sort of settle itself out. So again, that at another market, Houston. And again, a very competitive marketplace, another divestiture market. We've had some activity there. We've had -- we shared with you, I think, many quarters ago now, we had to take a price reduction in one of our large municipal transfer station contracts there, and we're about to anniversary there I think the next quarter I think. And so those things tend to play havoc with our numbers, but in the other marketplaces, and that was my comment earlier, when you factor out those isolated issues in the broad section of our marketplaces, we're getting 2% PI. And so our goal is always to, in absolute terms, get a spread between absolute inflation and absolute price, right. And so that's how we get margin expansion. If you look at our numbers, you're seeing margin expansion. So when we talk about price, remember, we're talking about absolute price, which includes the effects of churn, includes the effects of mix, okay. It's a pure price number. And so as long as we can continue to price that spread between real inflation and real price, we're going to continue to give you margin expansion, and that's what you're seeing in our numbers today.

And as far as our service decreases, we haven't seen any further signs of service decreasing, but have not yet seen the signs of life on the increasing side. So what we'd like to be able to tell you is that, at some point, we'll see container weights improve. So as customers throw out more waste, the container waste per pounds pretty are decreased, and that converts it at some point to service increases. But we're watching diligently for that, just have not seen yet any movement. On the volume side, we did see some decline in MSW at the landfill, which is driven our volume numbers a little bit. And that's what we would kind of describe as competitive MSW. In a couple of cases, where we've had, in one case, a large competitor who has had their own landfill but it was 70 to 80 miles away, I think, and for many years, they run to a contract with us. The contract was below market. The contract came to term. We try to negotiate a price that was more consistent with market, they elected to drive the extra distance their own landfill. We've got a few other examples like that. We've got a landfill that we sold in the divestiture in the Midwest to a competitor. And the first thing they did with it was go out and secure some waste in the market so they could pay the mortgage on that new landfill. And not unexpected, we've seen this happening in the past. And these things take a little while but to settle down, but it did show up in our volume this quarter.

We're hopeful that we'd see a little more of that continue. We haven't seen it continue. We haven't seen a further decline, but we haven't seen it build. And so we're kind of patiently waiting for those volumes to come back to us and for our customer's businesses to improve, but we haven't got anything better to report on that.

When the economy's tough and challenged and CPI is low and customers are sensitive, it will be closer to 50 bips.

And we've talked about the fact that we've had to reprice some of our large residential business because of CPI, the timing of CPI because customers have come to us and said, ""Look, I'm willing to extend the contract, but I need a price concessions."" We've been successful price over the years. We've got a good partnership. We've done some of that. So we make intelligent price decisions with our existing customer base just to keep our business. It's really profitable work. We're  through the days of pricing that negative tail that we used to talk about. It's a waste in the landfills. And you said it, Corey, these landfills they're expensive to built, to develop, they're expensive to operate. The environmental rules continued to get more stringent. We're going to spend a couple of million dollars a year or next year more in air quality, controls and testing. That's going to continue to impact the price of landfills. These landfills are expensive to own into infinity and it's a release to landfill pricing. We continue to move landfill pricing up. As I said earlier, we talked about some of the volume, and we're down year-over-year in MSW and the landfill. And some of that is directly related to the fact that we priced that business and some of that volume, those customers have chosen to leave and move on to another disposal site, in many cases, many miles farther than ours. And we've allowed  that business to leave. And we're going to continue to take that approach. These landfills are too costly and too valuable just to get the air space and so on. So we're going to continue to do that. But I'd like to see our price be higher at the landfill? Absolutely I would. And we're looking at that as well. We're looking at that not only to our third-party customers but our own internal customers. So we're going to continue to focus on it.

I'm very pleased to report that we continue to achieve record performance in a weak but stable economy. We are raising our free cash flow guidance to $800 million due to the benefit of bonus depreciation. We're on target to achieve the revised upward earnings guidance of $1.69 to $1.71 we provided you in July. We remain on track to meet or exceed the full year EBITDA margin guidance, and we continue to see improvement in year-over-year volumes. 
Based on our strong earnings and cash flow visibility, our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of $400 million. In less than two years since the closing of our merger, we have completed the first successful large implementation integration in the solid waste industry on a timely basis. All operating locations are on a single IT platform. We have achieved $190 million of run rate synergies and exceeded our goal by 27%, and we have repaid $1.1 billion of debt and have the highest credit ratings in the industry. And we returned to Republic's long-term strategy of paying free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchase now and our annual dividend. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Don Slager to discuss our third quarter highlights."

Our third quarter results reflect our continued focus on safety, cost control, systems integration and intelligently pricing our business. Financial highlights for the third quarter and year-to-date are revenue of approximately $2.1 billion.",433,"Thanks, Jim. Our third quarter results reflect our continued focus on safety, cost control, systems integration and intelligently pricing our business. Financial highlights for the third quarter and year-to-date are revenue of approximately $2.1 billion. This is the second consecutive quarter with [ph] positive internal growth. Net income adjusted primarily for merger-related expenses was $173 million, or $0.45 per share. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the third quarter was 30.8%. As Jim just mentioned, we are on track to meet or exceed our full year EBITDA margin guidance. 
Our field organization has maintained their focus on pricing, and continues to achieve open market pricing in excess of inflation. Core price increase for the third quarter was 1.5%. If we adjust for a few isolated areas were required to divest of operations, core price was approximately 2%.
Our total price improvement, including fuel surcharges and higher commodity values was 2.6%. We continue to use our ROI pricing tools to be sure all business activity meets our requirements. Our volumes declined year-over-year by 2.5%, which is an 80 basis point improvement versus the second quarter. The areas that showed the strongest volume improvement were in the Commercial and Industrial businesses, with sequential improvements of 110 and 230 basis points respectively. 
Landfill special waste continues to be strong, which resulted in year-over-year volume growth in the Landfill business for the second quarter in a row. Third quarter adjusted free cash flow was $177 million and $579 million on a year-to-date basis. Adjusted free cash flow per share of $1.51 for the year is 117% of adjusted book earnings. As you know, free cash flow is the best measure of the quality of earnings.
I would now like to mention a few of our achievements in the quarter that demonstrate our ongoing focus on cost controls. We continue to experience positive results from our safety initiatives, as accident frequency is down more than 15% compared to last year. Ensuring a safe environment is key to our long-term success. Our field management has continued to achieve labor productivity gains over the prior year, and reduce labor costs in an absolute dollars, as well as a percentage of revenue.
We adjusted our maintenance headcount to the proper ratio of collection routes. This resulted in a lower maintenance cost per engine hour and reduction in maintenance costs as a percentage of revenue. I would like to thank our field operations for their commitment to achieving high-level of performance in all aspects of our business. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tod for a recap of our third quarter financial performance."
386225,114223888,85672,"Republic Services, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Republic Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Don. Third quarter of 2010 revenue, as Don indicated was $2.06 billion. After considering the impact of revenue from divested operations, same-store revenue increased by $2.4 million consisting of the following: Core price growth of a positive 1.5",1702,"Thanks, Don. Third quarter of 2010 revenue, as Don indicated was $2.06 billion. After considering the impact of revenue from divested operations, same-store revenue increased by $2.4 million consisting of the following: Core price growth of a positive 1.5%. In total, the collection line of business saw a price increase of 1.6% and the disposal business saw a price increase of 1.1%, with all lines of business reporting positive price increases in the third quarter. By now, a pricing was down sequentially, and this includes the impact of lower CPI in our indexed base business. As you know, approximately 50% of our customer contracts contain pricing restrictions. The majority tied to CPI.
Within the Collection business, these restrictions are rated to Residential and Commercial businesses. The pricing on these contracts has been negatively impacted by the low levels of CPI. Our original 2010 guidance assumed the full year CPI of about 2.5%, and the most recent CPI for the month of September was 1.1%. 
Our landfill prices increased by 1.2%. Now this includes MSW, up 2.2%, partially offset by positive but relatively lower-priced Construction & Demolition and special waste event driven work. It's important to note that the majority of our MSW volume is tied to index-based pricing.
We expect our full year 2010 price to approximate 1.6%. Commodity revenue, increase of 0.6%. Our commodity prices increased approximately 29% to an average of $119 per ton in the current quarter from $92 per ton in the prior year. Our third quarter commodity volume of 455,000 tons was down sequentially about 2% and relatively flat with the prior year.
Current October commodity prices are approximately $134 a ton, an increase of $15 compared to the third quarter average. Now a fuel recovery fee had an increase of 0.5%. The increase in Fuel Recovery Fees relates to an increase in fuel costs. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $2.94 in the third quarter of 2010 from $2.60 in the prior year, with current fuel prices at $3.07 per gallon.
Turning to our volumes. Our volumes were down 2.5%, this is a sequential improvement from the second quarter of about 80 basis points. We continue to see improvements in the Collection business, which is now down less than 3% over the prior year. You will recall last year, we saw a collection volume declines of over 8%. 
Volumes are also improving in all collection lines sequentially, led by industrial with a 230 basis point increase from the second quarter of 2010. This improvement reflects an increase in permanent hauls, primarily for manufacturing customers, and a more normal cyclical uptick from the temporary business. 
Now our landfill volumes had year-over-year growth of 1.4%. Last year, we saw landfill volume declines of over 18%. This improvement in volume is due to an increase in special waste received at our landfills.
Now I'll turn to our third quarter year-over-year margins. Third quarter 2010 EBITDA margins decreased by 10 basis points to 30.8%, from 30.9% in the prior year. EBITDA margins exclude divestiture losses, restructuring charges, cost of achieve synergies and prior-year remediation recoveries. The decline in margin is driven by a 100 basis point increase in risk-insurance expense. As we said before, we do actuarial adjustments on a quarterly basis, and reserve adjustments tend to be lumpy. 
In the third quarter of 2009, we benefited from adjustments to prior period plans that did not repeat to the same level in the current third quarter. Year-to-date insurance expense is less in 2010 than 2009 and lower as a percentage of revenue. The increase in the current quarter was due to the timing, again, of actuarial adjustments. Excluding the change in risk insurance expense, our third quarter EBITDA margins improved 90 basis points over the prior year. 
Now I'll comment on some of the other changes in costs as a percentage of revenue. The details, of which are available on our website, and will be included in our 10-Q filing which are coming out in the next couple of days.
First, fuel. The unfavorable fuel expense increase of 40 basis points was due to the 13% increase in the cost of diesel. And again, I indicated diesel prices of $2.94 in the third quarter versus $2.60 in the third quarter of the prior year. Partially offsetting this increase in fuel costs was an increase in related Fuel Recovery Fee revenue, resulting in a net decrease in EBITDA margin of about 10 basis points. 
Second, recycling cost of goods sold. The unfavorable 30 basis point increase in expense relates to increases in rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. Cost of goods sold at our recycling facilities increased to an average of $36 per ton from $27 in the prior year. Commodity revenue increases more than offset this increase in cost, resulting in an increase spread of approximately $18 per ton. The net impact was a favorable 30 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin.
Third, labor and related benefits cost. The 10 basis point improvement in margin is primarily due to the synergy-related staffing reductions due to route consolidations in overlap markets, favorable reductions in health care claims and an overall improvement in collection productivity. 
Fourth, transfer and disposal cost. The 50 basis point improvement, again, primarily relates to the margin benefit of incremental landfill volumes that carry a little or no associated disposal cost. 
Next, transportation and subcontract expenses. The 20 basis point improvement in margin results from synergy-related cost reductions from redirecting waste streams within our more efficient transfer and disposal network. 
And finally, SG&A. SG&A, excluding cost to achieve synergies was approximately 9.8% compared to 10.5% in the prior year. The 70 basis point improvement in margin relates to the leverage benefit of reducing expenses while maintaining the revenue base, and a reduction also in incentive compensation expense. Looking ahead, we believe SG&A should be in the range of approximately 10%.
These cost improvements collectively as a percentage of revenue are enabling us to meet or exceed our full year EBITDA margin guidance of 31%. Now let me turn to my attention to depreciation, depletion and amortization. This improved 40 basis points, which primarily relates to a reduction in landfill amortization expense and accretion. The accumulative impact of expansions and permit modifications that extended the life and reduced construction costs resulted in a favorable reduction in the per ton rate we charge as landfill aerospace is consumed. DD&A, as a percentage of revenue, approximated 11.2%. DD&A is higher than capital expenditures, as a percentage of revenue, due to the amortization of intangibles resulting from the merger.
Looking at other aspects of our income statement, interest expense. I want to remind you that in interest expense, we have $24.3 million of non-cash amortization. As we continue to refinance our debt, the portion related to the Allied debt discount of approximately $11 million will decline. 
Now I'll discuss our free cash flow for the 9 months ended September 30. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $579 million, which consists of cash provided by operating activities of $964 million, less property and equipment receives of $535 million, plus the proceeds from the sale of used equipment of $17 million, plus merger-related expenditures net of tax of 16, plus divestiture-related tax payments of $6 million, plus the legacy tax settlement related to BFI of $111 million. That equals the adjusted free cash flow of $579 million.
As Jim discussed earlier, we are raising our 2010 adjusted free cash flow guidance to $800 million. This includes the impact of the benefit from bonus depreciation expense of approximately $50 million, and also an increase in capital spending of about $45 million. Our previous guidance for capital spend was $790 million. And as a result of bonus depreciation, we are now planning to spend $835 million this year. Again, the $800 million of adjusted free cash flow includes both of these items.
Just to remind you, we define free cash flow based upon capital expenditures received during the period, and we have included a reconciliation of the timing difference between capital expenditures received versus paid in our 8-K filing. 
Now let me talk briefly about our balance sheet. At September 30, our accounts receivable balance was $896 million and our days sales outstanding was 40 days, or 25 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $6.9 billion at September 30 and excess credit availability under our bank facility is approximately $1.4 billion. 
Onto our taxes. The tax rate included in adjusted EPS for the third quarter was lower than the full year estimate due to the closing out of certain state tax positions in the quarter. We expect full year 2010 tax rate for adjusted earnings to approximate 40.6%. Now this full year tax rate estimate includes the benefit of 1.1% arising from favorably resolving certain federal and state tax items.
Before I turn the call back over to Don, I'd like to share a few comments about Jim, since this is his last conference call before he retires. Jim took over Republic in 1998. Revenues were about $1.4 billion, and we had about 10,000 employees. Since that time, revenues have increased over $8 billion. Margins have improved by 250 basis points and free cash flow has increased by almost 800%. And in the process, we were able to complete a very successful merger with Allied Waste and Republic Services. 
Now there's always a downside. And on the downside, Jim's handicap has led from 3 to 9, that's an unfavorable variance of 600 basis points. My outlook is, this will improve over the next few years. I think if Jim didn't retire soon, his handicap would be as high as mine, and that's trouble. In all seriousness, look, I speak for all of Republic employees. We've had 13 years of Jim's leadership, challenging our actions and business plans, open to debate, willing to accept other points of view, dealing directly and honestly with issues both good and bad. His legacy is strong. It's a strong team and a clear vision for the future of Republic. So thank you, Jim. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Don."

As we have said many times, this is a business that regularly produces earnings growth in the mid- to high-single digit percentage range. With the stock buyback, earnings growth can be in the low double-digit range. This has been Republic's track record, one of steady and consistent earnings growth. 
2010 earnings growth will be higher than usual because of the realization of synergies, including the benefit from refinancing activities. And since the majority of the synergy benefit has already been realized, about $0.01 of additional EPS benefit will roll over into 2011. 
Our approach to the business remain steady and consistent. Based on what we see in the economic and business environment, we expect 2011 EPS to grow by about 10%, which includes the benefit of our share repurchase program. We are currently in the middle of our 2011 business planning process, and we'll provide detailed guidance for 2011 in our Q4 earnings call in February. 
As you know, Jim will be retiring as CEO at the end of the year, now I'll become CEO at that time. We have had an orderly transition process during the past four months. Kevin Walbridge, who I recently named Executive Vice President in Operations, is now officed here in Phoenix. Kevin is an exceptional operating executive with deep industry experience. He is now actively involved in operating reviews and detailed planning as we develop our future business plan.
This plan will constantly advance safety while gaining productivity. This plan will persistently price our assets and services while protecting our business and getting our share of market opportunity. This plan will continually elevate customer experience and employee engagement while controlling costs. As I said before, steady and consistent. 
We have an outstanding team at Republic, and we're maintaining our focus on improving return on invested capital, increasing free cash flow and returning our strong free cash flow to shareholders. 
Before I turn the call over to Jim to wrap up our review of the quarter, I'd like to thank him publicly for his leadership in building a great company. I want to thank him personally for his support and guidance that he has given me over the past several years. And on behalf of the entire team expressed our appreciation for his many years of devotion to the people and to the owners of Republic Services. Thank you, Jim."

When we talk about churn internally, we're talking about the spread between what we sell new business at and what we lose business at. So when we talk about defection, some people sometimes use that word churn to describe defection. Defection is the amount of business that we lose in a given year. And part of that defection is structural, which is bankruptcies and businesses closing. Part of that defection is competitive. So our defection rate has been consistent over the last several quarters, it's actually down just slightly. So when we haven't seen much change really in the makeup of that defection being generally half competitive and half being structural. On the churn, we've seen pretty consistent rates in the dollar per unit that we're losing revenue at. And I would say on a multi-quarter basis pretty consistent in what we're losing or we're residing a new business at. So not much movement there overall."

This thing now has been going on somewhat, let's say, three years. Customers are more sensitive to price, and that's just the nature sort of economics one-to-one, right. So we are still pricing persistently, as I said in my comments, we're going to continue to do that. That's just part of our business model. We think the assets that we own allow us to continue to do that. So it's always been a very competitive business. That’s still the case today. Customers are a little more sensitive than it has been in the past. We have municipalities who have been feeling the pain of a better economy for a number of years. And these are long partnerships that we've had that. In some cases, we're repricing a little, but a little bit of that business today, more than we have in years past. That's just the cycle that we're in today, and that's a cycle that we'll work ourselves out of over the next couple of years, we believe."

So if you think of our business, 40 states, we managed it through 28 area of teams, but we're in 200 marketplaces, a little bit over 200 marketplaces across the United States. So when we look at in isolation several markets, there are a couple of markets that are really driving some pricing pressures, some negative price. And one of those is L.A., it's a very competitive marketplace. It has been for many years. We've got a very great landfill position there. We've talked to many of you before about the fact that there is a big municipal landfill in the marketplace that used to close by 11:00. Today, they're open all day long. That changes the dynamic in the marketplace. We had to divest over landfill in that market as position of the merger that causes a certain competitive aspect with the new dynamic in the marketplace that will take a couple of years to sort of settle itself out. So again, that at another market, Houston. And again, a very competitive marketplace, another divestiture market. We've had some activity there. We've had -- we shared with you, I think, many quarters ago now, we had to take a price reduction in one of our large municipal transfer station contracts there, and we're about to anniversary there I think the next quarter I think. And so those things tend to play havoc with our numbers, but in the other marketplaces, and that was my comment earlier, when you factor out those isolated issues in the broad section of our marketplaces, we're getting 2% PI. And so our goal is always to, in absolute terms, get a spread between absolute inflation and absolute price, right. And so that's how we get margin expansion. If you look at our numbers, you're seeing margin expansion. So when we talk about price, remember, we're talking about absolute price, which includes the effects of churn, includes the effects of mix, okay. It's a pure price number. And so as long as we can continue to price that spread between real inflation and real price, we're going to continue to give you margin expansion, and that's what you're seeing in our numbers today."

So it's land clearing for development of a government facility. So I don't know that, that necessarily reflects a change in our outlook on commercial construction because it's the government. Normally, when we start to see nice special waste jobs because their clearing soil from old industrial sides of building the commercial real estate, again, that's more of a private sector issue. We haven't begun to see any of that yet. The other large job is a mandated cleanup that EPA mandated. And so they're really wasn't a lot of flexibility in that. One of the things we think about in special waste is when, let's say, a large industry maybe a steel mill has a stockpile of special waste and their budgets free up a little bit and they have some discretionary spending, and then they'll start to move some of that material. So it tends to be an indicator of discretionary spending easing up, but we'll keep you posted."

What we lose, we gain, so we're not necessarily growing the business on a net sales basis on the competitive side of things. And as far as our service decreases, we haven't seen any further signs of service decreasing, but have not yet seen the signs of life on the increasing side. So what we'd like to be able to tell you is that, at some point, we'll see container weights improve. So as customers throw out more waste, the container waste per pounds pretty are decreased, and that converts it at some point to service increases. But we're watching diligently for that, just have not seen yet any movement. On the volume side, we did see some decline in MSW at the landfill, which is driven our volume numbers a little bit. And that's what we would kind of describe as competitive MSW. In a couple of cases, where we've had, in one case, a large competitor who has had their own landfill but it was 70 to 80 miles away, I think, and for many years, they run to a contract with us. The contract was below market. The contract came to term. We try to negotiate a price that was more consistent with market, they elected to drive the extra distance their own landfill. We've got a few other examples like that. We've got a landfill that we sold in the divestiture in the Midwest to a competitor. And the first thing they did with it was go out and secure some waste in the market so they could pay the mortgage on that new landfill. And not unexpected, we've seen this happening in the past. And these things take a little while but to settle down, but it did show up in our volume this quarter."

Just like when the economy started to fall away from us a couple of years ago, we saw it start in the East go to the Midwest then go West itself after that, and we saw start to gain momentum in these few examples we shared in the East to Midwest. We're hopeful that we'd see a little more of that continue. We haven't seen it continue. We haven't seen a further decline, but we haven't seen it build. And so we're kind of patiently waiting for those volumes to come back to us and for our customer's businesses to improve, but we haven't got anything better to report on that. So it's just kind of steady at this point. No further decline, no further improvement and we're hanging in there. And I think as we do get some of that volume coming back our way, we'll get our share as I said, and we'll see some operating leverage as a result."

We were able to get our hands around what is really two different sets of actuarial numbers and able to adjust that based upon the excellent safety performance of the company.

But nevertheless, our focus, as I said, is to get in absolute terms that spread. And as we've said many times, we think we can get 50 bips into a 150 bips of price in that spread between true inflation and price. When the economy's tough and challenged and CPI is low and customers are sensitive, it will be closer to 50 bips. The economy's screaming and inflation is high and people are less concerned, we get better pricing. And so that's where we're going to focus."

But I'll tell you, we look at it a little differently across lines of business. And we've talked about the fact that we've had to reprice some of our large residential business because of CPI, the timing of CPI because customers have come to us and said, ""Look, I'm willing to extend the contract, but I need a price concessions."" We've been successful price over the years. We've got a good partnership. We've done some of that. So we make intelligent price decisions with our existing customer base just to keep our business. It's really profitable work. We're through the days of pricing that negative tail that we used to talk about. It's a waste in the landfills. And you said it, Corey, these landfills they're expensive to built, to develop, they're expensive to operate. The environmental rules continued to get more stringent. We're going to spend a couple of million dollars a year or next year more in air quality, controls and testing. That's going to continue to impact the price of landfills. These landfills are expensive to own into infinity and it's a release to landfill pricing. We continue to move landfill pricing up. As I said earlier, we talked about some of the volume, and we're down year-over-year in MSW and the landfill. And some of that is directly related to the fact that we priced that business and some of that volume, those customers have chosen to leave and move on to another disposal site, in many cases, many miles farther than ours. And we've allowed  that business to leave. And we're going to continue to take that approach. These landfills are too costly and too valuable just to get the air space and so on. So we're going to continue to do that. But I'd like to see our price be higher at the landfill? Absolutely I would. And we're looking at that as well.

 I'm very pleased to report that we continue to achieve record performance in a weak but stable economy. We are raising our free cash flow guidance to $800 million due to the benefit of bonus depreciation. We're on target to achieve the revised upward earnings guidance of $1.69 to $1.71 we provided you in July. We remain on track to meet or exceed the full year EBITDA margin guidance, and we continue to see improvement in year-over-year volumes.
 Based on our strong earnings and cash flow visibility, our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of $400 million. In less than two years since the closing of our merger, we have completed the first successful large implementation integration in the solid waste industry on a timely basis. All operating locations are on a single IT platform. We have achieved $190 million of run rate synergies and exceeded our goal by 27%, and we have repaid $1.1 billion of debt and have the highest credit ratings in the industry. And we returned to Republic's long-term strategy of paying free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchase now and our annual dividend.
 Now I'd like to turn the call over to Don Slager to discuss our third quarter highlights.

Our third quarter results reflect our continued focus on safety, cost control, systems integration and intelligently pricing our business. Financial highlights for the third quarter and year-to-date are revenue of approximately $2.1 billion.",433," Thanks, Jim. Our third quarter results reflect our continued focus on safety, cost control, systems integration and intelligently pricing our business. Financial highlights for the third quarter and year-to-date are revenue of approximately $2.1 billion. This is the second consecutive quarter with [ph] positive internal growth. Net income adjusted primarily for merger-related expenses was $173 million, or $0.45 per share. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the third quarter was 30.8%. As Jim just mentioned, we are on track to meet or exceed our full year EBITDA margin guidance.
 Our field organization has maintained their focus on pricing, and continues to achieve open market pricing in excess of inflation. Core price increase for the third quarter was 1.5%. If we adjust for a few isolated areas were required to divest of operations, core price was approximately 2%.
 Our total price improvement, including fuel surcharges and higher commodity values was 2.6%. We continue to use our ROI pricing tools to be sure all business activity meets our requirements. Our volumes declined year-over-year by 2.5%, which is an 80 basis point improvement versus the second quarter. The areas that showed the strongest volume improvement were in the Commercial and Industrial businesses, with sequential improvements of 110 and 230 basis points respectively.
 Landfill special waste continues to be strong, which resulted in year-over-year volume growth in the Landfill business for the second quarter in a row. Third quarter adjusted free cash flow was $177 million and $579 million on a year-to-date basis. Adjusted free cash flow per share of $1.51 for the year is 117% of adjusted book earnings. As you know, free cash flow is the best measure of the quality of earnings.
 I would now like to mention a few of our achievements in the quarter that demonstrate our ongoing focus on cost controls. We continue to experience positive results from our safety initiatives, as accident frequency is down more than 15% compared to last year. Ensuring a safe environment is key to our long-term success. Our field management has continued to achieve labor productivity gains over the prior year, and reduce labor costs in an absolute dollars, as well as a percentage of revenue.
 We adjusted our maintenance headcount to the proper ratio of collection routes. This resulted in a lower maintenance cost per engine hour and reduction in maintenance costs as a percentage of revenue. I would like to thank our field operations for their commitment to achieving high-level of performance in all aspects of our business.
 I'll now turn the call over to Tod for a recap of our third quarter financial performance.

386225,114223888,86358,"Republic Services, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Republic Services, Inc.","Executives"," Thanks, Don. Third quarter of 2010 revenue, as Don indicated was $2.06 billion. After considering the impact of revenue from divested operations, same-store revenue increased by $2.4 million consisting of the following: Core price growth of a positive 1.",1702," Thanks, Don. Third quarter of 2010 revenue, as Don indicated was $2.06 billion. After considering the impact of revenue from divested operations, same-store revenue increased by $2.4 million consisting of the following: Core price growth of a positive 1.5%. In total, the collection line of business saw a price increase of 1.6% and the disposal business saw a price increase of 1.1%, with all lines of business reporting positive price increases in the third quarter. By now, a pricing was down sequentially, and this includes the impact of lower CPI in our indexed base business. As you know, approximately 50% of our customer contracts contain pricing restrictions. The majority tied to CPI.
 Within the Collection business, these restrictions are rated to Residential and Commercial businesses. The pricing on these contracts has been negatively impacted by the low levels of CPI. Our original 2010 guidance assumed the full year CPI of about 2.5%, and the most recent CPI for the month of September was 1.1%.
 Our landfill prices increased by 1.2%. Now this includes MSW, up 2.2%, partially offset by positive but relatively lower-priced Construction & Demolition and special waste event driven work. It's important to note that the majority of our MSW volume is tied to index-based pricing.
 We expect our full year 2010 price to approximate 1.6%. Commodity revenue, increase of 0.6%. Our commodity prices increased approximately 29% to an average of $119 per ton in the current quarter from $92 per ton in the prior year. Our third quarter commodity volume of 455,000 tons was down sequentially about 2% and relatively flat with the prior year.
 Current October commodity prices are approximately $134 a ton, an increase of $15 compared to the third quarter average. Now a fuel recovery fee had an increase of 0.5%. The increase in Fuel Recovery Fees relates to an increase in fuel costs. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $2.94 in the third quarter of 2010 from $2.60 in the prior year, with current fuel prices at $3.07 per gallon.
 Turning to our volumes. Our volumes were down 2.5%, this is a sequential improvement from the second quarter of about 80 basis points. We continue to see improvements in the Collection business, which is now down less than 3% over the prior year. You will recall last year, we saw a collection volume declines of over 8%.
 Volumes are also improving in all collection lines sequentially, led by industrial with a 230 basis point increase from the second quarter of 2010. This improvement reflects an increase in permanent hauls, primarily for manufacturing customers, and a more normal cyclical uptick from the temporary business.
 Now our landfill volumes had year-over-year growth of 1.4%. Last year, we saw landfill volume declines of over 18%. This improvement in volume is due to an increase in special waste received at our landfills.
 Now I'll turn to our third quarter year-over-year margins. Third quarter 2010 EBITDA margins decreased by 10 basis points to 30.8%, from 30.9% in the prior year. EBITDA margins exclude divestiture losses, restructuring charges, cost of achieve synergies and prior-year remediation recoveries. The decline in margin is driven by a 100 basis point increase in risk-insurance expense. As we said before, we do actuarial adjustments on a quarterly basis, and reserve adjustments tend to be lumpy.
 In the third quarter of 2009, we benefited from adjustments to prior period plans that did not repeat to the same level in the current third quarter. Year-to-date insurance expense is less in 2010 than 2009 and lower as a percentage of revenue. The increase in the current quarter was due to the timing, again, of actuarial adjustments. Excluding the change in risk insurance expense, our third quarter EBITDA margins improved 90 basis points over the prior year.
 Now I'll comment on some of the other changes in costs as a percentage of revenue. The details, of which are available on our website, and will be included in our 10-Q filing which are coming out in the next couple of days.
 First, fuel. The unfavorable fuel expense increase of 40 basis points was due to the 13% increase in the cost of diesel. And again, I indicated diesel prices of $2.94 in the third quarter versus $2.60 in the third quarter of the prior year. Partially offsetting this increase in fuel costs was an increase in related Fuel Recovery Fee revenue, resulting in a net decrease in EBITDA margin of about 10 basis points.
 Second, recycling cost of goods sold. The unfavorable 30 basis point increase in expense relates to increases in rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. Cost of goods sold at our recycling facilities increased to an average of $36 per ton from $27 in the prior year. Commodity revenue increases more than offset this increase in cost, resulting in an increase spread of approximately $18 per ton. The net impact was a favorable 30 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin.
 Third, labor and related benefits cost. The 10 basis point improvement in margin is primarily due to the synergy-related staffing reductions due to route consolidations in overlap markets, favorable reductions in health care claims and an overall improvement in collection productivity.
 Fourth, transfer and disposal cost. The 50 basis point improvement, again, primarily relates to the margin benefit of incremental landfill volumes that carry a little or no associated disposal cost.
 Next, transportation and subcontract expenses. The 20 basis point improvement in margin results from synergy-related cost reductions from redirecting waste streams within our more efficient transfer and disposal network.
 And finally, SG&A. SG&A, excluding cost to achieve synergies was approximately 9.8% compared to 10.5% in the prior year. The 70 basis point improvement in margin relates to the leverage benefit of reducing expenses while maintaining the revenue base, and a reduction also in incentive compensation expense. Looking ahead, we believe SG&A should be in the range of approximately 10%.
 These cost improvements collectively as a percentage of revenue are enabling us to meet or exceed our full year EBITDA margin guidance of 31%. Now let me turn to my attention to depreciation, depletion and amortization. This improved 40 basis points, which primarily relates to a reduction in landfill amortization expense and accretion. The accumulative impact of expansions and permit modifications that extended the life and reduced construction costs resulted in a favorable reduction in the per ton rate we charge as landfill aerospace is consumed. DD&A, as a percentage of revenue, approximated 11.2%. DD&A is higher than capital expenditures, as a percentage of revenue, due to the amortization of intangibles resulting from the merger.
 Looking at other aspects of our income statement, interest expense. I want to remind you that in interest expense, we have $24.3 million of non-cash amortization. As we continue to refinance our debt, the portion related to the Allied debt discount of approximately $11 million will decline.
 Now I'll discuss our free cash flow for the 9 months ended September 30. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $579 million, which consist of cash provided by operating activities of $964 million, less property and equipment receives of $535 million, plus the proceeds from the sale of used equipment of $17 million, plus merger-related expenditures net of tax of 16, plus divestiture-related tax payments of $6 million, plus the legacy tax settlement related to BFI of $111 million. That equals the adjusted free cash flow of $579 million.
 As Jim discussed earlier, we are raising our 2010 adjusted free cash flow guidance to $800 million. This includes the impact of the benefit from bonus depreciation expense of approximately $50 million, and also an increase in capital spending of about $45 million. Our previous guidance for capital spend was $790 million. And as a result of bonus depreciation, we are now planning to spend $835 million this year. Again, the $800 million of adjusted free cash flow includes both of these items.
 Just to remind you, we define free cash flow based upon capital expenditures received during the period, and we have included a reconciliation of the timing difference between capital expenditures received versus paid in our 8-K filing.
 Now let me talk briefly about our balance sheet. At September 30, our accounts receivable balance was $896 million and our days sales outstanding was 40 days, or 25 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $6.9 billion at September 30 and excess credit availability under our bank facility is approximately $1.4 billion.
 Onto our taxes. The tax rate included in adjusted EPS for the third quarter was lower than the full year estimate due to the closing out of certain state tax positions in the quarter. We expect full year 2010 tax rate for adjusted earnings to approximate 40.6%. Now this full year tax rate estimate includes the benefit of 1.1% arising from favorably resolving certain federal and state tax items.
 Before I turn the call back over to Don, I'd like to share a few comments about Jim, since this is his last conference call before he retires. Jim took over Republic in 1998. Revenues were about $1.4 billion, and we had about 10,000 employees. Since that time, revenues have increased over $8 billion. Margins have improved by 250 basis points and free cash flow has increased by almost 800%. And in the process, we were able to complete a very successful merger with Allied Waste and Republic Services.
 Now there's always a downside. And on the downside, Jim's handicap has led from 3 to 9, that's an unfavorable variance of 600 basis points. My outlook is, this will improve over the next few years. I think if Jim didn't retire soon, his handicap would be as high as mine, and that's trouble. In all seriousness, look, I speak for all of Republic employees. We've had 13 years of Jim's leadership, challenging our actions and business plans, open to debate, willing to accept other points of view, dealing directly and honestly with issues both good and bad. His legacy is strong. It's a strong team and a clear vision for the future of Republic. So thank you, Jim.
 Now I'll turn the call over to Don.

As we have said many times, this is a business that regularly produces earnings growth in the mid- to high-single digit percentage range. With the stock buyback, earnings growth can be in the low double-digit range. This has been Republic's track record, one of steady and consistent earnings growth.
 2010 earnings growth will be higher than usual because of the realization of synergies, including the benefit from refinancing activities. And since the majority of the synergy benefit has already been realized, about $0.01 of additional EPS benefit will roll over into 2011.
 Our approach to the business remain steady and consistent. Based on what we see in the economic and business environment, we expect 2011 EPS to grow by about 10%, which includes the benefit of our share repurchase program. We are currently in the middle of our 2011 business planning process, and we'll provide detailed guidance for 2011 in our Q4 earnings call in February.
 As you know, Jim will be retiring as CEO at the end of the year, now I'll become CEO at that time. We have had an orderly transition process during the past four months. Kevin Walbridge, who I recently named Executive Vice President in Operations, is now officed here in Phoenix. Kevin is an exceptional operating executive with deep industry experience. He is now actively involved in operating reviews and detailed planning as we develop our future business plan.
 This plan will constantly advance safety while gaining productivity. This plan will persistently price our assets and services while protecting our business and getting our share of market opportunity. This plan will continually elevate customer experience and employee engagement while controlling costs. As I said before, steady and consistent.
 We have an outstanding team at Republic, and we're maintaining our focus on improving return on invested capital, increasing free cash flow and returning our strong free cash flow to shareholders.
 Before I turn the call over to Jim to wrap up our review of the quarter, I'd like to thank him publicly for his leadership in building a great company. I want to thank him personally for his support and guidance that he has given me over the past several years. And on behalf of the entire team expressed our appreciation for his many years of devotion to the people and to the owners of Republic Services. Thank you, Jim.

Maybe more importantly, I need to thank all of the employees of Republic Services for allowing me to take a ride with them. So it's been 12 years that I've been the CEO of Republic Services. You, we have achieved many successes during that period of time and delivered a total return to our shareholders of over 178%. During that same period, the S&P had a total return of 26%.
 More importantly, I've had the privilege of being the CEO of an organization that has the strongest management team, has met the challenges of economic uncertainty, set industry standards for financial transparency and disclosure, and never lost its commitment to developing future leaders and reinvesting in the best operating platform in the industry.
 I've worked with Don and known Don for much longer than the two years that the company have come together. I have total confidence in Don's leadership and in his ability to take the company to the next plateau. And as I can tell you, he is as focused as I have been in continuing to improve shareholder value.
 Thanks again to our field management team for delivering our standard results in 2010. And, again, thanks to everyone out there for taking me along for the ride.

When we talk about churn internally, we're talking about the spread between what we sell new business at and what we lose business at. So when we talk about defection, some people sometimes use that word churn to describe defection. Defection is the amount of business that we lose in a given year. And part of that defection is structural, which is bankruptcies and businesses closing. Part of that defection is competitive. So our defection rate has been consistent over the last several quarters, it's actually down just slightly. So when we haven't seen much change really in the makeup of that defection being generally half competitive and half being structural. On the churn, we've seen pretty consistent rates in the dollar per unit that we're losing revenue at. And I would say on a multi-quarter basis pretty consistent in what we're losing or we're residing a new business at. So not much movement there overall.

So if you think of our business, 40 states, we managed it through 28 area of teams, but we're in 200 marketplaces, a little bit over 200 marketplaces across the United States. So when we look at in isolation several markets, there are a couple of markets that are really driving some pricing pressures, some negative price. And one of those is L.A., it's a very competitive marketplace. It has been for many years. We've got a very great landfill position there. We've talked to many of you before about the fact that there is a big municipal landfill in the marketplace that used to close by 11:00. Today, they're open all day long. That changes the dynamic in the marketplace. We had to divest over landfill in that market as position of the merger that causes a certain competitive aspect with the new dynamic in the marketplace that will take a couple of years to sort of settle itself out. So again, that at another market, Houston. And again, a very competitive marketplace, another divestiture market. We've had some activity there. We've had -- we shared with you, I think, many quarters ago now, we had to take a price reduction in one of our large municipal transfer station contracts there, and we're about to anniversary there I think the next quarter I think. And so those things tend to play havoc with our numbers, but in the other marketplaces, and that was my comment earlier, when you factor out those isolated issues in the broad section of our marketplaces, we're getting 2% PI. And so our goal is always to, in absolute terms, get a spread between absolute inflation and absolute price, right. And so that's how we get margin expansion. If you look at our numbers, you're seeing margin expansion. So when we talk about price, remember, we're talking about absolute price, which includes the effects of churn, includes the effects of mix, okay. It's a pure price number. And so as long as we can continue to price that spread between real inflation and real price, we're going to continue to give you margin expansion, and that's what you're seeing in our numbers today.

In a couple of cases, where we've had, in one case, a large competitor who has had their own landfill but it was 70 to 80 miles away, I think, and for many years, they run to a contract with us. The contract was below market. The contract came to term. We try to negotiate a price that was more consistent with market, they elected to drive the extra distance their own landfill. We've got a few other examples like that. We've got a landfill that we sold in the divestiture in the Midwest to a competitor. And the first thing they did with it was go out and secure some waste in the market so they could pay the mortgage on that new landfill. And not unexpected, we've seen this happening in the past. And these things take a little while but to settle down, but it did show up in our volume this quarter.

We're hopeful that we'd see a little more of that continue. We haven't seen it continue. We haven't seen a further decline, but we haven't seen it build. And so we're kind of patiently waiting for those volumes to come back to us and for our customer's businesses to improve, but we haven't got anything better to report on that.

When the economy's tough and challenged and CPI is low and customers are sensitive, it will be closer to 50 bips.

And some of that is directly related to the fact that we priced that business and some of that volume, those customers have chosen to leave and move on to another disposal site, in many cases, many miles farther than ours. And we've allowed  that business to leave. And we're going to continue to take that approach. These landfills are too costly and too valuable just to get the air space and so on. So we're going to continue to do that. But I'd like to see our price be higher at the landfill? Absolutely I would. And we're looking at that as well. We're looking at that not only to our third-party customers but our own internal customers. So we're going to continue to focus on it.

I'm very pleased to report that we continue to achieve record performance in a weak but stable economy. We are raising our free cash flow guidance to $800 million due to the benefit of bonus depreciation. We're on target to achieve the revised upward earnings guidance of $1.69 to $1.71 we provided you in July. We remain on track to meet or exceed the full year EBITDA margin guidance, and we continue to see improvement in year-over-year volumes. 
Based on our strong earnings and cash flow visibility, our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of $400 million. In less than two years since the closing of our merger, we have completed the first successful large implementation integration in the solid waste industry on a timely basis. All operating locations are on a single IT platform. We have achieved $190 million of run rate synergies and exceeded our goal by 27%, and we have repaid $1.1 billion of debt and have the highest credit ratings in the industry. And we returned to Republic's long-term strategy of paying free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchase now and our annual dividend. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Don Slager to discuss our third quarter highlights."

Our third quarter results reflect our continued focus on safety, cost control, systems integration and intelligently pricing our business. Financial highlights for the third quarter and year-to-date are revenue of approximately $2.1 billion.",434,"Thanks, Jim. Our third quarter results reflect our continued focus on safety, cost control, systems integration and intelligently pricing our business. Financial highlights for the third quarter and year-to-date are revenue of approximately $2.1 billion. This is the second consecutive quarter with [ph] positive internal growth. Net income adjusted primarily for merger-related expenses was $173 million, or $0.45 per share. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the third quarter was 30.8%. As Jim just mentioned, we are on track to meet or exceed our full year EBITDA margin guidance. 
Our field organization has maintained their focus on pricing, and continues to achieve open market pricing in excess of inflation. Core price increase for the third quarter was 1.5%. If we adjust for a few isolated areas were required to divest of operations, core price was approximately 2%.
Our total price improvement, including fuel surcharges and higher commodity values was 2.6%. We continue to use our ROI pricing tools to be sure all business activity meets our requirements. Our volumes declined year-over-year by 2.5%, which is an 80 basis point improvement versus the second quarter. The areas that showed the strongest volume improvement were in the Commercial and Industrial businesses, with sequential improvements of 110 and 230 basis points respectively. 
Landfill special waste continues to be strong, which resulted in year-over-year volume growth in the Landfill business for the second quarter in a row. Third quarter adjusted free cash flow was $177 million and $579 million on a year-to-date basis. Adjusted free cash flow per share of $1.51 for the year is 117% of adjusted book earnings. As you know, free cash flow is the best measure of the quality of earnings.
I would now like to mention a few of our achievements in the quarter that demonstrate our ongoing focus on cost controls. We continue to experience positive results from our safety initiatives, as accident frequency is down more than 15% compared to last year. Ensuring a safe environment is key to our long-term success. Our field management has continued to achieve labor productivity gains over the prior year, and reduce labor costs in an absolute dollars, as well as a percentage of revenue.
We adjusted our maintenance headcount to the proper ratio of collection routes. This resulted in a lower maintenance cost per engine hour and reduction in maintenance costs as a percentage of revenue. I would like to thank our field operations for their commitment to achieving high level of performance in all aspects of our business. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tod for a recap of our third quarter financial performance."

Third quarter of 2010 revenue, as Don indicated was $2.06 billion. After considering the impact of revenue from divested operations, same-store revenue increased by $2.4 million consisting of the following: Core price growth of a positive 1.5",1701,"Thanks, Don. Third quarter of 2010 revenue, as Don indicated was $2.06 billion. After considering the impact of revenue from divested operations, same-store revenue increased by $2.4 million consisting of the following: Core price growth of a positive 1.5%. In total, the collection line of business saw a price increase of 1.6% and the disposal business saw a price increase of 1.1%, with all lines of business reporting positive price increases in the third quarter. By now, our pricing was down sequentially, and this includes the impact of lower CPI in our indexed base business. As you know, approximately 50% of our customer contracts contain pricing restrictions. The majority tied to CPI.
Within the Collection business, these restrictions are rated to Residential and Commercial businesses. The pricing on these contracts has been negatively impacted by the low levels of CPI. Our original 2010 guidance assumed the full year CPI of about 2.5%, and the most recent CPI for the month of September was 1.1%. 
Our landfill prices increased by 1.2%. Now this includes MSW, up 2.2%, partially offset by positive but relatively lower-priced Construction & Demolition and special waste event-driven work. It's important to note that the majority of our MSW volume is tied to index-based pricing.
We expect our full year 2010 price to approximate 1.6%. Commodity revenue, increase of 0.6%. Our commodity prices increased approximately 29% to an average of $119 per ton in the current quarter from $92 per ton in the prior year. Our third quarter commodity volume of 455,000 tons was down sequentially about 2% and relatively flat with the prior year.
Current October commodity prices are approximately $134 a ton, an increase of $15 compared to the third quarter average. Now a fuel recovery fee had an increase of 0.5%. The increase in Fuel Recovery Fees relates to an increase in fuel costs. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $2.94 in the third quarter of 2010 from $2.60 in the prior year, with current fuel prices at $3.07 per gallon.
Turning to our volumes. Our volumes were down 2.5%, this is a sequential improvement from the second quarter of about 80 basis points. We continue to see improvements in the Collection business, which is now down less than 3% over the prior year. You will recall last year, we saw a collection volume declines of over 8%. 
Volumes are also improving in all collection lines sequentially, led by industrial with a 230 basis point increase from the second quarter of 2010. This improvement reflects an increase in permanent hauls, primarily for manufacturing customers, and a more normal cyclical uptick from the temporary business. 
Now our landfill volumes had year-over-year growth of 1.4%. Last year, we saw landfill volume declines of over 18%. This improvement in volume is due to an increase in special waste received at our landfills.
Now I'll turn to our third quarter year-over-year margins. Third quarter 2010 EBITDA margins decreased by 10 basis points to 30.8%, from 30.9% in the prior year. EBITDA margins exclude divestiture losses, restructuring charges, cost of achieve synergies and prior-year remediation recoveries. The decline in margin is driven by a 100 basis point increase in risk-insurance expense. As we said before, we do actuarial adjustments on a quarterly basis, and reserve adjustments tend to be lumpy. 
In the third quarter of 2009, we benefited from adjustments to prior period plans that did not repeat to the same level in the current third quarter. Year-to-date insurance expense is less in 2010 than 2009 and lower as a percentage of revenue. The increase in the current quarter was due to the timing, again, of actuarial adjustments. Excluding the change in risk insurance expense, our third quarter EBITDA margins improved 90 basis points over the prior year. 
Now I'll comment on some of the other changes in costs as a percentage of revenue. The details, of which are available on our website, and will be included in our 10-Q filing which are coming out in the next couple of days.
First, fuel. The unfavorable fuel expense increase of 40 basis points was due to the 13% increase in the cost of diesel. And again, I indicated diesel prices of $2.94 in the third quarter versus $2.60 in the third quarter of the prior year. Partially offsetting this increase in fuel costs was an increase in related Fuel Recovery Fee revenue, resulting in a net decrease in EBITDA margin of about 10 basis points. 
Second, recycling cost of goods sold. The unfavorable 30 basis point increase in expense relates to increases in rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. Cost of goods sold at our recycling facilities increased to an average of $36 per ton from $27 in the prior year. Commodity revenue increases more than offset this increase in cost, resulting in an increased spread of approximately $18 per ton. The net impact was a favorable 30 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin.
Third, labor and related benefits cost. The 10 basis point improvement in margin is primarily due to the synergy-related staffing reductions due to route consolidations in overlap markets, favorable reductions in health care claims and an overall improvement in collection productivity. 
Fourth, transfer and disposal cost. The 50 basis point improvement, again, primarily relates to the margin benefit of incremental landfill volumes that carry a little or no associated disposal cost. 
Next, transportation and subcontract expenses. The 20 basis point improvement in margin results from synergy-related cost reductions from redirecting waste streams within our more efficient transfer and disposal network. 
And finally, SG&A. SG&A, excluding cost to achieve synergies was approximately 9.8% compared to 10.5% in the prior year. The 70 basis point improvement in margin relates to the leverage benefit of reducing expenses while maintaining the revenue base, and a reduction also in incentive compensation expense. Looking ahead, we believe SG&A should be in the range of approximately 10%.
These cost improvements collectively as a percentage of revenue are enabling us to meet or exceed our full year EBITDA margin guidance of 31%. Now let me turn to my attention to depreciation, depletion and amortization. This improved 40 basis points, which primarily relates to a reduction in landfill amortization expense and accretion. The accumulative impact of expansions and permit modifications that extended the life and reduced construction costs resulted in a favorable reduction in the per ton rate we charge as landfill aerospace is consumed. DD&A, as a percentage of revenue, approximated 11.2%. DD&A is higher than capital expenditures, as a percentage of revenue, due to the amortization of intangibles resulting from the merger.
Looking at other aspects of our income statement, interest expense. I want to remind you that in interest expense, we have $24.3 million of non-cash amortization. As we continue to refinance our debt, the portion related to the Allied debt discount of approximately $11 million will decline. 
Now I'll discuss our free cash flow for the 9 months ended September 30. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $579 million, which consists of cash provided by operating activities of $964 million, less property and equipment receives of $535 million, plus the proceeds from the sale of used equipment of $17 million, plus merger-related expenditures net of tax of 16, plus divestiture-related tax payments of $6 million, plus the legacy tax settlement related to BFI of $111 million. That equals the adjusted free cash flow of $579 million.
As Jim discussed earlier, we are raising our 2010 adjusted free cash flow guidance to $800 million. This includes the impact of the benefit from bonus depreciation expense of approximately $50 million, and also an increase in capital spending of about $45 million. Our previous guidance for capital spend was $790 million. And as a result of bonus depreciation, we are now planning to spend $835 million this year. Again, the $800 million of adjusted free cash flow includes both of these items.
Just to remind you, we define free cash flow based upon capital expenditures received during the period, and we have included a reconciliation of the timing difference between capital expenditures received versus paid in our 8-K filing. 
Now let me talk briefly about our balance sheet. At September 30, our accounts receivable balance was $896 million and our days sales outstanding was 40 days, or 25 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $6.9 billion at September 30 and excess credit availability under our bank facility is approximately $1.4 billion. 
Onto our taxes. The tax rate included in adjusted EPS for the third quarter was lower than the full year estimate due to the closing out of certain state tax positions in the quarter. We expect full year 2010 tax rate for adjusted earnings to approximate 40.6%. Now this full year tax rate estimate includes the benefit of 1.1% arising from favorably resolving certain federal and state tax items.
Before I turn the call back over to Don, I'd like to share a few comments about Jim, since this is his last conference call before he retires. Jim took over Republic in 1998. Revenues were about $1.4 billion, and we had about 10,000 employees. Since that time, revenues have increased over $8 billion. Margins have improved by 250 basis points and free cash flow has increased by almost 800%. And in the process, we were able to complete a very successful merger with Allied Waste and Republic Services. 
Now there's always a downside. And on the downside, Jim's handicap has led from 3 to 9, that's an unfavorable variance of 600 basis points. My outlook is, this will improve over the next few years. I think if Jim didn't retire soon, his handicap would be as high as mine, and that's trouble. In all seriousness, look, I speak for all of Republic employees. We've had 13 years of Jim's leadership, challenging our actions and business plans, open to debate, willing to accept other points of view, dealing directly and honestly with issues both good and bad. His legacy is strong. It's a strong team and a clear vision for the future of Republic. So thank you, Jim. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Don."

As we have said many times, this is a business that regularly produces earnings growth in the mid- to high-single digit percentage range. With the stock buyback, earnings growth can be in the low double-digit range. This has been Republic's track record, one of steady and consistent earnings growth. 
2010 earnings growth will be higher than usual because of the realization of synergies, including the benefit from refinancing activities. And since the majority of the synergy benefit has already been realized, about $0.01 of additional EPS benefit will roll over into 2011. 
Our approach to the business remain steady and consistent. Based on what we see in the economic and business environment, we expect 2011 EPS to grow by about 10%, which includes the benefit of our share repurchase program. We are currently in the middle of our 2011 business planning process, and we'll provide detailed guidance for 2011 in our Q4 earnings call in February. 
As you know, Jim will be retiring as CEO at the end of the year, now I'll become CEO at that time. We have had an orderly transition process during the past four months. Kevin Walbridge, who I recently named Executive Vice President in Operations, is now officed here in Phoenix. Kevin is an exceptional operating executive with deep industry experience. He is now actively involved in operating reviews and detailed planning as we develop our future business plan.
This plan will constantly advance safety while gaining productivity. This plan will persistently price our assets and services while protecting our business and getting our share of market opportunity. This plan will continually elevate customer experience and employee engagement while controlling costs. As I said before, steady and consistent. 
We have an outstanding team at Republic, and we're maintaining our focus on improving return on invested capital, increasing free cash flow and returning our strong free cash flow to shareholders. 
Before I turn the call over to Jim to wrap up our review of the quarter, I'd like to thank him publicly for his leadership in building a great company. I want to thank him personally for his support and guidance that he has given me over the past several years. And on behalf of the entire team expressed our appreciation for his many years of devotion to the people and to the owners of Republic Services. Thank you, Jim."

When we talk about churn internally, we're talking about the spread between what we sell new business at and what we lose business at. So when we talk about defection, some people sometimes use that word churn to describe defection. Defection is the amount of business that we lose in a given year. And part of that defection is structural, which is bankruptcies and businesses closing. Part of that defection is competitive. So our defection rate has been consistent over the last several quarters, it's actually down just slightly. So when we haven't seen much change really in the makeup of that defection being generally half competitive and half being structural. On the churn, we've seen pretty consistent rates in the dollar per unit that we're losing revenue at. And I would say on a multi-quarter basis pretty consistent in what we're losing or we're residing a new business at. So not much movement there overall."

This thing now has been going on somewhat, let's say, three years. Customers are more sensitive to price, and that's just the nature sort of economics one-to-one, right. So we are still pricing persistently, as I said in my comments, we're going to continue to do that. That's just part of our business model. We think the assets that we own allow us to continue to do that. So it's always been a very competitive business. That's still the case today. Customers are a little more sensitive than it has been in the past. We have municipalities who have been feeling the pain of a better economy for a number of years. And these are long partnerships that we've had that. In some cases, we're repricing a little, but a little bit of that business today, more than we have in years past.

So if you think of our business, 40 states, we managed it through 28 area of teams, but we're in 200 marketplaces, a little bit over 200 marketplaces across the United States. So when we look at in isolation several markets, there are a couple of markets that are really driving some pricing pressures, some negative price. And one of those is L.A., it's a very competitive marketplace. It has been for many years. We've got a very great landfill position there. We've talked to many of you before about the fact that there is a big municipal landfill in the marketplace that used to close by 11:00. Today, they're open all day long. That changes the dynamic in the marketplace. We had to divest over landfill in that market as position of the merger that causes a certain competitive aspect with the new dynamic in the marketplace that will take a couple of years to sort of settle itself out. So again, that at another market, Houston. And again, a very competitive marketplace, another divestiture market. We've had some activity there. We've had -- we shared with you, I think, many quarters ago now, we had to take a price reduction in one of our large municipal transfer station contracts there, and we're about to anniversary there I think the next quarter I think. And so those things tend to play havoc with our numbers, but in the other marketplaces, and that was my comment earlier, when you factor out those isolated issues in the broad section of our marketplaces, we're getting 2% PI. And so our goal is always to, in absolute terms, get a spread between absolute inflation and absolute price, right. And so that's how we get margin expansion. If you look at our numbers, you're seeing margin expansion. So when we talk about price, remember, we're talking about absolute price, which includes the effects of churn, includes the effects of mix, okay. It's a pure price number. And so as long as we can continue to price that spread between real inflation and real price, we're going to continue to give you margin expansion, and that's what you're seeing in our numbers today."

So it's land clearing for development of a government facility. So I don't know that, that necessarily reflects a change in our outlook on commercial construction because it's the government. Normally, when we start to see nice special waste jobs because their clearing soil from old industrial sides of building the commercial real estate, again, that's more of a private sector issue. We haven't begun to see any of that yet. The other large job is a mandated cleanup that EPA mandated. And so there really wasn't a lot of flexibility in that. One of the things we think about in special waste is when, let's say, a large industry maybe a steel mill has a stockpile of special waste and their budgets free up a little bit and they have some discretionary spending, and then they'll start to move some of that material. So it tends to be an indicator of discretionary spending easing up, but we'll keep you posted."

And as far as our service decreases, we haven't seen any further signs of service decreasing, but have not yet seen the signs of life on the increasing side. So what we'd like to be able to tell you is that, at some point, we'll see container weights improve. So as customers throw out more waste, the container waste per pounds pretty are decreased, and that converts it at some point to service increases. But we're watching diligently for that, just have not seen yet any movement. On the volume side, we did see some decline in MSW at the landfill, which is driven our volume numbers a little bit. And that's what we would kind of describe as competitive MSW. In a couple of cases, where we've had, in one case, a large competitor who has had their own landfill but it was 70 to 80 miles away, I think, and for many years, they run to a contract with us. The contract was below market. The contract came to term. We try to negotiate a price that was more consistent with market, they elected to drive the extra distance their own landfill. We've got a few other examples like that. We've got a landfill that we sold in the divestiture in the Midwest to a competitor. And the first thing they did with it was go out and secure some waste in the market so they could pay the mortgage on that new landfill. And not unexpected, we've seen this happening in the past. And these things take a little while but to settle down, but it did show up in our volume this quarter."

On the second quarter call, we shared with you some new life we were seeing in certain parts of our business we've shared. Specifically, we saw some manufacturing coming back in the East, in the Midwest. And it was kind of a new revelation for us, we hadn't seen anything like that in a number of quarters. So we were anxious to share it with you, and tell you that we're seeing some life out there in the economy. And we're hoping that it would continue. Just like when the economy started to fall away from us a couple of years ago, we saw it start in the East go to the Midwest then go West itself after that, and we saw start to gain momentum in these few examples we shared in the East to Midwest. We're hopeful that we'd see a little more of that continue. We haven't seen it continue. We haven't seen a further decline, but we haven't seen it build. And so we're kind of patiently waiting for those volumes to come back to us and for our customer's businesses to improve, but we haven't got anything better to report on that. So it's just kind of steady at this point. No further decline, no further improvement and we're hanging in there. And I think as we do get some of that volume coming back our way, we'll get our share as I said, and we'll see some operating leverage as a result."

And so that mix tends to play a little havoc with us there, but it's kind of a 12-month lag that worked our way through of all that about CPI noise. But nevertheless, our focus, as I said, is to get in absolute terms that spread. And as we've said many times, we think we can get 50 bips into a 150 bips of price in that spread between true inflation and price. When the economy's tough and challenged and CPI is low and customers are sensitive, it will be closer to 50 bips. The economy's screaming and inflation is high and people are less concerned, we get better pricing. And so that's where we're going to focus."

But I'll tell you, we look at it a little differently across lines of business. And we've talked about the fact that we've had to reprice some of our large residential business because of CPI, the timing of CPI because customers have come to us and said, ""Look, I'm willing to extend the contract, but I need a price concessions."" We've been successful price over the years. We've got a good partnership. We've done some of that. So we make intelligent price decisions with our existing customer base just to keep our business. It's really profitable work. We're through the days of pricing that negative tail that we used to talk about. It's a waste in the landfills. And you said it, Corey, these landfills they're expensive to build, to develop, they're expensive to operate. The environmental rules continued to get more stringent. We're going to spend a couple of million dollars a year or next year more in air quality, controls and testing. That's going to continue to impact the price of landfills. These landfills are expensive to own into infinity and it's a release to landfill pricing. We continue to move landfill pricing up. As I said earlier, we talked about some of the volume, and we're down year-over-year in MSW and the landfill. And some of that is directly related to the fact that we priced that business and some of that volume, those customers have chosen to leave and move on to another disposal site, in many cases, many miles farther than ours. And we've allowed  that business to leave. And we're going to continue to take that approach. These landfills are too costly and too valuable just to get the air space and so on. So we're going to continue to do that. But I'd like to see our price be higher at the landfill? Absolutely I would. And we're looking at that as well.

I'm very pleased to report that we continue to achieve record performance in a weak but stable economy. We are raising our free cash flow guidance to $800 million due to the benefit of bonus depreciation. We're on target to achieve the revised upward earnings guidance of $1.69 to $1.71 we provided you in July. We remain on track to meet or exceed the full year EBITDA margin guidance, and we continue to see improvement in year-over-year volumes. 
Based on our strong earnings and cash flow visibility, our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of $400 million. In less than two years since the closing of our merger, we have completed the first successful large implementation integration in the solid waste industry on a timely basis. All operating locations are on a single IT platform. We have achieved $190 million of run rate synergies and exceeded our goal by 27%, and we have repaid $1.1 billion of debt and have the highest credit ratings in the industry. And we returned to Republic's long-term strategy of paying free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchase now and our annual dividend.

Our third quarter results reflect our continued focus on safety, cost control, systems integration and intelligently pricing our business. Financial highlights for the third quarter and year-to-date are revenue of approximately $2.1 billion. This is the second consecutive quarter with [ph] positive internal growth. Net income adjusted primarily for merger-related expenses was $173 million, or $0.45 per share. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the third quarter was 30.8%. As Jim just mentioned, we are on track to meet or exceed our full year EBITDA margin guidance. 
Our field organization has maintained their focus on pricing, and continues to achieve open market pricing in excess of inflation. Core price increase for the third quarter was 1.5%. If we adjust for a few isolated areas were required to divest of operations, core price was approximately 2%.
Our total price improvement, including fuel surcharges and higher commodity values was 2.6%. We continue to use our ROI pricing tools to be sure all business activity meets our requirements. Our volumes declined year-over-year by 2.5%, which is an 80 basis point improvement versus the second quarter. The areas that showed the strongest volume improvement were in the Commercial and Industrial businesses, with sequential improvements of 110 and 230 basis points respectively. 
Landfill special waste continues to be strong, which resulted in year-over-year volume growth in the Landfill business for the second quarter in a row. Third quarter adjusted free cash flow was $177 million and $579 million on a year-to-date basis. Adjusted free cash flow per share of $1.51 for the year is 117% of adjusted book earnings. As you know, free cash flow is the best measure of the quality of earnings.
I would now like to mention a few of our achievements in the quarter that demonstrate our ongoing focus on cost controls. We continue to experience positive results from our safety initiatives, as accident frequency is down more than 15% compared to last year. Ensuring a safe environment is key to our long-term success. Our field management has continued to achieve labor productivity gains over the prior year, and reduce labor costs in an absolute dollars, as well as a percentage of revenue.
We adjusted our maintenance headcount to the proper ratio of collection routes. This resulted in a lower maintenance cost per engine hour and reduction in maintenance costs as a percentage of revenue. I would like to thank our field operations for their commitment to achieving high level of performance in all aspects of our business.

After considering the impact of revenue from divested operations, same-store revenue increased by $2.4 million consisting of the following: Core price growth of a positive 1.5",1701,"Thanks, Don. Third quarter of 2010 revenue, as Don indicated was $2.06 billion. After considering the impact of revenue from divested operations, same-store revenue increased by $2.4 million consisting of the following: Core price growth of a positive 1.5%. In total, the collection line of business saw a price increase of 1.6% and the disposal business saw a price increase of 1.1%, with all lines of business reporting positive price increases in the third quarter. By now, our pricing was down sequentially, and this includes the impact of lower CPI in our indexed base business. As you know, approximately 50% of our customer contracts contain pricing restrictions. The majority tied to CPI.
Within the Collection business, these restrictions are rated to Residential and Commercial businesses. The pricing on these contracts has been negatively impacted by the low levels of CPI. Our original 2010 guidance assumed the full year CPI of about 2.5%, and the most recent CPI for the month of September was 1.1%. 
Our landfill prices increased by 1.2%. Now this includes MSW, up 2.2%, partially offset by positive but relatively lower-priced Construction & Demolition and special waste event-driven work. It's important to note that the majority of our MSW volume is tied to index-based pricing.
We expect our full year 2010 price to approximate 1.6%. Commodity revenue, increase of 0.6%. Our commodity prices increased approximately 29% to an average of $119 per ton in the current quarter from $92 per ton in the prior year. Our third quarter commodity volume of 455,000 tons was down sequentially about 2% and relatively flat with the prior year.
Current October commodity prices are approximately $134 a ton, an increase of $15 compared to the third quarter average. Now a fuel recovery fee had an increase of 0.5%. The increase in Fuel Recovery Fees relates to an increase in fuel costs. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $2.94 in the third quarter of 2010 from $2.60 in the prior year, with current fuel prices at $3.07 per gallon.
Turning to our volumes. Our volumes were down 2.5%, this is a sequential improvement from the second quarter of about 80 basis points. We continue to see improvements in the Collection business, which is now down less than 3% over the prior year. You will recall last year, we saw a collection volume declines of over 8%. 
Volumes are also improving in all collection lines sequentially, led by industrial with a 230 basis point increase from the second quarter of 2010. This improvement reflects an increase in permanent hauls, primarily for manufacturing customers, and a more normal cyclical uptick from the temporary business. 
Now our landfill volumes had year-over-year growth of 1.4%. Last year, we saw landfill volume declines of over 18%. This improvement in volume is due to an increase in special waste received at our landfills.
Now I'll turn to our third quarter year-over-year margins. Third quarter 2010 EBITDA margins decreased by 10 basis points to 30.8%, from 30.9% in the prior year. EBITDA margins exclude divestiture losses, restructuring charges, cost of achieve synergies and prior-year remediation recoveries. The decline in margin is driven by a 100 basis point increase in risk-insurance expense. As we said before, we do actuarial adjustments on a quarterly basis, and reserve adjustments tend to be lumpy. 
In the third quarter of 2009, we benefited from adjustments to prior period plans that did not repeat to the same level in the current third quarter. Year-to-date insurance expense is less in 2010 than 2009 and lower as a percentage of revenue. The increase in the current quarter was due to the timing, again, of actuarial adjustments. Excluding the change in risk insurance expense, our third quarter EBITDA margins improved 90 basis points over the prior year. 
Now I'll comment on some of the other changes in costs as a percentage of revenue. The details, of which are available on our website, and will be included in our 10-Q filing which are coming out in the next couple of days.
First, fuel. The unfavorable fuel expense increase of 40 basis points was due to the 13% increase in the cost of diesel. And again, I indicated diesel prices of $2.94 in the third quarter versus $2.60 in the third quarter of the prior year. Partially offsetting this increase in fuel costs was an increase in related Fuel Recovery Fee revenue, resulting in a net decrease in EBITDA margin of about 10 basis points. 
Second, recycling cost of goods sold. The unfavorable 30 basis point increase in expense relates to increases in rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. Cost of goods sold at our recycling facilities increased to an average of $36 per ton from $27 in the prior year. Commodity revenue increases more than offset this increase in cost, resulting in an increased spread of approximately $18 per ton. The net impact was a favorable 30 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin.
Third, labor and related benefits cost. The 10 basis point improvement in margin is primarily due to the synergy-related staffing reductions due to route consolidations in overlap markets, favorable reductions in health care claims and an overall improvement in collection productivity. 
Fourth, transfer and disposal cost. The 50 basis point improvement, again, primarily relates to the margin benefit of incremental landfill volumes that carry a little or no associated disposal cost. 
Next, transportation and subcontract expenses. The 20 basis point improvement in margin results from synergy-related cost reductions from redirecting waste streams within our more efficient transfer and disposal network. 
And finally, SG&A. SG&A, excluding cost to achieve synergies was approximately 9.8% compared to 10.5% in the prior year. The 70 basis point improvement in margin relates to the leverage benefit of reducing expenses while maintaining the revenue base, and a reduction also in incentive compensation expense. Looking ahead, we believe SG&A should be in the range of approximately 10%.
These cost improvements collectively as a percentage of revenue are enabling us to meet or exceed our full year EBITDA margin guidance of 31%. Now let me turn to my attention to depreciation, depletion and amortization. This improved 40 basis points, which primarily relates to a reduction in landfill amortization expense and accretion. The accumulative impact of expansions and permit modifications that extended the life and reduced construction costs resulted in a favorable reduction in the per ton rate we charge as landfill aerospace is consumed. DD&A, as a percentage of revenue, approximated 11.2%. DD&A is higher than capital expenditures, as a percentage of revenue, due to the amortization of intangibles resulting from the merger.
Looking at other aspects of our income statement, interest expense. I want to remind you that in interest expense, we have $24.3 million of non-cash amortization. As we continue to refinance our debt, the portion related to the Allied debt discount of approximately $11 million will decline. 
Now I'll discuss our free cash flow for the 9 months ended September 30. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $579 million, which consists of cash provided by operating activities of $964 million, less property and equipment receives of $535 million, plus the proceeds from the sale of used equipment of $17 million, plus merger-related expenditures net of tax of 16, plus divestiture-related tax payments of $6 million, plus the legacy tax settlement related to BFI of $111 million. That equals the adjusted free cash flow of $579 million.
As Jim discussed earlier, we are raising our 2010 adjusted free cash flow guidance to $800 million. This includes the impact of the benefit from bonus depreciation expense of approximately $50 million, and also an increase in capital spending of about $45 million. Our previous guidance for capital spend was $790 million. And as a result of bonus depreciation, we are now planning to spend $835 million this year. Again, the $800 million of adjusted free cash flow includes both of these items.
Just to remind you, we define free cash flow based upon capital expenditures received during the period, and we have included a reconciliation of the timing difference between capital expenditures received versus paid in our 8-K filing. 
Now let me talk briefly about our balance sheet. At September 30, our accounts receivable balance was $896 million and our days sales outstanding was 40 days, or 25 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $6.9 billion at September 30 and excess credit availability under our bank facility is approximately $1.4 billion. 
Onto our taxes. The tax rate included in adjusted EPS for the third quarter was lower than the full year estimate due to the closing out of certain state tax positions in the quarter. We expect full year 2010 tax rate for adjusted earnings to approximate 40.6%. Now this full year tax rate estimate includes the benefit of 1.1% arising from favorably resolving certain federal and state tax items.
Before I turn the call back over to Don, I'd like to share a few comments about Jim, since this is his last conference call before he retires. Jim took over Republic in 1998. Revenues were about $1.4 billion, and we had about 10,000 employees. Since that time, revenues have increased over $8 billion. Margins have improved by 250 basis points and free cash flow has increased by almost 800%. And in the process, we were able to complete a very successful merger with Allied Waste and Republic Services. 
Now there's always a downside. And on the downside, Jim's handicap has led from 3 to 9, that's an unfavorable variance of 600 basis points. My outlook is, this will improve over the next few years. I think if Jim didn't retire soon, his handicap would be as high as mine, and that's trouble. In all seriousness, look, I speak for all of Republic employees. We've had 13 years of Jim's leadership, challenging our actions and business plans, open to debate, willing to accept other points of view, dealing directly and honestly with issues both good and bad. His legacy is strong. It's a strong team and a clear vision for the future of Republic. So thank you, Jim. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Don."

As we have said many times, this is a business that regularly produces earnings growth in the mid- to high-single digit percentage range. With the stock buyback, earnings growth can be in the low double-digit range. This has been Republic's track record, one of steady and consistent earnings growth. 
2010 earnings growth will be higher than usual because of the realization of synergies, including the benefit from refinancing activities. And since the majority of the synergy benefit has already been realized, about $0.01 of additional EPS benefit will roll over into 2011. 
Our approach to the business remain steady and consistent. Based on what we see in the economic and business environment, we expect 2011 EPS to grow by about 10%, which includes the benefit of our share repurchase program. We are currently in the middle of our 2011 business planning process, and we'll provide detailed guidance for 2011 in our Q4 earnings call in February. 
As you know, Jim will be retiring as CEO at the end of the year, now I'll become CEO at that time. We have had an orderly transition process during the past four months. Kevin Walbridge, who I recently named Executive Vice President in Operations, is now officed here in Phoenix. Kevin is an exceptional operating executive with deep industry experience. He is now actively involved in operating reviews and detailed planning as we develop our future business plan.
This plan will constantly advance safety while gaining productivity. This plan will persistently price our assets and services while protecting our business and getting our share of market opportunity. This plan will continually elevate customer experience and employee engagement while controlling costs. As I said before, steady and consistent. 
We have an outstanding team at Republic, and we're maintaining our focus on improving return on invested capital, increasing free cash flow and returning our strong free cash flow to shareholders. 
Before I turn the call over to Jim to wrap up our review of the quarter, I'd like to thank him publicly for his leadership in building a great company. I want to thank him personally for his support and guidance that he has given me over the past several years. And on behalf of the entire team expressed our appreciation for his many years of devotion to the people and to the owners of Republic Services. Thank you, Jim."

You, we, have achieved many successes during that period of time and delivered a total return to our shareholders of over 178%. During that same period, the S&P had a total return of 26%. 
More importantly, I've had the privilege of being the CEO of an organization that has the strongest management team, has met the challenges of economic uncertainty, set industry standards for financial transparency and disclosure, and never lost its commitment to developing future leaders and reinvesting in the best operating platform in the industry. 
I've worked with Don and known Don for much longer than the two years that the company have come together. I have total confidence in Don's leadership and in his ability to take the company to the next plateau.

When we talk about churn internally, we're talking about the spread between what we sell new business at and what we lose business at. So when we talk about defection, some people sometimes use that word churn to describe defection. Defection is the amount of business that we lose in a given year. And part of that defection is structural, which is bankruptcies and businesses closing. Part of that defection is competitive. So our defection rate has been consistent over the last several quarters, it's actually down just slightly. So when we haven't seen much change really in the makeup of that defection being generally half competitive and half being structural. On the churn, we've seen pretty consistent rates in the dollar per unit that we're losing revenue at. And I would say on a multi-quarter basis pretty consistent in what we're losing or we're residing a new business at. So not much movement there overall."

So if you think of our business, 40 states, we managed it through 28 area of teams, but we're in 200 marketplaces, a little bit over 200 marketplaces across the United States. So when we look at in isolation several markets, there are a couple of markets that are really driving some pricing pressures, some negative price. And one of those is L.A., it's a very competitive marketplace. It has been for many years. We've got a very great landfill position there. We've talked to many of you before about the fact that there is a big municipal landfill in the marketplace that used to close by 11:00. Today, they're open all day long. That changes the dynamic in the marketplace. We had to divest over landfill in that market as position of the merger that causes a certain competitive aspect with the new dynamic in the marketplace that will take a couple of years to sort of settle itself out. So again, that at another market, Houston. And again, a very competitive marketplace, another divestiture market. We've had some activity there. We've had -- we shared with you, I think, many quarters ago now, we had to take a price reduction in one of our large municipal transfer station contracts there, and we're about to anniversary there I think the next quarter I think. And so those things tend to play havoc with our numbers, but in the other marketplaces, and that was my comment earlier, when you factor out those isolated issues in the broad section of our marketplaces, we're getting 2% PI. And so our goal is always to, in absolute terms, get a spread between absolute inflation and absolute price, right. And so that's how we get margin expansion. If you look at our numbers, you're seeing margin expansion. So when we talk about price, remember, we're talking about absolute price, which includes the effects of churn, includes the effects of mix, okay. It's a pure price number. And so as long as we can continue to price that spread between real inflation and real price, we're going to continue to give you margin expansion, and that's what you're seeing in our numbers today."

We haven't begun to see any of that yet. The other large job is a mandated cleanup that EPA mandated. And so there really wasn't a lot of flexibility in that.

So it tends to be an indicator of discretionary spending easing up, but we'll keep you posted."

We have -- as I said in an earlier question, our defection has been pretty static. Our sales, we tend to be sort of net even. What we lose, we gain, so we're not necessarily growing the business on a net sales basis on the competitive side of things. And as far as our service decreases, we haven't seen any further signs of service decreasing, but have not yet seen the signs of life on the increasing side. So what we'd like to be able to tell you is that, at some point, we'll see container weights improve. So as customers throw out more waste, the container waste per pounds pretty are decreased, and that converts it at some point to service increases. But we're watching diligently for that, just have not seen yet any movement. On the volume side, we did see some decline in MSW at the landfill, which is driven our volume numbers a little bit. And that's what we would kind of describe as competitive MSW. In a couple of cases, where we've had, in one case, a large competitor who has had their own landfill but it was 70 to 80 miles away, I think, and for many years, they run to a contract with us. The contract was below market. The contract came to term. We try to negotiate a price that was more consistent with market, they elected to drive the extra distance their own landfill. We've got a few other examples like that. We've got a landfill that we sold in the divestiture in the Midwest to a competitor. And the first thing they did with it was go out and secure some waste in the market so they could pay the mortgage on that new landfill. And not unexpected, we've seen this happening in the past. And these things take a little while but to settle down, but it did show up in our volume this quarter."

Again, not asking you to go specifically what your plans are for 2011 yet, but just from a strategic point of view. I know you've  talked in the past about beating the price at the landfill at a level that generates a sufficient return on your capital investment there. Are you where you think you need to be to get that kind of return? And how do you think about the trade-off between the economy and therefore presumably consumers being more sensitive on price versus the fact that as a larger company now, obviously, you've got more power in the market and potentially testing on how flexible people might be on price under those circumstances?"

But I'll tell you, we look at it a little differently across lines of business. And we've talked about the fact that we've had to reprice some of our large residential business because of CPI, the timing of CPI because customers have come to us and said, ""Look, I'm willing to extend the contract, but I need a price concessions."" We've been successful price over the years. We've got a good partnership. We've done some of that. So we make intelligent price decisions with our existing customer base just to keep our business. It's really profitable work. We're through the days of pricing that negative tail that we used to talk about. It's a waste in the landfills. And you said it, Corey, these landfills they're expensive to build, to develop, they're expensive to operate. The environmental rules continued to get more stringent. We're going to spend a couple of million dollars a year or next year more in air quality, controls and testing. That's going to continue to impact the price of landfills. These landfills are expensive to own into infinity and it's a release to landfill pricing. We continue to move landfill pricing up. As I said earlier, we talked about some of the volume, and we're down year-over-year in MSW and the landfill. And some of that is directly related to the fact that we priced that business and some of that volume, those customers have chosen to leave and move on to another disposal site, in many cases, many miles farther than ours. And we've allowed  that business to leave. And we're going to continue to take that approach. These landfills are too costly and too valuable just to get the air space and so on. So we're going to continue to do that. But I'd like to see our price be higher at the landfill? Absolutely I would. And we're looking at that as well. We're looking at that not only to our third-party customers but our own internal customers. So we're going to continue to focus on it."
