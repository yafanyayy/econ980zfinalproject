You will reca",667,"Good afternoon. I am very pleased to report that our company produced earnings of $0.58 per diluted share in the fiscal third quarter ended November 28, 2009, compared with $0.34 per diluted share last year, an increase of approximately 71%. You will recall that last year's fiscal third quarter was negatively impacted by challenging economic conditions, as well as the liquidation sales of a then major competitor. While the consumer continues to face economic challenges and the pressures of the macroeconomic environment still remain, we are cautiously optimistic as we look to the balance of fiscal 2009. During the fiscal third quarter, we opened 16 new Bed Bath & Beyond stores, four Christmas Tree Shops, one Harmon Face Values stores and seven buybuy BABY stores, bringing the number of openings in the first nine months of fiscal 2009 to 49 versus 50 for the same period last year. Additionally, we closed one Bed Bath & Beyond store during the quarter. We continued to add Fine China departments in additional Bed Bath & Beyond stores as well as Harmon, Face Values, health and beauty care departments and additional Bed Bath & Beyond Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY stores. Consolidated store space at November 28, 2009, was approximately 33.4 million square feet, an increase of approximately 5.7% over last year.Since the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter, we have opened three new Bed Bath & Beyond stores and one Harmon Face Values store and close one Bed Bath & Beyond store. We currently operate one that are 1008 stores, including 960 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada, as well as 57 Christmas Tree Shops, 26 buybuy BABY stores and 43 stores under the name Harmon or Harmon Face Values. In addition, through a joint venture, we operate two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More.In fiscal 2009, including stores already opened today, we anticipate opening approximately 64 new stores across all concepts, including 38 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in the United States and Canada, eight Christmas Tree Shops, 13 buybuy BABY stores and five Harmon Face Values stores, ending the year with approximately 33.7 million square feet, an increase of approximately 5% over last year. We've also continued to apply our stringent standards to growth as we evaluate new store sites and proactively review lease terms, as well as look to relocate and/or right size our stores in response to changing market conditions on a case-by-case basis. We believe that throughout the United States and Canada, there is an opportunity to open an excess of 400 additional Bed Bath & Beyond stores and we also strive over time to become the leading home furnishings retailer in the countries in which we do business. We keep working to increase the productivity of our stores by introducing new merchandising initiatives, as well as expanding, renovating, remodeling and/or relocating stores to enhance our customer shopping experience. Our ability to leverage in the breadths and depths of our merchandise offerings, grow our bridal baby and gift registries and continue the development of our online sales capabilities afford us additional opportunity to attract new customers to Bed Bath & Beyond. As we have repeatedly said, we will capitalize on the unique strengths of our decentralized culture, which has enabled us to build the strong exciting business we have today. This culture, which takes advantage of the knowledge independence and customer focus of our associates has always been the foundation of our long-term performance and allows us to respond more quickly as economic conditions change on a market by market basis. We believe that the challenging macroeconomic environment affords us an exceptional opportunity to solidify and enhance our position in the merchandising categories we offer our customer. We are confident that we have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near and long-term goals. And now, I'll turn the call over to Steven Temares. Steve?"

Our third quarter results exceeded our internal planning assumptions. They were accomplished through the dedication and talents of our associates and our constant focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience, while at the same time, creating a more productive and efficient company. Although economic and consumer spending challenges persist, our fundamental business strategy has remained unchanged, to offer a broad assortment merchandise at everyday low prices through superior customer service. We continue to systematically challenge the costs associated with running our company, and although we have anniversaryied many of the expense reduction initiatives that we instituted during last year's fiscal third quarter, we continue to strive to find opportunities to lower our operating costs. Our balance sheet and overall financial health are extremely strong and we remain focused on building a business that stands the test of time.We always look for ways to enhance our customer's overall shopping experience and remain committed to being our customer's first choice in the merchandise categories we offer, domestically, interactively and over the longer term, internationally. We still believe strongly that the current retailing environment, though difficult, provides an excellent opportunity for us to continue to strengthen our long-term prospects. We are confident that our company is well-positioned to grow profitably and deliver superior shareholder value and that we are effectively managing our business to compete and increase our market share over time. Our capital spending first nine months of fiscal 2009 was approximately $109 million. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making required investments in our company to help position us for long-term success, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects whose impacted view is important to our future. And taking the long-term approach to building our Bed Bath & Beyond, Christmas Tree Shops, buybuy BABY, and Harmon Face Values concepts and through the ongoing efforts to cross merchandise and leverage our best practices across each of our concepts, we expect over time to do more, for and with our customers.Turning to our third quarter performance, as reported earlier today, net earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $0.58, an increase of approximately 71% versus the $0.34 a share earned in last year's third quarter, which was negatively impacted by challenging economic conditions as well as liquidation sales of a number of retailers, including a then major competitor. For the fiscal nine months, net earnings per diluted share were $1.44 compared with $1.10 last year. Net sales for the fiscal third quarter were approximately $2 billion, approximately 10.8% higher than the corresponding fiscal 2008 period. Third quarter comp store sales increased approximately 7.3% versus a decrease of 5.6% last year. For the first nine months, net sales were approximately $5.6 billion, about 5.7% higher than last year. Comp store sales for the fiscal nine months increased approximately 1.7% versus a decrease of 1.7% for the same period last year. Gross profit for the fiscal third quarter was approximately 41.1% of net sales compared with approximately 38.9% of net sales for the fiscal third quarter of 2008, which rounds to approximately 230 basis points increase in the gross profit margin. This increase resulted from relative decreases in inventory acquisition costs and coupon redemptions as a percentage of sales, partially offset by a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories.Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal third quarter were approximately 28.7% of net sales as compared to approximately 31.2% in last year's third quarter. The decrease of 250 basis points in the SG&A was primarily due to a relative decrease in advertising expense resulting from a decrease in the distribution of advertising pieces as well as a relative decrease in payroll expense. Also contributing to this decrease was the 7.3% increase in comparable store sales, resulting in relative decreases in fixed costs such as occupancy. Reflecting the movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal third quarter was higher than in the period a year ago by approximately 480 basis points. For the fiscal nine months, the operating profit margin increased by approximately 250 basis points. Our tax rate continues to fluctuate as the taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal third quarter, or tax rate was approximately 38.6% compared to approximately 36.3% for the comparable quarter last year. We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produced Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers and by doing so, continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer. I'll now turn the call back to Gene."

As you heard from Len and Steve, we earned $0.58 per diluted share in our first quarter and $1.44 per diluted share for the first nine months of fiscal 2009. We are encouraged by our positive fiscal third quarter results and with the holiday shopping season now behind us, we are cautiously optimistic about the balance of fiscal 2009 as compared to last year, when a then major competitor was completing its liquidation, with the continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment makes it difficult to forecast future results. However, the following are our major planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2009. One, including the 53 stores opened so far this year, we expect to open approximately 64 new stores across our concepts, including 38 Bed Bath & Beyond stores throughout the U.S. and Canada, eight Christmas Tree Shops, 13 buybuy BABY stores and five Harmon Face Values stores. We also plan to continue Harmon Face Values' health and beauty care departments within additional Bed Bath & Beyond Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY locations, as well as continue to add Fine China departments to Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Two, based on sales to date and our assumptions for the rest of the fourth quarter, including our ongoing efforts to optimize our advertising strategy, we are now modeling consolidated comparable store sales to increase about 3% to 5% in the fourth quarter. Three, assuming a 3% to 5% increase in comparable store sales, consolidated net sales are expected to increase by approximately 8% to 11% in the fourth quarter. Four, we expect some improvement in the operating profit margin for the fourth quarter as compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. However, as Steve mentioned, we expect the improvements we have seen in SG&A to moderate as we continue to anniversary the expense control initiatives we began implementing during the third quarter of last year. Five, interest income is expected to be approximately flat versus last year's fourth quarter. Six, the full-year tax provision continues to be estimated in the high 30% range, with continuing viability as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. Seven, capital expenditures for fiscal 2009, principally for new stores, existing store refurbishment, information technology enhancements and other projects are now planned at approximately $200 million, which of course remains subject to the timing of projects. Eight, depreciation for fiscal 2009 is estimated to be approximately $180 million. Nine, our share repurchase program will continue to be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions and developments in the auction-rate security market. 10, we expect to continue to generate positive cash flow in fiscal 2009 and entirely fund operation from internally-generated sources. Based on an increase in our fourth quarter comparable store sales planning assumption, as well as our just released third-quarter results exceeding our previous estimates, we now estimate that we will earn approximately $0.67 to $0.71 per diluted share for the fiscal fourth quarter and approximately $2.11 to $2.15 per diluted share for all of fiscal 2009.Turning to fiscal 2010, while we have not yet completed our budget, our preliminary running assumptions include the following. One, we expect the overall economic environment to remain challenging. Two, we anticipate opening approximately 65 stores across all of our concepts. However, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. Three, we expect to continue our program of remodeling, renovating and expanding a number of our stores in fiscal 2010. Four, our operations will continue to be entirely funded from internally-generated sources. Five, our share repurchase program will be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions and developments in the auction-rate securities market. Six, we expect continuing variability in our quarterly tax rates. We anticipate providing further information related to the fiscal first quarter and full-year fiscal 2010 on our next quarterly conference call on April 7, 2010. Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal third quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong and debt-free. We ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.2 billion. This includes approximately $186 million of investments related to auction-rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $2 million to reflect their current liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it does not affect the company's earnings. During the quarter, we had auction rate redemptions of approximately $6 million at par. As we have said in the past, and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities. Inventories continue to be tempered by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good shape. As of November 28, 2009, inventories were approximately $2 billion or $58.61 per square foot, a reduction of approximately 3.7% on a per square foot basis versus last year. Consolidated shareholder's equity at November 28, 2009 was approximately $3.4 billion, which is net of share repurchases, including approximately $34 million repurchased during the fiscal third quarter. As a reminder, our next conference call to review operating results for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year ending February 27, 2010 will be on Wednesday, April 7, 2010.If you have any questions, Ken and Lisa will be in their offices this evening, January 6 to take your calls. As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond and we wish you a happy and healthy new year."

One, including the 53 stores opened so far this year, we expect to open approximately 64 new stores across our concepts, including 38 Bed Bath & Beyond stores throughout the U.S. and Canada, eight Christmas Tree Shops, 13 buybuy BABY stores and five Harmon Face Values stores. We also plan to continue Harmon Face Values' health and beauty care departments within additional Bed Bath & Beyond Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY locations, as well as continue to add Fine China departments to Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Two, based on sales to date and our assumptions for the rest of the fourth quarter, including our ongoing efforts to optimize our advertising strategy, we are now modeling consolidated comparable store sales to increase about 3% to 5% in the fourth quarter. Three, assuming a 3% to 5% increase in comparable store sales, consolidated net sales are expected to increase by approximately 8% to 11% in the fourth quarter. Four, we expect some improvement in the operating profit margin for the fourth quarter as compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. However, as Steve mentioned, we expect the improvements we have seen in SG&A to moderate as we continue to anniversary the expense control initiatives we began implementing during the third quarter of last year. Five, interest income is expected to be approximately flat versus last year's fourth quarter. Six, the full-year tax provision continues to be estimated in the high 30% range, with continuing viability as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. Seven, capital expenditures for fiscal 2009, principally for new stores, existing store refurbishment, information technology enhancements and other projects are now planned at approximately $200 million, which of course remains subject to the timing of projects. Eight, depreciation for fiscal 2009 is estimated to be approximately $180 million. Nine, our share repurchase program will continue to be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions and developments in the auction-rate security market. 10, we expect to continue to generate positive cash flow in fiscal 2009 and entirely fund operation from internally-generated sources. Based on an increase in our fourth quarter comparable store sales planning assumption, as well as our just released third-quarter results exceeding our previous estimates, we now estimate that we will earn approximately $0.67 to $0.71 per diluted share for the fiscal fourth quarter and approximately $2.11 to $2.15 per diluted share for all of fiscal 2009.Turning to fiscal 2010, while we have not yet completed our budget, our preliminary running assumptions include the following. One, we expect the overall economic environment to remain challenging. Two, we anticipate opening approximately 65 stores across all of our concepts. However, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. Three, we expect to continue our program of remodeling, renovating and expanding a number of our stores in fiscal 2010. Four, our operations will continue to be entirely funded from internally-generated sources. Five, our share repurchase program will be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions and developments in the auction-rate securities market. Six, we expect continuing variability in our quarterly tax rates. We anticipate providing further information related to the fiscal first quarter and full-year fiscal 2010 on our next quarterly conference call on April 7, 2010. Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal third quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong and debt-free. We ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.2 billion. This includes approximately $186 million of investments related to auction-rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $2 million to reflect their current liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it does not affect the company's earnings. During the quarter, we had auction rate redemptions of approximately $6 million at par. As we have said in the past, and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities. Inventories continue to be tempered by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good shape. As of November 28, 2009, inventories were approximately $2 billion or $58.61 per square foot, a reduction of approximately 3.7% on a per square foot basis versus last year. Consolidated shareholder's equity at November 28, 2009 was approximately $3.4 billion, which is net of share repurchases, including approximately $34 million repurchased during the fiscal third quarter. As a reminder, our next conference call to review operating results for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year ending February 27, 2010 will be on Wednesday, April 7, 2010.If you have any questions, Ken and Lisa will be in their offices this evening, January 6 to take your calls. As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond and we wish you a happy and healthy new year."

I am very pleased to report that our company produced earnings of $0.58 per diluted share in the fiscal third quarter ended November 28, 2009, compared with $0.34 per diluted share last year, an increase of approximately 71%. You will recall that last year's fiscal third quarter was negatively impacted by challenging economic conditions, as well as the liquidation sales of a then major competitor. While the consumer continues to face economic challenges and the pressures of the macroeconomic environment still remain, we are cautiously optimistic as we look to the balance of fiscal 2009. During the fiscal third quarter, we opened 16 new Bed Bath & Beyond stores, four Christmas Tree Shops, one Harmon Face Values store and seven buybuy BABY stores, bringing the number of openings in the first nine months of fiscal 2009 to 49 versus 50 for the same period last year. Additionally, we closed one Bed Bath & Beyond store during the quarter. We continued to add Fine China departments in additional Bed Bath & Beyond stores as well as Harmon, Face Values, health and beauty care departments and additional Bed Bath & Beyond Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY stores. Consolidated store space at November 28, 2009, was approximately 33.4 million square feet, an increase of approximately 5.7% over last year.Since the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter, we have opened three new Bed Bath & Beyond stores and one Harmon Face Values store and close one Bed Bath & Beyond store. We currently operate 1086 stores, including 960 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada, as well as 57 Christmas Tree Shops, 26 buybuy BABY stores and 43 stores under the name Harmon or Harmon Face Values. In addition, through a joint venture, we operate two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More.In fiscal 2009, including stores already opened today, we anticipate opening approximately 64 new stores across all concepts, including 38 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in the United States and Canada, eight Christmas Tree Shops, 13 buybuy BABY stores and five Harmon Face Values stores, ending the year with approximately 33.7 million square feet, an increase of approximately 5% over last year. We also continued to apply our stringent standards to growth as we evaluate new store sites and proactively review lease terms, as well as look to relocate and/or right size our stores in response to changing market conditions on a case-by-case basis. We believe that throughout the United States and Canada, there is an opportunity to open an excess of 400 additional Bed Bath & Beyond stores and we also strive over time to become the leading home furnishings retailer in the countries in which we do business. We keep working to increase the productivity of our stores by introducing new merchandising initiatives, as well as by expanding, renovating, remodeling and/or relocating stores to enhance our customer shopping experience. Our ability to leverage in the breadth and depth of our merchandise offerings, grow our bridal, baby and gift registries and continue the development of our online sales capabilities afford us additional opportunity to attract new customers to Bed Bath & Beyond. As we have repeatedly said, we will capitalize on the unique strengths of our decentralized culture, which has enabled us to build the strong exciting business we have today. This culture, which takes advantage of the knowledge, independence and customer focus of our associates has always been the foundation of our long-term performance and allows us to respond more quickly as economic conditions change on a market-by-market basis. We believe that the challenging macroeconomic environment affords us an exceptional opportunity to solidify and enhance our position in the merchandising categories we offer our customer.

Our third quarter results exceeded our internal planning assumptions. They were accomplished through the dedication and talents of our associates and our constant focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience, while at the same time, creating a more productive and efficient company. Although economic and consumer spending challenges persist, our fundamental business strategy has remained unchanged to offer a broad assortment merchandise at everyday low prices through superior customer service. We continue to systematically challenge the costs associated with running our company, and although we have anniversary-ied many of the expense reduction initiatives that we instituted during last year's fiscal third quarter, we continue to strive to find the opportunity to lower our operating costs. Our balance sheet and overall financial health are extremely strong and we remain focused on building a business that stands the test of time.We always look for ways to enhance our customers' overall shopping experience and remain committed to being our customers' first choice in the merchandise categories we offer, domestically, interactively and over the longer term, internationally. We still believe strongly that the current retailing environment, though difficult, provides an excellent opportunity for us to continue to strengthen our long-term prospects. We are confident that our company is well-positioned to grow profitably and deliver superior shareholder value and that we are effectively managing our business to compete and increase our market share over time. Our capital spending in the first nine months of fiscal 2009 was approximately $109 million. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making required investments in our company to help position us for long-term success, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects whose impact is viewed as important to our future. In taking a long-term approach to building our Bed Bath & Beyond, Christmas Tree Shops, buybuy BABY, and Harmon Face Values concepts and through the ongoing efforts to cross merchandise and leverage our best practices across each of our concepts, we expect over time to do more, for and with our customers.Turning to our third quarter performance, as reported earlier today, net earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $0.58, an increase of approximately 71% versus the $0.34 a share earned in last year's third quarter, which was negatively impacted by challenging economic conditions as well as liquidation sales of a number of retailers, including a then major competitor. For the fiscal nine months, net earnings per diluted share were $1.44 compared with $1.10 last year. Net sales for the fiscal third quarter were approximately $2 billion, approximately 10.8% higher than the corresponding fiscal 2008 period. Third quarter comp store sales increased approximately 7.3% versus a decrease of 5.6% last year. For the first nine months, net sales were approximately $5.6 billion, about 5.7% higher than last year. Comp store sales for the fiscal nine months increased approximately 1.7% versus a decrease of 1.7% for the same period last year. Gross profit for the fiscal third quarter was approximately 41.1% of net sales compared with approximately 38.9% of net sales for the fiscal third quarter of 2008, which rounds to approximately 230 basis points increase in the gross profit margin. This increase resulted from relative decreases in inventory acquisition costs and coupon redemptions as a percentage of sales, partially offset by a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories.Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal third quarter were approximately 28.7% of net sales as compared to approximately 31.2% in last year's third quarter. The decrease of a 250 basis points in the SG&A was primarily due to a relative decrease in advertising expense resulting from a decrease in the distribution of advertising pieces as well as a relative decrease in payroll expense. Also contributing to this decrease was the 7.3% increase in comparable store sales, resulting in relative decreases in fixed costs such as occupancy. Reflecting the movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal third quarter was higher than in the period a year ago by approximately 480 basis points. For the fiscal nine months, the operating profit margin increased by approximately 250 basis points. Our tax rate continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal third quarter, our tax rate was approximately 38.6% compared to approximately 36.3% for the comparable quarter last year. We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produced Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers and by doing so, continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer. I'll now turn the call back to Gene."

Three, assuming a 3% to 5% increase in comparable store sales, consolidated net sales are expected to increase by approximately 8% to 11% in the fourth quarter.

Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal third quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong and debt-free. We ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.2 billion. This includes approximately $186 million of investments related to auction-rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $2 million to reflect their current liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it does not affect the company's earnings. During the quarter, we had auction rate redemptions of approximately $6 million at par. As we have said in the past, and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities. Inventories continue to be tempered by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good shape. As of November 28, 2009, inventories were approximately $2 billion or $58.61 per square foot, a reduction of approximately 3.7% on a per square foot basis versus last year.

I am very pleased to report that our company’s net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 56% in the fiscal fourth quarter to $0.86 and approximately 40% in the fiscal year to $2.30. 
You will recall that last year’s fiscal fourth quarter was negatively impacted by challenging economic conditions as well as the completion of liquidation sales of a then major competitor. While the economy appears to be showing some signs of improvement we believe the consumer continues to face economic challenges and the pressures of the macroeconomic environment still remains. As such we remain cautiously optimistic as we begin fiscal 2010. 
During the fiscal fourth quarter we opened eight Bed Bath and Beyond stores, four Christmas Tree shops, three Harmon Face Value stores and three buybuy BABY stores bringing the total number of openings in fiscal 2009 to 67. Additionally, we closed one and relocated three Bed Bath and Beyond stores during the quarter. We continued to add fine china departments in additional Bed Bath and Beyond stores as well as place Harmon Face Value’s health and beauty care offerings in all of our concepts. 
Consolidated store space at February 27, 2010 was approximately 33.7 million square feet, an increase of approximately 5% over last year. Since the beginning of fiscal 2010 we have opened one Bed Bath and Beyond store and one buybuy BABY store. We currently operate 1,102 stores including 966 Bed Bath and Beyond stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada as well as 61 Christmas Tree shops, 30 buybuy BABY stores and 45 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Value. In addition, we are a partner in a joint venture which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More. 
In fiscal 2010 we anticipate opening a total of approximately 60 stores. Currently we believe that fiscal 2010’s mix of store openings will consist of approximately 30 Bed Bath and Beyond stores in the United States and Canada, approximately 10 Christmas Tree shops and approximately 20 buybuy BABY stores. Additionally we will continue to place Harmon Face Value health and beauty care offerings in all our concepts. We also look forward to expanding into our 50th state, Hawaii, with a Bed Bath and Beyond store expected to open this summer. 
We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all of our concepts. We continue to apply our stringent standards of growth as we evaluate new store price as well as continue to review our existing locations and lease terms for opportunities to relocate and/or right size our stores in response to changing market conditions. We believe throughout the United States and Canada there is an opportunity to open in excess of 1,300 Bed Bath and Beyond stores as well as grow the Christmas Tree shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast to coast. 
We continue to work to increase the productivity of our existing stores by introducing new merchandising initiatives, as well as by expanding, renovating, remodeling and/or relocating stores to enhance our customers’ shopping experience. Our ability to leverage the breadth and depth of our merchandise offering, grow our bridal, BABY and gift registries and continue the development of our online sales capabilities has afforded us additional opportunities to attract new customers to Bed Bath and Beyond. 
We continue to believe that these challenging macroeconomic times have provided us an exceptional opportunity to further solidify and enhance our position in the merchandising categories that we offer our customers.

Our balance sheet and overall financial health are extremely strong and we remain focused on building a business that spans the test of time. We continue to find ways to enhance our customers’ overall shopping experience and we remain committed to being our customers’ first choice for the merchandise categories we offer, domestically, interactively and over the longer term internationally. We are confident our company is well positioned to grow profitably, deliver superior shareholder value and to compete and increase our market share over time. 
Our capital spending for all of fiscal 2009 was approximately $154 million, lower than we had estimated in our January conference call due primarily to the timing and cost of certain store and warehouse construction projects and IT purchases. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success, principally through new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects whose impact is viewed as important to our future and taking a long-term approach to building our Bed Bath and Beyond, Christmas Tree Shops, buybuy BABY and Harmon Face Value concepts and through the ongoing effort to cross merchandise and leverage our best practices across each of our concepts. We expect over time to do more for and with our customers. 
Turning to our fiscal 2009 performance, as reported earlier today our net earnings per diluted share for the fiscal fourth quarter were $0.86, an increase of approximately 56% versus the $0.55 per share earned in last year’s fourth quarter which was negatively impacted by challenging economic conditions as well as the completion of liquidation sales of a then major competitor. 
For all of fiscal 2009 net earnings per diluted share were $2.30, an increase of approximately 40% as compared with $1.64 last year. Net sales for the fiscal fourth quarter were approximately $2.2 billion, approximately 16.7% higher than the corresponding fiscal 2008 period. Fourth quarter comp store sales increased approximately 11.5% versus a decrease of approximately 4.3% last year. 
For the full fiscal 2009 year net sales were approximately $7.8 billion, about 8.6% higher than last year. Comp store sales for the full fiscal year increased approximately 4.4% versus a decrease of approximately 2.4% last year. 
Gross profit for the fiscal fourth quarter was approximately 42.6% of net sales compared to approximately 40.8% of net sales for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2008. This increase of 180 basis points resulted from decreases in coupon redemptions, mark downs and inventory acquisition costs as a percentage of net sales partially offset by a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal fourth quarter were approximately 26.1% of net sales as compared to approximately 28.8% of net sales in last year’s fourth quarter, a decrease of approximately 270 basis points. This decrease can be attributed to lower advertising, occupancy and payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales. Advertising expense decreased due to a reduction in the distribution of advertising pieces. 
Occupancy, as with other fixed costs benefited from the 11.5% increase in comparable store sales. Reflecting the movement in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses the operating profit margin for the fiscal fourth quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago by approximately 450 basis points. For all of fiscal 2009 the operating profit margin increased by approximately 320 basis points. 
Our tax rate continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal fourth quarter our tax rate was approximately 39.1% compared to approximately 39% even for the comparable quarter last year. 
We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts which produced Bed Bath and Beyond long-term  success. Through their efforts we look forward to meeting the challenges that lay ahead and seizing the opportunity to satisfy our customers and by doing so continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer. 
I will now turn the call back to Gene. Gene?

As you heard from Warren and Steve our results exceeded our planning assumptions and we earned $0.86 per diluted share in our fiscal fourth quarter and $2.30 per diluted share for all of fiscal 2009. We are encouraged by our positive fiscal fourth quarter results and remain cautiously optimistic about the coming year. 
The continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment makes it difficult to forecast future results. However, the following are our major planning assumptions for fiscal 2010. 
One, we anticipate opening approximately 60 stores across all of our concepts including approximately 30 Bed Bath and Beyond stores, approximately 10 Christmas Tree shops and approximately 20 buybuy BABY stores. We will continue to place Harmon Face Value’s health and beauty care offerings in all of our concepts and fine china departments within our Bed Bath and Beyond stores. 
Consistent with our historical experience we anticipate new store openings will occur throughout the year with the majority in our fiscal second half. We remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. 
  Two, we expect to continue our program of expanding, renovating, remodeling and/or relocating a number of our stores in fiscal 2010. Three, for the first half of fiscal 2010 we are modeling a mid single digit percentage increase in comparable store sales. For the second half of fiscal 2010 considering the higher comparable store sales comparisons as well as less visibility into future economic conditions we are modeling a low single digit percent increase in comparable store sales. 
Four, based on these comparable store sales assumptions we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by a high single digit percentage in the first half of fiscal 2010 and by a mid single digit percentage in the second half of fiscal 2010. 
Five, assuming these sales levels we would expect leverage in our operating profit margin to both the fiscal first quarter and the full year. Six, interest income is expected to be relatively flat versus fiscal 2009. Seven, the full-year tax provision is estimated in the mid to high 30% range with variability as taxable events occur. 
Eight, capital expenditures for fiscal 2010 principally for new stores, existing store refurbishment and Information technology enhancements and other projects are currently planned at approximately $225 million. Nine, depreciation for fiscal 2010 is estimated to be approximately $180 million. 
Ten, we expect to generate positive cash flow in fiscal 2010 and to continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources. Eleven, our share repurchase program will be influenced by several factors including business and market conditions. 
Based on these and other planning assumptions we are modeling diluted earnings per share to be in a range of approximately $0.44 to $0.48 in the first quarter. For all of fiscal 2010 we are modeling diluted earnings per share to increase by approximately 10-15%. 
Before concluding this afternoons call a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal fourth quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong and debt free. We ended fiscal 2009 with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.7 billion. This includes approximately $181 million of investments related to auction rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $2 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary it did not affect the company’s earnings. 
During the quarter we had redemptions of auction rate securities of approximately $5 million at par. We anticipate additional redemptions of approximately $55 million at par during the first half of fiscal 2010. Approximately $43 million of these redemptions are related to a commitment we have with an investment firm to redeem these investments at par commencing June 30, 2010. As we have said in the past and as we have experienced to date we believe given the high credit quality of these investments we will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities. 
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demand of our customers and are in good shape. As of February 27, 2010 inventories were approximately $1.8 billion or $52.15 per square foot, an increase of approximately 1.8% on a per square foot basis versus last year. 
Consolidated shareholder’s equity at February 27, 2010 was approximately $3.7 billion which is net of share repurchases including approximately $28 million repurchased during the fiscal fourth quarter. 
As a reminder our next conference call to review operating results for the first quarter ending on May 29, 2010 will be on Wednesday, June 23, 2010. If you have any questions Ken and Lisa will be in their offices this evening, April 7th to take your calls. 
As always we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath and Beyond.

While the economic environment appears to be showing some signs of stabilizing, it appears the consumer continues to face economic challenges, and the pressures of the macroeconomic environment still persist.
As such, we remain cautiously optimistic as we continue fiscal 2010. During the fiscal first quarter, we opened two Bed Bath & Beyond and two buybuy BABY stores, as well as relocated and renovated a number of Bed Bath & Beyond stores.
Consolidated store space at May 29, 2010 was approximately 33.9 million sq. feet, an increase of approximately 5% over last year's first quarter. Since the beginning of the fiscal second quarter of 2010, we have opened one additional Bed Bath & Beyond store.
We currently operate 1,105 stores, including 968 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in 49 states, The District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Canada, as well as 61 Christmas Tree Shops, 31 buybuy BABY stores, and 45 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values.
In addition, we are a partner in a joint venture which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name ""Home & More.
During fiscal 2010, including the five stores we have opened to-date we anticipate opening a total of approximately 55 to 60 stores across all of our concepts. We look forward to expanding into our 50th state, Hawaii, with a Bed Bath & Beyond store expected to open during the fiscal second quarter.
We remain committed to, and are excited about the continued growth of all of our merchandize offerings. We continue to apply our stringent standards to growth as we evaluate new store sites as well as continue to review our existing locations and lease terms for opportunities to relocate and/or rightsize our stores in response to changing market conditions.
As we have previously said, we believe throughout the United States and Canada there is an opportunity to operate in excess of 1300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, as well as grow our Christmas Tree shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast to coast. Additionally, we will continue to open Harmon Face Values stores and selectively place health and beauty care offerings in all our concepts.
We continue to work to increase the productivity of our existing stores by evolving the merchandize offerings, as well as by expanding, renovating, remodeling and/or relocating stores to enhance our customers' shopping experience.
Our ability to leverage the breadth and depth of our merchandize offering through our Bridal, Baby, and Gift registries and continued development of our online sales capabilities has afforded us additional opportunities to attract new customers to Bed Bath & Beyond.
The success of our company is due in large part to the tremendous efforts of our associates and to our unique decentralized culture. This culture, which takes advantage of the knowledge, independence and the customer focus of our associates has always been the foundation of our long term performance, and allows us to respond more quickly to local market demand and the changing economic conditions on a market-by-market basis. 
We are confident that we have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near and long term goals.

We are pleased that our first quarter results exceeded our internal planning assumptions. The dedication and talents of our associates and their constant focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience, while at the same time creating a more productive and efficient company are the key to producing the continued strong results we have experienced.
As Len said, while it appears that the economic environment may be stabilizing, persistent high unemployment and uncertainty in the economy could continue to pressure the consumer and affect their spending. Although economic challenges persist, our fundamental business strategy has remained unchanged to offer a broader assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices with superior customer service.
We continue to systematically challenge the costs associated with running our company, and although during the second half of last year, we anniversaried many of the more significant expense reduction initiatives that we instituted, we continue to strive to find opportunities to lower our operating costs.

We are confident that our company is well positioned to grow profitably, deliver superior shareholder value and to compete and increase our market share over time. As always, we remain focused on building a business that stands the test of time.
In taking this long term approach to building our Bed Bath & Beyond, Christmas Tree Shops, buybuy BABY and Harmon Face Value concepts and through the ongoing effort to cross-merchandise and leverage our best practices across each of our concepts, we expect over time to do more for and with our customers.
Turning to our fiscal first quarter 2010 performance, as reported earlier today our net earnings per diluted share were $0.52, an increase of approximately 53% versus the $0.34 per share earned in last year's first quarter.
Net sales for the fiscal first quarter were approximately $1.9 billion, approximately 13.5% higher than the corresponding fiscal 2009 period. First quarter comp store sales increased approximately 8.4% versus a decrease of approximately 1.6% last year.
Gross profit for the fiscal first quarter was approximately 40.3% of net sales compared to approximately 39.4% of net sales for the fiscal first quarter of 2009. This increase of approximately 90 basis points resulted primarily from decreases in coupon redemptions and inventory acquisition costs as a percentage of net sales partially offset by a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal first quarter were approximately 28.6% of net sales as compared to approximately 31% of net sales in last year's first quarter, a decrease of approximately 240 basis points. This decrease can be primarily attributed to lower advertising and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales.
Advertising expense decreased due to a continued reduction in the distribution of advertising pieces. Occupancy, as with other costs, benefited from the 8.4% increase in comparable store sales.
Reflecting the movement in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal first quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago by approximately 330 basis points. Our provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as tax law events occur and exposures are reevaluated.
For the fiscal first quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 39.1% compared to approximately 39.5% for the comparable quarter last year. Our capital spending during the fiscal first quarter 2010 was approximately $39 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects whose impact is viewed as important to our future.
While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long term success. With our annual meeting of shareholders scheduled to take place on Tuesday, June 29, we encourage shareholders who have not yet voted to take advantage of electronic voting either via the internet or by telephone.
We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produced Bed Bath & Beyond's long term success.

Four, based on results today and our comparable store sales assumptions, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by a high-single digit percentage in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 and consistent with our prior conference call by a mid-single digit percentage in the second half of fiscal 2010.

Eleven, subject to business and market conditions, we expect to continue our share repurchase program.
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are modeling diluted earnings per share in the fiscal second quarter to be in the range of approximately $0.59 to $0.63. For all of fiscal 2010, we're modeling diluted earnings per share to increase by approximately 15%.
Before concluding this afternoon's (call), a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal first quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong and debt-free. We ended the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.8 billion.
This includes approximately $150 million of investments related to auction rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $3 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity.
Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings. During the first quarter, we had approximately $31 million of redemptions of auction rate securities at par, of which $17 million related to the previously disclosed $43 million redemptions commitment we have with an investment firm.
Of the remaining $26 million of this commitment, $17 million has been received so far in the second quarter, and the remaining $9 million is expected to be received on or about July 1, 2010.
As we have said in the past, and as we have experienced to-date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities.
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good shape. As of May 29, 2010 inventories were approximately $1.8 billion or $54.49 per square foot, an increase of approximately 3% on a per square foot basis versus last year.
Consolidated shareholders equity at May 29, 2010 was approximately $3.8 billion, which is net of share repurchases, including approximately $85 million repurchased during the fiscal first quarter.
As a reminder, our next conference call to review operating results for the second quarter ending on August 28, 2010 will be on Wednesday, September 22, 2010. If you have any questions, Ken, Fran and I will be in our offices this evening, June 23, to take your calls.

We continue to work to increase the productivity of our existing stores by evolving the merchandise offering, as well as by expanding, renovating, remodeling and/or relocating stores to enhance our customer shopping experience. Our ability to leverage the breadth and depth of our merchandise offering, grow our Bridal, Baby and Gift registries and continued development of our online sales capabilities has afforded us additional opportunities to attract new customers to Bed Bath & Beyond.
The success of our company is due, in large part, to the tremendous efforts of our associates and to our unique decentralized culture. This culture which takes advantage of the knowledge, independence and the customer focus of our associates has always been the foundation of our long-term performance and allows us to respond more quickly to local market demands and to changing economic conditions on a market-by-market basis. We are confident that we have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near- and long-term goals.

We are pleased that our first quarter results exceeded our internal planning assumptions. The dedication and talents of our associates and our constant focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience, while at the same time, creating a more productive and efficient company are the keys to producing the continued strong results we have experienced. 
As Len said, while it appears that the economic environment may be stabilizing, persistent high unemployment and uncertainty in the economy could continue to pressure the consumer and affect their spending. Although economic challenges persist, our fundamental business strategy has remained unchanged, to offer a broad assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices with superior customer service.
We continue to systematically challenge the costs associated with running our company. And although during the second half of last year, we anniversaried many of the more significant expense reduction initiatives that we instituted, we continue to strive to find opportunities to lower our operating costs. We also continue to work to enhance our customers' overall shopping experience, and we remain committed to being our customers' first choice for the merchandise categories we offer, domestically, interactively and, over the longer term, internationally. 
We are confident that our company is well positioned to grow profitably, deliver superior shareholder value and to compete and increase our market share over time. As always, we remain focused on building a business that stands the test of time. In taking this long-term approach to building our Bed Bath & Beyond, Christmas Tree Shops, buybuy BABY and Harmon Face Values concepts and through the ongoing effort to cross-merchandise and leverage our best practices across each of our concepts, we expect over time to do more for and with our customers.
Turning to our fiscal first quarter 2010 performance. As reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $0.52, an increase of approximately 53% versus the $0.34 per share earned in last year's first quarter. Net sales for the fiscal first quarter were approximately $1.9 billion, approximately 13.5% higher than the corresponding fiscal 2009 period. First quarter comp store sales increased approximately 8.4% versus a decrease of approximately 1.6% last year. 
Gross profit for the fiscal first quarter was approximately 40.3% of net sales compared to approximately 39.4% of net sales for the fiscal first quarter of 2009. This increase of approximately 90 basis points resulted primarily from decreases in coupon redemptions and inventory acquisition costs as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower-margin categories.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal first quarter were approximately 28.6% of net sales as compared to approximately 31% of net sales in last year's first quarter, a decrease of approximately 240 basis points. This decrease can be primarily attributed to lower advertising and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales. Advertising expense decreased due to a continued reduction in the distribution of advertising pieces. Occupancy, as with other fixed costs, benefited from the 8.4% increase in comparable store sales.
Reflecting the movement in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal first quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago by approximately 330 basis points. Our provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are re-evaluated. For the fiscal first quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 39.1% compared to approximately 39.5% for the comparable quarter last year. 
Our capital spending during the fiscal first quarter of 2010 was approximately $39 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects whose impact is viewed as important to our future. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success. 
With our annual meeting of shareholders scheduled to take place on Tuesday, June 29, we encourage shareholders who have not yet voted to take advantage of electronic voting either via the Internet or by telephone.
We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produced Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers and, by doing so, continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer.

As you heard from Steve, our results exceeded our planning assumptions and we earned $0.52 per diluted share in our fiscal first quarter. We remain encouraged by our positive fiscal first quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the year. The continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment makes it difficult to forecast future results. However, the following are our major planning assumptions for fiscal 2010. 
One, we anticipate opening approximately 55 to 60 stores across all of our concepts. Consistent with our historical experience, we anticipate that new store openings will occur throughout the year, with the majority in our fiscal second half. We remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. 
Two, we expect to continue our program of expanding, renovating, remodeling and/or relocating a number of our stores in fiscal 2010. 
Three, for the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we are modeling a mid-single-digit percentage increase in comparable store sales. As we said in our April conference call, for the second half of fiscal 2010, considering the higher comparable store sales comparisons as well as less visibility to future economic conditions, we are modeling a low single-digit percentage increase in comparable store sales. 
Four, based on our results to date and our comparable store sales assumptions, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by a high single-digit percentage in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. And consistent with our prior conference call, by a mid-single-digit percentage in the second half of fiscal 2010. 
Five, assuming these sales levels, we would expect leverage in our operating profit margin for both the fiscal second quarter and the full year. 
Six, interest income is expected to be relatively flat versus fiscal 2009. 
Seven, the second quarter and full year tax provision is estimated in the mid to high 30% range, with variability as taxable events occur. 
Eight, capital expenditures for fiscal 2010, principally for new stores, existing store refurbishments, information technology enhancements and other projects are currently planned at approximately $225 million. 
Nine, depreciation for fiscal 2010 is estimated to be approximately $180 million. 
10, we expect to generate positive cash flow in fiscal 2010 and to continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources. 
11, subject to business and market conditions, we expect to continue our share repurchase program. 
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are modeling diluted earnings per share in the fiscal second quarter to be in the range of approximately $0.59 to $0.63. For all of fiscal 2010, we are modeling diluted earnings per share to increase by approximately 15%.
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal first quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong and debt-free. We ended the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.8 billion. This includes approximately $150 million of investments related to auction rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $3 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings. 
During the first quarter, we had approximately $31 million of redemptions of auction rate securities at par, of which $17 million related to the previously disclosed $43 million redemption commitment we have with an investment firm. Of the remaining $26 million of this commitment, $17 million has been received so far in the second quarter, and the remaining $9 million is expected to be received on or about July 1, 2010. As we have said in the past and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover, at par, all amounts invested in these securities.
Inventories continue to be tailored by stores to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good shape. As of May 29, 2010, inventories were approximately $1.8 billion or $54.49 per square foot, an increase of approximately 3% on a per-square-foot basis versus last year.  Consolidated shareholders equity at May 29, 2010, was approximately $3.8 billion, which is net of share repurchases, including approximately $85 million repurchased during the fiscal first quarter. 
As a reminder, our next conference call to review operating results for the second quarter ending on August 28, 2010, will be on Wednesday, September 22, 2010. If you have any questions, Ken, Frank and I will be in our offices this evening, June 23, to take your calls. As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond."

I am pleased to report that our company's net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 53% in the fiscal first quarter to $0.52. While the economic environment appears to be showing some signs of stabilizing, it appears the consumer continues to face economic challenges and the pressures of the macroeconomic environment still persist. As such, we remain cautiously optimistic as we continue fiscal 2010.
During the fiscal first quarter, we opened two Bed Bath & Beyond and two buybuy BABY stores as well as relocated and renovated a number of Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Consolidated store space at May 29, 2010, was approximately 33.9 million square feet, an increase of approximately 5% over last year's first quarter. Since the beginning of the fiscal second quarter of 2010, we have opened one additional Bed Bath & Beyond store. We currently operate 1,105 stores, including 968 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada as well as 61 Christmas Tree Shops, 31 buybuy BABY stores and 45 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. In addition, we are a partner in a joint venture which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More.
During fiscal 2010, including the five stores we have opened to date, we anticipate opening a total of approximately 55 to 60 stores across all of our concepts. We look forward to expanding into our 50th state, Hawaii, with a Bed Bath & Beyond store expected to open during the fiscal second quarter. We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all of our merchandise offerings. We continue to apply our stringent standards to growth as we evaluate new store sites as well as continue to review our existing locations and lease terms for opportunities to relocate and/or rightsize our stores in response to changing market conditions. As we have previously said, we believe throughout the United States and Canada, there was an opportunity to operate in excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, as well as grow our Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast to coast.

I am pleased to report that our company's net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 53% in the fiscal first quarter to $0.52. While the economic environment appears to be showing some signs of stabilizing, it appears the consumer continues to face economic challenges and the pressures of the macroeconomic environment still persist. As such, we remain cautiously optimistic as we continue fiscal 2010.
During the fiscal first quarter, we opened two Bed Bath & Beyond and two buybuy BABY stores as well as relocated and renovated a number of Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Consolidated store space at May 29, 2010, was approximately 33.9 million square feet, an increase of approximately 5% over last year's first quarter. Since the beginning of the fiscal second quarter of 2010, we have opened one additional Bed Bath & Beyond store. We currently operate 1,105 stores, including 968 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada as well as 61 Christmas Tree Shops, 31 buybuy BABY stores and 45 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. In addition, we are a partner in a joint venture which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More.
During fiscal 2010, including the five stores we have opened to date, we anticipate opening a total of approximately 55 to 60 stores across all of our concepts. We look forward to expanding into our 50th state, Hawaii, with a Bed Bath & Beyond store expected to open during the fiscal second quarter. We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all of our merchandise offerings. We continue to apply our stringent standards to growth as we evaluate new store sites as well as continue to review our existing locations and lease terms for opportunities to relocate and/or rightsize our stores in response to changing market conditions. As we have previously said, we believe throughout the United States and Canada, there was an opportunity to operate in excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, as well as grow our Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast to coast. Additionally, we will continue to open Harmon Face Values stores and selectively place health and beauty care offerings in all our concepts. 
We continue to work to increase the productivity of our existing stores by evolving the merchandise offering, as well as by expanding, renovating, remodeling and/or relocating stores to enhance our customer shopping experience. Our ability to leverage the breadth and depth of our merchandise offering, grow our Bridal, Baby and Gift registries and continued development of our online sales capabilities has afforded us additional opportunities to attract new customers to Bed Bath & Beyond.
The success of our company is due, in large part, to the tremendous efforts of our associates and to our unique decentralized culture. This culture which takes advantage of the knowledge, independence and the customer focus of our associates has always been the foundation of our long-term performance and allows us to respond more quickly to local market demands and to changing economic conditions on a market-by-market basis. We are confident that we have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near- and long-term goals.

We are pleased that our first quarter results exceeded our internal planning assumptions. The dedication and talents of our associates and our constant focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience, while at the same time, creating a more productive and efficient company are the keys to producing the continued strong results we have experienced. 
As Len said, while it appears that the economic environment may be stabilizing, persistent high unemployment and uncertainty in the economy could continue to pressure the consumer and affect their spending. Although economic challenges persist, our fundamental business strategy has remained unchanged, to offer a broad assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices with superior customer service.
We continue to systematically challenge the costs associated with running our company. And although during the second half of last year, we anniversaried many of the more significant expense reduction initiatives that we instituted, we continue to strive to find opportunities to lower our operating costs. We also continue to work to enhance our customers' overall shopping experience, and we remain committed to being our customers' first choice for the merchandise categories we offer, domestically, interactively and, over the longer term, internationally. 
We are confident that our company is well positioned to grow profitably, deliver superior shareholder value and to compete and increase our market share over time. As always, we remain focused on building a business that stands the test of time. In taking this long-term approach to building our Bed Bath & Beyond, Christmas Tree Shops, buybuy BABY and Harmon Face Values concepts and through the ongoing effort to cross-merchandise and leverage our best practices across each of our concepts, we expect over time to do more for and with our customers.
Turning to our fiscal first quarter 2010 performance. As reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $0.52, an increase of approximately 53% versus the $0.34 per share earned in last year's first quarter. Net sales for the fiscal first quarter were approximately $1.9 billion, approximately 13.5% higher than the corresponding fiscal 2009 period. First quarter comp store sales increased approximately 8.4% versus a decrease of approximately 1.6% last year. 
Gross profit for the fiscal first quarter was approximately 40.3% of net sales compared to approximately 39.4% of net sales for the fiscal first quarter of 2009. This increase of approximately 90 basis points resulted primarily from decreases in coupon redemptions and inventory acquisition costs as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower-margin categories.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal first quarter were approximately 28.6% of net sales as compared to approximately 31% of net sales in last year's first quarter, a decrease of approximately 240 basis points. This decrease can be primarily attributed to lower advertising and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales. Advertising expense decreased due to a continued reduction in the distribution of advertising pieces. Occupancy, as with other fixed costs, benefited from the 8.4% increase in comparable store sales.
Reflecting the movement in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal first quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago by approximately 330 basis points. Our provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are re-evaluated. For the fiscal first quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 39.1% compared to approximately 39.5% for the comparable quarter last year. 
Our capital spending during the fiscal first quarter of 2010 was approximately $39 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects whose impact is viewed as important to our future. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success. 
With our annual meeting of shareholders scheduled to take place on Tuesday, June 29, we encourage shareholders who have not yet voted to take advantage of electronic voting either via the Internet or by telephone.
We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produced Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers and, by doing so, continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer.

As you heard from Steve, our results exceeded our planning assumptions and we earned $0.52 per diluted share in our fiscal first quarter. We remain encouraged by our positive fiscal first quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the year. The continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment makes it difficult to forecast future results. However, the following are our major planning assumptions for fiscal 2010. 
One, we anticipate opening approximately 55 to 60 stores across all of our concepts. Consistent with our historical experience, we anticipate that new store openings will occur throughout the year, with the majority in our fiscal second half. We remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. 
Two, we expect to continue our program of expanding, renovating, remodeling and/or relocating a number of our stores in fiscal 2010. 
Three, for the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we are modeling a mid-single-digit percentage increase in comparable store sales. As we said in our April conference call, for the second half of fiscal 2010, considering the higher comparable store sales comparisons as well as less visibility to future economic conditions, we are modeling a low single-digit percentage increase in comparable store sales. 
Four, based on our results to date and our comparable store sales assumptions, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by a high single-digit percentage in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. And consistent with our prior conference call, by a mid-single-digit percentage in the second half of fiscal 2010. 
Five, assuming these sales levels, we would expect leverage in our operating profit margin for both the fiscal second quarter and the full year. 
Six, interest income is expected to be relatively flat versus fiscal 2009. 
Seven, the second quarter and full year tax provision is estimated in the mid to high 30% range, with variability as taxable events occur. 
Eight, capital expenditures for fiscal 2010, principally for new stores, existing store refurbishments, information technology enhancements and other projects are currently planned at approximately $225 million. 
Nine, depreciation for fiscal 2010 is estimated to be approximately $180 million. 
10, we expect to generate positive cash flow in fiscal 2010 and to continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources. 
11, subject to business and market conditions, we expect to continue our share repurchase program. 
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are modeling diluted earnings per share in the fiscal second quarter to be in the range of approximately $0.59 to $0.63. For all of fiscal 2010, we are modeling diluted earnings per share to increase by approximately 15%.
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal first quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong and debt-free. We ended the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.8 billion. This includes approximately $150 million of investments related to auction rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $3 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings. 
During the first quarter, we had approximately $31 million of redemptions of auction rate securities at par, of which $17 million related to the previously disclosed $43 million redemption commitment we have with an investment firm. Of the remaining $26 million of this commitment, $17 million has been received so far in the second quarter, and the remaining $9 million is expected to be received on or about July 1, 2010. As we have said in the past and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover, at par, all amounts invested in these securities.
Inventories continue to be tailored by stores to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good shape. As of May 29, 2010, inventories were approximately $1.8 billion or $54.49 per square foot, an increase of approximately 3% on a per-square-foot basis versus last year.  Consolidated shareholders equity at May 29, 2010, was approximately $3.8 billion, which is net of share repurchases, including approximately $85 million repurchased during the fiscal first quarter. 
As a reminder, our next conference call to review operating results for the second quarter ending on August 28, 2010, will be on Wednesday, September 22, 2010. If you have any questions, Ken, Frank and I will be in our offices this evening, June 23, to take your calls. As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond."

I am pleased to report that our company's net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 53% in the fiscal first quarter to $0.52. While the economic environment appears to be showing some signs of stabilizing, it appears the consumer continues to face economic challenges and the pressures of the macroeconomic environment still persist. As such, we remain cautiously optimistic as we continue fiscal 2010.
During the fiscal first quarter, we opened two Bed Bath & Beyond and two buybuy BABY stores as well as relocated and renovated a number of Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Consolidated store space at May 29, 2010, was approximately 33.9 million square feet, an increase of approximately 5% over last year's first quarter. Since the beginning of the fiscal second quarter of 2010, we have opened one additional Bed Bath & Beyond store. We currently operate 1,105 stores, including 968 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada as well as 61 Christmas Tree Shops, 31 buybuy BABY stores and 45 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. In addition, we are a partner in a joint venture which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More.
During fiscal 2010, including the five stores we have opened to date, we anticipate opening a total of approximately 55 to 60 stores across all of our concepts. We look forward to expanding into our 50th state, Hawaii, with a Bed Bath & Beyond store expected to open during the fiscal second quarter. We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all of our merchandise offerings. We continue to apply our stringent standards to growth as we evaluate new store sites as well as continue to review our existing locations and lease terms for opportunities to relocate and/or rightsize our stores in response to changing market conditions. As we have previously said, we believe throughout the United States and Canada, there was an opportunity to operate in excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, as well as grow our Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast to coast. Additionally, we will continue to open Harmon Face Values stores and selectively place health and beauty care offerings in all our concepts. 
We continue to work to increase the productivity of our existing stores by evolving the merchandise offering, as well as by expanding, renovating, remodeling and/or relocating stores to enhance our customer shopping experience. Our ability to leverage the breadth and depth of our merchandise offering, grow our Bridal, Baby and Gift registries and continue the development of our online sales capabilities has afforded us additional opportunities to attract new customers to Bed Bath & Beyond.
The success of our company is due, in large part, to the tremendous efforts of our associates and to our unique decentralized culture. This culture which takes advantage of the knowledge, independence and the customer focus of our associates has always been the foundation of our long-term performance and allows us to respond more quickly to local market demands and to changing economic conditions on a market-by-market basis. We are confident that we have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near- and long-term goals. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Steven Temares. Steve?"

We are pleased that our first quarter results exceeded our internal planning assumptions. The dedication and talents of our associates and our constant focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience, while at the same time, creating a more productive and efficient company are the keys to producing the continued strong results we have experienced. 
As Len said, while it appears that the economic environment may be stabilizing, persistent high unemployment and uncertainty in the economy could continue to pressure the consumer and affect their spending. Although economic challenges persist, our fundamental business strategy has remained unchanged, to offer a broad assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices with superior customer service.
We continue to systematically challenge the costs associated with running our company. And although during the second half of last year, we anniversaried many of the more significant expense reduction initiatives that we instituted, we continue to strive to find opportunities to lower our operating costs. We also continue to work to enhance our customers' overall shopping experience, and we remain committed to being our customers' first choice for the merchandise categories we offer, domestically, interactively and, over the longer term, internationally. 
We are confident that our company is well positioned to grow profitably, deliver superior shareholder value and to compete and increase our market share over time. As always, we remain focused on building a business that stands the test of time. In taking this long-term approach to building our Bed Bath & Beyond, Christmas Tree Shops, buybuy BABY and Harmon Face Values concepts and through the ongoing effort to cross-merchandise and leverage our best practices across each of our concepts, we expect over time to do more for and with our customers.
Turning to our fiscal first quarter 2010 performance. As reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $0.52, an increase of approximately 53% versus the $0.34 per share earned in last year's first quarter. Net sales for the fiscal first quarter were approximately $1.9 billion, approximately 13.5% higher than the corresponding fiscal 2009 period. First quarter comp store sales increased approximately 8.4% versus a decrease of approximately 1.6% last year. 
Gross profit for the fiscal first quarter was approximately 40.3% of net sales compared to approximately 39.4% of net sales for the fiscal first quarter of 2009. This increase of approximately 90 basis points resulted primarily from decreases in coupon redemptions and inventory acquisition costs as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower-margin categories.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal first quarter were approximately 28.6% of net sales as compared to approximately 31% of net sales in last year's first quarter, a decrease of approximately 240 basis points. This decrease can be primarily attributed to lower advertising and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales. Advertising expense decreased due to a continued reduction in the distribution of advertising pieces. Occupancy, as with other fixed costs, benefited from the 8.4% increase in comparable store sales.
Reflecting the movement in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal first quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago by approximately 330 basis points. Our provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are re-evaluated. For the fiscal first quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 39.1% compared to approximately 39.5% for the comparable quarter last year. 
Our capital spending during the fiscal first quarter of 2010 was approximately $39 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects whose impact is viewed as important to our future. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success. 
With our annual meeting of shareholders scheduled to take place on Tuesday, June 29, we encourage shareholders who have not yet voted to take advantage of electronic voting either via the Internet or by telephone.
We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produced Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers and, by doing so, continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer.

As you heard from Steve, our results exceeded our planning assumptions and we earned $0.52 per diluted share in our fiscal first quarter. We remain encouraged by our positive fiscal first quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the year. The continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment makes it difficult to forecast future results. However, the following are our major planning assumptions for fiscal 2010. 
One, we anticipate opening approximately 55 to 60 stores across all of our concepts. Consistent with our historical experience, we anticipate that new store openings will occur throughout the year, with the majority in our fiscal second half. We remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. 
Two, we expect to continue our program of expanding, renovating, remodeling and/or relocating a number of our stores in fiscal 2010. 
Three, for the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we are modeling a mid-single-digit percentage increase in comparable store sales. As we said in our April conference call, for the second half of fiscal 2010, considering the higher comparable store sales comparisons as well as less visibility to future economic conditions, we are modeling a low single-digit percentage increase in comparable store sales. 
Four, based on our results to date and our comparable store sales assumptions, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by a high single-digit percentage in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. And consistent with our prior conference call, by a mid-single-digit percentage in the second half of fiscal 2010. 
Five, assuming these sales levels, we would expect leverage in our operating profit margin for both the fiscal second quarter and the full year. 
Six, interest income is expected to be relatively flat versus fiscal 2009. 
Seven, the second quarter and full year tax provision is estimated in the mid to high 30% range, with variability as taxable events occur. 
Eight, capital expenditures for fiscal 2010, principally for new stores, existing store refurbishment, information technology enhancements and other projects are currently planned at approximately $225 million. 
Nine, depreciation for fiscal 2010 is estimated to be approximately $180 million. 
10, we expect to generate positive cash flow in fiscal 2010 and to continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources. 
11, subject to business and market conditions, we expect to continue our share repurchase program. 
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are modeling diluted earnings per share in the fiscal second quarter to be in the range of approximately $0.59 to $0.63. For all of fiscal 2010, we are modeling diluted earnings per share to increase by approximately 15%.
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal first quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong and debt-free. We ended the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.8 billion. This includes approximately $150 million of investments related to auction rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $3 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings. 
During the first quarter, we had approximately $31 million of redemptions of auction rate securities at par, of which $17 million related to the previously disclosed $43 million redemption commitment we have with an investment firm. Of the remaining $26 million of this commitment, $17 million has been received so far in the second quarter, and the remaining $9 million is expected to be received on or about July 1, 2010. As we have said in the past and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover, at par, all amounts invested in these securities.
Inventories continue to be tailored by stores to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good shape. As of May 29, 2010, inventories were approximately $1.8 billion or $54.49 per square foot, an increase of approximately 3% on a per-square-foot basis versus last year.  Consolidated shareholders equity at May 29, 2010, was approximately $3.8 billion, which is net of share repurchases, including approximately $85 million repurchased during the fiscal first quarter. 
As a reminder, our next conference call to review operating results for the second quarter ending on August 28, 2010, will be on Wednesday, September 22, 2010. If you have any questions, Ken, Frank and I will be in our offices this evening, June 23, to take your calls. As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond."

While the economic environment appears to have stabilized, it looks as if the consumer continues to face challenges as a result of the macroeconomic environment. And as such, and as we said previously, we are cautiously optimistic about the remainder of fiscal 2010.
During the second quarter, we opened five Bed Bath & Beyond stores, including our first store in our 50th state, Hawaii. Additionally, we opened two buybuy BABY stores, as well as expanded and renovated several Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Consolidated store space at August 28, 2010 was approximately 34.1 million square feet, an increase of approximately 5% over last year's second quarter. 
Since the beginning of the third fiscal quarter of 2010, we've opened one additional Bed Bath & Beyond store, two buybuy BABY stores and one Christmas Tree Shops store. So we currently operate 1,115 stores, including 973 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada, as well as 62 Christmas Tree Shops, 35 buybuy BABY stores and 45 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. In addition, we were partner in a joint venture, which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More.
During fiscal 2010, including the 15 stores we've opened to date, we now anticipate that the total number of new store openings will be in the mid- to high-40s range across all of our concepts. As the years progress, this revised number primary reflects greater visibility into the number of stores that will open in late fiscal 2010, versus opening in fiscal 2011. 
As we have said in the past, a shift in store openings from late in the fiscal year into the next fiscal year, have little impact on our current year earnings and long-term profitability. We continue to acquire our stringent standards to growth, as we evaluate new store sites, as well as continue to review our existing locations, and leased terms for opportunities to relocate and/or rightsize our stores in response to changing market conditions. 
As we previously said, we believe that throughout the United States and Canada, there is an opportunity to operate in excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, as well as grow our Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast-to-coast.

Turning to our fiscal second quarter performance. As reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $0.70, an increase of approximately 35% when compared to the $0.52 per share that we earned in last year's second quarter. For the fiscal first half, net earnings per diluted share were $1.22 compared with $0.86 last year. Net sales for the fiscal second quarter were approximately $2.1 billion, approximately 11.6% higher than in the corresponding 2009 period. 
Second quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 7.4% versus a decrease of approximately 0.6% last year. For the fiscal first half, net sales were approximately $4.1 billion, about 12.5% higher than last year. Comp store sales for the fiscal first half increased by approximately 7.9% compared with a decrease of approximately 1.1% in last year's first half.
Gross profit for the fiscal second quarter was approximately 40.9% of net sales compared to approximately 40.4% of net sales for the second quarter of 2009. This increase in the gross profit margin, resulted primarily from a decrease in coupon redemptions as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal second quarter were approximately 27.1% of net sales, as compared to approximately 28.8% of net sales in last year's second quarter, a decrease of approximately 170 basis points. This decrease can be primarily be attributed to lower advertising, payroll and occupancy expenses, as a percentage of net sales. Advertising expense decreased due to a continued reduction in the distribution of advertising pieces. Payroll and occupancy expenses benefited from the approximate 7.4% increase in comparable store sales.
Reflecting the movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal second quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago, by approximately 230 basis points. For the fiscal first half, the operating profit margin increased by approximately 280 basis points. 
Our provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate, as taxable events occur and exposures are re-evaluated. For the fiscal second quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 38.9% compared to approximately 39.4% for the comparable quarter last year.
Our capital spending during the first half of 2010 was approximately $84 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects whose impact is viewed as important to our future. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success.

As you heard from Warren and Steve, our results exceeded our planning assumptions, and we earned $0.70 per diluted share in our fiscal second quarter and $1.22 per diluted share for the first six months of fiscal 2010. 
We remain encouraged by our positive fiscal second quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the second half of fiscal 2010. The continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment makes it difficult to forecast future results. However, the following are our major planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2010.
One, including the 15 stores opened so far this year, we expect the total number of new store openings across all of our concepts to be in the mid- to high-40s range. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. Two, we expect to continue our program of expanding, renovating, remodeling and/or relocating a number of our stores in fiscal 2010. Three, if you recall, last year's comp store sales improved from a decrease of approximately 1.1% in the first half, to an increase of approximately 9.5% in the second half. Taking this more difficult second half comparison into consideration, for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2010, we are modeling a low single-digit percentage increase in comparable store sales. This would result in a mid-single-digit percentage comp store sales increase for all of fiscal 2010. Four, based on our results to date and our comparable store sales assumptions, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2010 and by a high single-digit percentage for all of fiscal 2010.
Five, for the remainder of the year, assuming these sales levels and modeling advertising events that are consistent with the second half of last year, in addition to planning the continuation of the shift in mix of merchandise sold to lower-margin categories, we are modeling our operating profit as a percentage of sales to be relatively flat in the third quarter and to deleverage in our fourth quarter. For all of fiscal 2010, we will expect to leverage our operating profit.
Six, interest income is expected to be relatively flat in the back half of 2010 versus the same period in fiscal 2009. Seven, the third quarter and full year tax provisions are estimated in the high-30s percent range, with variability as taxable events occur. Eight, capital expenditures for fiscal 2010, principally for new stores, existing store refurbishment, information technology enhancements and other projects continue to be planned at approximately $225 million, which of course remains subject to the timing of projects.
Nine, depreciation for fiscal 2010 is estimated to be approximately $180 million. Ten, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2010 and continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources. Eleven, we expect to continue our share repurchase program and evaluate the amount of repurchases based upon business and economic conditions.
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share in the fiscal third quarter to be in the range of approximately $0.61 to $0.65. For all of fiscal 2010, we are now modeling net earnings per diluted share to increase by approximately 20%, up from the previous model of approximately 15%.
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal second quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong and debt free. We ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investments securities of approximately $1.8 billion. This includes approximately $123.8 million of investments related to auction rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $3.1 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings.
During the second quarter, we had approximately $26 million of redemptions of auction rate securities at par. Subsequent to the second quarter, we had approximately $2.4 million of auction rate security redemptions at par, leaving a balance of approximately $121.4 million of these securities. As we have said in the past and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities.
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. As of August 28, 2010, inventories were approximately $1.9 billion or $55.78 per square foot, an increase of approximately 3.4% on a per-square-foot basis versus last year. Consolidated shareholders equity at August 28, 2010, was approximately $3.8 billion, which is net of share repurchases, including approximately $193 million, representing approximately 4.9 million shares repurchased during the fiscal second quarter.
As a reminder, our next conference call to review operating results for the third quarter ending on November 27, 2010, will be on Wednesday, December 22, 2010. If you have any questions, Kenneth Frankel and I, will be in our offices this evening, September 22 to take your calls. As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond."

I am pleased to report that our company's net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 35% in the fiscal second quarter to $0.70. While the economic environment appears to have stabilized, it looks as if the consumer continues to face challenges as a result of the macroeconomic environment. And as such, and as we said previously, we are cautiously optimistic about the remainder of fiscal 2010.
During the second quarter, we opened five Bed Bath & Beyond stores, including our first store in our 50th state, Hawaii. Additionally, we opened two buybuy BABY stores as well as expanded and renovated several Bed Bath & Beyond stores.
Consolidated store space at August 28, 2010 was approximately 34.1 million square feet, an increase of approximately 5% over last year's second quarter. Since the beginning of the third fiscal quarter of 2010, we have opened one additional Bed Bath & Beyond store, two buybuy BABY stores, and one Christmas Tree Shops store.
So we currently operate 1,115 stores, including 973 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, The District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Canada, as well as 62 Christmas Tree Shops, 35 buybuy BABY stores, and 45 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. In addition, we are a partner in a joint venture, which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More.
During fiscal 2010, including the 15 stores we have opened to-date, we now anticipate that total number of new store openings will be in the mid-to-high 40s range across all of our concepts. As the year has progressed, this revised number primarily reflects greater visibility into the number of stores that will open in late fiscal 2010 versus opening in the fiscal 2011.
As we have said in the past, a shift in store openings from late in the fiscal year into the next fiscal year has little impact on our current year earnings and long-term profitability. We continue to apply our stringent standards to growth as we evaluate new store sites as well as continue to review our existing locations and lease terms for opportunities to relocate and/or right-size our stores in response to changing market conditions.
As we have previously said, we believe that throughout the United States and Canada there is an opportunity to operate in excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores as well as grow our Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast to coast. Additionally, we will continue to open Harmon Face Values stores and selectively place health and beauty care offerings in all our concepts.
We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all our merchandise offerings. We continue to work to increase the productivity of our existing stores by evolving the merchandise offerings as well as by expanding, renovating, remodeling and/or relocating stores to enhance our customers' shopping experience.
Our ability to leverage the breadth and depth of our merchandise offerings; grow our Bridal, Baby, and Gift registries; and continue the development of our online sales capabilities has afforded us additional opportunities to attract new customers to Bed Bath & Beyond.
The continued success of our company is due in large part to the tremendous efforts of our associates and to our unique decentralized culture. This culture, which takes advantage of the knowledge, the independence, and the customer focus of our associates, has always been the foundation of our long-term performance and allows us to respond more quickly to local market demand and the changing economic conditions on a market-by-market basis. We are confident that we have the people, the resources, and the capability to achieve our near and long-term goals.
And now I'll turn the call over to Steven Temares. Steve?

We are pleased that our second quarter results exceeded our internal planning assumptions. We believe the dedication and talents of our associates and their constant focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience while at the same time creating a more productive and efficient company are the key to producing the continued strong results we have experienced.
As Warren said, while it appears that the economic environment has stabilized, persistent high unemployment and uncertainty in the economy could continue to pressure consumers and affect their spending. However, we remain cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the year. Although economic challenges persist, our fundamental business strategy has remained unchanged to offer a broad assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices with superior customer service.
As always, we will continue to work to enhance our customers’ overall shopping experience and we remain committed to being our customers’ first choice for the merchandise categories we offer, domestically, interactively, and over the longer term, internationally. At the same time, we will continue to systematically challenge the costs associated with running our company and strive to find opportunities to lower our operating costs.
We are confident that our company is well positioned to grow profitably, deliver superior shareholder value, and to compete and increase our market share over time. As always, we remain focused on building a business that stands the test of time. In taking this long-term approach to building our Bed Bath & Beyond, Christmas Tree Shops, buybuy BABY, and Harmon Face Values concepts and through the ongoing effort to cross-merchandise and leverage our best practices across all our concepts, we expect over time to do more for and with our customers.
Turning to our fiscal second quarter performance, as reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share was $0.70, an increase of approximately 35% when compared to the $0.52 per share that we earned in last year's second quarter. For the fiscal first half, net earnings per diluted share were $1.22 compared with $0.86 last year.
Net sales for the fiscal second quarter were approximately $2.1 billion, approximately 11.6% higher than in the corresponding 2009 period. Second quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 7.4% versus a decrease of approximately 0.6% last year. For the fiscal first half, net sales were approximately $4.1 billion, about 12.5% higher than last year. Comp store sales for the fiscal first half increased by approximately 7.9% compared with a decrease of approximately 1.1% in last year’s first half.
Gross profit for the fiscal second quarter was approximately 40.9% of net sales compared to approximately 40.4% of net sales for the second quarter of 2009. This increase in the gross profit margin resulted primarily from a decrease in coupon redemptions as a percentage of net sales partially offset by a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal second quarter were approximately 27.1% of net sales as compared to approximately 28.8% of net sales in last year's second quarter, a decrease of approximately 170 basis points. This decrease can be primarily attributed to lower advertising, payroll and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales.
Advertising expense decreased due to a continued reduction in the distribution of advertising pieces. Payroll and occupancy expenses benefited from the approximate 7.4% increase in comparable store sales.
Reflecting the movement in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal second quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago by approximately 230 basis points. For the fiscal first half, the operating profit margin increased by approximately 280 basis points. Our provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate, as tax law events occur and exposures are reevaluated.
For the fiscal second quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 38.9% compared to approximately 39.4% for the comparable quarter last year. Our capital spending during the first half of 2010 was approximately $84 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements, and other projects whose impact is viewed as important to our future.
While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success. We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produces Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers, and by doing so, continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer.
I'll now turn the call back to Gene. Gene?

As you heard from Warren and Steve, our results exceeded our planning assumptions and we earned $0.70 per diluted share in our fiscal second quarter and $1.22 per diluted share for the first six months of fiscal 2010. We remain encouraged by our positive fiscal second quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the second half of fiscal 2010.
The continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment makes it difficult to forecast future results. However, the following are our major planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2010. One, including the 15 stores opened so far this year, we expect the total number of new stores openings across all of our concepts to be in the mid-to-high 40s range. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. Two, we expect to continue our program of expanding, renovating, remodeling and/or relocating a number of our stores in fiscal 2010.
Three, if you recall, last year's comp store sales improved from a decrease of approximately 1.1% in the first half to an increase of approximately 9.5% in the second half. Taking this more difficult second half comparison into consideration, for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2010, we are modeling a low single-digit percentage increase in comparable store sales. This would result in a mid single-digit percentage comp store sales increase for all of fiscal 2010.
Four, based on our results to-date and our comparable store sales assumptions, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by a mid single-digit percentage in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2010 and by a high single-digit percentage for all of fiscal 2010.
Five, for the remainder of the year, assuming these sales levels and modeling advertising events that are consistent with the second half of last year, in addition to planning the continuation of the shift and mix of merchandise sold to lower-margin categories, we are modeling our operating profit as a percentage of sales to be relatively flat in the third quarter and to de-leverage in our fourth quarter. For all of fiscal 2010, we would expect to leverage our operating profit.
Six, interest income is expected to be relatively flat in the back half of 2010 versus the same period in fiscal 2009. Seven, the third quarter and full year tax provisions are estimated in the high-30s percent range with variability as taxable events occur.
Eight, capital expenditures for fiscal 2010, principally for new stores, existing store refurbishment, information technology enhancements and other projects, continue to be planned at approximately $225 million, which of course remain subject to the timing of projects. Nine, depreciation for fiscal 2010 is estimated to be approximately $180 million.
Ten, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2010 and continue to fund operations entirely from internally-generated sources. Eleven, we expect to continue our share repurchase program and evaluate the amount of repurchases based upon business and economic conditions.
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share in the fiscal third quarter to be in the range of approximately $0.61 to $0.65. For all of fiscal 2010, we are now modeling net earnings per diluted share to increase by approximately 20%, up from the previous model of approximately 15%.
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal second quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong and debt free. We ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.8 billion. This includes approximately $123.8 million of investments related to auction rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $3.1 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings.
During the second quarter, we had approximately $26 million of redemptions of auction rate securities at par. Subsequent to the second quarter, we had approximately $2.4 million of auction rate security redemptions at par, leaving a balance of approximately $121.4 million of these securities. As we have said in the past and as we have experienced to-date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover, at par, all amounts invested in these securities.
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. As of August 28, 2010, inventories were approximately $1.9 billion or $55.78 per square foot, an increase of approximately 3.4% on a per square foot basis versus last year.
Consolidated shareholders' equity at August 28, 2010 was approximately $3.8 billion, which is net of share repurchases, including approximately $193 million representing approximately 4.9 million shares repurchased during the fiscal second quarter.
As a reminder, our next conference call to review operating results for the third quarter ending on November 27, 2010 will be on Wednesday, December 22, 2010. If you have any questions, Kenneth Frankel and I will be in our offices this evening, September 22, to take your calls. As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond.

For the fiscal first half, net earnings per diluted share were $1.22 compared with $0.86 last year.

Second quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 7.4% versus a decrease of approximately 0.6% last year.

Comp store sales for the fiscal first half increased by approximately 7.9% compared with a decrease of approximately 1.1% in last year's first half.
Gross profit for the fiscal second quarter was approximately 40.9% of net sales compared to approximately 40.4% of net sales for the second quarter of 2009.

We remain encourage",862,"Thanks, Steve. As you heard from Warren and Steve, our results exceeded our planning assumptions, and we earned $0.70 per diluted share in our fiscal second quarter and $1.22 per diluted share for the first six months of fiscal 2010. 
We remain encouraged by our positive fiscal second quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the second half of fiscal 2010. The continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment makes it difficult to forecast future results. However, the following are our major planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2010.
One, including the 15 stores opened so far this year, we expect the total number of new store openings across all of our concepts to be in the mid- to high-40s range. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. Two, we expect to continue our program of expanding, renovating, remodeling and/or relocating a number of our stores in fiscal 2010. Three, if you recall, last year's comp store sales improved from a decrease of approximately 1.1% in the first half, to an increase of approximately 9.5% in the second half. Taking this more difficult second half comparison into consideration, for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2010, we are modeling a low single-digit percentage increase in comparable store sales. This would result in a mid-single-digit percentage comp store sales increase for all of fiscal 2010. Four, based on our results to date and our comparable store sales assumptions, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2010 and by a high single-digit percentage for all of fiscal 2010.
Five, for the remainder of the year, assuming these sales levels and modeling advertising events that are consistent with the second half of last year, in addition to planning the continuation of the shift in mix of merchandise sold to lower-margin categories, we are modeling our operating profit as a percentage of sales to be relatively flat in the third quarter and to deleverage in our fourth quarter. For all of fiscal 2010, we will expect to leverage our operating profit.
Six, interest income is expected to be relatively flat in the back half of 2010 versus the same period in fiscal 2009. Seven, the third quarter and full year tax provisions are estimated in the high-30s percent range, with variability as taxable events occur. Eight, capital expenditures for fiscal 2010, principally for new stores, existing store refurbishment, information technology enhancements and other projects continue to be planned at approximately $225 million, which of course remains subject to the timing of projects.
Nine, depreciation for fiscal 2010 is estimated to be approximately $180 million. Ten, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2010 and continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources. Eleven, we expect to continue our share repurchase program and evaluate the amount of repurchases based upon business and economic conditions.
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share in the fiscal third quarter to be in the range of approximately $0.61 to $0.65. For all of fiscal 2010, we are now modeling net earnings per diluted share to increase by approximately 20%, up from the previous model of approximately 15%.
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal second quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong and debt free. We ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.8 billion. This includes approximately $123.8 million of investments related to auction rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $3.1 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings.
During the second quarter, we had approximately $26 million of redemptions of auction rate securities at par. Subsequent to the second quarter, we had approximately $2.4 million of auction rate security redemptions at par, leaving a balance of approximately $121.4 million of these securities. As we have said in the past and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities.
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. As of August 28, 2010, inventories were approximately $1.9 billion or $55.78 per square foot, an increase of approximately 3.4% on a per-square-foot basis versus last year. Consolidated shareholders' equity at August 28, 2010, was approximately $3.8 billion, which is net of share repurchases, including approximately $193 million, representing approximately 4.9 million shares repurchased during the fiscal second quarter.
As a reminder, our next conference call to review operating results for the third quarter ending on November 27, 2010, will be on Wednesday, December 22, 2010. If you have any questions, Kenneth Frankel and I, will be in our offices this evening, September 22 to take your calls. As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond."

I am pleased to report that our company's net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 28% in the fiscal third quarter to $0.74.

I am pleased to report that our company's net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 28% in the fiscal third quarter to $0.74. While the economic environment appears to have stabilized, and is perhaps improving, it looks as if the consumer continues to face challenges resulting from the macroeconomic environment such as historically high unemployment rates. However, we are cautiously optimistic about the remainder of fiscal 2010.
During the third quarter, we opened five Bed Bath & Beyond stores, seven buybuy BABY stores and five Christmas Tree Shop stores, as well as relocated, expanded and renovated several Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Consolidated store space at November 27, 2010 was approximately 34.7 million square feet, an increase of approximately 4% over last year's third quarter.
Since the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2010, we have opened two additional Bed Bath & Beyond stores and two buybuy BABY stores. Including these openings, we currently operate 1,131 stores including 978 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Colombia, Puerto Rico and Canada, as well as 66 Christmas Tree Shops, 42 buybuy BABY stores and 45 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. In addition, we are a partner of the joint venture which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More.
During fiscal 2010, including the 32 stores we have opened to date, we anticipate that the total number of new store openings will be in the low forties across all of our concepts. As the year has progressed, this revised number primarily reflects greater visibility into the number of stores that will now open in fiscal 2011 versus the fourth quarter of 2010. 
As we have said in the past, the shift in store openings from late in the fiscal year into the next fiscal year has little impact on our current year earnings and long-term profitability. We continue to acquire our stringent standards to growth as we evaluate new store sites as well as continue to review our existing locations and lease terms for opportunities to relocate and/or rightsize our stores in response to changing market conditions.
As we have previously said, we believe that throughout the United States and Canada, there is an opportunity to operate an excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores as well as grow our Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast-to-coast. 
Additionally, we will continue to open Harmon Face Values stores and selectively place health and beauty care offerings in all our concepts. We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all our merchandise offerings.
We continue to work to increase the productivity of our existing stores by evolving the merchandise offerings as well as by expanding, renovating, remodeling and/or relocating stores to enhance our customers shopping experience. Our ability to leverage the breath and depth of our merchandise offerings, grow our bridal, baby and gift registries and continue the development of our interactive platforms has afforded us additional opportunities to attract new customers to Bed Bath & Beyond.
At this time, in conjunction with our ongoing review of our capital structure, I am pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program. We are currently planning that the new share repurchase program will commence in early fiscal 2011 at the completion of the existing program. 
Although the Board's authorization does not set a time limitation for the share repurchase, for planning purposes, the company anticipates completing the program over the next two years or so after it begins. It is currently anticipated that this new $2 billion share repurchase program will be funded from current cash and from present and future cash flows. 
This new program reflects the Board's continued confidence in our future. Since 2004 through the third quarter of fiscal 2010, our company has returned approximately $2.6 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases. The continued success of our company is due in large part to the tremendous efforts of our associates and to our unique decentralized culture. 
This culture takes advantage of the knowledge, the independence and the customer focus of our associates, has always been the foundation of our long-term performance and allows us to respond more quickly to market demands and the changing economic conditions on a market by market basis. We are confident that we have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near- and long-term goals. And now I'll turn the call over to Steven Temares. Steve?"
321778,113663864,91129,"Bed Bath & Beyond, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Dec 22, 2010",2010-12-22,"Earnings Calls","20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Len.

We are pleased that our third-quarter results exceeded our internal planning assumptions. We believe the dedication and talents of our associates and their constant focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience, while at the same time creating a more productive and efficient company, are the keys to producing the continued strong results we have experienced.
As Len said, while the period of the economic environment has stabilized and is perhaps improving, persistent high unemployment and uncertainty in the economy could continue to pressure consumers and affect their spending. However, as Len also said, we remain cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the year. Although economic challenges persist, our fundamental business strategy has remained unchanged to offer a broad assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices with superior customer service.
As always, we will continue to work to enhance our customers' overall shopping experience. And we remain committed to being our customers' first choice for the merchandise categories we offer domestically, interactively and over the longer term, internationally. 
At the same time, we'll continue to systematically challenge the costs associated with running our company and strive to find opportunities to lower operating costs. We are confident that our company is well-positioned to grow profitably, deliver superior shareholder value and to compete and increase our market share over time. As always, we remain focused on building a business that stands the test of time.
In taking this long-term approach to building our Bed Bath & Beyond, Christmas Tree Shops, buybuy BABY and Harmon Face Values concepts and through the ongoing efforts across merchandise and leverage our best practices across all of our concepts, we expect, over time, to do more for and with our customers.
Turning to our fiscal third quarter performance, as reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $0.74, an increase of approximately 28% when compared to the $0.58 per share that we earned in last year's third quarter. For the fiscal nine months, net earnings per diluted share were $1.95 compared with $1.44 last year, an increase of about 35%. Net sales for the fiscal third quarter were approximately $2.2 billion, approximately 11.1% higher than the corresponding 2009 period.
Third quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 7% compared with an increase of 7.3% last year. For the fiscal nine months, net sales were approximately $6.3 billion, about 12% higher than last year and comp store sales for the fiscal nine months increased by approximately 7.6% compared with an increase of 1.7% and last year's first nine months.
Gross profit for the first fiscal third quarter was approximately 40.9% of net sales compared to approximately 41.1% of net sales for the third quarter of 2009. This decrease in the gross profit margin resulted primarily from an increase in inventory acquisition costs and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, partially offset by a decrease in coupon redemptions as a percentage of net sales.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal third quarter were approximately 27% of net sales as compared to approximately 28.7% of net sales and last year's third quarter, a decrease of approximately 170 basis points. This decrease can primarily be attributed to lower payroll, occupancy and advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales. Payroll and occupancy expenses benefited from the approximate 7% increase in comp store sales. Advertising expense decreased due to a reduction in the distribution of advertising pieces, although not at the rate achieved in our most recent quarters.
Reflecting the movement in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal third quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago by approximately 150 basis points. For the fiscal nine months, the operating profit margin increased by approximately 230 basis points. 
For the fiscal third quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 38.6%, which is consistent with the comparable quarter last year. Our provision for income taxes is expected to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated.
Our capital spending during the first nine months of 2010 was approximately $142 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects whose impact is viewed as important to our future. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success.
As Len said, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program. Our Board took this action based upon its continued confidence in our company's long-term growth potential, financial outlook and cash flow generation. It's currently anticipated that this new $2 billion share repurchase program will be funded from current cash and from present and expected future cash flows. 
That said, our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise. 
We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts which produced Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers, and by doing so, continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer.

As you heard from Len and Steve, our results exceeded our planning assumptions and we earned $0.74 per diluted share in our fiscal third quarter and $1.95 per diluted share for the first nine months of fiscal 2010.
We remain encouraged by our positive fiscal third quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the remainder of fiscal 2010. The continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment makes it difficult to forecast future results. However, the following are our major planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2010.
One, including the 32 stores opened so far this year, we expect the total number of new store openings across all of our concepts to be in the low forties. Two, if you recall, last year's comp store sales improved in the fourth quarter by approximately 11.5%. Taking this tough fourth quarter comparison into consideration, for this year's fourth quarter, we are modeling a low single-digit percentage increase in comparable store sales. This would result in a mid- single-digit percent comp store sales increase for all of fiscal 2010. Three, based on our results to date and our comparable same-store sales assumptions, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by a mid single-digit percentage in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and by a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage for all of fiscal 2010. 
Four, assuming these sales levels, and modeling advertising events that are consistent with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 in addition to planning the continuation of the shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, we are modeling our operating profit as a percentage of sales to deleverage in the fourth quarter. For all of fiscal 2010, we expect leverage in our operating profit. 
Five, interest income is expected to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 versus the same period in fiscal 2009. Six, the fourth quarter and full year tax revisions are estimated in the high thirties percent range, with variability as taxable events occur. Seven, capital expenditures for fiscal 2010, principally for new stores, existing store refurbishment, information technology enhancements and other projects are now planned to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million, which of course remain subject to the timing of projects.
Eight, depreciation for fiscal 2010 is estimated to be approximately $180 million. Nine, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2010 and continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources. Ten, as previously discussed, we expect to continue our share repurchase program. 
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are now modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $0.91 to $0.95 for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2010 and approximately $2.86 to $2.90 for all of fiscal 2010. This would represent an increase of approximately 25% over fiscal 2009, up from our previous model of approximately 20%.
Turning to fiscal 2011, while we are still in the process of preparing our budget for next year and while we still believe that the continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment makes it difficult to forecast future results, our preliminary planning assumptions include the following.
One, we anticipate opening approximately the same number of stores as the current year. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. Two, we expect to continue our program of relocating, remodeling, renovating and expanding a number of our stores in 2011. Three, our operations will continue to be entirely funded from internally generated sources. 
Four, as previously discussed, we anticipate completing the current share repurchase program in early fiscal 2011 and begin our new $2 billion share repurchase program thereafter, which we are planning will take two years or so to complete after it begins. Five, in fiscal 2011, the Easter holidays falls three weeks later than in fiscal 2010. This may affect sales trends in the early part of the year. 
Six, we expect continuing variability in our quarterly tax rates. We expect to provide further information related to the fiscal first quarter and full year 2011 on our next quarterly conference call on April 6, 2011. Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal third quarter.
Our balance sheet remains strong and debt free. We ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.6 billion. This includes approximately $121.3 million of investments related to auction rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $2.9 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings.
During the third quarter, we had approximately $2.5 million of redemptions of auction rate securities at par. As we have said in the past, and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities.
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. As of November 27, 2010, inventories were approximately $2.2 billion or $62.59 per square foot, an increase of approximately 6.8% on a per square foot basis versus last year and 2.9% higher than in 2008. 
Consolidated shareholder's equity at November 27, 2010, was approximately $3.8 billion, which is net of all share repurchase, including the approximately $211 million representing approximately 5 million shares repurchased during the fiscal third quarter of 2010.
As a reminder, our next conference call to review operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ending on February 26, 2011, will be on Wednesday, April 6, 2011. If you have any questions, Ken Franklin and I will be in our offices this evening, December 22, to take your calls. As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond and we wish you a happy holiday season and a healthy new year."

While the economic environment appears to have stabilized and is perhaps improving, it looks as if the consumer continues to face challenges resulting from the macroeconomic environment, such as historically high unemployment rates. However, we are cautiously optimistic about the remainder of fiscal 2010.
During the third quarter, we opened five Bed Bath & Beyond stores, seven buybuy BABY stores and five Christmas Tree Shop stores, as well as relocated, expanded and renovated several Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Consolidated store space at November 27, 2010, was approximately 34.7 million square feet, an increase of approximately 4% over last year's third quarter.
Since the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2010, we have opened two additional Bed Bath & Beyond stores and two buybuy BABY stores. Including these openings, we currently operate 1,131 stores, including 978 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada, as well as 66 Christmas Tree Shops, 42 buybuy BABY stores and 45 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values.

As we have previously said, we believe that throughout the United States and Canada, there is an opportunity to operate an excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores as well as grow our Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast-to-coast. 
Additionally, we will continue to open Harmon Face Values stores and selectively place health and beauty care offerings in all our concepts. We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all our merchandise offerings.
We continue to work to increase the productivity of our existing stores by evolving the merchandise offerings as well as by expanding, renovating, remodeling and/or relocating stores to enhance our customers' shopping experience. Our ability to leverage the breadth and depth of our merchandise offerings, grow our bridal, baby and gift registries and continue the development of our interactive platform has afforded us additional opportunities to attract new customers to Bed Bath & Beyond.
At this time, in conjunction with our ongoing review of our capital structure, I am pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program. We are currently planning that the new share repurchase program will commence in early fiscal 2011 at the completion of the existing program. 
Although the board's authorization does not set a time limitation for the share repurchase, for planning purposes, the company anticipates completing the program over the next two years or so after it begins. It is currently anticipated that this new $2 billion share repurchase program will be funded from current cash and from present and future cash flows. This new program reflects the board's continued confidence in our future. 
Since 2004 through the third quarter of fiscal 2010, our company has returned approximately $2.6 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases. The continued success of our company is due in large part to the tremendous efforts of our associates and to our unique decentralized culture. 
This culture, which takes advantage of the knowledge, the independence and the customer focus of our associates, has always been the foundation of our long-term performance and allows us to respond more quickly to market demands and to changing economic conditions on a market-by-market basis. We are confident that we have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near- and long-term goals. And now I'll turn the call over to Steven Temares. Steve?"

We are pleased that our third quarter results exceeded our internal planning assumptions. We believe the dedication and talent of our associates and their constant focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience while at the same time, creating a more productive and efficient company are the keys to producing the continued strong results we have experienced.
As Len said, while it appears that the economic environment has stabilized and is perhaps improving, persistent high unemployment and uncertainty in the economy could continue to pressure consumers and affect their spending. However, as Len also said, we remain cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the year. Although economic challenges persist, our fundamental business strategy has remained unchanged to offer a broad assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices with superior customer service.
As always, we will continue to work to enhance our customers' overall shopping experience, and we remain committed to being our customers' first choice for the merchandise categories we offer domestically, interactively and over the longer term, internationally. 
At the same time, we'll continue to systematically challenge the costs associated with running our company and strive to find opportunities to lower operating costs. We are confident that our company is well positioned to grow profitably, deliver superior shareholder value and to compete and increase our market share over time. As always, we remain focused on building a business that stands the test of time.
In taking this long-term approach to building our Bed Bath & Beyond, Christmas Tree Shops, buybuy BABY and Harmon Face Values concepts and through the ongoing efforts across merchandise and leverage our best practices across all of our concepts, we expect, over time, to do more for and with our customers.
Turning to our fiscal third quarter performance, as reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $0.74, an increase of approximately 28% when compared to the $0.58 per share that we earned in last year's third quarter. For the fiscal nine months, net earnings per diluted share were $1.95 compared with $1.44 last year, an increase of about 35%. Net sales for the fiscal third quarter were approximately $2.2 billion, approximately 11.1% higher than the corresponding 2009 period.
Third quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 7% compared with an increase of 7.3% last year. For the fiscal nine months, net sales were approximately $6.3 billion, about 12% higher than last year and comp store sales for the fiscal nine months increased by approximately 7.6% compared with an increase of 1.7% in last year's first nine months.
Gross profit for the first fiscal third quarter was approximately 40.9% of net sales compared to approximately 41.1% of net sales for the third quarter of 2009. This decrease in the gross profit margin resulted primarily from an increase in inventory acquisition cost and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, partially offset by a decrease in coupon redemptions as a percentage of net sales.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal third quarter were approximately 27% of net sales as compared to approximately 28.7% of net sales in last year's third quarter, a decrease of approximately 170 basis points. This decrease can primarily be attributed to lower payroll, occupancy and advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales. Payroll and occupancy expenses benefited from the approximate 7% increase in comp store sales. Advertising expense decreased due to a reduction in the distribution of advertising pieces although not at the rate achieved in our most recent quarters.
Reflecting the movement in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal third quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago by approximately 150 basis points. For the fiscal nine months, the operating profit margin increased by approximately 230 basis points. 
For the fiscal third quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 38.6%, which is consistent with the comparable quarter last year. Our provision for income taxes is expected to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated.
Our capital spending during the first nine months of 2010 was approximately $142 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects whose impact is viewed as important to our future. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success.
As Len said, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program. Our Board took this action based upon its continued confidence in our company's long-term growth potential, financial outlook and cash flow generation. It's currently anticipated that this new $2 billion share repurchase program will be funded from current cash and from present and expected future cash flows. That said, our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. 
In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise. 
We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produced Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers and by doing so, continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer. I'll now turn the call back to Gene. Gene?"
321778,113663864,91139,"Bed Bath & Beyond, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Dec 22, 2010",2010-12-22,"Earnings Calls","20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. As you heard from Len and Steve, our results exceeded our planning assumptions and we earned $0.74 per diluted share in our fiscal third quarter and $1.95 per diluted share for the first nine months of fiscal 2010.We remain encouraged by",1009,"Thanks, Steve. As you heard from Len and Steve, our results exceeded our planning assumptions and we earned $0.74 per diluted share in our fiscal third quarter and $1.95 per diluted share for the first nine months of fiscal 2010.
We remain encouraged by our positive fiscal third quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the remainder of fiscal 2010. The continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment makes it difficult to forecast future results. However, the following are our major planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2010.
One, including the 32 stores opened so far this year, we expect the total number of new store openings across all of our concepts to be in the low forties. Two, if you recall, last year's comp store sales improved in the fourth quarter by approximately 11.5%. Taking this tough fourth quarter comparison into consideration, for this year's fourth quarter, we are modeling a low single-digit percentage increase in comparable store sales. This would result in a mid-single-digit percent comp store sales increase for all of fiscal 2010. Three, based on our results to date and our comparable store sales assumptions, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and by a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage for all of fiscal 2010. 
Four, assuming these sales levels and modeling advertising events that are consistent with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 in addition to planning the continuation of the shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, we are modeling our operating profit as a percentage of sales to deleverage in the fourth quarter. For all of fiscal 2010, we expect leverage in our operating profit. 
Five, interest income is expected to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 versus the same period in fiscal 2009. Six, the fourth quarter and full year tax revisions are estimated in the high thirties percent range, with variability as taxable events occur. Seven, capital expenditures for fiscal 2010, principally for new stores, existing store refurbishment, information technology enhancements and other projects are now planned to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million, which of course, remains subject to the timing of projects.
Eight, depreciation for fiscal 2010 is estimated to be approximately $180 million. Nine, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2010 and continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources. Ten, as previously discussed, we expect to continue our share repurchase program. 
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are now modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $0.91 to $0.95 for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2010 and approximately $2.86 to $2.90 for all of fiscal 2010. This would represent an increase of approximately 25% over fiscal 2009, up from our previous model of approximately 20%.
Turning to fiscal 2011, while we are still in the process of preparing our budget for next year and while we still believe that the continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment makes it difficult to forecast future results, our preliminary planning assumptions include the following.
One, we anticipate opening approximately the same number of stores as the current year. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. Two, we expect to continue our program of relocating, remodeling, renovating and expanding a number of our stores in fiscal 2011. Three, our operations will continue to be entirely funded from internally generated sources. 
Four, as previously discussed, we anticipate completing the current share repurchase program in the early fiscal 2011 and begin our new $2 billion share repurchase program thereafter, which we are planning will take two years or so to complete after it begins. Five, in fiscal 2011, the Easter holidays falls three weeks later than in fiscal 2010. This may affect sales trends in the early part of the year. Six, we expect continuing variability in our quarterly tax rates. 
We expect to provide further information related to the fiscal first quarter and full year 2011 on our next quarterly conference call on April 6, 2011. Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal third quarter.
Our balance sheet remains strong and debt free. We ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.6 billion. This includes approximately $121.3 million of investments related to auction rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $2.9 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings.
During the third quarter, we had approximately $2.5 million of redemptions of auction rate securities at par. As we have said in the past and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities.
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good shape or good condition. As of November 27, 2010, inventories were approximately $2.2 billion or $62.59 per square foot, an increase of approximately 6.8% on a per square foot basis versus last year and 2.9% higher than in 2008. 
Consolidated shareholder's equity at November 27, 2010, was approximately $3.8 billion, which is net of all share repurchases, including the approximately $211 million representing approximately 5 million shares repurchased during the fiscal third quarter of 2010.
As a reminder, our next conference call to review operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ending on February 26, 2011, will be on Wednesday, April 6, 2011. If you have any questions, Ken Frankel and I will be in our offices this evening, December 22, to take your calls. As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond, and we wish you a happy holiday season and a healthy new year."

I am pleased to report that our company's net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 28% in the fiscal third quarter to $0.74. While the economic environment appears to have stabilized and is perhaps improving, it looks as if the consumer continues to face challenges resulting from the macroeconomic environment, such as historically high unemployment rates. However, we are cautiously optimistic about the remainder of fiscal 2010.
During the third quarter, we opened five Bed Bath & Beyond stores, seven buybuy BABY stores and five Christmas Tree Shop stores, as well as relocated, expanded and renovated several Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Consolidated store space at November 27, 2010, was approximately 34.7 million square feet, an increase of approximately 4% over last year's third quarter.
Since the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2010, we have opened two additional Bed Bath & Beyond stores and two buybuy BABY stores. Including these openings, we currently operate 1,131 stores, including 978 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada, as well as 66 Christmas Tree Shops, 42 buybuy BABY stores and 45 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. In addition, we are a partner in the joint venture, which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More.
During fiscal 2010, including the 32 stores we have opened to date, we anticipate that the total number of new store openings will be in the low forties across all of our concepts. As the year has progressed, this revised number primarily reflects greater visibility into the number of stores that will now open in fiscal 2011 versus the fourth quarter of 2010. 
As we have said in the past, a shift in store openings from late in the fiscal year into the next fiscal year has little impact on our current year earnings and long-term profitability. We continue to acquire our stringent standards to growth as we evaluate new store sites as well as continue to review our existing locations and lease terms for opportunities to relocate and/or rightsize our stores in response to changing market conditions.
As we have previously said, we believe that throughout the United States and Canada, there is an opportunity to operate an excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores as well as grow our Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast-to-coast.

Turning to our fiscal third quarter performance, as reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $0.74, an increase of approximately 28% when compared to the $0.58 per share that we earned in last year's third quarter. For the fiscal nine months, net earnings per diluted share were $1.95 compared with $1.44 last year, an increase of about 35%. Net sales for the fiscal third quarter were approximately $2.2 billion, approximately 11.1% higher than the corresponding 2009 period.
Third quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 7% compared with an increase of 7.3% last year. For the fiscal nine months, net sales were approximately $6.3 billion, about 12% higher than last year and comp store sales for the fiscal nine months increased by approximately 7.6% compared with an increase of 1.7% in last year's first nine months.
Gross profit for the first fiscal third quarter was approximately 40.9% of net sales compared to approximately 41.1% of net sales for the third quarter of 2009. This decrease in the gross profit margin resulted primarily from an increase in inventory acquisition cost and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, partially offset by a decrease in coupon redemptions as a percentage of net sales.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal third quarter were approximately 27% of net sales as compared to approximately 28.7% of net sales in last year's third quarter, a decrease of approximately 170 basis points. This decrease can primarily be attributed to lower payroll, occupancy and advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales. Payroll and occupancy expenses benefited from the approximate 7% increase in comp store sales. Advertising expense decreased due to a reduction in the distribution of advertising pieces although not at the rate achieved in our most recent quarters.
Reflecting the movement in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal third quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago by approximately 150 basis points. For the fiscal nine months, the operating profit margin increased by approximately 230 basis points. 
For the fiscal third quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 38.6%, which is consistent with the comparable quarter last year. Our provision for income taxes is expected to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated.
Our capital spending during the first nine months of 2010 was approximately $142 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects whose impact is viewed as important to our future. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success.
As Len said, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program. Our Board took this action based upon its continued confidence in our company's long-term growth potential, financial outlook and cash flow generation. It's currently anticipated that this new $2 billion share repurchase program will be funded from current cash and from present and expected future cash flows.

We remain encouraged by our positive fiscal third quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the remainder of fiscal 2010. The continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment makes it difficult to forecast future results. However, the following are our major planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2010.
One, including the 32 stores opened so far this year, we expect the total number of new store openings across all of our concepts to be in the low forties. Two, if you recall, last year's comp store sales improved in the fourth quarter by approximately 11.5%. Taking this tough fourth quarter comparison into consideration, for this year's fourth quarter, we are modeling a low single-digit percentage increase in comparable store sales. This would result in a mid-single-digit percent comp store sales increase for all of fiscal 2010. Three, based on our results to date and our comparable store sales assumptions, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and by a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage for all of fiscal 2010. 
Four, assuming these sales levels and modeling advertising events that are consistent with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 in addition to planning the continuation of the shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, we are modeling our operating profit as a percentage of sales to deleverage in the fourth quarter. For all of fiscal 2010, we expect leverage in our operating profit. 
Five, interest income is expected to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 versus the same period in fiscal 2009. Six, the fourth quarter and full year tax revisions are estimated in the high thirties percent range, with variability as taxable events occur. Seven, capital expenditures for fiscal 2010, principally for new stores, existing store refurbishment, information technology enhancements and other projects are now planned to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million, which of course, remains subject to the timing of projects.
Eight, depreciation for fiscal 2010 is estimated to be approximately $180 million. Nine, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2010 and continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources. Ten, as previously discussed, we expect to continue our share repurchase program. 
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are now modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $0.91 to $0.95 for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2010 and approximately $2.86 to $2.90 for all of fiscal 2010. This would represent an increase of approximately 25% over fiscal 2009, up from our previous model of approximately 20%.
Turning to fiscal 2011, while we are still in the process of preparing our budget for next year and while we still believe that the continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment makes it difficult to forecast future results, our preliminary planning assumptions include the following.
One, we anticipate opening approximately the same number of stores as the current year. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. Two, we expect to continue our program of relocating, remodeling, renovating and expanding a number of our stores in fiscal 2011. Three, our operations will continue to be entirely funded from internally generated sources. 
Four, as previously discussed, we anticipate completing the current share repurchase program in the early fiscal 2011 and begin our new $2 billion share repurchase program thereafter, which we are planning will take two years or so to complete after it begins. Five, in fiscal 2011, the Easter holidays falls three weeks later than in fiscal 2010. This may affect sales trends in the early part of the year. Six, we expect continuing variability in our quarterly tax rates. 
We expect to provide further information related to the fiscal first quarter and full year 2011 on our next quarterly conference call on April 6, 2011. Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal third quarter.
Our balance sheet remains strong and debt free. We ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.6 billion. This includes approximately $121.3 million of investments related to auction rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $2.9 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings.
During the third quarter, we had approximately $2.5 million of redemptions of auction rate securities at par. As we have said in the past and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities.
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good shape or good condition. As of November 27, 2010, inventories were approximately $2.2 billion or $62.59 per square foot, an increase of approximately 6.8% on a per square foot basis versus last year and 2.9% higher than in 2008. 
Consolidated shareholder's equity at November 27, 2010, was approximately $3.8 billion, which is net of all share repurchases, including the approximately $211 million representing approximately 5 million shares repurchased during the fiscal third quarter of 2010.
As a reminder, our next conference call to review operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ending on February 26, 2011, will be on Wednesday, April 6, 2011. If you have any questions, Ken Frankel and I will be in our offices this evening, December 22, to take your calls. As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond, and we wish you a happy holiday season and a healthy new year."

I am pleased to report that our company's net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 28% in the fiscal third quarter to $0.74.

I am pleased to report that our company's net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 28% in the fiscal third quarter to $0.74. While the economic environment appears to have stabilized and is perhaps improving, it looks as if the consumer continues to face challenges resulting from the macroeconomic environment, such as historically high unemployment rates. However, we are cautiously optimistic about the remainder of fiscal 2010.
During the third quarter, we opened five Bed Bath & Beyond stores, seven buybuy BABY stores and five Christmas Tree Shop stores, as well as relocated, expanded and renovated several Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Consolidated store space at November 27, 2010 was approximately 34.7 million square feet, an increase of approximately 4% over last year's third quarter.
Since the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2010, we have opened two additional Bed Bath & Beyond stores and two buybuy BABY stores. Including these openings, we currently operate 1,131 stores, including 978 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada, as well as 66 Christmas Tree Shops, 42 buybuy BABY stores and 45 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. In addition, we are a partner in the joint venture, which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More.
During fiscal 2010, including the 32 stores we have opened to date, we anticipate that the total number of new store openings will be in the low forties across all of our concepts. As the year has progressed, this revised number primarily reflects greater visibility into the number of stores that will now open in fiscal 2011 versus the fourth quarter of 2010. 
As we have said in the past, a shift in store openings from late in the fiscal year into the next fiscal year has little impact on our current year earnings and long-term profitability. We continue to apply our stringent standards to growth as we evaluate new store sites as well as continue to review our existing locations and lease terms for opportunities to relocate and/or rightsize our stores in response to changing market conditions.
As we have previously said, we believe that throughout the United States and Canada, there is an opportunity to operate in excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores as well as grow our Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast-to-coast. 
Additionally, we will continue to open Harmon Face Values stores and selectively place health and beauty care offerings in all our concepts. We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all our merchandise offerings.
We continue to work to increase the productivity of our existing stores by evolving the merchandise offerings as well as by expanding, renovating, remodeling and/or relocating stores to enhance our customers' shopping experience. Our ability to leverage the breadth and depth of our merchandise offerings, grow our bridal, baby and gift registries and continue the development of our interactive platform has afforded us additional opportunities to attract new customers to Bed Bath & Beyond.
At this time, in conjunction with our ongoing review of our capital structure, I am pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program. We are currently planning that the new share repurchase program will commence in early fiscal 2011 after completion of the existing program. 
Although the board's authorization does not set a time limitation for the share repurchase, for planning purposes, the company anticipates completing the program over the next two years or so after it begins. It is currently anticipated that this new $2 billion share repurchase program will be funded from current cash and from present and future cash flows. This new program reflects the board's continued confidence in our future. 
Since 2004 through the third quarter of fiscal 2010, our company has returned approximately $2.6 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases. The continued success of our company is due in large part to the tremendous efforts of our associates and to our unique decentralized culture. 
This culture, which takes advantage of the knowledge, the independence and the customer focus of our associates, has always been the foundation of our long-term performance and allows us to respond more quickly to market demands and to changing economic conditions on a market-by-market basis. We are confident that we have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near- and long-term goals. And now I'll turn the call over to Steven Temares. Steve?"

We are pleased that our third quarter results exceeded our internal planning assumptions. We believe the dedication and talent of our associates and their constant focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience while at the same time, creating a more productive and efficient company are the keys to producing the continued strong results we have experienced.
As Len said, while it appears that the economic environment has stabilized and is perhaps improving, persistent high unemployment and uncertainty in the economy could continue to pressure consumers and affect their spending. However, as Len also said, we remain cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the year. Although economic challenges persist, our fundamental business strategy has remained unchanged to offer a broad assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices with superior customer service.
As always, we will continue to work to enhance our customers' overall shopping experience, and we remain committed to being our customers' first choice for the merchandise categories we offer domestically, interactively and over the longer term, internationally. 
At the same time, we'll continue to systematically challenge the costs associated with running our company and strive to find opportunities to lower operating costs. We are confident that our company is well positioned to grow profitably, deliver superior shareholder value and to compete and increase our market share over time. As always, we remain focused on building a business that stands the test of time.
In taking this long-term approach to building our Bed Bath & Beyond, Christmas Tree Shops, buybuy BABY and Harmon Face Values concepts and through the ongoing efforts across merchandise and leverage our best practices across all of our concepts, we expect, over time, to do more for and with our customers.
Turning to our fiscal third quarter performance, as reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $0.74, an increase of approximately 28% when compared to the $0.58 per share that we earned in last year's third quarter. For the fiscal nine months, net earnings per diluted share were $1.95 compared with $1.44 last year, an increase of about 35%. Net sales for the fiscal third quarter were approximately $2.2 billion, approximately 11.1% higher than the corresponding 2009 period.
Third quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 7% compared with an increase of 7.3% last year. For the fiscal nine months, net sales were approximately $6.3 billion, about 12% higher than last year and comp store sales for the fiscal nine months increased by approximately 7.6% compared with an increase of 1.7% in last year's first nine months.
Gross profit for the first fiscal third quarter was approximately 40.9% of net sales compared to approximately 41.1% of net sales for the third quarter of 2009. This decrease in the gross profit margin resulted primarily from an increase in inventory acquisition costs, as shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, partially offset by a decrease in coupon redemptions as a percentage of net sales.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal third quarter were approximately 27% of net sales as compared to approximately 28.7% of net sales in last year's third quarter, a decrease of approximately 170 basis points. This decrease can primarily be attributed to lower payroll, occupancy and advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales. Payroll and occupancy expenses benefited from the approximate 7% increase in comp store sales. Advertising expense decreased due to a reduction in the distribution of advertising pieces, although not at the rate achieved in our most recent quarters.
Reflecting the movement in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal third quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago by approximately 150 basis points. For the fiscal nine months, the operating profit margin increased by approximately 230 basis points. 
For the fiscal third quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 38.6%, which is consistent with the comparable quarter last year. Our provision for income taxes is expected to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated.
Our capital spending during the first nine months of 2010 was approximately $142 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects whose impact is viewed as important to our future. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success.
As Len said, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program. Our Board took this action based upon its continued confidence in our company's long-term growth potential, financial outlook and cash flow generation. It's currently anticipated that this new $2 billion share repurchase program will be funded from current cash and from present and expected future cash flows. That said, our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. 
In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise. 
We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produced Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers and by doing so, continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer.
I'll now turn the call back to Gene. Gene?"

As you heard from Len and Steve, our results exceeded our planning assumptions and we earned $0.74 per diluted share in our fiscal third quarter and $1.95 per diluted share for the first nine months of fiscal 2010.We remain encouraged by",1009,"Thanks, Steve. As you heard from Len and Steve, our results exceeded our planning assumptions and we earned $0.74 per diluted share in our fiscal third quarter and $1.95 per diluted share for the first nine months of fiscal 2010.
We remain encouraged by our positive fiscal third quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the remainder of fiscal 2010. The continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment makes it difficult to forecast future results. However, the following are our major planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2010.
One, including the 32 stores opened so far this year, we expect the total number of new store openings across all of our concepts to be in the low forties. Two, if you recall, last year's comp store sales improved in the fourth quarter by approximately 11.5%. Taking this tough fourth quarter comparison into consideration, for this year's fourth quarter, we are modeling a low single-digit percentage increase in comparable store sales. This would result in a mid-single-digit percent comp store sales increase for all of fiscal 2010. Three, based on our results to date and our comparable store sales assumptions, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and by a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage for all of fiscal 2010. Four, assuming these sales levels and modeling advertising events that are consistent with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 in addition to planning the continuation of the shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, we are modeling our operating profit as a percentage of sales to deleverage in our fourth quarter. For all of fiscal 2010, we expect leverage in our operating profit. Five, interest income is expected to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 versus the same period in fiscal 2009. Six, the fourth quarter and full year tax revisions are estimated in the high thirties percent range, with variability as taxable events occur. Seven, capital expenditures for fiscal 2010, principally for new stores, existing store refurbishment, information technology enhancements and other projects are now planned to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million which of course remain subject to the timing of projects. Eight, depreciation for fiscal 2010 is estimated to be approximately $180 million. Nine, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2010 and continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources. Ten, as previously discussed, we expect to continue our share repurchase program. 
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are now modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $0.91 to $0.95 for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2010 and approximately $2.86 to $2.90 for all of fiscal 2010. This would represent an increase of approximately 25% over fiscal 2009, up from our previous model of approximately 20%.
Turning to fiscal 2011, while we are still in the process of preparing our budget for next year and while we still believe that the continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment makes it difficult to forecast future results, our preliminary planning assumptions include the following.
One, we anticipate opening approximately the same number of stores as the current year. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. Two, we expect to continue our program of relocating, remodeling, renovating and expanding a number of our stores in fiscal 2011. Three, our operations will continue to be entirely funded from internally generated sources. Four, as previously discussed, we anticipate completing the current share repurchase program in the early fiscal 2011 and begin our new $2 billion share repurchase program thereafter, which we are planning will take two years or so to complete after it begins. Five, in fiscal 2011, the Easter holiday falls three weeks later than in fiscal 2010. This may affect sales trends in the early part of the year. Six, we expect continuing variability in our quarterly tax rates. 
We expect to provide further information related to the fiscal first quarter and full year 2011 on our next quarterly conference call on April 6, 2011. Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal third quarter.
Our balance sheet remains strong and debt free. We ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.6 billion. This includes approximately $121.3 million of investments related to auction rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $2.9 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings.
During the third quarter, we had approximately $2.5 million of redemptions of auction rate securities at par. As we have said in the past and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities.
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good shape or good condition. As of November 27, 2010, inventories were approximately $2.2 billion or $62.59 per square foot, an increase of approximately 6.8% on a per square foot basis versus last year and 2.9% higher than in 2008. 
Consolidated shareholder's equity at November 27, 2010, was approximately $3.8 billion, which is net of all share repurchases, including the approximately $211 million representing approximately 5 million shares repurchased during the fiscal third quarter of 2010.
As a reminder, our next conference call to review operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ending on February 26, 2011, will be on Wednesday, April 6, 2011. If you have any questions, Ken Frankel and I will be in our offices this evening, December 22, to take your calls. As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond, and we wish you a happy holiday season and a healthy new year."

As always, we remain focused on building a business that stands the test of time.
In taking this long-term approach to building our Bed Bath & Beyond, Christmas Tree Shops, buybuy BABY and Harmon Face Values concepts and through the ongoing efforts across merchandise and leverage our best practices across all of our concepts, we expect, over time, to do more for and with our customers.
Turning to our fiscal third quarter performance, as reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $0.74, an increase of approximately 28% when compared to the $0.58 per share that we earned in last year's third quarter. For the fiscal nine months, net earnings per diluted share were $1.95 compared with $1.44 last year, an increase of about 35%. Net sales for the fiscal third quarter were approximately $2.2 billion, approximately 11.1% higher than the corresponding 2009 period.
Third quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 7% compared with an increase of 7.3% last year. For the fiscal nine months, net sales were approximately $6.3 billion, about 12% higher than last year and comp store sales for the fiscal nine months increased by approximately 7.6% compared with an increase of 1.7% in last year's first nine months.
Gross profit for the first fiscal third quarter was approximately 40.9% of net sales compared to approximately 41.1% of net sales for the third quarter of 2009. This decrease in the gross profit margin resulted primarily from an increase in inventory acquisition costs, as shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, partially offset by a decrease in coupon redemptions as a percentage of net sales.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal third quarter were approximately 27% of net sales as compared to approximately 28.7% of net sales in last year's third quarter, a decrease of approximately 170 basis points. This decrease can primarily be attributed to lower payroll, occupancy and advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales. Payroll and occupancy expenses benefited from the approximate 7% increase in comp store sales. Advertising expense decreased due to a reduction in the distribution of advertising pieces, although not at the rate achieved in our most recent quarters.
Reflecting the movement in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal third quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago by approximately 150 basis points. For the fiscal nine months, the operating profit margin increased by approximately 230 basis points. 
For the fiscal third quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 38.6%, which is consistent with the comparable quarter last year. Our provision for income taxes is expected to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated.
Our capital spending during the first nine months of 2010 was approximately $142 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects whose impact is viewed as important to our future. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success.
As Len said, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program. Our Board took this action based upon its continued confidence in our company's long-term growth potential, financial outlook and cash flow generation. It's currently anticipated that this new $2 billion share repurchase program will be funded from current cash and from present and expected future cash flows. That said, our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. 
In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise. 
We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produced Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers and by doing so, continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer.
I'll now turn the call back to Gene. Gene?"

As you heard from Len and Steve, our results exceeded our planning assumptions and we earned $0.74 per diluted share in our fiscal third quarter and $1.95 per diluted share for the first nine months of fiscal 2010.
We remain encouraged by our positive fiscal third quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the remainder of fiscal 2010. The continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment makes it difficult to forecast future results. However, the following are our major planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2010.
One, including the 32 stores opened so far this year, we expect the total number of new store openings across all of our concepts to be in the low forties. Two, if you recall, last year's comp store sales improved in the fourth quarter by approximately 11.5%. Taking this tough fourth quarter comparison into consideration, for this year's fourth quarter, we are modeling a low single-digit percentage increase in comparable store sales. This would result in a mid-single-digit percent comp store sales increase for all of fiscal 2010. Three, based on our results to date and our comparable store sales assumptions, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and by a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage for all of fiscal 2010. Four, assuming these sales levels and modeling advertising events that are consistent with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 in addition to planning the continuation of the shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, we are modeling our operating profit as a percentage of sales to deleverage in our fourth quarter. For all of fiscal 2010, we expect leverage in our operating profit. Five, interest income is expected to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 versus the same period in fiscal 2009. Six, the fourth quarter and full year tax revisions are estimated in the high thirties percent range, with variability as taxable events occur. Seven, capital expenditures for fiscal 2010, principally for new stores, existing store refurbishment, information technology enhancements and other projects are now planned to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million which of course remain subject to the timing of projects. Eight, depreciation for fiscal 2010 is estimated to be approximately $180 million. Nine, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2010 and continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources. Ten, as previously discussed, we expect to continue our share repurchase program. 
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are now modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $0.91 to $0.95 for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2010 and approximately $2.86 to $2.90 for all of fiscal 2010. This would represent an increase of approximately 25% over fiscal 2009, up from our previous model of approximately 20%.
Turning to fiscal 2011, while we are still in the process of preparing our budget for next year and while we still believe that the continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment makes it difficult to forecast future results, our preliminary planning assumptions include the following.
One, we anticipate opening approximately the same number of stores as the current year. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. Two, we expect to continue our program of relocating, remodeling, renovating and expanding a number of our stores in fiscal 2011. Three, our operations will continue to be entirely funded from internally generated sources. Four, as previously discussed, we anticipate completing the current share repurchase program in the early fiscal 2011 and begin our new $2 billion share repurchase program thereafter, which we are planning will take two years or so to complete after it begins. Five, in fiscal 2011, the Easter holiday falls three weeks later than in fiscal 2010. This may affect sales trends in the early part of the year. Six, we expect continuing variability in our quarterly tax rates. 
We expect to provide further information related to the fiscal first quarter and full year 2011 on our next quarterly conference call on April 6, 2011. Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal third quarter.
Our balance sheet remains strong and debt free. We ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.6 billion. This includes approximately $121.3 million of investments related to auction rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $2.9 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings.
During the third quarter, we had approximately $2.5 million of redemptions of auction rate securities at par. As we have said in the past and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities.
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good shape or good condition. As of November 27, 2010, inventories were approximately $2.2 billion or $62.59 per square foot, an increase of approximately 6.8% on a per square foot basis versus last year and 2.9% higher than in 2008. 
Consolidated shareholder's equity at November 27, 2010, was approximately $3.8 billion, which is net of all share repurchases, including the approximately $211 million representing approximately 5 million shares repurchased during the fiscal third quarter of 2010.
As a reminder, our next conference call to review operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ending on February 26, 2011, will be on Wednesday, April 6, 2011. If you have any questions, Ken Frankel and I will be in our offices this evening, December 22, to take your calls. As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond, and we wish you a happy holiday season and a healthy new year."

I am pleased to report that our Company's net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 28% in the fiscal third quarter to $0.74. While the economic environment appears to have stabilized and is perhaps improving, it looks as if the consumer continues to face challenges resulting from the macroeconomic environment, such as historically high unemployment rates. However, we are cautiously optimistic about the remainder of fiscal 2010.
During the third quarter, we opened 5 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 7 buybuy BABY stores and 5 Christmas Tree Shop stores as well as relocated, expanded and renovated several Bed Bath & Beyond stores.
Consolidated store space at November 27, 2010, was approximately 34.7 million square feet, an increase of approximately 4% over last year's third quarter.
Since the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2010, we have opened 2 additional Bed Bath & Beyond stores and 2 buybuy BABY stores. Including these openings, we currently operate 1,131 stores including 978 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada, as well as 66 Christmas Tree Shops, 42 buybuy BABY stores and 45 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values.
In addition, we are a partner in the joint venture, which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More.
During fiscal 2010, including the 32 stores we have opened to-date we anticipate that the total number of new store openings will be in the low 40s across all of our concepts. As the year has progressed, this revised number primarily reflects greater visibility into the number of stores that we'll now open in fiscal 2011 versus the fourth quarter of 2010.
As we have said in the past, our shift in store openings from late in the fiscal year into the next fiscal year has little impact on our current year earnings and long-term profitability.
We continue to apply our stringent standards to growth as we evaluate new store sites as well as continue to review our existing locations and lease terms for opportunities to relocate and/or right size our stores in response to changing market conditions.
As we have previously said, we believe that throughout the United States and Canada, there is an opportunity to operate in excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, as well as grow our Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast to coast.
Additionally, we will continue to open Harmon Face Value stores and selectively place health and beauty care offerings in all our concepts. We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all our merchandise offerings.
We continue to work to increase the productivity of our existing stores by evolving the merchandise offerings as well as by expanding, renovating, remodeling and/or relocating stores to enhance our customer shopping experience.
Our ability to leverage the breadth and depth of our merchandise offerings, grow our bridal, baby and gift registries, and continue the development of our interactive platforms has afforded us additional opportunities to attract new customers to Bed Bath & Beyond.
At this time, in conjunction with our ongoing review of our capital structure, I am pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program. We are currently planning that the new share repurchase program will commence in early fiscal 2011 after completion of the existing program. Although the Board’s authorization has not set a time limitation for the share repurchase, for planning purposes the Company anticipates completing the program over the next two years or so after it begins.
It is currently anticipated that this new $2 billion share repurchase program will be funded from current cash and from present and future cash flows. This new program reflects the Board's continued confidence in our future.
Since 2004, through the third quarter of fiscal 2010, our Company has returned approximately $2.6 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases.
The continued success of our Company is due in large part to the tremendous efforts of our associates and to our unique decentralized culture. This culture, takes advantage of the knowledge, the independence, and the customer focus of our associates has always been the foundation of our long-term performance and allows us to respond more quickly to market demands as a changing economic conditions on a market-by-market basis.
We are confident that we have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near term and long-term goals.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Steven Temares. Steve?

We believe the dedication and talents of our associates and their constant focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience, while at the same time creating a more productive and efficient company, are the keys to producing the continued strong results we have experienced.
As Len said, while it appears that the economic environment has stabilized and is perhaps improving, persistent high unemployment and uncertainty in the economy could continue to pressure consumers and affect their spending. However, as Len also said, we remain cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the year.
Although economic challenges persist, our fundamental business strategy has remained unchanged to offer a broad assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices with superior customer service. As always, we will continue to work to enhance our customer's overall shopping experience and we remain committed to being our customers' first choice for the merchandise categories we offer, domestically, interactively and over the longer term internationally.
At the same time, we'll continue to systematically challenge the cost associated with running our Company and strive to find opportunities to lower operating costs.

Turning to our fiscal third quarter performance; as reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $0.74, an increase of approximately 28% when compared to the $0.58 per share that we earned in last year's third quarter. For the fiscal nine months net earnings per diluted share were $1.95 compared with $1.44 last year an increase about 35%. Net sales for the fiscal third quarter were approximately $2.2 billion, approximately 11.1% higher than in the corresponding 2009 period.
Third quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 7% compared with an increase of 7.3% last year. For the fiscal nine months, net sales were approximately $6.3 billion, about 12% higher than last year and comp store sales for the fiscal nine months increased by approximately 7.6% compared with an increase of 1.7% in last year's first nine months.
Gross profit for the first fiscal third quarter was approximately 40.9% of net sales compared to approximately 41.1% of net sales for the third quarter of 2009. This decrease in the gross profit margin resulted primarily from an increase in inventory acquisition cost and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories. Partially offset by a decrease in coupon redemptions as a percentage of net sales.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal third quarter were approximately 27% of net sales as compared to approximately 28.7% of net sales in last year's third quarter, a decrease of approximately 170 basis points.
This decrease can primarily be attributed to lower payroll, occupancy and advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales.

This includes approximately $121.3 million of investments related to auction rate securities.
