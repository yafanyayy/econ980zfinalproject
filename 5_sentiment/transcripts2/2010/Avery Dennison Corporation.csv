Our discussion today will reference the earnings release that we issued earlier, along with the slide presentation titled Fourth Quarter 2009 Financial Review and Analysis. Both documents were furnished today with our 8-K, and posted at the Investors section of our website at www.investors.averydennison.com.  We remind you that these results are preliminary, as we have not yet filed our 10-Q. Our news release references GAAP operating margin, which includes interest expense, restructuring and other charges included in the other expense line of our P&L. Also referenced are transition costs associated with acquisition integrations. Restructuring charges and integration transition costs tend to be fairly discreet in amount, frequency and timing. In light of the nature of these items, we'll focus on margin commentary on pretax results before their effect and before interest expense. This detail is in schedules A-2 to A-5 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release. We also remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to uncertainty. The Safe Harbor statement included in the documents that we've provided today, along with our 2008 Form 10-K address certain risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations. On the call today are Dean Scarborough, President and CEO; Dan O'Bryant, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Mitch Butier, Corporate Vice President, Global Finance.

While 2009 was really a tale of two halves, the first half of the year unprecedented 3 a steep drop in our revenues and very difficult earnings trajectory, followed by a much improved second half of the year. And I'd like to just thank all of our employees for an exceptional performance in probably one of the most difficult economic environments we faced in a number of years. We ended the year with record free cash flow, over $450 million. It enabled us to reduce debt by $300 million in the second half, while still continuing to invest in new markets and emerging growth opportunities. And we made great progress to our end of 2000 debt reduction target of at least $350 million. Now we had a major effort last year on reducing our fixed cost, and Dan will go through some of the details on our restructuring program, which is still undergoing and will likely conclude in the second quarter of this year. We made strong productivity gains. In fact, operational working capital as a percentage of sales was at its best level in over four years. Our second-half inventory turns were at their highest level in three years, and we saw solid margin improvement in the second half over the first half, with the fourth quarter gross margins 2.3 points higher than the fourth quarter of last year. And it's really all about our ability to raise and maintain prices to reduce costs, including both raw material and our fixed cost of operations. Now in the fourth quarter, our operating margins were a bit lower than we expected, really for two reasons. One was we lowered our inventories by a very aggressive amount, which caused us to take some fixed cost charges on the P&L. And then last year, we were reversing bonus accruals because we we're missing our targets for the year. And because of it, the great achievement on free cash flow, there was quite a difference in the year-over-year swing in bonus accruals.Now I'll talk a little bit about what's going in and the businesses. The pressure-sensitive sector, great discipline on price and productivity all year. Organic sales were up by 2% in the fourth quarter, so we've lapped the declines finally. And emerging markets really came back strong. And specifically, China was up more than 20% in the quarter. And they continued to go, really just gangbusters in the second half. In Retail Information Services, our fourth quarter sales decline was the lowest of the year. You'll recall that we really started to see a steep drop in the back half of 2008. We've seen retailers now begin to maintain their unprecedented low inventories. And so the inventory sales ratio, which improved all year, looks like it's reached the bottom. And I really don't think it'll be until the spring season until we see that opportunity for real large top-line improvement. As you recall, that business is quite seasonal, so we don't really start to see those results until very late in the first quarter and in the second quarter. And we continue to take fixed cost out of the business with our aggressive restructuring programs.Office product sales did decline. White-collar unemployment is still pretty high, and purchasing on the corporate side is still down. And we had a bit of a fall-off in the fourth quarter from a very strong back-to-school in the third. But even in this tough environment, we invested in some new marketing programs, in new products, which we launched in the fourth quarter. And we took a little bit of market share during the quarter as well, so we're feeling more confident about that business.So we're well positioned as markets recover. We have the leading share in our core businesses, very strong operating leverage, really solid variable margins, and we're managing that price inflation GAAP in raw material costs out and focused discipline employees. So let me tell you what we're thinking about 2010. I do expect a better year. I guess, it would be hard not to. And the major factor that will impact our results is still the strength and length of the recovering. And frankly, our mindset is anticipating a moderate recovery, as the impact of inventory destocking is over.  And we're going to be relying mainly on consumer demand. It's not clear to me that people will start to restock inventories very rapidly. But we'll continue to strengthen our financial position and also step up our investment in growth, especially in the areas of marketing, where we're adding capability to do end-use marketing to accelerate the rate of decoration transfer in raw materials and pressure-sensitive. We see a lot of new growth opportunities in RFID. More people are looking at item-level marketing today than ever before. And I really sense that retailers are interested in better control of inventories in the store as well as the ability to control labor class. And I mentioned before, we've invested in new products and accelerated our new product development process in our Office Products business. So now I'll turn it over to Dan."

I'm not going to walk through the slides page by page this quarter, and see if we can leave a little more room for Q&A. But I will hit a few of the highlights across the business and each of our business segments. So first off, sales in the fourth quarter, as you can see were down organically about 1%, which was a continued improvement from the rate of the first three quarters. And don't forget that the effect of having added a 53rd week in the year was to move the full holiday period into the fourth quarter, which reduced sales by an estimated 3%. Taking that into account, the U.S. and Europe are both improving, but still operating below prior year. Of these, the Asia really surged ahead. We had the best growth year in China in several years.The operating margin declined a bit, mostly due to higher MG&A expenses in the quarter, which I'll walk you through it in a moment. Gross profit margins remained well ahead of prior year, with a continuing positive impact of restructuring and productivity, as well as the positive impact of our year-on-year pricing in raw material results. But sequentially, we saw some margin decline, both fixed cost leverage contributed as well as segment mix. Margins were also impacted by the significant inventory reduction that we had in the fourth quarter. And in addition, Office Product sales in the fourth quarter were lower as a percentage of sales with our higher margins. That impacted us as well.The MG&A costs were higher in the quarter primarily due to two or three factors. One, the currency translation impact to the numbers by about $10 million. And after a period of relative austerity associated with the decline in economy, in the fourth quarter we increase investment in marketing and business development. And we incurred a higher employee cost, including bonus accruals which I'll comment a little bit further as we go.As we look at MG&A levels going forward, we project MG&A to be higher than it was in the third quarter but lower than in the fourth quarter because of a number of items that uniquely impacted the fourth. This level of spending also provides for some room for us to make additional marketing expenses as the year goes by, which Dean addressed.The bonus accruals changed from reversals last year, which benefited fourth quarter '08 results to accruals in the fourth quarter of '09. And the 4Q '09 accruals impacted both cost of goods sold and the MG&A to the tune of about $25 million on a combined basis. The primary driver of the year-on-year change was the extremely strong cash flow results that we had, which we're very proud of.  It's been a year where we started the year going into difficult economic circumstances, and moved much of the focus of the organization and our bonus pools toward the free cash flow objective and we achieved well beyond expectation there. We reduced debt by $300 million in the second half of the year. We managed to maintain good liquidity throughout the economic crisis. We protected our credit ratings and access to commercial paper, which benefited us throughout the year and kept our cost of debt down materially.And working capital contributed about $200 million. I'm talking about operating working capital. That part which is managed by our divisions contributed about $200 million of free cash flow. And 80% of that was productivity on the working capital lines, so we're very pleased with what we've been able to do on the free cash flow.Our current restructuring program will conclude on schedule at the end of the second quarter. And we've expanded the program a bit to an annual run rate savings of $180 million by mid-2010. We achieved 75% of that run rate by the end of 2009. So the total cost of the program will now be approximately $160 million, about 70% of which are cash costs. 2009 free cash flow included about $70 million of the cash costs with this program. And most of that, the balance will hit in 2010.So let me just give a little bit of color on our business units, starting with Pressure-sensitive Materials. Sales grew about 2% due to strength in the emerging markets. The rate of decline in most regions has improved, but is still in the negative territory. Asia was a big driver with China, as I said, is best-rated in several years, north of the 20% mark. And recovery in North America and Europe remains muted.Operating margin increased year-over-year due to the progress we've made on both productivity and pricing, along with raw material costs. And while we are maintaining most of the benefits of these factors, we're feeling some inflation now and we are adjusting prices. Sequential margins are down due to the employee cost that we've talked about and to the early signs of inflation hitting some of our raw materials. In Retail Information Services, sales were off about 2% in the fourth quarter. And while it's still negative, that's the lowest decline that we've seen all year. Revenue lift in this business is key to the margin improvement that we anticipate. The business continues to take out fixed costs to streamline its operations, and are launching new products and services as well. So we continue to target double-digit margins as retail markets begin to improve.In Office and Consumer Products, sales declined more significantly, reflecting continued weakened market demand, led by slower corporate purchasing activity consistent with the white-collar unemployment levels that we've seen. We've seen some sequential improvement in the point-of-sales trends in the commercial segment here, but it's still really weak. The fourth quarter commercial point of sale was down 9% versus being down in the low- to mid-teens in each of the first three quarters of 2009. So operating margin declined as we felt the impact of reduced fixed cost, leverage and employee costs.  Office Products did a great job on the cash flow front in the quarter, as did most of our businesses. We also increased marketing and product development spend and launched a few new products has Dean talked about in that part of the business.Now let me shift the focus to Slides 15, 16 and 17, which turns our discussion to 2010 outlook. On 15, we've already talked about the record free cash flow in 2009. The chart in the upper-right corner of that slide shows the decline over the last couple of years in capital spending. We expect capital spending in 2010 of between $125 million and $150 million, which would still be relatively low compared to depreciation and amortization. The lower chart shows the significant productivity we've delivered in operating working capital through 2010, and since the Paxar acquisition, where you see the number peaking in the second quarter of 2007. On Slides 16 and 17, as we did last year, we're listing what we currently believe to be some of the contributing factors to 2010's year-on-year changes in the P&L and in free cash flow. We're again giving 2010 EPS and free cash flow scenarios pegged [ph] off a relatively wide range of revenue assumptions. Where appropriate, we'll update the contributing factors in our 2010 quarterly reports. The key point that we're trying to make on these slides is that it's still difficult to predict revenue and as a result, difficult to predict earnings. But we still expect that free cash flow will be very strong once again in 2010. So that wraps up my brief overview of the slides. We hope you've had a chance to take a look at the rest of that material, and we'd be happy now to take you're questions."

But we had one quarter or two were flat growth, and then it rebounded pretty quickly to double-digit. So I don't really anticipate a whole lot. The Export business is still good going out of China and I anticipate think will be better certainly than last year. I don't know. You never know though. The government over there needs to employ people. So I think they'll probably lean more to a stimulus and be cautious about ramping back too quickly."

The greater part of that growth-related spending, there is some infrastructure spending.

The Roll Materials business also has had a capital project going on in their systems front and that will wrap up during the next 12 months or so. So most of what is in for structural is related to the level of IT spend going on in those projects. Some of it is pension.

I think our cost reduction, I mean the gross margin improvement year-over-year especially if you look at the first half to the second half has been phenomenal actually. Our gross margins in that business are as high as they've been in the last 3 to 4 years. We finally recovered all that raw material inflation that we've lagged. We've taken a lot of fixed cost out of the supply chain. And so I actually think it's in pretty good shape right now. So a little volume will go a long way in terms of driving good returns in that business."

Well, the results benefit from comparison with one of our toughest quarters. We saw meaningful increases in demand especially in raw materials, graphics and reflective products and retail information services.
Our volumes are not all the way back to pre-recession levels, but we are pleased none the less. We saw a solid top line growth across all regions and we had double digit growth in all emerging markets. Gross profit margin was more than a point better than the fourth quarter and more than four points better year-over-year. The operating leverage from restructuring and other productivity initiatives enabled gross margins more than 250 basis points above 2008 levels on 5% lower sales.
Operating margin before restructuring charges and other items improved 170 basis points from the fourth quarter in 2009. We did see raw material inflation accelerating. We did raise prices in the first quarter, but it wasn't enough to offset the inflation that we felt during the last two quarters.
We've announced price increases going forward in many of our businesses, and while we do expect that we will cover the raw material increases there likely will be some lag. Turning to the businesses, the pressure sensitive segment delivered very strong margin growth. Raw materials momentum in the fourth quarter continued especially in emerging markets.
Our end user marketing programs are creating a pipeline of new opportunities for decoration transfer which will enable above market growth as we continue to implement those programs. Graphics and reflective products benefited from restocking to accommodate a modest increase in promotional spending. This division is also launched two new products, a new cast film that has superior conformability and new reflective sheeting that makes signs more visible at night.
Retail information services experienced increased demand and benefited from comparison with one of their most difficult quarters, the first quarter of last year when retailers dramatically accelerated inventory to stocking. What we see is apparel sales beginning to increase and while it's too early to call a pipeline refill because retailers are still watching their inventories closely.
We are definitely seeing an uptick in buying since retailers are tacking to catch up with those sales increases. This year, we actually started strong and we are continuing to see solid demand right through the second quarter today. Office and consumer products were the exception to our margin story in the quarter.
End demand for our products is still declining, but at a slower rate. As both of you know we have new competition in the labels category, and will spend some money to defend our strong brand position as well as continuing to increase our spending on innovation in new areas.
I'm confident we will continue to be successful in our printable media business because we have excellent relationships with customers including an outstanding service record and recognized expertise in category management and the Avery brand has very strong consumer brand equity. In fact, it drives traffic to the stores and our customers understand us.
We will be increasing our investment in demand creation including 3D and radio advertising which you will see later this year, and you will see us begin to launch several new products late this year, and early in 2011. The Europe IT business continues to develop well with demand up more than 50% from one year ago. There continues to be strong interest in item level marking in retail but we also see trying another application as well.
Now Dan will go over the quarter in more detail.

I'm going to start with slide five if you have the handout that we provided. Sales in the first quarter were up organically about 7% contributing strongly to the improvement trend over the last third quarters. We experienced solid volume growth across all regions and almost every key business across the corporation.
Emerging markets in particular continue to surge ahead with Asia leading the way growing nearly 30% in our materials businesses in China. Emerging markets represented over 35% of our total sales for the quarter. Operating margin also improved due to the continuing positive impact of restructuring and productivity initiatives. Margins were up sequentially as well.
Volume, restructuring and productivity initiatives more than offset the net impact of raw material inflation and selling price changes. For the year, we expect inflation and pricing to be a headwin to margins, which I will discuss later in the outlook section. Sequentially MG&A was roughly flat although in dollars and as a percentage of sales it was up versus last year.
In the first quarter of last year, we were in the throws of the economic decline running MG&A in severe austerity mode well below was healthy for the business. In the first quarter of 2010, variable costs associated with higher volumes along with the increase growth-related and infrastructure investments were partially offset by restructuring and productivity initiatives.
Currency translation represented a $10 million increase versus prior year, and for reasons that Dean mentioned namely increased volume in the benefits of restructuring and productivity, gross margin for the company is up in the first quarter both year-over-year and sequentially.
And looking ahead will and we will reiterate this in our outlook section. We both expect both gross margin and operating margins to come under pressure from raw material inflation in the coming months. As we discussed in January during our fourth quarter conference call, we began to see some inflation in the fourth quarter, and started raising prices in January.
The phase of inflation is accelerating and we are in the midst of another round of price increases in most geographies, so our margins in the near term may come under some pressure. We expect our prices to cover the inflation once they are fully implemented.
Our pressure sensitive material segment delivered double digit margins in the quarter with both volume and productivity actions contributing, emerging markets were strong again accelerating further off last quarter's positive numbers. Within the pressure sensitive segment, our graphics and reflective business delivered its highest revenue since the third quarter of 2008.
We are seeing some restocking here, and we will need a few more months behind us before we declare trend. The margins in this business have improved dramatically due to the volume and cost reductions we've driven over the last years. In retail information services, the big margins story is the 440 basis point improvement over the last year's first quarter.
This reflects over 45% in incremental operating margin year-over-year consistent with this segment high contribution margin. First quarter revenue comps in RIS benefited from increased demand due in part to significant inventory de stocking among apparel retailers that occurred in the first half of 2009. The inventory to sales ratio in apparel remains at long-term lows and even debt further in February as sales grew improved ahead of inventory restocking.
There is evidenced that while the consumer hasn't come back in completely. Retail sales of apparel are up, which is great news for the sector and the second quarter is the best indicator of retailer sentiment, and we are hopeful the current trends indicate some inventory rebuild going on now and in coming months.
The order pattern in Q1 was strong and as Dean said, this continued into April. Looking at office products, the decline in sales in the first quarter reflected weakened market demand and changes in customer programs. This was partially offset by lower inventory de-stocking in the first quarter of 2010, compared to that in the first quarter of last year.
Office products operating margin declined in the quarter due to increased spending related to customer programs as well as higher investment in consumer promotions in marketing. Dean has covered the competitive dynamics in the segment, so I could just say that our margins will remain under pressure here while we invest and defend.
In our other specially converting businesses, margin swung from negative to positive. It is there as evident of restocking, but it will take some time to see what the on growth going trajectory will look like. Now as you know the company's cash flow is seasonal, we generally use cash in the first half of the year, and generate all of our free cash flow in the second half.
This year, it should be no exception particularly with the growth and volume we are experiencing early in the year. On slide 14 to slide 15, we provide a list of factors that we believe will contribute to Avery Dimension's 2010 financial results. Based on the factors listed and other assumptions, we expect reported revenue growth of 5% to 7% and adjusted earnings per share of $250 to $280 per share.
We estimate free cash flow in 2010 to $300 million to $350 million. Comps obviously become more challenging as the year progresses, but we are pleased with the strong start to the year. Just as we did last quarter, we are listing what we currently believe to be some contributing factors to 2010s year-over-year changes at the P&L and free cash flow.
The key factors on slide 14 that are in our April guidance assumptions that are different are what we said at January are as follows. At current rates, currency translation represents less than a 1% benefit to reported sales growth and neutral impact to EBIT.
We now expect approximately 3% or $75 million in new inflation raw material cost partially offset with the benefit from our global sourcing strategies, material cost productivity and price increases. This is about double the inflation we expect at the coming end of the year, and we will incur additional expenses for the rest of the year focused on innovation and demand creation in our office product segment.
These factors plus the others listed on slide 14get us to our 2010 EPS guidance of $250 to $280 per share. While we are not giving quarterly guidance, there are a couple of comments I could make about Q2.
First in office products, back-to-school season is been shifting earlier in some years and later in others. We expect this year's back-to-school to occur later resulting in some sales shifting from the second quarter into the third. In the second quarter, inflation is outpacing our price increases as it has since the fourth quarter.
This will keep some pressure on Q2 margins. And as mentioned free cash flow should again be strong at 2010, we are expecting to generate between $300 million and $350 million of free cash flow. Our primary focus for the use of free cash is to reduce debt. As you know, we completed the $250 million bond issuance this month and we will use the proceeds to pay down our term loan.
If the economy cooperates, we would expect to be in a position later this year for the Board to consider an increase in the return of capital to the shareholders in the form of increased dividend, share repurchases or both. And before opening the call to questions, let me wrap up with one more comment.
We are pleased with the trajectory of our businesses, and though the economy is moving in a positive direction, we are not yet back to 2008 levels. Never the less were sales still down more than 5% from the first quarter of 2008. We exceeded that quarter's pretax profits by over 13%. With all the actions we've taken over the last year, we've generated a new level of operating leverage and its continued investment for growth at the same time.
And now we'd be happy to take your questions.

Have you seen some improvement in volume from what you might have been seeing earlier in the quarter, year-on-year, how are trends progressed? Thank you.

If you look at Europe as the average, actually the organic growth rate was similar to the U.S. But if you pull out Eastern Europe the number drops. I think from an RIS perspective, retailers in Europe are not seeing the increases in demand that U.S. retailers are. I still think they're a little bit lagging behind. The pressure sensitive business actually had a pretty good quarter in Europe in Q1. So I'm not sure what that says yet but my sense is we're still not at the same level of as robust a recovery as we see in North America.

So a lot of it is just again investments that we have for new products, for innovation and more attractive consumer programs as we defend the category.
So the good news I've heard lately that's more anecdotal is that the port of the business that hurt the most last years was the contracting commercial side of the business versus retail. They both were down but the contracting promotion was down a lot more. The comps looked a little more promising on the commercial side of the business these days. So I've got my fingers crossed but we'll see, hopefully a little recovery again than we anticipate.
The big impact will be the impact of back to school in the second and third quarter. I think we're well positioned to have a decent back to school this year.

The inventory to sales ratio for apparel dropped to its lowest level ever at least on our charts in a number of years in February. So at the same time I think March apparel sales would actually be down quite nicely. So I think we're starting to see some restocking. Frankly what we're seeing anecdotally is retailers giving us a forecast of that and then saying, when they actually order, saying, oh no, its X+15 or X+20 and so my sense is that in the U.S., for U.S. retailers and brand owners, there's a lot more confidence and so we're feeling pretty good about the trends. Lets say apparel is kind of one of those low cost luxuries and as consumers get a little more confident, buying that extra outfit isn't huge.
Back to school is all about binders and dividers for us and so the two are necessarily linked. I have got to tell you, every other year it's the same. So one year it's early, the next year it's late.

We'd like to see the dividend start moving back up in the direction where we had pre-recession and that will be discussion. But we intend to look at share repurchases as well. We have another round, a final round of our converts that come due late this year and so there is a couple of million shares that we'll issue. We would like to not see those additional shares outstanding for very long but debt comes first.

The first quarter was an encouraging start to the year. While the results benefit from comparison with one of our toughest quarters, we saw meaningful increases in demand, especially in Roll Materials, Graphics and Reflective Products and Retail Information Services. Now volumes are not all the way back to pre-recession levels, but we're pleased, nonetheless. We saw a solid topline growth across all regions, and we had double-digit growth in all emerging markets.
Gross profit margin was more than a point better than the fourth quarter and more than four points better year-over-year. The operating leverage from restructuring and other productivity initiatives enabled gross margins more than 250 basis points above 2008 levels on 5% lower sales. Operating margin before restructuring charges and other items improved 170 basis points from the fourth quarter in 2009. 
We do see raw material inflation accelerating. We did raise prices in the first quarter, but it wasn't enough to offset the inflation that we felt during the last two quarters. We've announced price increases going forward in many of our businesses. And while we do expect that we recover the raw material increases, there likely will be some lag.
Turning to the businesses, the Pressure-sensitive segment delivered very strong margin growth. Roll Materials momentum in the fourth quarter continued, especially in emerging markets. Our end-user marketing programs are creating a pipeline of new opportunities for decoration transfer, which will enable above-market growth, as we continue to implement those programs. 
Graphics and Reflective Products benefited from restocking to accommodate a modest increase in promotional spending. This division has also launched two new products, a new cast film that has superior conformability and new reflective sheeting that makes signs more visible at night.
Retail Information Services experienced increased demand and benefited from comparison with one of their most difficult quarters, the first quarter of last year, when retailers dramatically accelerated inventory destocking. What we see is a parallel sales beginning to increase. And while it's too early to call a pipeline refill, because retailers are still watching their inventories closely, we're definitely seeing an uptick in volumes as retailers are trying to catch up with those sales increases. This year, we actually started strong, and we are continuing to see solid demand right through the second quarter to date.
Office and Consumer Products was the exception to our margin story in the quarter. End demand for our products is still declining, but at a slower rate. As most of you know, we have new competition in the labels category, and we'll spend some money to defend our strong brand position, as well as continuing to increase our spending on innovation in new areas. 
I'm confident we will continue to be successful in our Printable Media business, because we have excellent relationships with customers, including an outstanding service record and recognized expertise in category management, and the Avery brand has very strong consumer brand equity. In fact, it drives traffic to the stores and our customers understand us. We'll be increasing our investment and demand creation, including TV and radio advertising, which you'll see later this year. And you'll also see us begin to launch several new products late this year and early in 2011.
The RFID [Radio Frequency Identification] business continues to develop well, with demand up more than 50% from one year ago. There continues to be strong interest in item-level marking in retail, but we also see strength in other applications as well. 
Now Dan will go over the quarter in more detail."

I'm going to start with Slide 5, if you have the handout that we've provided.

I'm going to start with Slide 5, if you have the handout that we've provided. Sales in the first quarter were up organically about 7%, contributing strongly to the improvement trend of the last three quarters. We experienced solid volume growth across all regions and in almost every key business across the corporation. 
Emerging markets, in particular, continued to surge ahead, with Asia leading the way, growing nearly 30% in our Materials businesses in China. Emerging markets represented over 35% of our total sales for the quarter. 
Operating margin also improved due to the continuing positive impact of restructuring and productivity initiatives. Margins were up sequentially as well. Volume, restructuring and productivity initiatives more than offset the net impact of raw material inflation and selling price changes. For the year, we expect inflation of pricing to be a headwind to margins, which I'll discuss later in the outlook section. 
Sequentially, MG&A [marketing, general and administrative] was roughly flat, although, in dollars and as a percentage of sales, it was up versus last year. In the first quarter of last year, we were in the throes of the economic decline, running MG&A in severe austerity mode, well below what's healthy for the business. 
In the first quarter of 2010, variable costs associated with higher volume, along with the increased growth-related and infrastructure investment, were partially offset by restructuring and productivity initiatives. Currency translation represented a $10 million increase versus prior year. 
And for reasons that Dean mentioned, mainly increased volume and the benefits of restructuring and productivity, gross margin for the company is up in the first quarter, both year-over-year and sequentially. In looking ahead, and we'll reiterate this in our outlook section, we expect both gross margin and operating margins to come under pressure from raw material inflation in the coming months. 
As we discussed in January, during our fourth quarter conference call, we began to see some inflation in the fourth quarter and started raising prices in January. The pace of inflation is accelerating, and we're in the midst of another round of price increases than most geographies. So while margins in the near term may come under some pressure, we expect our prices to cover the inflation once they're fully implemented.
Our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment delivered double-digit margins in the quarter, with both volume and productivity actions contributing. Emerging markets were strong again, accelerating further off last quarter's positive numbers. 
Within the Pressure-sensitive segment, our Graphics and Reflective business delivered its highest revenues since the third quarter of 2008. We're seeing some restocking here, and we'll need a few more months behind us before we declare a trend. The margins in this business have improved dramatically due to the volume and cost reductions we've driven over the last year. 
In Retail Information Services, the big margin story is the 440-basis point improvement over last year's first quarter. This reflects over 45% in incremental operating margin year-over-year, consistent with this segment's high-contribution margin. First quarter revenue comps in RIS benefited from increased demand, due in part to significant inventory destocking among apparel retailers that occurred in the first half of 2009. 
The inventory-to-sales ratio in apparel remains at long-term lows, and even dipped further in February as sell-through improved ahead of inventory restocking. There is evidence that while the consumer hasn't come back completely, retail sales of apparel are up, which is great news for this sector.
Now the second quarter is the best indicator of retailers' sentiment. And we're hopeful that current trends indicate some inventory rebuild going on now and in coming months. The order pattern in Q1 was strong and, as Dean said, has continued into April. 
Looking at Office Products, the decline in sales in the first quarter reflected weak end-market demand and changes in customer programs. This was partially offset by lower inventory destocking in the first quarter of 2010 compared to that in the first quarter of last year. 
Office Products operating margin declined in the quarter, due to increased spending related to customer programs, as well as higher investment in consumer promotions and marketing. Dean has covered the competitive dynamics in this segment. So suffice it to say that our margins will remain under pressure here, while we invest and defend. 
In other specialty converting businesses, margins swung from negative to positive. There's evidence of restocking, but it will take some time to see what the ongoing trajectory will look like.
And as you know, the company's cash flow is seasonal. We generally use cash in the first half of the year and generate all of our free cash flow in the second half. This year should be no exception, particularly with the growth and volume we're experiencing early in the year. 
On Slide 14 and 15, we provide a list of factors that we believe will contribute to Avery Dennison's 2010 financial results. Based on the factors listed and other assumptions, we expect reported revenue growth of 5% to 7% and adjusted earnings per share of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. We estimate free cash flow in 2010 of $300 million to $350 million. 
Comps, obviously, become more challenging as the year progresses, but we're pleased with the strong start to the year. Just as we did last quarter, we're listing what we currently believe to be some contributing factors to 2010's year-over-year changes in the P&L and free cash flow. 
The key factors on Slide 14 that are in our April guidance assumptions, and that are different from what we said in January, are as follows: At current rates, currency translation represents less than a 1% benefit to reported sales growth and neutral impact to EBIT. We now expect approximately 3%, or $75 million, of new inflation in raw material costs, partially offset with the benefit from our global sourcing strategies, material cost productivity and price increases. This is about double the inflation we expected coming into the year. And we will incur additional expenses for the rest of the year focused on innovation and demand creation in our Office Products segment. These factors, plus the others listed on Slide 14, get us to our 2010 EPS guidance of $2.50 to $2.80. 
While we're not giving quarterly guidance, there are a couple of comments I can make about Q2. First, on Office Products, back-to-school season has been shifting earlier in some years and later in others. We expect this year's back-to-school to occur later, resulting in some sales shifting from the second quarter into the third. 
In the second quarter, inflation is outpacing our price increases, as it has since the fourth quarter. This will keep some pressure on Q2 margins. And as mentioned, free cash flow should again be strong in 2010. We're expecting to generate between $300 million and $350 million of free cash flow. Our primary focus for the use of this free cash is to reduce debt. 
As you know, we completed a $250 million bond issuance this month, and we will use the proceeds to pay down our term loan. If the economy cooperates, we would expect to be in a position later this year for the board to consider an increase in the return of capital to shareholders, in the form of increased dividends, share repurchases or both.
And before opening the call to questions, let me wrap up with one more comment. We're pleased with the trajectory of our businesses. And although the economy is moving in a positive direction, we're not yet back to 2008 levels.

So at the same time, I think March apparel sales actually rebounded quite nicely. I think we're starting to see some restocking.

Back-to-school is all about binders and dividers for us. And so the two are necessarily linked. I got to tell you, every other year it's the same. One year, it's early; the next year, it's late.

We remind you that these results are preliminary, as we have not yet filed our 10-Q. 
Our news release references GAAP operating margin, which includes interest expense, restructuring and other charges and included in the other expense line of our P&L. Also referenced are transition costs associated with acquisition integrations. Restructuring charges and integration transition costs tend to be fairly discreet in amount, frequency and timing. In light of the nature of these items, we'll focus our margin commentary on pre-tax results before their effect and before interest expense. This detail is in schedules A-2 to A-5 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release.

These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to uncertainty.

The first quarter was an encouraging start to the year. While the results benefit from comparison with one of our toughest quarters, we saw meaningful increases in demand, especially in Roll Materials, Graphics and Reflective Products and Retail Information Services. Now volumes are not all the way back to pre-recession levels, but we're pleased, nonetheless. We saw a solid topline growth across all regions, and we had double-digit growth in all emerging markets.
Gross profit margin was more than a point better than the fourth quarter and more than four points better year-over-year. The operating leverage from restructuring and other productivity initiatives enabled gross margins more than 250 basis points above 2008 levels on 5% lower sales. Operating margin before restructuring charges and other items improved 170 basis points from the fourth quarter in 2009. 
We do see raw material inflation accelerating. We did raise prices in the first quarter, but it wasn't enough to offset the inflation that we felt during the last two quarters. We've announced price increases going forward in many of our businesses. And while we do expect that we recover the raw material increases, there likely will be some lag.
Turning to the businesses, the Pressure-sensitive segment delivered very strong margin growth. Roll Materials momentum in the fourth quarter continued, especially in emerging markets. Our end-user marketing programs are creating a pipeline of new opportunities for decoration transfer, which will enable above-market growth, as we continue to implement those programs. 
Graphics and Reflective Products benefited from restocking to accommodate a modest increase in promotional spending. This division has also launched two new products, a new cast film that has superior conformability and new reflective sheeting that makes signs more visible at night.
Retail Information Services experienced increased demand and benefited from comparison with one of their most difficult quarters, the first quarter of last year, when retailers dramatically accelerated inventory destocking. What we see is a parallel sales beginning to increase. And while it's too early to call a pipeline refill, because retailers are still watching their inventories closely, we're definitely seeing an uptick in volumes as retailers are attempting to catch up with those sales increases. This year, we actually started strong, and we are continuing to see solid demand right through the second quarter to date.
Office and Consumer Products was the exception to our margin story in the quarter. End demand for our products is still declining, but at a slower rate. As most of you know, we have new competition in the labels category, and we'll spend some money to defend our strong brand position, as well as continuing to increase our spending on innovation in new areas. 
I'm confident we will continue to be successful in our Printable Media business, because we have excellent relationships with customers, including an outstanding service record and recognized expertise in category management, and the Avery brand has very strong consumer brand equity. In fact, it drives traffic to the stores and our customers understand us. We'll be increasing our investment and demand creation, including TV and radio advertising, which you'll see later this year. And you'll also see us begin to launch several new products late this year and early in 2011.
The RFID [Radio Frequency Identification] business continues to develop well, with demand up more than 50% from one year ago. There continues to be strong interest in item-level marking in retail, but we also see strength in other applications as well. 
Now Dan will go over the quarter in more detail."

I'm going to start with Slide 5, if you have the handout that we've provided. Sales in the first quarter were up organically about 7%, contributing strongly to the improvement trend of the last three quarters. We experienced solid volume growth across all regions and in almost every key business across the corporation. 
Emerging markets, in particular, continued to surge ahead, with Asia leading the way, growing nearly 30% in our Materials businesses in China. Emerging markets represented over 35% of our total sales for the quarter. 
Operating margin also improved due to the continuing positive impact of restructuring and productivity initiatives. Margins were up sequentially as well. Volume, restructuring and productivity initiatives more than offset the net impact of raw material inflation and selling price changes. For the year, we expect inflation of pricing to be a headwind to margins, which I'll discuss later in the outlook section. 
Sequentially, MG&A [marketing, general and administrative] was roughly flat, although, in dollars and as a percentage of sales, it was up versus last year. In the first quarter of last year, we were in the throes of the economic decline, running MG&A in severe austerity mode, well below what's healthy for the business. 
In the first quarter of 2010, variable costs associated with higher volume, along with the increased growth-related and infrastructure investment, were partially offset by restructuring and productivity initiatives. Currency translation represented a $10 million increase versus prior year. 
And for reasons that Dean mentioned, namely increased volume and the benefits of restructuring and productivity, gross margin for the company is up in the first quarter, both year-over-year and sequentially. In looking ahead, and we'll reiterate this in our outlook section, we expect both gross margin and operating margins to come under pressure from raw material inflation in the coming months. 
As we discussed in January, during our fourth quarter conference call, we began to see some inflation in the fourth quarter and started raising prices in January. The pace of inflation is accelerating, and we're in the midst of another round of price increases in most geographies. So while margins in the near term may come under some pressure, we expect our prices to cover the inflation once they're fully implemented.
Our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment delivered double-digit margins in the quarter, with both volume and productivity actions contributing. Emerging markets were strong again, accelerating further off last quarter's positive numbers. 
Within the Pressure-sensitive segment, our Graphics and Reflective business delivered its highest revenue since the third quarter of 2008. We're seeing some restocking here, and we'll need a few more months behind us before we declare a trend. The margins in this business have improved dramatically due to the volume and cost reductions we've driven over the last year. 
In Retail Information Services, the big margin story is the 440-basis point improvement over last year's first quarter. This reflects over 45% in incremental operating margin year-over-year, consistent with this segment's high-contribution margin. First quarter revenue comps in RIS benefited from increased demand, due in part to significant inventory destocking among apparel retailers that occurred in the first half of 2009. 
The inventory-to-sales ratio in apparel remains at long-term lows, and even dipped further in February as sell-through improved ahead of inventory restocking. There is evidence that while the consumer hasn't come back completely, retail sales of apparel are up, which is great news for this sector.
Now the second quarter is the best indicator of retailer sentiment. And we're hopeful that current trends indicate some inventory rebuild going on now and in coming months. The order pattern in Q1 was strong and, as Dean said, has continued into April. 
Looking at Office Products, the decline in sales in the first quarter reflected weak end-market demand and changes in customer programs. This was partially offset by lower inventory destocking in the first quarter of 2010 compared to that in the first quarter of last year. 
Office Products operating margin declined in the quarter, due to increased spending related to customer programs, as well as higher investment in consumer promotions and marketing. Dean has covered the competitive dynamics in this segment. So suffice it to say that our margins will remain under pressure here, while we invest and defend. 
In other specialty converting businesses, margins swung from negative to positive. There's evidence of restocking, but it will take some time to see what the ongoing trajectory will look like.
And as you know, the company's cash flow is seasonal. We generally use cash in the first half of the year and generate all of our free cash flow in the second half. This year should be no exception, particularly with the growth in volume we're experiencing early in the year. 
On Slide 14 and 15, we provide a list of factors that we believe will contribute to Avery Dennison's 2010 financial results. Based on the factors listed and other assumptions, we expect reported revenue growth of 5% to 7% and adjusted earnings per share of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. We estimate free cash flow in 2010 of $300 million to $350 million. 
Comps, obviously, become more challenging as the year progresses, but we're pleased with the strong start to the year. Just as we did last quarter, we're listing what we currently believe to be some contributing factors to 2010's year-over-year changes in the P&L and free cash flow. 
The key factors on Slide 14 that are in our April guidance assumptions, and that are different from what we said in January, are as follows: At current rates, currency translation represents less than a 1% benefit to reported sales growth and neutral impact to EBIT. We now expect approximately 3%, or $75 million, of new inflation in raw material costs, partially offset with the benefit from our global sourcing strategies, material cost productivity and price increases. This is about double the inflation we expected coming into the year. And we will incur additional expenses for the rest of the year focused on innovation and demand creation in our Office Products segment. These factors, plus the others listed on Slide 14, get us to our 2010 EPS guidance of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. 
While we're not giving quarterly guidance, there are a couple of comments I can make about Q2. First, on Office Products, back-to-school season has been shifting earlier in some years and later in others. We expect this year's back-to-school to occur later, resulting in some sales shifting from the second quarter into the third. 
In the second quarter, inflation is outpacing our price increases, as it has since the fourth quarter. This will keep some pressure on Q2 margins. And as mentioned, free cash flow should again be strong in 2010. We're expecting to generate between $300 million and $350 million of free cash flow. Our primary focus for the use of this free cash is to reduce debt. 
As you know, we completed a $250 million bond issuance this month, and we will use the proceeds to pay down our term loan. If the economy cooperates, we would expect to be in a position later this year for the board to consider an increase in the return of capital to shareholders, in the form of increased dividends, share repurchases or both.
And before opening the call to questions, let me wrap up with one more comment. We're pleased with the trajectory of our businesses. And although the economy is moving in a positive direction, we're not yet back to 2008 levels. Nevertheless, with sales still down more than 5% from the first quarter of 2008, we exceeded that quarter's pre-tax profits by over 13%. With all the actions we've taken over the last year, we've generated a new level of operating leverage and have continued investing for growth at the same time. 
And now we'd be happy to take your questions."

So we saw the impact of a little bit less destocking than we saw in the prior year. POS trends are still negative. This business is probably going to be the last to recover in an economy because it's pretty much based on white-collar employment. So a lot of it is just, again, investment that we have for new products, for innovation and more attractive consumer programs as we defend the category. So the good news I've heard lately is more anecdotally is that the part of the business that got hurt the most last year was the contracting commercial side of the business versus retail. They both were down, but the contracting commercial was down a lot more. The comps look a little more promising on the commercial side of the business these days. So I've got my fingers crossed that we'll see maybe, hopefully, a little more recovery than we anticipate. The big impact though will be the impact of back-to-school in the second and third quarter. I think we're well positioned to have decent back-to-school this year."

The inventory-to-sales ratio for apparel dropped to its lowest level ever, at least in our charts in a number of years in February. So at the same time, I think March apparel sales actually rebounded quite nicely. I think we're starting to see some restocking. Frankly, what we're saying anecdotally is retailers giving us a forecast of X and then saying when they actually order, saying, ""Oh no, it's X plus 15 or X plus 20."" So my sense is that in the U.S. for U.S. retailers and brand owners, there's a lot more confidence. And so we're feeling pretty good about the trends. Let's say that the apparel is kind of one of those low-cost luxuries. And as consumers get a little more confident buying that extra outfit isn't huge. Back-to-school is all about binders and dividers for us. And so the two are necessarily linked. I got to tell you, every other year it's the same. One year, it's early; the next year, it's late. We actually know, though, from a couple of customers who want their back-to-school season to run a little later and longer that we just simply expect the orders to flow through a little more in the third quarter than the second quarter.

And with our investments in end-use marketing now, we really are building on an interesting and excellent pipeline of needs from a number of end-use sectors. That being said, from a relative basis, RIS has the most upside simply because of its current performance level and what we believe this business can do. So I also believe that RIS given it's -- it's got the cost out, we're still going to continue to do that. We have growth opportunities on both the branded solutions side, but as well as the information solutions side, especially if item-level -- if item-level RFID takes off, it brings a whole new trajectory to that business."

The first quarter was an encouraging start to the year. While the results benefit from comparison with one of our toughest quarters, we saw meaningful increases in demand, especially in Roll Materials, Graphics and Reflective Products and Retail Information Services. Now volumes are not all the way back to pre-recession levels, but we're pleased, nonetheless. We saw a solid topline growth across all regions, and we had double-digit growth in all emerging markets.
Gross profit margin was more than a point better than the fourth quarter and more than four points better year-over-year. The operating leverage from restructuring and other productivity initiatives enabled gross margins more than 250 basis points above 2008 levels on 5% lower sales. Operating margin before restructuring charges and other items improved 170 basis points from the fourth quarter in 2009. 
We do see raw material inflation accelerating. We did raise prices in the first quarter, but it wasn't enough to offset the inflation that we felt during the last two quarters. We've announced price increases going forward in many of our businesses. And while we do expect that we recover the raw material increases, there likely will be some lag.
Turning to the businesses, the Pressure-sensitive segment delivered very strong margin growth. Roll Materials momentum in the fourth quarter continued, especially in emerging markets. Our end-user marketing programs are creating a pipeline of new opportunities for decoration transfer, which will enable above-market growth, as we continue to implement those programs. 
Graphics and Reflective Products benefited from restocking to accommodate a modest increase in promotional spending. This division has also launched two new products, a new cast film that has superior conformability and new reflective sheeting that makes signs more visible at night.
Retail Information Services experienced increased demand and benefited from comparison with one of their most difficult quarters, the first quarter of last year, when retailers dramatically accelerated inventory destocking. What we see is a parallel sales beginning to increase. And while it's too early to call a pipeline refill, because retailers are still watching their inventories closely, we're definitely seeing an uptick in volumes as retailers are attempting to catch up with those sales increases. This year, we actually started strong, and we are continuing to see solid demand right through the second quarter to date.
Office and Consumer Products was the exception to our margin story in the quarter. End demand for our products is still declining, but at a slower rate. As most of you know, we have new competition in the labels category, and we'll spend some money to defend our strong brand position, as well as continuing to increase our spending on innovation in new areas. 
I'm confident we will continue to be successful in our Printable Media business, because we have excellent relationships with customers, including an outstanding service record and recognized expertise in category management, and the Avery brand has very strong consumer brand equity. In fact, it drives traffic to the stores and our customers understand us. We'll be increasing our investment and demand creation, including TV and radio advertising, which you'll see later this year. And you'll also see us begin to launch several new products late this year and early in 2011.
The RFID [Radio Frequency Identification] business continues to develop well, with demand up more than 50% from one year ago. There continues to be strong interest in item-level marking in retail, but we also see strength in other applications as well. 
Now Dan will go over the quarter in more detail."

I'm going to start with Slide 5, if you have the handout that we've provided.

I'm going to start with Slide 5, if you have the handout that we've provided. Sales in the first quarter were up organically about 7%, contributing strongly to the improvement trend of the last three quarters. We experienced solid volume growth across all regions and in almost every key business across the corporation. 
Emerging markets, in particular, continued to surge ahead, with Asia leading the way, growing nearly 30% in our Materials businesses in China. Emerging markets represented over 35% of our total sales for the quarter. 
Operating margin also improved due to the continuing positive impact of restructuring and productivity initiatives. Margins were up sequentially as well. Volume, restructuring and productivity initiatives more than offset the net impact of raw material inflation and selling price changes. For the year, we expect inflation of pricing to be a headwind to margins, which I'll discuss later in the outlook section. 
Sequentially, MG&A [marketing, general and administrative] was roughly flat, although, in dollars and as a percentage of sales, it was up versus last year. In the first quarter of last year, we were in the throes of the economic decline, running MG&A in severe austerity mode, well below what's healthy for the business. 
In the first quarter of 2010, variable costs associated with higher volume, along with the increased growth-related and infrastructure investment, were partially offset by restructuring and productivity initiatives. Currency translation represented a $10 million increase versus prior year. 
And for reasons that Dean mentioned, namely increased volume and the benefits of restructuring and productivity, gross margin for the company is up in the first quarter, both year-over-year and sequentially. In looking ahead, and we'll reiterate this in our outlook section, we expect both gross margin and operating margins to come under pressure from raw material inflation in the coming months. 
As we discussed in January, during our fourth quarter conference call, we began to see some inflation in the fourth quarter and started raising prices in January. The pace of inflation is accelerating, and we're in the midst of another round of price increases in most geographies. So while margins in the near term may come under some pressure, we expect our prices to cover the inflation once they're fully implemented.
Our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment delivered double-digit margins in the quarter, with both volume and productivity actions contributing. Emerging markets were strong again, accelerating further off last quarter's positive numbers. 
Within the Pressure-sensitive segment, our Graphics and Reflective business delivered its highest revenue since the third quarter of 2008. We're seeing some restocking here, and we'll need a few more months behind us before we declare a trend. The margins in this business have improved dramatically due to the volume and cost reductions we've driven over the last year. 
In Retail Information Services, the big margin story is the 440-basis point improvement over last year's first quarter. This reflects over 45% in incremental operating margin year-over-year, consistent with this segment's high-contribution margin. First quarter revenue comps in RIS benefited from increased demand, due in part to significant inventory destocking among apparel retailers that occurred in the first half of 2009. 
The inventory-to-sales ratio in apparel remains at long-term lows, and even dipped further in February as sell-through improved ahead of inventory restocking. There is evidence that while the consumer hasn't come back completely, retail sales of apparel are up, which is great news for this sector.
Now the second quarter is the best indicator of retailer sentiment. And we're hopeful that current trends indicate some inventory rebuild going on now and in coming months. The order pattern in Q1 was strong and, as Dean said, has continued into April. 
Looking at Office Products, the decline in sales in the first quarter reflected weak end-market demand and changes in customer programs. This was partially offset by lower inventory destocking in the first quarter of 2010 compared to that in the first quarter of last year. 
Office Products operating margin declined in the quarter, due to increased spending related to customer programs, as well as higher investment in consumer promotions and marketing. Dean has covered the competitive dynamics in this segment. So suffice it to say that our margins will remain under pressure here, while we invest and defend. 
In other specialty converting businesses, margins swung from negative to positive. There's evidence of restocking, but it will take some time to see what the ongoing trajectory will look like.
And as you know, the company's cash flow is seasonal. We generally use cash in the first half of the year and generate all of our free cash flow in the second half. This year should be no exception, particularly with the growth in volume we're experiencing early in the year. 
On Slide 14 and 15, we provide a list of factors that we believe will contribute to Avery Dennison's 2010 financial results. Based on the factors listed and other assumptions, we expect reported revenue growth of 5% to 7% and adjusted earnings per share of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. We estimate free cash flow in 2010 of $300 million to $350 million. 
Comps, obviously, become more challenging as the year progresses, but we're pleased with the strong start to the year. Just as we did last quarter, we're listing what we currently believe to be some contributing factors to 2010's year-over-year changes in the P&L and free cash flow. 
The key factors on Slide 14 that are in our April guidance assumptions, and that are different from what we said in January, are as follows: At current rates, currency translation represents less than a 1% benefit to reported sales growth and neutral impact to EBIT. We now expect approximately 3%, or $75 million, of new inflation in raw material costs, partially offset with the benefit from our global sourcing strategies, material cost productivity and price increases. This is about double the inflation we expected coming into the year. And we will incur additional expenses for the rest of the year focused on innovation and demand creation in our Office Products segment. These factors, plus the others listed on Slide 14, get us to our 2010 EPS guidance of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. 
While we're not giving quarterly guidance, there are a couple of comments I can make about Q2. First, on Office Products, back-to-school season has been shifting earlier in some years and later in others. We expect this year's back-to-school to occur later, resulting in some sales shifting from the second quarter into the third. 
In the second quarter, inflation is outpacing our price increases, as it has since the fourth quarter. This will keep some pressure on Q2 margins. And as mentioned, free cash flow should again be strong in 2010. We're expecting to generate between $300 million and $350 million of free cash flow. Our primary focus for the use of this free cash is to reduce debt. 
As you know, we completed a $250 million bond issuance this month, and we will use the proceeds to pay down our term loan. If the economy cooperates, we would expect to be in a position later this year for the board to consider an increase in the return of capital to shareholders, in the form of increased dividends, share repurchases or both.
And before opening the call to questions, let me wrap up with one more comment. We're pleased with the trajectory of our businesses. And although the economy is moving in a positive direction, we're not yet back to 2008 levels. Nevertheless, with sales still down more than 5% from the first quarter of 2008, we exceeded that quarter's pre-tax profits by over 13%. With all the actions we've taken over the last year, we've generated a new level of operating leverage and have continued investing for growth at the same time. 
And now we'd be happy to take your questions."

I mean, if you look at Europe as the average, it actually -- their organic growth rate was similar to the U.S. But if you pull out Eastern Europe, the number drops. I think, from an RIS perspective, retailers in Europe are not seeing the increases in demand that U.S. retailers are. I'd still think they're a little bit lagging behind. The Pressure-sensitive business actually had a pretty good quarter in Europe in Q1. So I'm not sure what that says yet. But my sense is, we're still not at that same level as robust a recovery as we see in North America."

They both were down, but the contracting commercial was down a lot more. The comps look a little more promising on the commercial side of the business these days. So I've got my fingers crossed that we'll see maybe, hopefully, a little more recovery than we anticipate. The big impact though will be the impact of back-to-school in the second and third quarter.

So at the same time, I think March apparel sales actually rebounded quite nicely. I think we're starting to see some restocking.

So my sense is that in the U.S. for U.S. retailers and brand owners, there's a lot more confidence. And so we're feeling pretty good about the trends. Let's say that the apparel is kind of one of those low-cost luxuries. And as consumers get a little more confident buying that extra outfit isn't huge. Back-to-school is all about binders and dividers for us. And so the two are necessarily linked. I got to tell you, every other year it's the same. One year, it's early; the next year, it's late.

Before we get to the quarter, I’d like to welcome Mitch Butier. He has been on our quarterly calls for some time now as Corporate Vice President of Finance and Chief Accounting Officer and this is his first call as CFO. He has been with Av",996,"Thanks, Eric. Before we get to the quarter, I’d like to welcome Mitch Butier. He has been on our quarterly calls for some time now as Corporate Vice President of Finance and Chief Accounting Officer and this is his first call as CFO. He has been with Avery Dennison for more than almost 10 years in leadership positions and he has worked in all three of our core business segments as well as here at Corporate. He is a seasoned finance executive and a strong leader and I’m delighted to have him in his new role.
Now, turning to the second quarter, I’m pleased with our performance with sales growth in the mid-teens and continued margin expansion. While the year-over-year comparison is with a very soft quarter, the good news is that our largest businesses either approached or exceeded pre-recession levels of sales and profitability.
The increased operating leverage from additional volumes combined with the benefits of restructuring and productivity initiatives enabled us to expand operating margins while absorbing higher raw material costs and additional growth investments.
Turning to the businesses, Pressure-Sensitive Materials delivered double-digit sales growth and solid profitability. Roll materials at double-digit sales growth in every geographic region. Graphics and Reflective products also had double-digit organic sales growth, reflecting increased government expenditures on infrastructure and a rebound in promotional spending from last year’s low level. As expected, raw material inflation impacted our margins on a sequential basis as price increases lagged cost increases.
We’ve added end-use marketing resources to strengthen our competitive advantage in the pressure-sensitive materials businesses. This investment is enabling us to grow faster by demonstrating the value of pressure-sensitive in enhancing brands, as well as giving us key insights on new packaging and labeling needs.
For example, during the second quarter, we launched several new products for the wine, durables, and digital printing market segments, and we are building a substantial pipeline of new products and solutions that will expand the market for pressure-sensitive and take share from alternative packaging and labeling methods.
Retail Information Services delivered very strong results in the second quarter as customers continue to refill depleted apparel inventory. During a time of unprecedented demand, we improved service, which I believe enables us to gain market share during the quarter. RIS margins improved dramatically and its increased volume and last year’s restructuring actions delivered solid bottom line results.
I know you’ve all seen the announcements about RFID item level marking. While we can’t discuss specific customer programs, this market is definitely accelerating, as retailers strive to improve inventory accuracy to enable a better consumer experience and reduced store labor costs with lower inventory levels.
We have significant competitive advantages in this business, including our backward integration in scale and inlay manufacturing, our global footprint and our excellent track record in delivering information solutions to retailers and plant owners all over the world. I do believe the Wal-Mart announcement last week will accelerate adoption rates across the retail market.
Retail Information Services is starting to realize its promise, and I am delighted with the progress we’ve made. We are the global leader in this business by a large margin. Again, we estimate that we’re only still touching a small fraction of the addressable market for our products and services.
With the compelling business model and expanding competitive advantage, I am confident RIS will deliver strong growth in sales with improved profitability and returns over the coming years.
Now, I touched on the growth of RFID for apparel applications, but we’ve seen strength outside of that market as well. So this is definitely worth mentioning. As most of you know, we have a separate RFID division that sells inlays, not only to Retail Information Services for item level marking, but to outside customers in other vertical markets.
Sales for nine retail applications grew by nearly 50% this quarter and as other supply chains continue to adopt this technology.
Office and Consumer Product results were as expected, given the slow economic recovery and our investments in innovation and demand creation. The competitive situation in labeling is still taking shape but this quarter, you’ll start to see our TV advertising and other elements of our demand creation campaign.
We’re building on our strong consumer brand equity and excellent relationships with major customers and we’re also bringing new innovations to the market. These investments will pressure Office Products’ margins for the balance of the year.
I do believe the back half of the year will present a few challenges, and that is why we only modestly increased our full year guidance. The second quarter is our seasonally strongest quarter. It was difficult to see the seasonal pattern during the past few years with all the noise from the economic conditions we’ve been facing. But I do expect a return to a more normal pattern this year with meaningfully lower revenue for RIS in the third quarter compared to the second.
In addition, we faced three headwinds in the second half of the year. The first is the impact of currency. Second, raw material inflation continues to accelerate. The major factors there are acrylic monomers and paper liners, which both impact the materials businesses. These are specialty materials, somewhat unique to our industry, which are in a supply-demand imbalance right now and it’s not clear when we will see relief.
We continue to raise prices in these businesses, but there will be a lag in getting our margins back. I do want to emphasize that I don’t believe that the margin compression will be a permanent run rate change in our business, but it will be a headwind in the second half of the year.
The third headwind is the increased investment and demand creation and innovation at Office Products that I mentioned earlier. We are spending money to change the long-term trajectory of this business.
Now, Mitch will give you a more detailed explanation on the quarter and the rest of the year.

Starting with Slide #5, sales in the second quarter were up organically about 14%, continuing the improvement trend of the last four quarters. We experienced solid volume growth across all regions and in all key businesses in the Corporation",909,"Thanks, Dean. Starting with Slide #5, sales in the second quarter were up organically about 14%, continuing the improvement trend of the last four quarters. We experienced solid volume growth across all regions and in all key businesses in the Corporation with the exception of Office Products.
Emerging markets in particular continued the surge ahead, with Asia leading the way. Notwithstanding the decline in the euro during Q2, currency changes didn’t impact us much in the quarter, but at current rates currency will have a much bigger impact in the second half. Operating margin again expanded due to increased volume and restructuring and productivity initiatives more than offsetting the impact of raw material inflation.
Moving ahead to Slide #8, gross margin for the company was up in the second quarter, due primarily to volume growth. Inflation in the second quarter, as Dean said, was higher than what we expected just three months ago due to the tight supply of adhesive components and paper liners.
In the second half, we expect a further step-up in raw material cost from what we saw when we spoke to you in April. This will pressure gross margin in the second half as our price increases will lag the inflation through much of the remainder of the year. Now, while margins in the near-term may come under pressure, as Dean mentioned, we do expect our price increases to cover the inflation once they are fully implemented.
MG&A as a percentage of sales was down slightly in the second quarter. Sequentially, MG&A expense was roughly flat. As you may recall, in the second quarter of last year, we were operating at unsustainably low MG&A levels with tight restrictions on travel and other discretionary expenses. Looking to the second half, MG&A expense should be roughly comparable with second quarter levels.
Our Pressure-Sensitive Materials segment delivered strong revenue growth in the quarter with nearly 10% operating margin. Driven by a combination of volume growth and productivity, revenue in this segment is now back to pre-recession levels.
Mid-teen sales growth in raw materials reflected strength in all regions, due principally to the lack of destocking that occurred last year, and as Dean mentioned, our increased focus on end users and innovation.
Our Graphics and Reflective business, again, delivered solid growth reflecting pent-up demand for signage and increased government spending on infrastructure. The margins in this business have improved dramatically due to volume gains and cost reductions over the last year.
Sequentially, margins for the segment were down 40 basis points, as volume and price increases offset most but not all of the raw material inflation incurred in the quarter. As mentioned, we are experiencing additional roll material inflation, which will have a significant impact in the second half. Therefore, it’s reasonable to expect more margin compression during the rest of the year.
In Retail Information Services, second quarter revenue comps benefited from significant inventory destocking in the prior year, as well as improved retail apparel sales and new programs with key brands and retailers.
While April and May’s inventory-to-sales ratio came off of the March bottom, they remained close to historically record lows. RIS’s 8.8% operating margin reflects the increased volume combined with continued efforts to reduce fix costs and streamline operations. We’re very pleased with the progress and success in RIS.
Looking at Office Products, the decline in sales in the second quarter reflected weak end market demand. Office Products’ operating margin declined in the quarter due to higher investment in demand creation and innovation, as well as lower volume. Dean discussed the competitive situation in this segment, so obviously our margins will remain under pressure here while we invest and defend.
In our Other Specialty Converting businesses, we had strong sales growth and margins swung from negative to positive. As you know, this segment is more closely linked to cyclical industries, such as housing and automotive, so we expected these businesses to recover from last year’s depressed levels.
On Slides #13 and #14, we provide a list of factors that we believe will contribute to our 2010 financial results. Based on the factors listed, as well as other assumptions, we now expect reported revenue growth of 7% to 8% and adjusted EPS of $2.60 to $2.80 per share. We also estimate free cash flow to be approximately $350 million for the year.
Just as we did last quarter, we’ve lifted what we currently believe to be some contributing factors to 2010’s year-over-year changes in the P&L and free cash flow. We’ve highlighted the key factors in our current guidance assumptions that are different from what we’ve said in April. These changes are expected to mostly impact the second half.
To highlight the key changes; at June rates, currency is expected to negatively impact EBIT by approximately $8 million for the full year, which reflects a year-over-year headwind of about $11 million in the second half.
We now expect approximately $95 million in inflation of roll material costs, partially offset by benefits from global sourcing strategies, material cost productivity, and price increases. Again, most of this inflation will hit the second half of the year on a year-over-year basis.
The other point to consider is the seasonality of RIS. RIS revenue should be seasonally smaller in the second half with correspondingly lower operating margins, and then the operating profits within Office Products are also expected to be sequentially lower.
Now, we’d be happy to take your questions.

Actually, what’s been going on for the last three or four months is that the pipeline to refill the inventories has been pretty well bottlenecked in Asia with most customers being a little frustrated about getting product, especially out of South China. So, I actually expect that to continue a little bit for maybe another few weeks or so as the bottlenecks are relieved. The inventory to sales ratio is still at a historical low. It popped up a little bit for apparel and soft goods last month.
And there is the key question for me. Here’s what I’ll be watching carefully. Apparels sales were back-to-school. I think that will probably be our best leading indicator for the normal fourth quarter surge we have from our retailers and brand owners in the fourth quarter. The other factor here that’s tough to gauge is the ramp speed for a number of item level marking programs in RFID. So, while we know it’s going to happen, it’s really difficult to start to predict that quarter-by-quarter at least at this point.

What we found through quite a bit of market research late last year and early this year that there are solutions that we can offer, where the Avery brand is incredibly relevant and can get sell-through our existing channels and distribution. So we’ll be launching a number of new products. We’re still in market tests with some exciting things which I can’t really talk about yet that will start to show up in really about the first quarter of 2011.

There’s no really clear shrink-sleeve today that can be used.
So what we’re offering up is an attractive alternative. It requires a change in the application technology, which we’ve partnered with an outside company to do, and that’s a big deal, and we’re in the process of starting up a couple of new application that’ll be online I think by the end of the year.

I’m also happy with Pressure-Sensitive Materials. They had a great quarter. We have been investing in more demand creation through our marketing and end-use activity, and that’s starting to pay off. And with Office Products, we got a little bit more of an uphill battle, but you’ll start to see some of the demand creation activities on some of our current products, and then in 2011, many new products that we plan to introduce in that space.
We do face some near-term challenges between currency and raw material issues and the price gap, as well as some of the investments on Office Products, but I just want to make the point again, especially on the raw material margin issues, I do not see that as a long-term issue. I just see it as a transitional issue too. One of two things happen, we either get prices up or raw material costs will start to plateau and hopefully in a couple of places go again. So thanks for listening and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.

This is our third consecutive quarter of strong top line growth, driven by our largest segments, Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Information Services. Sales of both segments were above prerecession levels",515,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. This is our third consecutive quarter of strong top line growth, driven by our largest segments, Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Information Services. Sales of both segments were above prerecession levels with volume growth in all regions and continued strength in emerging markets. As we expected, margins came under pressure as raw material inflation outpaced price increases, resulting in a decline in margins year-over-year. We saw additional cost increases in late Q3, and as a result, have announced additional price increases in the fourth quarter.
Pressure-sensitive Materials delivered solid sales growth though with lower margins sequentially and year-over-year. This is where the inflation has hit us the hardest. Raw material strength in emerging markets and its focus on end customers contributed to high single-digit sales growth, while Graphics and Reflectives saw also double-digit growth especially in cast films and reflective materials. 
I recently attended Labelexpo and had the opportunity to talk with many of our customers. The overall mood was positive. Most converters indicated that business was good, although somewhat choppy, meaning that their order books were strong for a few weeks and then would pause. My takeaway is that end users are still reluctant to add inventory and are ordering very close to their demand levels. Converters indicated there were still quite a bit of quoting and new product activity, and customer optimism was demonstrated by robust press and equipment sales during the show.
We showcased several innovative technologies at Labelexpo. One is an ultra-thin liner material called Thin Stream that enabled less waste and lowered total applied cost. This innovation is targeted at the food and beverage market segment where pressure-sensitive penetration is low. The second innovation is Fasson curve appeal, which will enable consumer packaged goods companies to label containers with complex curves where today the only option is shrink sleeves. Both of these new proprietary solutions are in the early stages of commercialization, but are great examples of our new innovation platform.
I was very pleased with our progress in Retail Information Services. Our service improvement and our capability to offer a sustainable and brand-enhancing solution, along with supply chain and Information Solutions to major retailers and brands drove 18% sales growth in the quarter. Sales volumes, combined with a solid productivity, enabled solid year-over-year profit growth. RFID item-level marketing continues to gain traction. Sales of these products more than doubled in the quarter.
Office and Consumer Products results were as expected. Sales during back-to-school season, which runs from May through September, were flat year-over-year at point-of-sale, and our shipments were down slightly overall as retailers managed inventory down. While we did lose some share in the labels category, I'm encouraged by the sales of our new products such as label pads and note tabs. We continue to make progress this quarter on the top line and despite greater-than-expected raw material inflation, we expect to achieve the upper end of the annual guidance range that we provided in April. 
Now Mitch will give you a more detailed explanation of the quarter and the full year outlook."
252978,84102656,144845,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dean. Starting with Slide 5 and talking to the Slide 8. Sales in the third quarter were up organically about 8%. As Dean mentioned, we again experienced strong volume growth in our 2 largest segments with Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail In",1029,"Thanks, Dean. Starting with Slide 5 and talking to the Slide 8. Sales in the third quarter were up organically about 8%. As Dean mentioned, we again experienced strong volume growth in our 2 largest segments with Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Information Services delivering solid growth in all regions. The growth in these segments continues to more than offset the revenue decline in office products. 
As expected, our operating margin declined 6.5% in the third quarter as the benefit of higher volume was more than offset by rising raw material costs, higher employee-related costs and increased investment and growth in infrastructure. Now while our operating margin was in line with expenses for the quarter, we are experiencing additional pressure in raw materials as Dean mentioned. Raw material costs continue to rise, and we now expect total raw material inflation to be approximately $105 million for the full year. That's $10 million more than when we last spoke to you. 
The pressure in raw material costs continue to be driven by capacity constraints for certain adhesive components and paper liners. Given this new round of inflation, we are announcing additional pricing increases. These are in addition to the increases we've just implemented in the third quarter. We've previously said that we anticipate a closing in the price inflation gap by the end of the year. We now expect we will only be able to narrow it by year end, and we'll not close the gap until early in 2011. This, of course, assumes no additional raw material inflation.
Turning to Slide 9. Our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment again delivered strong organic revenue growth of 9%, although on lower margins of 8.3%. The growth was driven by continued solid performance in all regions of our raw material business with particularly strong growth continuing in our emerging markets. Specifically, North America is up mid-single digits, Western Europe was up high single digits and the emerging markets were up in the mid-teens. 
Sequentially, the operating margin for this segment declined 130 basis points as this segment is experiencing the vast majority of the raw material inflation. Retail Information Services delivered even stronger organic growth of 18% on higher operating margins. Third quarter revenue comps benefited from significant inventory destocking in the prior year, as well as improved retail apparel sales and new programs with key brands and retailers. While July and August retail inventory-to-sales ratios are off of the March bottom, they remain close to historically record lows. This is all the more reason why we're pleased with RIS' revenue in the third quarter. We are also pleased with the continuing margin expansion in RIS. Operating margins increased 5.6 percentage points in the third quarter, primarily due to volume. The sequential decline in RIS' margin is reflective of the normal seasonal sales trend. So RIS continues to show its operating leverage on the upside on track to double-digit margins.
Looking at Office Products. The decline in sales in the third quarter reflected weak end market demand and increased competition in the labeled portion of this business. Office Products operating margin declined in the quarter due to increased consumer promotion, demand creation and investment innovation, as well as lower volumes. We previously discussed the competitive situation in this segment, so our margins will remain under pressure here while we continue to invest and defend. For this year, that means Office Products is expected to deliver low double-digit margin.
Our other specialty converting businesses had solid sales growth on lower margins. These businesses were also adversely impacted by the significant raw material inflation we discussed earlier. And it's the primary driver of the decline in the operating margin.
Now moving on to guidance on Slides 12 and 13. Just as we did last quarter, we've highlighted the key factors in our current guidance assumptions that are different from what we said in July. Based on the factors listed, as well as other assumptions, we now expect reported revenue growth of 9%, adjusted EPS of $3.70 to $3.20 per share and free cash flow of $350 million to $375 million. 
We are expecting a discrete tax planning event in the fourth quarter that is expected to add approximately $0.40 of EPS this year, and we'll reduce taxes we expect to pay in future years. While this benefit will reduce our effective tax rate this year, we continue to expect an ongoing tax rate of 20% to 24%. This benefit is the primary reason why our guidance is up from last quarter. Excluding this expected tax event, full year 2010 adjusted EPS guidance would be $2.70 to $2.80, which reflects the higher end of our previous range. 
To highlight a couple of the other key changes in our assumptions, I mentioned the $105 million of inflation, which is up from our previous forecast of $95 million. At current rates, currency is now expected to be neutral to the P&L, and we may make pension contributions greater than $50 million. The actual amount we choose to contribute depends on where free cash flow is ending up in the December time frame. 
On the subject of pensions, I do want to note that we announced that we will freeze our U.S. defined benefit plan at the end of the year. The effect of this change is reflected in the financial statements, including a modest curtailment charge. We expect this will modestly reduce our pension expense, but increase our pension contributions in 2011. We will provide more information on the effect of this change of 2011 when we provide 2011 guidance early next year.
Before opening the call to questions, I do want to comment on our increased financial strength. As many of you know, mid-last year, we began a program to aggressively reduce our debt. We're exceeding our stated goals. We've reduced our debt by a more than $400 million since we embarked on this program mid-last year. And our net debt to EBITDA ratio is down significantly and now approximately 2, a key milestone. This is a significant improvement in the financial strength, driven by both higher profits and less debt. 
Now we'd be happy to take your questions."

A couple of our competitors had put certain products on sales allocation for a while due to the shortages. So we did not have to do that. We didn't expect to see any deflation in the back half of the year from acrylic monomers, although the industry talk was, and what we've actually seen is an acceleration of cost increases rather than the other way.

We remind you that these results are preliminary as we have not yet filed our 10-Q.
Our news release references GAAP operating margin, which includes interest expense, restructuring and other charges included in the other expense line of our P&L. Restructuring charges tend to be fairly disparate in amount, frequency and timing.
In light of the nature of these items, we'll focus our margin commentary on pretax results before their effect and before interest expense. These numbers are reconciled with GAAP in schedules A-2 to A-5 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release.
We also remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to uncertainty.

252978,84102656,144992,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. This is our third consecutive quarter of strong top line growth, driven by our largest segments, Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Information Services. Sales of both segments were above pre-recession levels",511,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. This is our third consecutive quarter of strong top line growth, driven by our largest segments, Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Information Services. Sales of both segments were above pre-recession levels with volume growth in all regions and continued strength in emerging markets. 
As we expected, margins came under pressure as raw material inflation outpaced price increases, resulting in a decline in margins year-over-year. We saw additional cost increases in late Q3, and as a result, have announced additional price increases in the fourth quarter.
Pressure-sensitive Materials delivered solid sales growth, though with lower margins sequentially and year-over-year. This is where the inflation has hit us the hardest. Raw material strength in emerging markets and a focus on end customers contributed to high single-digit sales growth, while Graphics and Reflective saw also double-digit growth especially in cast films and reflective materials. 
I recently attended Labelexpo and had the opportunity to talk with many of our customers. The overall mood was positive. Most converters indicated that business was good, although somewhat choppy, meaning that their order books were strong for a few weeks and then would pause. My takeaway is that end users are still reluctant to add inventory and are ordering very close to their demand levels. Converters indicated there were still quite a bit of quoting and new product activity, and customer optimism was demonstrated by robust press and equipment sales during the show.
We showcased several innovative technologies at Labelexpo. One is an ultra-thin liner material called ThinStream that enabled less waste and lower total applied cost. This innovation is targeted at the food and beverage market segment where pressure-sensitive penetration is low. 
The second innovation is Fasson Curve Appeal, which will enable consumer packaged goods companies to label containers with complex curves, where today the only option is shrink sleeves. Both of these new proprietary solutions are in the early stages of commercialization, but are great examples of our new innovation platform.
I was very pleased with our progress in Retail Information Services. Our service improvements and our capability to offer sustainable and brand-enhancing solution, along with supply chain and Information Solutions to major retailers and brands drove 18% sales growth in the quarter. Sales volumes, combined with solid productivity, enabled solid year-over-year profit growth. RFID item-level marking continues to gain traction. Sales of these products more than doubled in the quarter. 
Office and Consumer Products results were as expected. Sales during back-to-school season, which runs from May through September, were flat year-over-year at point-of-sale, and our shipments were down slightly, overall, as retailers managed inventories down. While we did lose some share in the labels category, I'm encouraged by the sales of our new products such as label pads and NoteTabs. 
We continued to make progress this quarter on the top line, and despite greater-than-expected raw material inflation, we expect to achieve the upper end of the annual guidance range that we provided in April. 
Now Mitch will give you a more detailed explanation of the quarter and the full year outlook."
252978,84102656,144992,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dean. Starting with Slide 5 and talking through to Slide 8. Sales in the third quarter were up organically about 8%. As Dean mentioned, we again experienced strong volume growth in our 2 largest segments, with Pressure-sensitive Materials and Reta",1033,"Thanks, Dean. Starting with Slide 5 and talking through to Slide 8. Sales in the third quarter were up organically about 8%. As Dean mentioned, we again experienced strong volume growth in our 2 largest segments, with Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Information Services delivering solid growth in all regions. The growth in these segments continues to more than offset the revenue decline in office products. 
As expected, our operating margin declined at 6.5% in the third quarter, as the benefit of higher volume was more than offset by rising raw material costs, higher employee-related costs and increased investments in growth and infrastructure. Now while our operating margin was in line with expectations for the quarter, we are experiencing additional pressure in raw materials, as Dean mentioned. Raw material costs continue to rise, and we now expect total raw material inflation to be approximately $105 million for the full year. That's $10 million more than when we last spoke to you. 
The pressure in raw material costs continues to be driven by capacity constraints for certain adhesive components and paper liners. Given this new round of inflation, we are announcing additional price increases. These are in addition to the increases we've just implemented in the third quarter. 
We previously said that we anticipated closing the price inflation gap by the end of the year. We now expect we will only be able to narrow it by year end, and we'll not close the gap until early in 2011. This, of course, assumes no additional raw material inflation.
Turning to Slide 9. Our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment again delivered strong organic revenue growth of 9%, although on lower margins of 8.3%. The growth was driven by continued solid performance in all regions of our raw material business with particularly strong growth continuing in our emerging markets. Specifically, North America is up mid-single digits, Western Europe was up high single digits and the emerging markets were up in the mid-teens. 
Sequentially, the operating margin for this segment declined 130 basis points, as this segment is experiencing the vast majority of the raw material inflation. Retail Information Services delivered even stronger organic growth of 18% on higher operating margins. Third quarter revenue comps benefited from significant inventory destocking of prior year, as well as improved retail apparel sales and new programs with key brands and retailers. 
While July and August retail inventory-to-sales ratios are off of the March bottom, they remain close to historically record lows. This is all the more reason why we're pleased with RIS' revenue in the third quarter. We are also pleased with the continuing margin expansion of RIS. Operating margins increased 5.6 percentage points in the third quarter, primarily due to volume. The sequential decline in RIS' margin is reflective of the normal seasonal sales trend. So RIS continues to show its operating leverage to the upside on track to double-digit margins.
Looking at Office Products, the decline in sales in the third quarter reflected weak end-market demand and increased competition in the labeled portion of this business. Office Products operating margin declined in the quarter due to increased consumer promotions, demand creation and investments in innovation, as well as lower volume. 
We previously discussed the competitive situation in this segment, so our margins will remain under pressure here while we continue to invest and defend. For this year, that means Office Products is expected to deliver low digit -- low double-digit margins. 
Our Other Specialty Converting businesses had solid sales growth on lower margins. These businesses were also adversely impacted by the significant raw material inflation we discussed earlier, and it's the primary driver of the decline in the operating margin.
Now moving on to guidance on Slides 12 and 13. Just as we did last quarter, we've highlighted the key factors in our current guidance assumptions that are different from what we said in July. Based on the factors listed, as well as other assumptions, we now expect reported revenue growth of 9%, adjusted EPS of $3.10 to $3.20 per share and free cash flow of $350 million to $375 million. 
We are expecting a discrete tax planning event in the fourth quarter that is expected to add approximately $0.40 of EPS this year, and we'll reduce taxes we expect to pay in future years. While this benefit will reduce our effective tax rate this year, we continue to expect an ongoing tax rate of 20% to 24%. This benefit is the primary reason why our guidance is up from last quarter. Excluding this expected tax event, full year 2010 adjusted EPS guidance would be $2.70 to $2.80, which reflects the higher end of our previous range. 
To highlight a couple of the other key changes in our assumptions, I mentioned the $105 million of inflation, which is up from our previous forecast of $95 million. At current rates, currency is now expected to be neutral to the P&L, and we may make pension contributions greater than $50 million. The actual amount we choose to contribute depends on where free cash flow is ending up in the December time frame. 
On the subject of pensions, I do want to note that we announced that we will freeze our U.S. defined benefit plan at the end of the year. The effect of this change is reflected in the financial statements including a modest curtailment charge. We expect this will modestly reduce our pension expense but increase our pension contributions in 2011. We will provide more information on the effect of this change in 2011 when we provide 2000 guidance -- 2011 guidance early next year.
Before opening the call to questions, I do want to comment on our increased financial strength. As many of you know, mid-last year, we began a program to aggressively reduce our debt. We're exceeding our stated goals. We have reduced our debt by a more than $400 million since we embarked on this program mid-last year, and our net debt to EBITDA ratio is down significantly and now approximately 2, a key milestone. This is a significant improvement in financial strength driven by both higher profits and less debt. 
Now we'd be happy to take your questions."

We signed an additional agreement in the last quarter with a major retailer, who is implementing item-level tagging. Unfortunately, I can't say who they are. But there is an increasing appetite for implementing these programs across the industry. So the capital expense, frankly, isn't huge for a lot of these retailers, I mean, compared to what they're spending their money on today. So I consider it to be a real positive trend. The one point I want to make though is that the sales increases and the profit increases we're getting in RIS are barely impacted by current RFID item level. So we still have a lot of traction left in that business without RFID. And for me, RFID is really icing on the cake, and so it remains a good medium- to long-term upside for this business.

Our news release references GAAP operating margin, which includes interest expense, restructuring and other charges included in the Other Expense line of our P&L. Restructuring charges tend to be fairly disparate in amount, frequency and timing.

This is our third consecutive quarter of strong top line growth, driven by our largest segments, Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Information Services. Sales of both segments were above pre-recession levels with volume growth in all regions and continued strength in emerging markets. 
As we expected, margins came under pressure as raw material inflation outpaced price increases, resulting in a decline in margins year-over-year. We saw additional cost increases in late Q3, and as a result, have announced additional price increases in the fourth quarter.
Pressure-sensitive Materials delivered solid sales growth, though with lower margins sequentially and year-over-year. This is where the inflation has hit us the hardest. Raw material strength in emerging markets and a focus on end customers contributed to high single-digit sales growth, while Graphics and Reflective saw also double-digit growth, especially in cast films and reflective materials. 
I recently attended Labelexpo and had the opportunity to talk with many of our customers. The overall mood was positive. Most converters indicated that business was good, although somewhat choppy, meaning that their order books were strong for a few weeks and then would pause. My takeaway is that end users are still reluctant to add inventory and are ordering very close to their demand levels. Converters indicated there were still quite a bit of quoting and new product activity, and customer optimism was demonstrated by robust press and equipment sales during the show.
We showcased several innovative technologies at Labelexpo. One is an ultra-thin liner material called ThinStream that enables less waste and lower total applied cost. This innovation is targeted at the food and beverage market segment where Pressure-sensitive penetration is low. 
The second innovation is Fasson Curve Appeal, which will enable consumer packaged goods companies to label containers with complex curves, where today the only option is shrink sleeves. Both of these new proprietary solutions are in the early stages of commercialization, but are great examples of our new innovation platform.
I was very pleased with our progress in Retail Information Services. Our service improvements and our capability to offer sustainable and brand-enhancing solutions, along with supply chain and Information Solutions to major retailers and brands, drove 18% sales growth in the quarter. Sales volumes, combined with solid productivity, enabled solid year-over-year profit growth. RFID item-level marking continues to gain traction. Sales of these products more than doubled in the quarter. 
Office and Consumer Products results were as expected. Sales during back-to-school season, which runs from May through September, were flat year-over-year at point-of-sale, and our shipments were down slightly overall, as retailers managed inventories down. While we did lose some share in the labels category, I'm encouraged by the sales of our new products such as label pads and NoteTabs. 
We continued to make progress this quarter on the top line, and despite greater-than-expected raw material inflation, we expect to achieve the upper end of the annual guidance range that we provided in April. 
Now Mitch will give you a more detailed explanation of the quarter and the full year outlook."
252978,84102656,145096,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dean. Starting with Slide 5 and talking through to Slide 8. Sales in the third quarter were up organically about 8%. As Dean mentioned, we again experienced strong volume growth in our 2 largest segments, with Pressure-sensitive Materials and Reta",1032,"Thanks, Dean. Starting with Slide 5 and talking through to Slide 8. Sales in the third quarter were up organically about 8%. As Dean mentioned, we again experienced strong volume growth in our 2 largest segments, with Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Information Services delivering solid growth in all regions. The growth in these segments continues to more than offset the revenue decline in office products. 
As expected, our operating margin declined at 6.5% in the third quarter, as the benefit of higher volume was more than offset by rising raw material costs, higher employee-related costs and increased investments in growth and infrastructure. Now while our operating margin was in line with expectations for the quarter, we are experiencing additional pressure in raw materials, as Dean mentioned. Raw material costs continue to rise, and we now expect total raw material inflation to be approximately $105 million for the full year. That's $10 million more than when we last spoke to you. 
The pressure in raw material costs continues to be driven by capacity constraints for certain adhesive components and paper liners. Given this new round of inflation, we are announcing additional price increases. These are in addition to the increases we've just implemented in the third quarter. 
We previously said that we anticipated closing the price inflation gap by the end of the year. We now expect we will only be able to narrow it by year end, and we'll not close the gap until early in 2011. This, of course, assumes no additional raw material inflation.
Turning to Slide 9. Our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment again delivered strong organic revenue growth of 9%, although on lower margins of 8.3%. The growth was driven by continued solid performance in all regions of our world materials business with particularly strong growth continuing in our emerging markets. Specifically, North America is up mid-single digits, Western Europe was up high single digits and the emerging markets were up in the mid-teens. Sequentially, the operating margin for this segment declined 130 basis points, as this segment is experiencing the vast majority of the raw material inflation.
Retail Information Services delivered even stronger organic growth of 18% on higher operating margins. Third quarter revenue comps benefited from significant inventory destocking the prior year, as well as improved retail apparel sales and new programs with key brands and retailers. While July and August retail inventory-to-sales ratios are off of the March bottom, they remain close to historically record lows. This is all the more reason why we're pleased with RIS' revenue in the third quarter. 
We are also pleased with the continuing margin expansion of RIS. Operating margins increased 5.6 percentage points in the third quarter, primarily due to volume. The sequential decline in RIS' margin is reflective of the normal seasonal sales trend. So RIS continues to show its operating leverage to be upside on track to double-digit margins.
Looking at Office Products, the decline in sales in the third quarter reflected weak end-market demand and increased competition in the labels portion of this business. Office Products operating margin declined in the quarter due to increased consumer promotions, demand creation and investments in innovation, as well as lower volumes. We previously discussed the competitive situation in this segment, so our margins will remain under pressure here while we continue to invest and defend. For this year, that means Office Products is expected to deliver low digit -- low double-digit margins. 
Our Other Specialty Converting businesses had solid sales growth on lower margins. These businesses were also adversely impacted by the significant raw material inflation we discussed earlier, and it's the primary driver of the decline in the operating margins.
Now moving on to guidance on Slides 12 and 13. Just as we did last quarter, we've highlighted the key factors in our current guidance assumptions that are different from what we said in July. Based on the factors listed, as well as other assumptions, we now expect reported revenue growth of 9%, adjusted EPS of $3.10 to $3.20 per share and free cash flow of $350 million to $375 million. 
We are expecting a discrete tax planning event in the fourth quarter that is expected to add approximately $0.40 of EPS this year and will reduce taxes we expect to pay in future years. While this benefit will reduce our effective tax rate this year, we continue to expect an ongoing tax rate of 20% to 24%. This benefit is the primary reason why our guidance is up from last quarter. Excluding this expected tax event, full year 2010 adjusted EPS guidance would be $2.70 to $2.80, which reflects the higher end of our previous range. 
To highlight a couple of the other key changes in our assumptions, I mentioned the $105 million of inflation, which is up from our previous forecast of $95 million. At current rates, currency is now expected to be neutral to the P&L, and we may make pension contributions greater than $50 million. The actual amount we choose to contribute depends on where free cash flow is ending up in the December time frame. 
On the subject of pensions, I do want to note that we announced that we will freeze our U.S. defined benefit plan at the end of the year. The effect of this change is reflected in the financial statements, including a modest curtailment charge. We expect this will modestly reduce our pension expense but increase our pension contributions in 2011. We will provide more information on the effect of this change in 2011 when we provide 2000 guidance -- 2011 guidance early next year.
Before opening the call to questions, I do want to comment on our increased financial strength. As many of you know, mid-last year, we began a program to aggressively reduce our debt. We're exceeding our stated goals. We have reduced our debt by more than $400 million since we embarked on this program mid-last year, and our net debt to EBITDA ratio is down significantly and now approximately 2, a key milestone. This is a significant improvement in financial strength driven by both higher profits and less debt. 
Now we'd be happy to take your questions."

So the $15 million charges in total external sales for us in RFID-related items, we're still on track for that. We signed an additional agreement in the last quarter with a major retailer who is implementing item-level tagging. Unfortunately, I can't say who they are. But there is an increasing appetite for implementing these programs across the industry. So the capital expense, frankly, isn't huge for a lot of these retailers, I mean, compared to what they're spending their money on today. So I consider it to be a real positive trend. The one point I want to make, though, is that the sales increases and the profit increases we're getting in RIS are barely impacted by current RFID item level. So we still have a lot of traction left in that business without RFID. And for me, RFID is really icing on the cake, and so it remains a good medium- to long-term upside for this business. But it's tracking along really well."

252978,84102656,145182,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. This is our third consecutive quarter of strong top line growth, driven by our largest segments, Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Information Services. Sales of both segments were above pre-recession levels",511,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. This is our third consecutive quarter of strong top line growth, driven by our largest segments, Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Information Services. Sales of both segments were above pre-recession levels with volume growth in all regions and continued strength in emerging markets. 
As we expected, margins came under pressure as raw material inflation outpaced price increases, resulting in a decline in margins year-over-year. We saw additional cost increases in late Q3, and as a result, have announced additional price increases in the fourth quarter.
Pressure-sensitive Materials delivered solid sales growth, though with lower margins sequentially and year-over-year. This is where the inflation has hit us the hardest. Raw material strength in emerging markets and a focus on end customers contributed to high single-digit sales growth, while Graphics and Reflective saw also double-digit growth, especially in cast films and reflective materials. 
I recently attended Labelexpo and had the opportunity to talk with many of our customers. The overall mood was positive. Most converters indicated that business was good, although somewhat choppy, meaning that their order books were strong for a few weeks and then would pause. My takeaway is that end users are still reluctant to add inventory and are ordering very close to their demand levels. Converters indicated there were still quite a bit of quoting and new product activity, and customer optimism was demonstrated by robust press and equipment sales during the show.
We showcased several innovative technologies at Labelexpo. One is an ultra-thin liner material called ThinStream that enables less waste and lower total applied cost. This innovation is targeted at the food and beverage market segment where pressure-sensitive penetration is low. 
The second innovation is Fasson Curve Appeal, which will enable consumer packaged goods companies to label containers with complex curves, where today the only option is shrink sleeves. Both of these new proprietary solutions are in the early stages of commercialization, but are great examples of our new innovation platform.
I was very pleased with our progress in Retail Information Services. Our service improvements and our capability to offer sustainable and brand-enhancing solutions, along with supply chain and Information Solutions to major retailers and brands, drove 18% sales growth in the quarter. Sales volumes, combined with solid productivity, enabled solid year-over-year profit growth. RFID item-level marking continues to gain traction. Sales of these products more than doubled in the quarter. 
Office and Consumer Products results were as expected. Sales during back-to-school season, which runs from May through September, were flat year-over-year at point-of-sale, and our shipments were down slightly overall, as retailers managed inventories down. While we did lose some share in the labels category, I'm encouraged by the sales of our new products such as label pads and NoteTabs. 
We continued to make progress this quarter on the top line, and despite greater-than-expected raw material inflation, we expect to achieve the upper end of the annual guidance range that we provided in April. 
Now Mitch will give you a more detailed explanation of the quarter and the full year outlook."
252978,84102656,145182,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dean. Starting with Slide 5 and talking through to Slide 8. Sales in the third quarter were up organically about 8%. As Dean mentioned, we again experienced strong volume growth in our 2 largest segments, with Pressure-sensitive Materials and Reta",1032,"Thanks, Dean. Starting with Slide 5 and talking through to Slide 8. Sales in the third quarter were up organically about 8%. As Dean mentioned, we again experienced strong volume growth in our 2 largest segments, with Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Information Services delivering solid growth in all regions. The growth in these segments continues to more than offset the revenue decline in office products. 
As expected, our operating margin declined at 6.5% in the third quarter, as the benefit of higher volume was more than offset by rising raw material costs, higher employee-related costs and increased investments in growth and infrastructure. Now while our operating margin was in line with expectations for the quarter, we are experiencing additional pressure in raw materials, as Dean mentioned. Raw material costs continue to rise, and we now expect total raw material inflation to be approximately $105 million for the full year. That's $10 million more than when we last spoke to you. 
The pressure in raw material costs continues to be driven by capacity constraints for certain adhesive components and paper liners. Given this new round of inflation, we are announcing additional price increases. These are in addition to the increases we've just implemented in the third quarter. 
We previously said that we anticipated closing the price inflation gap by the end of the year. We now expect we will only be able to narrow it by year end, and we'll not close the gap until early in 2011. This, of course, assumes no additional raw material inflation.
Turning to Slide 9. Our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment again delivered strong organic revenue growth of 9%, although on lower margins of 8.3%. The growth was driven by continued solid performance in all regions of our Roll Materials business with particularly strong growth continuing in our emerging markets. Specifically, North America is up mid-single digits, Western Europe was up high single digits and the emerging markets were up in the mid-teens. Sequentially, the operating margin for this segment declined 130 basis points, as this segment is experiencing the vast majority of the raw material inflation.
Retail Information Services delivered even stronger organic growth of 18% on higher operating margins. Third quarter revenue comps benefited from significant inventory destocking the prior year, as well as improved retail apparel sales and new programs with key brands and retailers. While July and August retail inventory-to-sales ratios are off of the March bottom, they remain close to historically record lows. This is all the more reason why we're pleased with RIS' revenue in the third quarter. 
We are also pleased with the continuing margin expansion of RIS. Operating margins increased 5.6 percentage points in the third quarter, primarily due to volume. The sequential decline in RIS' margin is reflective of the normal seasonal sales trend. So RIS continues to show its operating leverage to be upside on track to double-digit margins.
Looking at Office Products, the decline in sales in the third quarter reflected weak end-market demand and increased competition in the labels portion of this business. Office Products operating margin declined in the quarter due to increased consumer promotions, demand creation and investments in innovation, as well as lower volumes. We previously discussed the competitive situation in this segment, so our margins will remain under pressure here while we continue to invest and defend. For this year, that means Office Products is expected to deliver low digit -- low double-digit margins. 
Our Other Specialty Converting businesses had solid sales growth on lower margins. These businesses were also adversely impacted by the significant raw material inflation we discussed earlier, and it's the primary driver of the decline in the operating margins.
Now moving on to guidance on Slides 12 and 13. Just as we did last quarter, we've highlighted the key factors in our current guidance assumptions that are different from what we said in July. Based on the factors listed, as well as other assumptions, we now expect reported revenue growth of 9%, adjusted EPS of $3.10 to $3.20 per share and free cash flow of $350 million to $375 million. 
We are expecting a discrete tax planning event in the fourth quarter that is expected to add approximately $0.40 of EPS this year and will reduce taxes we expect to pay in future years. While this benefit will reduce our effective tax rate this year, we continue to expect an ongoing tax rate of 20% to 24%. This benefit is the primary reason why our guidance is up from last quarter. Excluding this expected tax event, full year 2010 adjusted EPS guidance would be $2.70 to $2.80, which reflects the higher end of our previous range. 
To highlight a couple of the other key changes in our assumptions, I mentioned the $105 million of inflation, which is up from our previous forecast of $95 million. At current rates, currency is now expected to be neutral to the P&L, and we may make pension contributions greater than $50 million. The actual amount we choose to contribute depends on where free cash flow is ending up in the December time frame. 
On the subject of pensions, I do want to note that we announced that we will freeze our U.S. defined benefit plan at the end of the year. The effect of this change is reflected in the financial statements, including a modest curtailment charge. We expect this will modestly reduce our pension expense but increase our pension contributions in 2011. We will provide more information on the effect of this change in 2011 when we provide 2000 guidance -- 2011 guidance early next year.
Before opening the call to questions, I do want to comment on our increased financial strength. As many of you know, mid-last year, we began a program to aggressively reduce our debt. We're exceeding our stated goals. We have reduced our debt by more than $400 million since we embarked on this program mid-last year, and our net debt to EBITDA ratio is down significantly and now approximately 2, a key milestone. This is a significant improvement in financial strength driven by both higher profits and less debt. 
Now we'd be happy to take your questions."
