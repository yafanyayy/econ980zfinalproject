Some 11 months ago after joining Anglo American, I visited many of our major shareholders and tabled a clear set of strategic priorities that the board and the management intended to pursue. Under Cynthia Carroll's leadership, management focused on delivering these priorities has been consistent and unwavering. As a result, there's been considerable success in value creation and since she will be giving you more details on our achievements and progress later. 
Just to say something about the board. The board with three new non-executive directors, with the recruitment process for a fourth underway, is performing in a cohesive way and is challenging up management in the way that it should. The contributions from the general management committee members who now regularly attend the board have added further value to our debates. I'm now satisfied that the width and relevance of skill sets have created a board fit for purpose. The changes have also strengthened the important work done on committees in clearing the sustainability of our business and the critical protection of our corporate reputation.
The completion of our major corporate reorganization has been executed superbly and on time. This has changed the dynamics and changed the transparency of decision-making, along with clear lines of communication, and importantly, accountability. The board witnessed this at firsthand during our recent two-day strategy session when the Executive Committee joined us providing significant and valuable involvement. We will also speak today about our disposal program being on track and creating significant value from the agreed sales of our non-core assets, as well as our continuing success with asset optimization and international procurement.
You will hear shortly too about the excellent progress we are making on both timing and CapEx on three of our major projects at Barro Alto, nickel; Los Bronces, copper; Kolomela, iron ore. And collectively, these new business streams will contribute significantly to earnings and cash flow from 2011 onwards. And as you know, some three years ago, the board took a decision to invest in the Minas Rio iron ore project, which represents the development of one of the world's largest iron ore bodies. However, this is not without challenges and one that the board is following very closely. 
We're making good progress on the areas that are within our control. But in reality, the timing of first ore is largely dependent upon the completion of the licensing process that lies on the critical path. This is receiving maximum attention and we're using every available resource to expedite the process. 
Elsewhere across the group, I'm greatly encouraged by the united drive and focus being displayed by the Executive on all fronts, and this is reflected in today's financial results including the improved operating performance, cash generation and the result in strengthening of our balance sheet, which René will discuss with you shortly.
All this progress has given the board confidence to reinstate the dividend earlier than we anticipated given the importance we as a board have attached to that commitment. It is therefore proposed to pay $0.25 per share at the half year and to move progressively thereafter. I will now hand over to Cynthia."

We've had a strong performance for the first half of 2010 and I'm first going to take you through our o",1472,"Thank you very much, Chairman. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and it's very good to see you again here this morning, and thank you for joining us. We've had a strong performance for the first half of 2010 and I'm first going to take you through our operational review. René will then talk about our financials and then we'll update you on the major growth projects.
I'll start with the highlights. We've had very good numbers to report for the first half. There's been strong recovery in earnings. Group operating profit is $4.4 billion. EBITDA is $5.4 billion and the underlying earnings per share is $1.84. We've seen further benefits from the operational turnaround in platinum and diamonds, and I'll comment on each of the businesses in a moment. 
Our early success in Asset Optimisation and Procurement has continued. We said we wanted to fund $2 billion of uplift from these initiatives by 2011. Well, in just the first six months of this year, we have achieved a run rate of $1 billion from our core businesses. 
As for the four near-term growth projects, the Barro Alto nickel project in Brazil is on track and we expect first production early 2011. The Los Bronces copper expansion project in Chile and the Kolomela iron ore project in South Africa are both on schedule and progressing very well. And we have made good progress at the Minas Rio iron ore project in Brazil in the face of a challenging regulatory environment. And I'll talk more about Minas Rio later on. 
You'll remember that we have focused our group on what we believe to be the most attractive commodities: platinum, copper, iron ore, metallurgical coal, diamonds, nickel and thermal coal. Our divestments of our non-core assets are going very well. $1.3 billion for our Zinc business, $500 million for certain undeveloped coal assets in Australia and over $400 million for several of Tarmac's European aggregates and concretes products businesses. Those sales will further strengthen the balance sheet by some $2.2 billion this year. And as the Chairman highlighted, we are reinstating the dividend. This reflects our improved operating performance and financial position, the progress we've made on our divestment program and a supportive medium-term outlook. The interim dividend is $0.25 per share.
So turning to safety. We are continuing to drive further improvements in our safety performance, and I believe we have actually taken the lead in the industry. We're showing that when you make safety a priority, you can make a real difference. 95% of our sites operated without fatalities in the first half of this year. We've seen a 38% reduction against the same period in 2009 and 71% reduction since 2007. Lost time injuries continue to decrease with a 30% improvement over the first half of last year. There's some way to go and I'm not settling for anything less than having no fatalities. But we are heading in the right direction. 
Our people understand what we mean when we say about safety. The governments and the trade unions with which we work understand that we are serious about it. And we believe the fact that safety matters to us and the reductions of injuries is a clear demonstration of this benefits the morale and the culture of the business. It furthers our relationships with our partners and underpins the big steps we are taking in improving productivity.
Now let's look at some of the details behind the business highlights. Starting with our performance in Platinum. This is a key business that we needed to turn around, and we have. We've seen a considerable transformation and there's evidence of continuing improvement, particularly in productivity as we drive the business into the lower half of the cost curve.  Our operating profit for the first half was $418 million. 
On safety, we've seen lost time injury frequency rates decreased by 16% and we've maintained tight control of operating cash unit costs despite labor inflation of 10% and a rise in electricity prices of 25%. This year, we're seeing the full benefit of the reduction of labor complement in 2009. We are constantly working on upgrading the efficiency and the productivity of our mine plants, infrastructure and equipment with clear results, yielding a 27% increase in our productivity since the start of 2008. And in addition, as you will have seen last week, we received letters of conversion of our mineral rights from the Department of Mineral Resources, and we are now executing those conversions.
There's a similarly good picture in copper and nickel. On copper, I want to highlight that we have doubled our operating profit to $1.2 billion. We've maintained production in line with the first half of last year despite operational issues in Mantos Blancos and industrial auction at Collahuasi, and we've maintained our per unit cost at $1.04 per pound against the market price of $3.23 per pound in the period. 
At Collahuasi, an expansion project to increase sulfide processing capacity to 150,000 tons per day by early 2011 continues. Collahuasi has also just announced a 40% increase in its copper reserves and resources more than 2 billion tons, bringing the total to 7.1 billion tons at 0.82% copper. And a conceptual study is underway to evaluate the next phases of expansion at Collahuasi that would ultimately increase production to at least 1 million tons of copper per annum. And we expect to complete this study in the first quarter of 2011.  And we will seek board approval this year for the  Quellaveco project, our exciting greenfield 225,000 ton per annum copper opportunity in Peru. 
As for Nickel, you see here a turnaround in operating profit with $68 million in the first half. The Barro Alto project is 94% complete and we will soon see a step change in our Nickel business unit production more than double when this project ramps up to its full 41,000 tons per year over the first five years. And work on the conceptual study for Jacare, also in Brazil, has begun and a pre-feasibility study for Morro Sem Bone will begin in the second half of the year.
In our Iron Ore and Manganese businesses, we've seen a very healthy increase in operating profit, up by 126% to $1.6 billion. Production at Kumba Sishen mine is up 17% year-on-year to 21.1 million tons. And cash cost are marginally lower and productivity has improved, offsetting increased waste volumes, which were up 23%. However, we are forecasting a 15% increase in unit cost for the full year to account for the planned higher stripping ratios. 
In Met Coal, we delivered an operating profit of $263 million. They were very heavy rains in Queensland in the first quarter, but our business still achieved record sales of 14.8 million tons, thanks to efficient stock management and asset rotation. In local currency terms, our FOB costs were down 7%, though this was more than offset by the Australian dollar which strengthened by 25% compared to the first half of 2009. 
Grosvenor, our Met Coal project in Queensland, Australia, is our second project that is set for board approval and we expect that to be next year. It sits in the lower half of the cost curve and we envision a single longwall initially, with production reaching about 4.3 million tons a year of hard coking coal. And we see the potential to double this production with a second longwall.
Our Thermal Coal profit is $351 million. Tier 2 production was affected by unusually heavy second quarter rains in South Africa and challenging geological conditions, but we're still seeing resilient prices in export Thermal Coal and good demand from India. Cerrejon is performing well, with unit cost down 10%, though operating profit was affected by the lower mid-Atlantic coal prices. 
In Diamonds, we recorded a big increase in volume from 6.6 million carats to 15.4 million carats, and operating profit of $261 million. That is a reflection of the market recovery and the significant cost savings that have been embedded in De Beers. We achieved sales of $2.6 billion, up 84% on the same half year.
So with respect to our operations, there is a very positive picture across our seven core commodity businesses. Now let's look at the work that we're doing around Asset Optimisation and Procurement. 
You'll remember in February that we set and increased target of $2 billion of uplift from just our core businesses by the end of 2011, and the graph here shows how we are well ahead of expectations with a run rate for the first six months of this year of $1 billion from core businesses and $1.2 billion in total. So that's where we are on the operating performance for the first half. 
Now I'll hand over to René to cover the financials."

Thank you, Cynthia. A very strong set of financial results as you will see over the next two slides, so supporting the redemption of the dividend of 13% up to $4.4 billion, I will go over next two slides to the expansion in term of the key movement in operating profit. Effective tax rate similar to last year at 31.8%. We have the benefits in the first half of project settlement in South Africa. For the full year, we're expecting a tax rate of 33%. Net debt down to $10.9 billion is a factor to expect to consider the divestments that we have announced on a pro forma basis, the level of debt is down to $9 billion.
Turning to the operating profit, we had a full significant positive cost volumes of $2.6 billion. $800 million due to platinum, $800 million due to iron ore and $700 million due to copper. Exchange, $643 million negative FX volumes, $400 million due to the strengthening of the rand, $200 million through the Aussie dollar.
Inflation, $270 million, we have seen a slowdown in the level of inflation including South Africa with an inflation rate forced us [indiscernible](1:38) below 6%. Volume, positive volumes of $219 million, predominantly in metallurgical coal and iron ore. Remember that this volume variance is calculated using last year commodity prices so it's somewhat underestimated. Cash cost down 1%. As you will see when I go to the detail due to a 2% decline in comparable growth. Due to the impact of turnaround at De Beers, De Beers contributed $261 million to the group operating cost sheet this year compared to a breakeven position last year.
Turning first to price volumes and first trade with commodity price volumes. Copper on average is $308, slightly below LME price of $323 due to the mark-to-market adjustment. At end of June, we had 94,000 tons of copper profitably priced at $2.95. Copper, significant increase in the rand basket price above 19,000 rand for the first half this year compared to less than 14,000 rand last year.
Turning to commodities, $903 million positive volumes. As I mentioned earlier much of the volumes came from the iron ore, $800 million. Significant changes in market practice highlight the key changes on the right-hand side. In the course of thermal coal from South Africa, 35% of the volume was still sold and long-term fixed price contract in the first half of 2010. These contracts are being phased out. And next year, we expect all the volumes sold from South Africa to be sold on floating index basis. 
Met Coal, 80% of the volumes sold on quantitatively benchmark basis. 10% was committed at the beginning of the year on the annual fixed priced basis and 10% being sold on the spot market. Kumba iron ore, 28% of volume was sold in first half on the spot market especially to China. That's the volume that we'd expect between 10% and 15%.
Turning to exchange and production volumes. In the case of exchange volumes I already mentioned, the negative volumes due to the rand, an average exchange rate of 753 in the first half compared to 920 last year. In terms of production volumes, platinum reported a 5% decline in refined production volume. It's all due to the closure of three high cost shaft which contributed 58,000 ounces in the first half of 2009. 
Copper production was flat. Three events impacted the volume of production in the first half. First, the earthquake, which had an impact of 2,000 tons of copper. We had also, at Collahuasi, a nine-day contractor strike which costs us 5,000 tons of production. And we had a failure                        of the [indiscernible](5:48) at Mantos Blancos, which cost us 7,000 tons of copper.
Met Coal, Cynthia mentioned the tremendous performance in Australia, 25% increase in production despite some difficult condition at the beginning of the year. Chemical Coal, down 4% as the projection at Cerrejon in Latin America was basically flat, also decline came from [indiscernible](6:18) due to some very heavy rain at the beginning of the year. Iron ore, 17% increase in production. [indiscernible](6:31) now is operating at nameplate capacity, 13 million tons a year. And we had a substantial improvement of the yield at the DMS plant in the first half of 2010.
Turning to the cost performance. 2% decline in comparable cost on the back of two initiatives that Cynthia highlighted around Asset Optimisation and Procurement, more than offsetting the increase in the non-comparable cost, predominantly electricity in South Africa and in Chile, as well as increase in oil prices, with an average oil price of $80 a barrel in the first half of 2010 compared to a $52 last year. Electricity and fuel represent 8% of big group cost base.
Turning to CapEx and net debt. We are making some tremendous progress on three of the four major projects. That went through, which will be commissioned early 2011. The Los Bronces expansion towards the end of 2011 and Sishen South in 2012. Those three projects when they come on stream and achieve full capacity at the currently role of commodity prices, will contribute an additional $2 billion of EBITDA.
On the right hand side, you see the cash flow movements. Operating cash flow of $3.7 billion. That's after a negative movement in working capital of $900 million. $300 million due to some increase in pipeline inventory at Platinum. That will be released during the second half of the year. $600 million increase in debt due to higher commodity prices. We highlight also the impact of the rights issue at Anglo Platinum, 12.5 billion rand rights issue, and contribution to do billion-dollar rights issue by De Beers earlier this year.
Divestment proceeds, not reflected at the end of June debt level. We are expected to receive all these proceeds before the end of the year except for $100 million in Australia. We have also been able to optimize the structure to minimize tax leakage. And on this overall $2.1 billion of proceeds, we're only expecting $124 million of tax leakage, $84 million associated with the sale in Australia and $40 million associated with the zinc divestment.
My last slide. So in conclusion, a very strong improvement in our financial position. Net debt of $10.9 billion. This number includes $300 million in South Africa. It doesn't include the level of debt in the deals that we don't consolidate, but you see the decline in the level of debt at De Beers from $3.1 billion to $1.5 billion, obviously, the benefit of the rights issue, but also a turnaround at De Beers, with a net cash generation of $620 million for the first half of this year.  Thank you."

And I'm proud just to comment on safety, and that's now after 28 million men hours worked. Our lost timing frequency rate is 0.029, of what is a fantastic performance. 
And the projects have achieved now in July, 11 men work hours lost time injury free. And as a comment, Barro Alto was elected this year related to 2009, the best in class for safety in Brazil. It was an election by the very important and technical magazine there. 
In the sustainable development side, we are at Barro Alto, and for the second year in the 20 top companies in Brazil in terms of biodiversity and social responsibility. And in terms of construction, Barro Alto, it's now 8.9% complete. We are now in the commissioning. We have four steps on the commission. And now we are on the last part of the commission, the C4 for discretionary areas. The main power substation has been already energized. And in terms of the main key components [ph](1:52), installation of refractory for the [indiscernible](1:56) furnace, we are ready for the first line and it means one month ahead. And then now, our challenge is to focus and then to complete the mechanical production for the lines one and two. That's what will happen on August and November this year. Now and completing these, we're ready for the first metal in December and the first commercial production at the beginning of the year.
We expect a safe, a smooth and a quicker ramp up. And we have a strong commissioning and operating alertness in place and that everything is going well there. And we expect Barro Alto to operate, like Cynthia mentioned, in the first half of the cost curve and work for the next 30 years. The project will deliver 41,000 tons of nickel in the first five years, and the average of 36,000 tons for the next 26 to 30 years production. And Barro Alto at full production will double our production in the next year and we'll increase our production from 26,000 to 62,000 tons of nickel."

Let me start by saying that when this project is actually commissioned, Los Bronces is going to be producing up to 490,000 tons of copper per year, which is going to make Los Bronces the fifth-largest copper mine in the world. 
During this year, we've been significantly ramping up the work rates on the project, and right now, we actually have 11,000 people working on site. And we have accumulated today 22 million work hours. 
On the mining side, the preparation of the mine for the expansion is going very well. And by the end of this year, we're going to have a full mining fleet on-site and operational. 
Very fortunately, we were able to complete the clearing on the grinding building before the onset of the winter season. And what this has made for us is that we can actually continue work despite of the poor weather conditions and a lot of snow. It's actually [indiscernible](00:52) so far. 
The earthquake in Chile, which hit Chile on the 27th of February did have an impact on the project. Many of our contractors came from Concepcion, which is near to the epicenter of the earthquake. And several of our fabricators were also located there. Fortunately, none of our people were hurt during the earthquake, and there was a brief delay of several weeks of the time. What we've done is we've revised some of our work programs and we remain absolutely confident that the original commissioning data in the 31st of August next year will be achieved. 
Finally, we've commenced with a conceptual study to look at the integration of the two new deposits that we announced last year, Los Sulfatos and San Enrique Monolito into the overall Los Bronces district. That study is due for completion at the end of next year. And I've got no doubt that this project that we own now won't be the last of the Los Bronces project.  I think this is a very exciting district with huge potential. Thank you, Cynthia."

Kolomela is our open iron ore project in South Africa and is on track for the second quarter startup in 2012. We will produce 9 million tons of low-cost high-quality iron ore a year, and there's potential for further expansion from there. Which takes us to Minas Rio, our 26.5 million ton per annum iron ore project in Brazil. Progress continues to be well executed on those areas of the project where we have secured the necessary approvals from the Brazilian authorities. The development of the Port of Acu is ahead of schedule. Our land access for the pipeline has increased significantly from 54% at the start of this year to 84% today, and the installation of pipeline from the mine site to the port is underway. 
However, a number of key approvals remain outstanding. Principally, the award of the second part of the installation license, which would allow us to begin construction of the beneficiation plant, the land clearance permit for the section of the pipeline and land access for certain areas around the mind and at specific sections along the pipeline route. 
It is clear that the environmental permitting processes and standards in Brazil have become increasingly rigorous and more complex in recent years. But I can assure you that we have considerable resource, more than 300 people deployed to resolve these delays, and we are in regular constructive high-level dialogue with the local and federal government officials and authorities in Brazil. 
Given the stage of development that the project has reached, the grant of the approvals does affect the critical path of the project towards the delivery of first ore. On the basis of where we are today, we estimate that from the date of securing the remaining initial approval, it should take between 27 and 30 months to construct and commission the mine and the plant, complete the project and deliver first ore on ship. And due to the inherent uncertainty around the timing of these key licenses and permits, it is not possible at this stage to forecast an accurate final capital expenditure figure for the project. 
However, we do expect that there will be an increase in cost to the project relating to changes in scope and licensing conditions representing $210 million. In addition, based on the range of potential outcomes, and in order to give us a complete picture as possible, we currently estimate that on the basis of initial approvals being awarded within a nine-month period from this last June, increased schedule related cost to the project will be incurred, equivalent to a quarterly amount of approximately $180 million. And as further clarity on licensing is achieved, we will update you on the capital expenditure figure and the final completion date.
In terms of the Port of Acu, negotiations are currently underway with our port partner, LLX, to secure a long-term competitive tariff structure, which incorporates both the first phase, as well as the expansion of the project. And this is likely to lead to the restructuring of the capital position in respect to the port.
Turning to our strategy. We have a unique and well-balanced core mining portfolio across precious base in both commodities, with favorable positioning in the lower half of the cost curve for the majority of our production. 
Our divestments of non-core businesses are well underway. Our four major strategic growth projects will increase production by over 1/3 starting early next year, and we are targeting further growth in the most attractive commodities with large-scale met coal and copper projects set for approval this year and next. 
We've embedded our cost management and productivity culture in the group, and we are well on track to deliver into our Asset Optimisation and Procurement targets. The balance sheet is strengthened with a significant increase in cash flow from 2012, and our new organizational structure and management model has created a more effective and focused business. Now let me say a few words about the macro environment.
Recent economic data has indicated that we are seeing some slowdown in activity. For instance, the manufacturer PMI survey shows some softening in industrial activity, both in the United States as well as China, as you can see from this chart. But this looks like a fairly typical cyclical pattern. And after the bounce from a recession, we tend to see a period of softer growth as the positive effects of the inventory cycle and policy stimulus start to fade. And this is what we think we are seeing right now, and this should continue into the second half of the year. And while acknowledging the risk, we see no fundamental evidence for a more severe double dip in the world economy. 
We expect solid growth in 2011 and a robust pace over the following few years. The major emerging economies will continue to drive world growth. In China, growth should average around 8.5% to 9% a year. India and Brazil should also continue to grow strongly, and there are signs that inflation is moderating in these economies and strong capital inflows are boosting their currencies. And this means that policy makers should be able to keep policy loose enough to sustain the recovery. 
So we expect continued recovery in the industrial economies. The growth is likely to be restrained by the persistent effects of the financial crisis and some fiscal tightening particularly in Europe. In the longer term, the fundamental picture for commodity demand remains very positive. Urbanization and industrialization particularly in China and India should continue to drive strong demand growth for our major commodities. And in addition, rising household incomes and wealth should stimulate a more dynamic consumer culture which should support demand for Platinum in particular.
First half 2010 auto sales increased significantly compared to 2009 levels in major markets. Auto production consensus forecast expect world auto production to return to 2008 levels in 2010, led by China. Diesel production is expected to return to 2008 levels in 2011. And jewelry demand in China is down from the high levels achieved in 2009 when there was restocking as prices were low, but we expect the demand outlook to remain very strong.
And finally, major markets continue to see growth from 2009 levels as economic conditions have improved. So there's been a modest decline in global crude steel production in June of 4.6%, but the demand growth outlook remains positive. And the spot price for iron ore has recovered by 15.7% over the last two weeks.
So to sum up, you've heard this morning that a strong recovery is seen in our earnings. We've reinstated our dividend. We are seeing further results of a real turnaround in platinum and in diamonds. The sale of our non-core assets is already announced, will strengthen the balance sheet by some $2.2 billion. We've embedded a cost management and productivity culture, and we're on track to deliver against our $2 billion value creation objective through Asset Optimisation and Procurement. 
Barro Alto, Los Bronces and Kolomela are all on schedule and on budget. And at Minas Rio we've made good progress on the elements of the project that are within our control, and we have considerable resource deployed to progress the issues that are beyond our control. And there's clear evidence in support of our view that the medium-term outlook is positive.
We have a clear strategy. We've set a clear goal when we said we wanted Anglo American to be the investment, the partner and the employer of choice in the mining industry, and in short, for Anglo American to be the leading global mining company. I believe that we are continuing to make great strides towards that goal through our operational excellence of world-class assets in the most attractive commodities. So thank you very much for your attention and we'll now take questions."

What does this mean? That means, and we haven't yet declared the earnings with respect to the period of March to June of this year but it represents $53 billion of benefit to Kumba and a further $97 million through the rest of the year.

I would say that we've done extremely well thus far in terms of securing our permits and licenses in Brazil on this project. I think we can claim that -- we can suggest to claim that we have outperformed everybody else in the industry with respect to this. We've secured 23 out of the 33 critical licenses over the last couple of years. As I mentioned earlier, the pipeline access has increased from 54% in total -- access to land increased from 54% of the total to 84% today. Earthworks on Spread 3, which represents about 1/3 of the pipeline are 92% complete and the port is ahead of schedule. We built the entire bridge of 2.7 kilometers. And as I highlighted a minute ago, there are key approvals that are outstanding, but we also are fully engaged and pushing and understand that process very, very well. So we continue with confidence and awareness at the same time. To your question about a stake sale or bringing in a partner, it's always an option. We've actually completed a third-party review just to validate where we are, and based on our internal view with the project, and we are very much in line with the outcome of that review. So that gave us a lot of comfort in terms of our approach. We have been approached by many parties who have expressed interest in taking a stake and we will continue to look at all options. And I think that it is obviously an option for us but we're not in any hurry to bring in a partner. We think that we've got the capability internally to drive the project forward. And your question about [indiscernible](6:30) are concerned about steel plant, we did consider this in a significant way as we were thinking about the -- where's my good friend Chris -- thinking about the appropriate pricing level for the Mitel. Saldana is the asset or the operation in question and at risk. And we believe quite firmly that at $50 per ton, they're economically whole and strong. So we think that it's best of all worlds for both parties."

I mean, cost, as I also mentioned, have come down by 7% year-on-year in local currency terms. They've had record production. They've been moving equipment out of their thermal coal asset base into their met coal assets in order to capitalize on the higher demand and the higher prices of metallurgical coal.

Some 11 months ago after joining Anglo American, I visited many of our major shareholders and tabled a clear set of strategic priorities that the board and the management intended to pursue. Under Cynthia Carroll's leadership, management focus on delivering these priorities has been consistent and unwavering. As a result, there's been considerable success in value creation and since she will be giving you more details on our achievements and progress later. 
Just to say something about the Board. The Board with three new non-executive directors, with the recruitment process for a fourth underway, is performing in a cohesive way and is challenging up management in the way that it should. The contributions from the general management committee members who now regularly attend the board have added further value to our debates. I'm now satisfied that the width and relevance of skill sets have created a Board fit for purpose. The changes have also strengthened the important work done on committees including the sustainability of our business and the critical protection of our corporate reputation.
The completion of our major corporate reorganization has been executed superbly and on time. This has changed the dynamics and changed the transparency of decision-making, along with clear lines of communication, and importantly, accountability. The board witnessed this at firsthand during our recent two-day strategy session when the Executive Committee joined us providing significant and valuable involvement. We will also speak today about our disposal program being on track and creating significant value from the agreed sales of our non-core assets, as well as our continuing success with asset optimization and international procurement.
You will hear shortly too about the excellent progress we are making on both timing and CapEx on three of our major projects at Barro Alto, nickel; Los Bronces, copper; Kolomela, iron ore. And collectively, these new business streams will contribute significantly to earnings and cash flow from 2011 onwards. And as you know, some three years ago, the board took a decision to invest in the Minas Rio iron ore project, which represents the development of one of the world's largest iron ore bodies. However, this is not without challenges and one that the board is following very closely. 
We're making good progress on the areas that are within our control. But in reality, the timing of first ore is largely dependent upon the completion of the licensing process that lies on the critical path. This is receiving maximum attention and we're using every available resource to expedite the process. 
Elsewhere across the group, I'm greatly encouraged by the united drive and focus being displayed by the Executives on all fronts, and this is reflected in today's financial results including the improved operating performance, cash generation and the resultant strengthening of our balance sheet, which René will discuss with you shortly.
All this progress has given the Board confidence to reinstate the dividend earlier than we anticipated given the importance we as a Board have attached to that commitment. It is therefore proposed to pay $0.25 per share at the half year and to move progressively thereafter. I will now hand over to Cynthia."

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and it's very good to see you again here this morning, and thank you for joining us. We've had a strong performance for the first half of 2010 and I'm first going to take you through our operational review. René will then talk about our financials and then we'll update you on the major growth projects.
I'll start with the highlights. We've had very good numbers to report for the first half. There's been strong recovery in earnings. Group operating profit is $4.4 billion. EBITDA is $5.4 billion and the underlying earnings per share is $1.84. We've seen further benefits from the operational turnaround in platinum and diamonds, and I'll comment on each of the businesses in a moment. 
Our early success in Asset Optimization and Procurement has continued. We said we wanted to fund $2 billion of uplift from these initiatives by 2011. Well, in just the first six months of this year, we have achieved a run rate of $1 billion from our core businesses. 
As for the four near-term growth projects, the Barro Alto nickel project in Brazil is on track and we expect first production early 2011. The Los Bronces copper expansion project in Chile and the Kolomela iron ore project in South Africa are both on schedule and progressing very well. And we have made good progress at the Minas Rio iron ore project in Brazil in the face of a challenging regulatory environment. And I'll talk more about Minas Rio later on. 
You'll remember that we have focused our group on what we believe to be the most attractive commodities: platinum, copper, iron ore, metallurgical coal, diamonds, nickel and thermal coal. Our divestments of our non-core assets are going very well. $1.3 billion for our Zinc business, $500 million for certain undeveloped coal assets in Australia and over $400 million for several of Tarmac's European aggregates and concretes products businesses. Those sales will further strengthen the balance sheet by some $2.2 billion this year. And as the Chairman highlighted, we are reinstating the dividend. This reflects our improved operating performance and financial position, the progress we've made on our divestment program and a supportive medium-term outlook. The interim dividend is $0.25 per share.
So turning to safety. We are continuing to drive further improvements in our safety performance, and I believe we have actually taken the lead in the industry. We're showing that when you make safety a priority, you can make a real difference. 95% of our sites operated without fatalities in the first half of this year. We've seen a 38% reduction against the same period in 2009 and 71% reduction since 2007. Lost time injuries continue to decrease with a 30% improvement over the first half of last year. There's some way to go and I'm not settling for anything less than having no fatalities. But we are heading in the right direction. 
Our people understand what we mean when we say about safety. The governments and the trade unions with which we work understand that we are serious about it. And we believe the fact that safety matters to us and the reductions of injuries is a clear demonstration of this benefits the morale and the culture of the business. It furthers our relationships with our partners and underpins the big steps we are taking in improving productivity.
Now let's look at some of the detail behind the business highlights. Starting with our performance in Platinum. This is a key business that we needed to turn around, and we have. We've seen a considerable transformation and there's evidence of continuing improvement, particularly in productivity as we drive the business into the lower half of the cost curve. Our operating profit for the first half was $418 million. 
On safety, we've seen lost time injury frequency rates decreased by 16% and we've maintained tight control of operating cash unit costs despite labor inflation of 10% and a rise in electricity prices of 25%. This year, we're seeing the full benefit of the reduction of labor complement in 2009. We are constantly working on upgrading the efficiency and the productivity of our mine plants, infrastructure and equipment with clear results, yielding a 27% increase in our productivity since the start of 2008. And in addition, as you will have seen last week, we received letters of conversion of our mineral rights from the Department of Mineral Resources, and we are now executing those conversions.
There's a similarly good picture in copper and nickel. On copper, I want to highlight that we have doubled our operating profit to $1.2 billion. We've maintained production in line with the first half of last year despite operational issues in Mantos Blancos and industrial auction at Collahuasi, and we've maintained our per unit cost at $1.04 per pound against the market price of $3.23 per pound in the period. 
At Collahuasi, an expansion project to increase sulfide processing capacity to 150,000 tons per day by early 2011 continues. Collahuasi has also just announced a 40% increase in its copper reserves and resources more than 2 billion tons, bringing the total to 7.1 billion tons at 0.82% copper. And a conceptual study is underway to evaluate the next phases of expansion at Collahuasi that would ultimately increase production to at least 1 million tons of copper per annum. And we expect to complete this study in the first quarter of 2011.  And we will seek Board approval this year for the  Quellaveco project, our exciting greenfield 225,000 ton per annum copper opportunity in Peru. 
As for Nickel, you see here a turnaround in operating profit with $68 million in the first half. The Barro Alto project is 94% complete and we will soon see a step change in our Nickel business unit production more than double when this project ramps up to its full 41,000 tons per year over the first five years. And work on the conceptual study for Jacare, also in Brazil, has begun and a pre-feasibility study for Morro Sem Bone will begin in the second half of the year.
In our Iron Ore and Manganese businesses, we've seen a very healthy increase in operating profit, up by 126% to $1.6 billion. Production at Kumba Sishen mine is up 17% year-on-year to 21.1 million tons. And cash cost are marginally lower and productivity has improved, offsetting increased waste volumes, which were up 23%. However, we are forecasting a 15% increase in unit cost for the full year to account for the planned higher stripping ratios. 
In Met Coal, we delivered an operating profit of $263 million. They were very heavy rains in Queensland in the first quarter, but our business still achieved record sales of 14.8 million tons, thanks to efficient stock management and asset rotation. In local currency terms, our FOB costs were down 7%, though this was more than offset by the Australian dollar which strengthened by 25% compared to the first half of 2009. 
Grosvenor, our Met Coal project in Queensland, Australia, is our second project that is set for Board approval and we expect that to be next year. It sits in the lower half of the cost curve and we envision a single longwall initially, with production reaching about 4.3 million tons a year of hard coking coal. And we see the potential to double this production with a second longwall.
Our Thermal Coal profit is $351 million. Here too production was affected by unusually heavy second quarter rains in South Africa and challenging geological conditions, but we're still seeing resilient prices in export Thermal Coal and good demand from India. Cerrejon is performing well, with unit cost down 10%, though operating profit was affected by the lower mid-Atlantic coal prices. 
In Diamonds, we recorded a big increase in volume from 6.6 million carats to 15.4 million carats, and operating profit of $261 million. That is a reflection of the market recovery and the significant cost savings that have been embedded in De Beers. We achieved sales of $2.6 billion, up 84% on the same half year.
So with respect to our operations, there is a very positive picture across our seven core commodity businesses. Now let's look at the work that we're doing around Asset Optimization and Procurement. 
You'll remember in February that we set an increased target of $2 billion of uplift from just our core businesses by the end of 2011, and the graph here shows how we are well ahead of expectations with a run rate for the first six months of this year of $1 billion from core businesses and $1.2 billion in total. So that's where we are on the operating performance for the first half. 
Now I'll hand over to René to cover the financials."
409115,109965347,77371,"Anglo American plc, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2010",2010-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Good morning, everybody. Thank you, Cynthia.

Thank you, Cynthia. A very strong set of financial results as you will see over the next two slides, so supporting the redemption of the dividend of 13% up to $4.4 billion, I will go over next two slides to the expansion in term of the key movement in operating profit. Effective tax rate similar to last year at 31.8%. We have the benefits in the first half of project settlement in South Africa. For the full year, we're expecting a tax rate of 33%. Net debt down to $10.9 billion is a factor to expect to consider the divestments that we have announced on a pro forma basis, the level of debt is down to $9 billion.
Turning to the operating cost sheet, we had a full significant positive cost volumes of $2.6 billion. $800 million due to platinum, $800 million due to iron ore and $700 million due to copper. Exchange, $643 million negative FX volumes, $400 million due to the strengthening of the rand, $200 million through the Aussie dollar.
Inflation, $270 million, we have seen a slowdown in the level of inflation including South Africa with an inflation rate forced us again in the first half below 6%. Volume, positive volumes of $219 million, predominantly in metallurgical coal and iron ore. Remember that this volume variance is calculated using last year commodity prices so it's somewhat underestimated. Cash cost down 1%. As you will see when I go through the detail due to a 2% decline in comparable growth. Due to the impact of turnaround at De Beers, De Beers contributed $261 million to the group operating cost sheet this year compared to a breakeven position last year.
Turning first to price volumes and first trade with commodity price volumes. Copper on average is $308, slightly below LME price of $323 due to the mark-to-market adjustment. At end of June, we had 94,000 tons of copper profitably priced at $2.95. Copper, significant increase in the rand basket price above 19,000 rand for the first half this year compared to less than 14,000 rand last year.
Turning to burnt [ph](0:30:35) commodities, $903 million positive volumes. As I mentioned earlier much of the volumes came from the iron ore, $800 million. Significant changes in market practice highlight the key changes on the right-hand side. In the course of thermal coal from South Africa, 35% of the volume was still sold and long-term fixed price contract in the first half of 2010. These contracts are being phased out. And next year, we expect all the volumes sold from South Africa to be sold on a floating index basis. 
Met Coal, 80% of the volumes sold on quantitatively benchmark basis. 10% was committed at the beginning of the year on the annual fixed priced basis and 10% being sold on the spot market. Kumba Iron Ore, 28% of the volume was sold in first half on the spot market especially to China. That involved the normal level that we'd expect between 10% and 15%.
Turning to exchange and production volumes. In the case of exchange volumes I already mentioned, the negative volumes due to the rand, an average exchange rate of 753 in the first half compared to 920 last year. In terms of production volumes, platinum reported a 5% decline in refined production volume. It's all due to the closure of three high cost shaft which contributed 58,000 ounces in the first half of 2009. 
Copper production was flat. Three events impacted the volume of production in the first half. First, the earthquake, which had an impact of 2,000 tons of copper. We had also, at Collahuasi, a nine-day contractor strike which costs us 5,000 tons of production. And we had a failure of the [indiscernible](0:33:03) at Mantos Blancos, which cost us 7,000 tons of copper.
Met Coal, Cynthia mentioned the tremendous performance in Australia, 25% increase in production despite some difficult condition at the beginning of the year. Chemical Coal, down 4% as the projection at Cerrejon in Latin America was basically flat, also decline came from South Africa due to some very heavy rain at the beginning of the year. Iron ore, 17% increase in production. The [indiscernible](0:33:46) plant now is operating at nameplate capacity, 13 million tons a year. And we had a substantial improvement of the yield at the DMS plant in the first half of 2010.
Turning to the cost performance. 2% decline in comparable cost on the back of two initiatives that Cynthia highlighted around Asset Optimization and Procurement, more than offsetting the increase in the non-comparable cost, predominantly electricity in South Africa and in Chile, as well as increase in oil prices, with an average oil price of $80 a barrel in the first half of 2010 compared to a $52 last year. Electricity and fuel represent 8% of the group cost base.
Turning to CapEx and net debt. We are making some tremendous progress on three of the four major projects. That went through, which will be commissioned early 2011. The Los Bronces expansion towards the end of 2011 and Sishen South in 2012. These three projects when they come on stream and achieve full capacity at the currently role of commodity prices, will contribute an additional $2 billion of EBITDA.
On the right hand side, you see the cash flow movements. Operating cash flow of $3.7 billion. That's after a negative movement in working capital of $900 million. $300 million due to some increase in pipeline inventory at Platinum. That will be released during the second half of the year. $600 million increase in debt due to higher commodity prices. We highlight also the impact of the rights issue at Anglo Platinum, 12.5 billion rand rights issue, and contribution to do billion-dollar rights issue by De Beers earlier this year.
Divestment proceeds, not reflected at the end of June debt level. We are expected to receive all these proceeds before the end of the year except for $100 million in Australia. We have also been able to optimize the structure to minimize tax leakage. And on this overall $2.1 billion of proceeds, we are only expecting $124 million of tax leakage, $84 million associated with the sale in Australia and $40 million associated with the zinc divestment.
My last slide. So in conclusion, a very strong improvement in our financial position. Net debt of $10.9 billion. This number includes $300 million in South Africa. It doesn't include the level of debt in the deals that we don't consolidate, but you see the decline in the level of debt at De Beers from $3.1 billion to $1.5 billion, obviously, the benefit of the rights issue, but also a turnaround at De Beers, with a net cash regeneration of $620 million for the first half of this year.  Thank you."

Turning to our near-term projects, and the first two projects that will come on stream next year, Barro Alto and Los Bronces. Barro Alto is a low-cost large-scale and long-life asset. We're well advanced, 94% complete, and start up is on track for the first quarter of 2011, just six months away.

And I'm proud just to comment on safety, and that's now after 28 million men hours worked. Our lost timing frequency rate is 0.029, of what is a fantastic performance. 
And the projects have achieved now in July, 11 men work hours lost time injury free. And as a comment, Barro Alto was elected this year related to 2009, the best in class for safety in Brazil. It was an election by the very important and technical magazine there. 
In the sustainable development side, we are at Barro Alto, and for the second year in the 20 top companies in Brazil in terms of biodiversity and social responsibility. And in terms of construction, Barro Alto, it's now 8.9% complete. We are now in the commissioning. We have four steps on the commission. And now we are on the last part of the commission, the C4 for discretionary areas. The main power substation has been already energized. And in terms of the main key components, installation of refractory for the kilns and the electrons [ph](0:40:52), we are ready for the first line and it means one month ahead. And then now, our challenge is to focus and then to complete the mechanical production for the lines one and two. That's what will happen on August and November this year. Now and completing these, we are ready for the first metal in December and the first commercial production at the beginning of the year.
We expect a safe, a smooth and a quicker ramp up. And we have a strong commissioning and operating alertness in place and that everything is going well there. And we expect Barro Alto to operate, like Cynthia mentioned, in the first half of the cost curve and work for the next 30 years. The project will deliver 41,000 tons of nickel in the first five years, and the average of 36,000 tons for the next 26 to 30 years production. And Barro Alto at full production will double our production in the next year and we'll increase our production from 26,000 to 62,000 tons of nickel."

Let me start by saying that when this project is actually commissioned, Los Bronces is going to be producing up to 490,000 tons of copper per year, which is going to make Los Bronces the fifth-largest copper mine in the world. 
During this year, we've been significantly ramping up the work rates on the project, and right now, we actually have 11,000 people working on site. And we have accumulated today 22 million work hours. 
On the mining side, the preparation of the mine for the expansion is going very well. And by the end of this year, we're going to have a full mining fleet on-site and operational. 
Very fortunately, we were able to complete the clearing on the grinding building before the onset of the winter season. And what this has meant for us is that we can actually continue work despite of the poor weather conditions and a lot of snow. It's actually [indiscernible](00:52) so far. 
The earthquake in Chile, which hit Chile on the 27th of February did have an impact on the project. Many of our contractors came from Concepcion, which is near to the epicenter of the earthquake. And several of our fabricators were also located there. Fortunately, none of our people were hurt during the earthquake, and there was a brief delay of several weeks of the time. What we've done is we've revised some of our work programs and we remain absolutely confident that the original commissioning data in the 31st of August next year will be achieved. 
Finally, we've commenced with a conceptual study to look into the integration of the two new deposits that we announced last year, Los Sulfatos and San Enrique Monolito into the overall Los Bronces district. That study is due for completion at the end of next year. And I've got no doubt that this project that we own now won't be the last of the Los Bronces project.  I think this is a very exciting district with huge potential. Thank you, Cynthia."

Kolomela is our open iron ore project in South Africa and is on track for the second quarter startup in 2012. We will produce 9 million tons of low-cost high-quality iron ore a year, and there's potential for further expansion from there. Which takes us to Minas Rio, our 26.5 million ton per annum iron ore project in Brazil. Progress continues to be well executed on those areas of the project where we have secured the necessary approvals from the Brazilian authorities. The development of the Port of Acu is ahead of schedule. Our land access for the pipeline has increased significantly from 54% at the start of this year to 84% today, and the installation of pipeline from the mine site to the port is underway. 
However, a number of key approvals remain outstanding. Principally, the award of the second part of the installation license, which would allow us to begin construction of the beneficiation plant, the land clearance permit for the section of the pipeline and land access for certain areas around the mine and at specific sections along the pipeline route. 
It is clear that the environmental permitting processes and standards in Brazil have become increasingly rigorous and more complex in recent years. But I can assure you that we have considerable resource, more than 300 people deployed to resolve these delays, and we are in regular constructive high-level dialogue with the local and federal government officials and authorities in Brazil. 
Given the stage of development that the project has reached, the grant of the approvals does affect the critical path of the project towards the delivery of first ore. On the basis of where we are today, we estimate that from the date of securing the remaining initial approval, it should take between 27 and 30 months to construct and commission the mine and the plant, complete the project and deliver first ore on ship. And due to the inherent uncertainty around the timing of these key licenses and permits, it is not possible at this stage to forecast an accurate final capital expenditure figure for the project. 
However, we do expect that there will be an increase in cost to the project relating to changes in scope and licensing conditions representing $210 million. In addition, based on the range of potential outcomes, and in order to give us a complete picture as possible, we currently estimate that on the basis of initial approvals being awarded within a nine-month period from this last June, increased schedule related cost to the project will be incurred, equivalent to a quarterly amount of approximately $180 million. And as further clarity on licensing is achieved, we will update you on the capital expenditure figure and the final completion date.
In terms of the Port of Acu, negotiations are currently underway with our port partner, LLX, to secure a long-term competitive tariff structure, which incorporates both the first phase, as well as the expansion of the project. And this is likely to lead to the restructuring of the capital position in respect to the port.
Turning to our strategy. We have a unique and well-balanced core mining portfolio across precious base in both commodities, with favorable positioning in the lower half of the cost curve for the majority of our production. 
Our divestments of non-core businesses are well underway. Our four major strategic growth projects will increase production by over 1/3 starting early next year, and we are targeting further growth in the most attractive commodities with large-scale met coal and copper projects set for approval this year and next. 
We've embedded our cost management and productivity culture in the group, and we are well on track to deliver into our Asset Optimization and Procurement targets. The balance sheet is strengthened with a significant increase in cash flow from 2012, and our new organizational structure and management model has created a more effective and focused business. Now let me say a few words about the macro environment.
Recent economic data has indicated that we are seeing some slowdown in activity. For instance, the manufacturer PMI survey shows some softening in industrial activity, both in the United States as well as China, as you can see from this chart. But this looks like a fairly typical cyclical pattern. And after the bounce from the recession, we tend to see a period of softer growth as the positive effects of the inventory cycle and policy stimulus start to fade. And this is what we think we are seeing right now, and this should continue into the second half of the year. And while acknowledging the risk, we see no fundamental evidence for a more severe double dip in the world economy. 
We expect solid growth in 2011 and a robust pace over the following few years. The major emerging economies will continue to drive world growth. In China, growth should average around 8.5% to 9% a year. India and Brazil should also continue to grow strongly, and there are signs that inflation is moderating in these economies and strong capital inflows are boosting their currencies. And this means that policy makers should be able to keep policy loose enough to sustain the recovery. 
So we expect continued recovery in the industrial economies. The growth is likely to be restrained by the persistent effects of the financial crisis and some fiscal tightening particularly in Europe. In the longer term, the fundamental picture for commodity demand remains very positive. Urbanization and industrialization particularly in China and India should continue to drive strong demand growth for our major commodities. And in addition, rising household incomes and wealth should stimulate a more dynamic consumer culture which should support demand for Platinum in particular.
First half 2010 auto sales increased significantly compared to 2009 levels in major markets. Auto production consensus forecast expect world auto production to return to 2008 levels in 2010, led by China. Diesel production is expected to return to 2008 levels in 2011. And jewelry demand in China is down from the high levels achieved in 2009 when there was restocking as prices were low, but we expect the demand outlook to remain very strong.
And finally, major markets continue to see growth from 2009 levels as economic conditions have improved. So there's been a modest decline in global crude steel production in June of 4.6%, but the demand growth outlook remains positive. And the spot price for iron ore has recovered by 15.7% over the last two weeks.
So to sum up, you've heard this morning that a strong recovery is seen in our earnings. We've reinstated our dividend. We are seeing further results of a real turnaround in platinum and in diamonds. The sale of our non-core assets is already announced, will strengthen the balance sheet by some $2.2 billion. We've embedded a cost management and productivity culture, and we're on track to deliver against our $2 billion value creation objective through Asset Optimization and Procurement. 
Barro Alto, Los Bronces and Kolomela are all on schedule and on budget. And at Minas Rio we've made good progress on the elements of the project that are within our control, and we have considerable resource deployed to progress the issues that are beyond our control. And there's clear evidence in support of our view that the medium-term outlook is positive.
We have a clear strategy. We've set a clear goal when we said we wanted Anglo American to be the investment, the partner and the employer of choice in the mining industry, and in short, for Anglo American to be the leading global mining company. I believe that we are continuing to make great strides towards that goal through our operational excellence of world-class assets in the most attractive commodities. So thank you very much for your attention and we'll now take questions."

Firstly, can you just say how confident you are that you will get these licenses through in the next nine month? And then how likely it could be that the start date of Minas Rio gets pushed back further into 2014? And then secondly, nothing was mentioned on potential stake sale, is this something being considered? And then finally, on AMSA, Mitel have been saying they're considering shutting the steel plants. So they are trying to play hardball here. Is this something that concerns you and would you consider some sort of compromise with them?"

I would say that we've done extremely well thus far in terms of securing our permits and licenses in Brazil on this project. I think we can claim that -- we can suggest to claim that we have outperformed everybody else in the industry with respect to this. We've secured 23 out of the 33 critical licenses over the last couple of years. As I mentioned earlier, the pipeline access has increased from 54% in total -- access to land increased from 54% of the total to 84% today. Earthworks on Spread 3, which represents about 1/3 of the pipeline are 92% complete and the port is ahead of schedule. We built the entire bridge of 2.7 kilometers. And as I highlighted a minute ago, there are key approvals that are outstanding, but we also are fully engaged and pushing and understand that process very, very well. So we continue with confidence and awareness at the same time. To your question about a stake sale or bringing in a partner, it's always an option. We've actually completed a third-party review just to validate where we are, and based on our internal view with the project, and we are very much in line with the outcome of that review. So that gave us a lot of comfort in terms of our approach. We have been approached by many parties who have expressed interest in taking a stake and we will continue to look at all options. And I think that it is obviously an option for us but we're not in any hurry to bring in a partner. We think that we've got the capability internally to drive the project forward. And your question about AMSA are concerned about steel plant, we did consider this in a significant way as we were thinking about the -- where's my good friend Chris -- thinking about the appropriate pricing level for the Mitel. Saldana is the asset or the operation in question and at risk. And we believe quite firmly that at $50 per ton, they're economically whole and strong. So we think that it's best of all worlds for both parties."

If you could just talk us through the cost and is this a one-off or is it business as usual? My second question would be on, can you just elaborate a little bit on the renegotiation on tariffs at the port with LLX. I must say I was under the impression that those were all secured. And the third question is, if you could just elaborate again on the dividend. You mentioned it's progressive. Is it progressive on a half-year basis or on a full-year basis? Just a little bit of detail around that."

We have not locked into port tariff and we've been conscious of the fact that we needed to get on with the negotiation on the port tariff. We are looking for a long term competitively priced tariff. And we are also not just looking for the first phase of the project but also the expansion of that project. So that's what we're working on locking in as we speak. I can't comment any further on that, given the fact that we are right now in negotiation. And your last question about Met Coal. I mean, Met Coal, as I mentioned, the Australian dollar has increased hugely by 25% in the first half of this year. I mean, cost, as I also mentioned, have come down by 7% year-on-year in local currency terms. They've had record production. They've been moving equipment out of their Thermal Coal asset base into their Met Coal assets in order to capitalize on the higher demand and the higher prices of metallurgical coal. And I think the productivity keeps coming up and up. Last year, they increased by 24%. This year, it's up by 15%. And they keep driving very, very hard. Seamus, I'll turn to you and invite you to make any further comments."

In terms of Minas Rio, do you think there is potential risk to further delays under the new government with the new president? Secondly, following on port issue, I appreciate that there is limited things you can say there. But is the desire to maintain Minas Rio in the first quarter of the cost curve, hence trying to maintain port tariff and cost around $8 a ton and whether or not you can sort of provide any guidance whether or not the port tariff in cost is based off CapEx that was the original amount or whether or not it's an inflated CapEx announced post the CapEx increase back in December?
