Currently, 12 months free cash flow grew 114% to $2.92 billion. Return on invested capital was 66% up from 41%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends.The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 461 million shares compared with 446 million. Worldwide revenue grew 42% to $9.52 billion or 37% excluding the $354 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, fast selection and free shifting offers including Amazon Prime. Media revenue increased to $4.68 billion, up 29% or 23% excluding foreign exchange rates.EGM revenue increased to $4.61 billion, up 60% or 54% excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 48% worldwide sales, up from 43%. Worldwide unit growth was 37%. Active customer accounts exceeded 105 million, up 19%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 1.9 million, up 24%. Cellar units were 28% of total unit.  Worldwide gross profit was $1.98 billion, up 47%. Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing technology and content and G&A combined was $1.3 billion or 14.5% of sales, down 25 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $733 million or 7.7% of revenue, compared with 7.9%. Tech and content was $297 million or 3.1% of revenue compared with 3.5%. Marketing was $269 million or 2.8% of revenue, up from 2.5% in the prior year.Now I'll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 36% to $4.96 billion. Zappos, which is included in our results beginning November 1, 2009 contributed approximately $200 million to our fourth quarter revenue. Media revenue grew 20% to $2.1 billion. EGM revenue grew 54% to $2.66 billion, representing 54% of North America revenues up from 48%. North America gross profit grew 50% to $1.17 billion and gross margin increased 211 basis points to 23.6% driven by increases in other revenue, improvements in inventory management, including vendor pricing and increases in 3P product sales, partially offset by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix.North America segment operating income increased 113% to $278 million or 5.6% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 49% to $4.56 billion. Revenue growth was 37% adjusting for the $344 million year-over-year favorable impact from foreign exchange rates during the quarter. Media revenue grew 37% to $2.58 billion or 26% excluding FX. And EGM revenue grew 68% to $1.95 billion or 56% excluding FX. EGM now represents 43% of international revenues, up from 38%.International gross profit grew 42% to $806 million or grew 31% excluding FX, while gross margin decreased 79 basis points to 17.7%, driven by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix, partially offset by improvements in inventory management including vendor pricing and the increases in 3P product sales. International segment operating income increased 39% to $319 million, a 7% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, International segment operating income increased 25%.Consolidated segment operating income grew 66% to $597 million or 6.3% of revenue, up 91 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $31 million favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, CSOI grew 58%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 75% to $476 million or 5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $85 million in Q4 or an 18% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $384 million or $0.85 per diluted share, compared with $225 million in $0.52 per diluted share. Now I'll discuss full year results. Revenue grew 28% to $24.51 billion or 29% excluding the $182 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. North America revenue grew 25% to $12.83 billion and international grew 31% to $11.68 billion or 33% growth, excluding year-over-year changes in FX.Consolidated segment operating income for CSOI grew 44% to $1.57 billion, or 48% excluding $40 million of unfavorable year-over-year impact of foreign exchange rates. And operating margin increased 71 basis points to 6.4%. GAAP operating income grew 34% to $1.13 billion or 4.6% of net sales. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.64 billion year-over-year to $6.37 billion. Our cash marketable securities primarily consists of cash, government and government agency securities, AAA rated money market funds and other investment grade securities. Such amounts recorded at fair value.In January 2010, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $2 billion of our common stock, replacing our previous share repurchase program. Inventory increased 35% to $2.17 billion and inventory turns were 12.2 unchanged from a year ago, even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.Accounts payable increased 56% to $5.61 billion and accounts payable days increased to 68 days from 62 in the prior year. Our 2009 capital expenditures were $373 million. While we were not providing CapEx guidance on today's call, we want to remind you that we're beginning the transition to our new Seattle offices this year. We will incur incremental CapEx of approximately $100 million in 2010 in support of this multi-year project.I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen today and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainties surrounding the exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It is not possible to actually predict demand. And therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that the foreign exchange rates remained approximately where they've been recently.We are prospectively adopting Accounting Standard Update No. 2009-13 revenue recognition multiple delivery revenue arrangements as of January 1, 2010. Sales of our Kindle e-reader are considered  arrangements with multiple elements which include the device, wireless connectivity and software upgrades. The revenue related to the device, which is the substantial portion of the total sales price in related cost will be recognized at the time of delivery. Revenue for the wireless connectivity and the software upgrades will be continued to be amortized over the life of the device, which remains estimated at two years.The impact of the adoption of this standard is included in the first quarter of 2010 guidance. For Q1, we expect net sales of between $6.45 billion and $7 billion, a growth of between 32% and 43%. This guidance anticipates approximately 500 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income will be between $275 million and $365 million or grow between 13% and 50%. This includes approximately $110 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $385 million and $475 million, a growth of between 20% and 48%. We remained heads down focused on driving better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks and with that Rob, let's move to questions."

And so those are the things that we're going to continue to focus on, as well as other things to try to grow that particular category. As it relates to the Kindle change, we have provided some information in the 10-K. Essentially, the way you should think about guidance is certainly, the change is effective '11, so it's included on our Q1 guidance. So for the units that we sell, a substantial portion of the price times those units can be reflected in our revenue. In addition to that, we have approximately $500 million of deferred revenue from shipments from last year that we amortized between 2010 and 2011. So a portion of that $500 million will also be in Q1."

Certainly, we had a nice increase in other revenue, which includes the Warp Services business or service business [ph], as well as other agreements that go into that line item. Inventory management, we're getting better at inventory management which also flows into our operating results as well. We're getting better prices from suppliers and partners. We had good third-party sales. So those are the key contributors partially offsetting that, we certainly get lower prices during the quarter. So those are really the drivers for gross margin. In terms of how we're thinking about in the digital and physical within media, we think we're positioned very nicely from a digital perspective. We have obviously, have some longer standing relationships with many, many different partners around the world in those particular categories. We think we're focused on the customer. And I think when you look at Kindle, that's certainly a good example of that. We think we've built a very nice book purpose device, that's purpose built for reading.

ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends.The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 461 million shares compared with 446 million. Worldwide revenue grew 42% to $9.52 billion or 37% excluding the $354 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, fast selection and free shifting offers including Amazon Prime.

Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 1.9 million, up 24%. Cellar units were 28% of total unit.  Worldwide gross profit was $1.98 billion, up 47%. Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing technology and content and G&A combined was $1.3 billion or 14.5% of sales, down 25 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $733 million or 7.7% of revenue, compared with 7.9%. Tech and content was $297 million or 3.1% of revenue compared with 3.5%. Marketing was $269 million or 2.8% of revenue, up from 2.5% in the prior year.Now I'll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 36% to $4.96 billion. Zappos, which is included in our results beginning November 1, 2009 contributed approximately $200 million to our fourth quarter revenue. Media revenue grew 20% to $2.1 billion. EGM revenue grew 54% to $2.66 billion, representing 54% of North America revenues up from 48%. North America gross profit grew 50% to $1.17 billion and gross margin increased 211 basis points to 23.6% driven by increases in other revenue, improvements in inventory management, including vendor pricing and increases in 3P product sales, partially offset by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix.North America segment operating income increased 113% to $278 million or 5.6% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 49% to $4.56 billion. Revenue growth was 37% adjusting for the $344 million year-over-year favorable impact from foreign exchange rates during the quarter. Media revenue grew 37% to $2.58 billion or 26% excluding FX. And EGM revenue grew 68% to $1.95 billion or 56% excluding FX. EGM now represents 43% of international revenues, up from 38%.International gross profit grew 42% to $806 million or grew 31% excluding FX, while gross margin decreased 79 basis points to 17.7%, driven by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix, partially offset by improvements in inventory management including vendor pricing and the increases in 3P product sales. International segment operating income increased 39% to $319 million, a 7% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, International segment operating income increased 25%.Consolidated segment operating income grew 66% to $597 million or 6.3% of revenue, up 91 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $31 million favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, CSOI grew 58%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 75% to $476 million or 5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $85 million in Q4 or an 18% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $384 million or $0.85 per diluted share, compared with $225 million in $0.52 per diluted share. Now I'll discuss full year results. Revenue grew 28% to $24.51 billion or 29% excluding the $182 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. North America revenue grew 25% to $12.83 billion and international grew 31% to $11.68 billion or 33% growth, excluding year-over-year changes in FX.Consolidated segment operating income for CSOI grew 44% to $1.57 billion, or 48% excluding $40 million of unfavorable year-over-year impact of foreign exchange rates. And operating margin increased 71 basis points to 6.4%. GAAP operating income grew 34% to $1.13 billion or 4.6% of net sales. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.64 billion year-over-year to $6.37 billion. Our cash marketable securities primarily consists of cash, government and government agency securities, AAA rated money market funds and other investment grade securities. Such amounts recorded at fair value.In January 2010, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $2 billion of our common stock, replacing our previous share repurchase program. Inventory increased 35% to $2.17 billion and inventory turns were 12.2 unchanged from a year ago, even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.Accounts payable increased 56% to $5.61 billion and accounts payable days increased to 68 days from 62 in the prior year. Our 2009 capital expenditures were $373 million. While we were not providing CapEx guidance on today's call, we want to remind you that we're beginning the transition to our new Seattle offices this year. We will incur incremental CapEx of approximately $100 million in 2010 in support of this multi-year project.I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen today and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainties surrounding the exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It is not possible to actually predict demand. And therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that the foreign exchange rates remained approximately where they've been recently.We are prospectively adopting Accounting Standard Update No. 2009-13 revenue recognition multiple delivery revenue arrangements as of January 1, 2010. Sales of our Kindle e-reader are considered  arrangements with multiple elements which include the device, wireless connectivity and software upgrades. The revenue related to the device, which is the substantial portion of the total sales price in related cost will be recognized at the time of delivery. Revenue for the wireless connectivity and the software upgrades will be continued to be amortized over the life of the device, which remains estimated at two years.The impact of the adoption of this standard is included in the first quarter of 2010 guidance. For Q1, we expect net sales of between $6.45 billion and $7 billion, a growth of between 32% and 43%. This guidance anticipates approximately 500 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income will be between $275 million and $365 million or grow between 13% and 50%. This includes approximately $110 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $385 million and $475 million, a growth of between 20% and 48%. We remained heads down focused on driving better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks and with that Rob, let's move to questions."

So for the units that we sell, a substantial portion of the price times those units can be reflected in our revenue. In addition to that, we have approximately $500 million of deferred revenue from shipments from last year that we amortized between 2010 and 2011.

It's reflected in the guidance that we gave for Q1. We have released the certainly, previous quarters. You can go back to Q1 of last year, make your own assumptions in terms of growth rate for year-over-year. And certainly, there'd be a range there but you can see that's probably the best way to think about it and look at what you put in for Q1."

Inventory management, we're getting better at inventory management which also flows into our operating results as well. We're getting better prices from suppliers and partners. We had good third-party sales. So those are the key contributors partially offsetting that, we certainly get lower prices during the quarter. So those are really the drivers for gross margin. In terms of how we're thinking about in the digital and physical within media, we think we're positioned very nicely from a digital perspective. We have obviously, have some longer standing relationships with many, many different partners around the world in those particular categories. We think we're focused on the customer. And I think when you look at Kindle, that's certainly a good example of that. We think we've built a very nice book purpose device, that's purpose built for reading. And we believe that readers deserve to have a dedicated device with great selection at great prices. And so those are the things that we've worked on in the 27 months since launch.

ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilitie",1015,"Thanks, Rob. I'll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 62% to $2.32 billion. Return on invested capital was 45% up from 41%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. 
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 463 million shares compared with 447 million. Worldwide revenue grew 46% to $7.13 billion, or 42%, excluding the $185 million favorable impact from the year-over-year changes in the foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage for our low prices, fast selection and free shipping offers including Amazon Prime. 
Media revenue increased to $3.43 billion, up 26%, or 22% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM revenue increased to $3.51 billion, up to 72%, or 68% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 49% of worldwide sales, up from 42%. 
Worldwide unit growth was 40%. Active customer accounts exceeded 114 million. For the first time and this number includes our Amazon China customer accounts. Worldwide active seller accounts were approximately 2 million, up 22%. Seller units were 31% of total units. 
Consolidated gross profit grew 42% to $1.63 billion, and gross margin decreased 62 basis points to 22.9%. We no longer present gross profit in our consolidated statement of operations, as we believe the income from operations is a more meaningful measure due to the diversity of our product categories and services. Our focus is on growing operating profit dollars rather than maximizing margin percentages. 
Now I'll discuss the operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, Tech and Content and G&A combined was $1.12 billion, or a 15.8% of sales, down 115 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $528 million, or 7.4% of revenue compared with 8.3%. Tech and Content was $319 million, or 4.5% of revenue compared with 4.9%. Marketing was $196 million, or 2.7% of revenue, up from 2.5% in the prior year. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation, or other operating expense line items. 
In North America segment, revenue grew 47% to $3.78 billion. Media revenue grew 22% to $1.6 billion. EGM revenue grew 73% to $2.02 billion, representing 54% of North America revenues, up from 45%. 
North America segment operating income increased 81% to $273 million, a 7.2% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 45% to $3.35 billion. Revenue growth was 37%, adjusting for the $175 million year-over-year favorable FX impact during the quarter. 
Media revenue grew 29% to $1.83 billion, or 23% excluding FX. And EGM revenue grew 70% to $1.49 billion, or 61% excluding FX. EGM now represents 44% of International revenues, up from 38%. 
International segment operating income increased 37% to $234 million, a 7% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, International segment operating income increased 26%. CSOI grew 58% to $507 million, or 7.1% of revenue, up 53 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $15 million favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, CSOI grew 53%. 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 62% to $394 million, or 5.5% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $100 million in Q1, or a 25% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $299 million, or $0.66 per diluted share compared with $177 million and $0.41 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.33 billion year-over-year to $5.06 billion. Inventory increased 44% to $1.82 billion and inventory turns were 12.6, up from 12.5 turns a year ago even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.  
Accounts payable increased 52% to $3.62 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 59 from 57 in the prior-year. 
Our Q1 2010 capital expenditures were $140 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in technology infrastructure including Amazon Web Services, additional investments and support of continued business growth including capacity support and fulfillment operations, and investments in corporate office space, which we expect to continue throughout 2010. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into the guidance of the order trends that we've seen to date, in what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates, can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they’ve been recently. 
For Q2, we expect net sales of between $6.1 and $6.7 billion, a growth of between 31% and 44%. This anticipates approximately 100 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between to $220 million and $320 million, or to grow between 39% and 102%. The second quarter 2009 results includes the impact of our settlement with Toys 'R' Us for $51 million, substantially all of which was expense during the quarter. This includes approximately $130 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses to be between $350 million and $450 million, a growth of between 15% and 48%. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe that putting the customer first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks, and with that, Rob, let's move to questions."

And we certainly have –- we’re focused on making sure that we have great and competitive low prices which certainly fuel growth. Prime is also a factor. 
Third-party growth continues to be very strong, so those are the factors that are driving the International growth. In terms of the change in accounting for Kindle, we're not breaking out any precise numbers on that. But the way you should think about it is, maybe a few different angles, one is if you look at our overall growth rate and you look at on a local currency basis and we certainly have for the first time a full quarter of Zappos included in those numbers as well as the change in accounting for Kindle. And if you back out exchange in those two items and you compare it to the equivalent growth rate in Q4, you did see a few hundred basis points acceleration in growth from Q4 to Q1. So I can't give you much more of a breakout than that, but you can see that -- we did see an acceleration grow there."

At the lower end of the range, it's 5.7% of implied operating margin and 6.7% on the high-end.

One thing to keep in mind though, as I mentioned in one of the earlier questions, with growth we're experiencing, we need to make sure we support that growth.

First, what you’re seeing there is we saw our accelerated growth. And when you see accelerated growth, we're able to leverage that in our Fulfillment capacity and a great way from a productivity standpoint. Also what I'd mentioned was we have added capacity. But specifically in North America, we haven't added any meaningful capacity since Q3 of '08. And if you recall, we were building capacity and then we had a financial disruption in the market, so we ended up having some excess capacity in Q4 of '08. We've been able to leverage that capacity throughout. And so that's resulting in the productivity that you are seeing. Now with the growth that we're experiencing, you should expect that we will have to add capacity over time here to satisfy that growth. 
In terms of your category question, we have learned a lot over the years, but it still takes us a number of years to get to scale and when we launch new categories. One of the things we have learned over the past several years is we need to make sure that we have great selection by day one. We need to make sure that we're pricing very competitively day one, even though we don't have necessarily the scale, or the buying tools to purchase well, day one. And so what that means usually is that we'll have a lower contribution profit per unit generally early on. And as we learn those categories, we get better and better at sourcing and make sure we have the right inventory in place and all that. So it takes a number of years before we get to scale in those categories and get meaningful free cash flow out of them."

Trolling 12 month free cash grew 62% to $2.32 billion. Return on invested capital is 45% up from 41%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow, divided by average total assets, minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long term debt over 5 quarter ends. 
The combination of common stock and stock based towards outstanding 463 million shares compared with 447 million. World wide revenue grew 46% to $7.13 billion or 42% excluding the $185 million payable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. 
We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices. Bad selection and pre-shipping offers including Amazon Prime. Media revenue increased to $3.43 up 26% or 22% excluding foreign exchange rates. ETM revenue increased to $3.51 billion of 72% or 68% excluding FX. World wide EGM increased to 49% of world wide sales up from 42%. 
World wide unit growth was 40%; active customer accounts exceeded a 114 million. And for the first time this number includes our Amazon China customer accounts. World-wide active seller accounts were approximately $2 million of 22%. Sold units were 31% of total units. Consolidated gross profit grew 42% to $1.63 billion and gross margin decreased 62 basis points up to 22.9%. 
We no longer present gross profit as our consolidated statement of operations as we believe income from operations is more meaningful measure due to the diversity of our product categories and services. Our focus is on growing operating profit dollars rather than maximizing margin percentages. 
Now I will discuss operating expenses, excluding stock based compensation. Fulfillment in marketing tech and content and G&A combined was $1.12 billion or 15.8% of sales down 115 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $528 million or 7.4% of revenue compared with 8.3%. 
Tech and content was $319 million or 4.5% of revenue compared with 4.9%. Marketing was $196 million or 2.7% of revenue, up from 2.5% in the prior year. Now I will talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock based compensation or other operating expense line items.
In North America segment, revenue grew 47% to $3.78 billion. Media revenue grew 22% to $1.6 billion. EGM revenue grew 72% to $2.02 billion, representing 54% of North America revenues, up from 45%. North America segment operating income increased 81% to $273 million, or 7.2% operating margin.
In the international segment, revenue grew 45% to $3.35 billion. Revenue growth was 37%, adjusting for the $175 million year-over-year favorable FX impact during the quarter.
Media revenue grew 29% to $1.83 billion or 23% excluding FX. And EGM revenue grew 68% to $1.49 billion or 61% excluding FX. EGM now represents 44% of international revenues, up from 38%.
International segment operating income increased 37% to $234 million, a 7% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates international segment operating income increased 26%. CSOI grew 58% to $507 million or 7.1% of revenue up 53 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $15 million favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, CSOI grew 53%.
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 62% to $394 million or 5.5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $100 million in Q1 or a 25% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $299 million of course, $0.66 per diluted share compared with $177 million and $0.41 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.33 billion year-over-year to $5.06 billion. Inventory increased 44% to $1.82 billion and inventory turns were 12.6 up from 12.5 turns a year ago, even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.
Accounts payable increased 52% to $3.62 billion and accounts payable days increased to 59 from 57 in the prior year.
Our Q1 2010 capital expenditures were $140 million, the increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in technology infrastructure including Amazon web services, additional investments and support of continued business growth including capacity to support fulfillment operations and investments and corporate office-base which we expect to continue throughout 2010. 
I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into the guidance of the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as global economy and consumer spending. 
It’s not possible to accurately predict and end and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings issues such as settling inter company balances and foreign currency amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. 
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions or stock based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange remained approximately where they have been recently. 
For Q2 we expect net sales of between $6.1 and $6.7 billion or growth of between 31% and 44%. This anticipates approximately 100 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income could be between $220 and $320 million or grow between 39% and 102%. 
The second quarter 2009 results include the impact of our settlement with Toys “R” Us for $51 million substantially all of which was expensed during the quarter. This includes approximately $130 million for stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income which excludes stock based compensation and other operating expense to be between $350 and $450 million, a growth of between 15% and 48%. We remain head strong focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe the prudent customer first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks and with that Rob let's move to questions.

We've been to leverage that capacity throughout and so that's resulting in the productivity that you are seeing. Now with the growth that we are experiencing, you should expect that we will have to add capacity overtime here to satisfy that growth. 
In terms of your category question, we have learned a lot over the years, but it still takes us a number of years to get to scale when we launch new categories. One of the things we've learned over the past several years is, we need to make sure that we have great selections day one. We need to make sure that we are pricing very competitively day one. Even though we don't have necessarily the scale or the buying tools to purchase well day one and so what that means usually is that will have lower contribution profit per unit generally early on and as we learn you know those categories we get better and better at you know sourcing and make sure we have the right inventory in place and all that.

I'll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 62% to $2.32 billion. Return on invested capital was 45% up from 41%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilitie",1011,"Thanks, Rob. I'll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 62% to $2.32 billion. Return on invested capital was 45% up from 41%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. 
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 463 million shares compared with 447 million. Worldwide revenue grew 46% to $7.13 billion, or 42%, excluding the $185 million favorable impact from the year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and free shipping offers including Amazon Prime. 
Media revenue increased to $3.43 billion, up 26%, or 22% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM revenue increased to $3.51 billion, up 72% or 68% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 49% of worldwide sales, up from 42%. 
Worldwide unit growth was 40%. Active customer accounts exceeded 114 million. For the first time this number includes our Amazon China customer accounts. Worldwide active seller accounts were approximately 2 million, up 22%. Seller units were 31% of total units. 
Consolidated gross profit grew 42% to $1.63 billion, and gross margin decreased 62 basis points to 22.9%. We no longer present gross profit in our consolidated statement of operations as we believe income from operations is a more meaningful measure due to the diversity of our product categories and services. Our focus is on growing operating profit dollars rather than maximizing margin percentages. 
Now I'll discuss the operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, Tech and Content and G&A combined was $1.12 billion, or a 15.8% of sales, down 115 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $528 million or 7.4% of revenue compared with 8.3%. Tech and Content was $319 million or 4.5% of revenue compared with 4.9%. Marketing was $196 million or 2.7% of revenue, up from 2.5% in the prior year. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. 
In North America segment, revenue grew 47% to $3.78 billion. Media revenue grew 22% to $1.6 billion. EGM revenue grew 73% to $2.02 billion, representing 54% of North America revenues, up from 45%. North America segment operating income increased 81% to $273 million, a 7.2% operating margin. 
In the International segment, revenue grew 45% to $3.35 billion. Revenue growth was 37%, adjusting for the $175 million year-over-year favorable FX impact during the quarter. 
Media revenue grew 29% to $1.83 billion or 23% excluding FX. And EGM revenue grew 70% to $1.49 billion or 61% excluding FX. EGM now represents 44% of International revenues, up from 38%. 
International segment operating income increased 37% to $234 million, a 7% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, the International segment operating income increased 26%. CSOI grew 58% to $507 million or 7.1% of revenue, up 53 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $15 million favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, CSOI grew 53%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 62% to $394 million, or 5.5% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $100 million in Q1 or a 25% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $299 million, or $0.66 per diluted share compared with $177 million and $0.41 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $2.33 billion year-over-year to $5.06 billion. Inventory increased 44% to $1.82 billion and inventory turns were 12.6, up from 12.5 turns a year ago even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 52% to $3.62 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 59 from 57 in the prior year. 
Our Q1 2010 capital expenditures were $140 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in technology infrastructure including Amazon Web Services, additional investments and support of continued business growth, including capacity to support fulfillment operations and investments in corporate office space, which we expect to continue throughout 2010. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into the guidance of the order trends that we've seen to date, in what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters in changes to our effective tax rates, can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they’ve been recently. 
For Q2, we expect net sales of between $6.1 billion and $6.7 billion, a growth of between 31% and 44%. This anticipates approximately 100 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between to $220 million and $320 million, or to grow between 39% and 102%. The second quarter 2009 results includes the impact of our settlement with Toys""R""Usfor $51 million, substantially all of which was expense during the quarter. This includes approximately $130 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate Consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses to be between $350 million and $450 million, a growth of between 15% and 48%. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe that putting the customer first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. 
Thanks, and with that, Rob, let's move to questions."

And it was driven by a number of things. Certainly, we’ve added many new categories and a lot of selections over the past few years, and we certainly have. We’re focused on making sure that we have great and competitive low prices, which is certainly fueling growth. Prime is also a factor. Third-party growth continues to be very strong. So those are the factors that are driving the International growth. In terms of the change in accounting for Kindle, we're not breaking out any precise numbers on that. But the way you should think about it is, maybe a few different items. One is if you look at our overall growth rate and you look at on a local currency basis and we certainly have for the first time a full quarter of Zappos included in those numbers as well as the change in accounting for Kindle. And if you back out exchange in those two items and you compare it to the equivalent growth rate in Q4, you did see a few hundred basis points acceleration in growth from Q4 to Q1. So I can't give you much more of a breakout than that, but you can see that -- we did see an acceleration of growth there."

At the lower end of the range, it's 5.7% of implied operating margin and 6.7% on the high-end.

One thing to keep in mind though, as I mentioned in one of the earlier questions, with growth we're experiencing, we need to make sure we support that growth.

But specifically in North America, we haven't added any meaningful capacity since Q3 of '08.

We've been able to leverage that capacity throughout. And so that's resulting in the productivity that you are seeing. Now with the growth that we're experiencing, you should expect that we will have to add capacity over time here to satisfy that growth. In terms of your category question, we have learned a lot over the years, but it still takes us a number of years to get to scale and when we launch new categories. One of the things we have learned over the past several years is we need to make sure that we have great selection by day one. We need to make sure that we're pricing very competitively day one, even though we don't have necessarily the scale, or the buying tools to purchase well, day one. And so what that means usually is that we'll have a lower contribution profit per unit generally early on. And as we learn those categories, we get better and better at sourcing and make sure we have the right inventory in place and all that.

I'll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 29% to $1.99 billion. Return on invested capital is 34%, down from 42%.

Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 29% to $1.99 billion. Return on invested capital is 34%, down from 42%. ROIC is TTM-free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. 
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 465 million shares compared with 451 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 41% to $6.57 billion, or 42%, excluding the $48 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in FX. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, fast selection with free shipping offers, including Amazon Prime. 
Media revenue increased to $2.87 billion, up 18%. EGM revenue increased to $3.49 billion, up 69%, or 70% excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 53% of worldwide sales, up from 45%. Worldwide unit growth was 39%. Active customer accounts exceeded 118 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million, up 19%. Seller units were 32% of total units. 
Consolidated gross profit grew 42% to $1.61 billion, and gross margin was 24.5%. Beginning this quarter, we no longer allocate Fulfillment costs related to the third-party inventory to cost of sales. Using our prior method, gross margin in Q2 2010 was 24.1%. 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content in G&A combined was $1.2 billion, or 18.3% of sales, up 50 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $558 million, or 8.5% of revenue, compared with 8.4%. Using the prior method of allocating Fulfillment costs related to third-party inventory to cost of sales, Q2 2010 Fulfillment was 8.1% of revenue. Tech and content was $350 million or 5.3% of revenue, compared with 5.5%. Marketing was $204 million, or 3.1% of revenue, up from 2.7% in the prior year. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results and, consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate segments, our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. 
In the North America segment, revenue grew 46% to $3.59 billion. Media revenue grew 15% to $1.32 billion. The sequential decline in quarter-over-quarter growth rates was driven primarily by seasonality in textbook sales and slower rates of growth in video games and video game consoles. 
EGM revenue grew 76% to $2.09 billion, representing 58% of North America revenues, up from 48%. North America segment operating income increased 61% to $200 million; a 5.6% operating margin. 
In the International segment, revenue grew 35% to $2.98 billion. Revenue growth was 38%, adjusting for the $54 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 20% to $1.55 billion, or 21% excluding foreign exchange rates. And EGM revenue grew 59% to $1.4 billion, or 63% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM now represents 47% of International revenues, up from 40%. 
International segment operating income increased 15% to $206 million; a 6.9% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, International segment operating income increased 21%. 
CSOI grew 34% to $406 million, or 6.2% of revenue; down 35 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $10 million unfavorable impact from FX, CSOI grew 37%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 71% to $270 million, or 4.1% of net sales. Q2 2009 operating income was negatively impacted by a $51 million legal settlement. 
Our income tax expense was $88 million in Q2, or a 30% rate for the quarter. During the quarter, we recorded estimated tax expense associated with tentative agreements between the Japanese and the U.S. tax authorities on the allocation of income between the U.S. and Japan for 2003 through 2005, resulting in a three percentage point increase in our effective tax rate for the quarter. 
GAAP net income was $207 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared with $142 million and $0.32 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $1.9 billion year-over-year to $5.11 billion. Inventory increased 46% to $1.94 billion and inventory turns were 12.5, up from 12.4 turns a year ago, even as we extended selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. 
Accounts payable increased 41% to $3.55 billion, and accounts payable days were 65, unchanged from the prior-year. Our Q2 2010 capital expenditures were $196 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments and support of continued business growth, including capacity to support our Fulfillment operations, additional investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, and investments in corporate office space. We expect this trend to continue throughout 2010. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and net foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. 
For Q3, we expect net sales of between $6.9 billion and $7.625 billion, a growth between 27% and 40%. This guidance anticipates approximately 300 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. 
GAAP operating income to be between $210 million and $310 million, or between a 16% decline and 24% growth. This anticipates approximately $130 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses to be between $340 million and $440 million, or be between 3% decline and 26% growth. 
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting the customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. 
Thanks. And with that, Rob, let's move to questions."

First of all, I guess as it relates to, broadly, Fulfillment. I guess can you talk about -- maybe a little bit more color on Fulfillment capacity being layered into the business? I guess, is that both Domestic and International, or just more of a U.S. kind of phenomenon? Maybe a bit more color on, I guess, how much of this incremental capacity is being allocated to your partners, seller partners out there. And I guess is this the build-up in front of the holiday season that you typically do? And then second, are you seeing consumers still buy more books in an environment where consumers have the Kindle App available on multiple devices these days?"

On the performance expense as a percentage of revenue, we have historically reallocated some of our cost from operating expenses to COGS. And when we stopped reporting gross margins last quarter, we decided this quarter not to allocate some of our cost out of operating expenses and into COGS. And the impact of that is a little over 40 basis points as a percentage of revenue. So in other words, our operating expenses for Fulfillment are about 40 basis points, as a percentage of revenue, higher than they would have been if that we have not done this. And the offset is in COGS. So then if you take a look at it, those Fulfillment expenses, we are growing very, very fast. And so we're adding capacity to support growth. And we plan on adding 13 Fulfillment centers this year after keeping our Fulfillment center structure relatively flat. Last year, we did add some capacity, but we're certainly adding a lot more this year. And that's, again, to support that growth. That's both in terms of our retail customers as well as Fulfillment by Amazon, our partners. And your question around whether it's Domestic or International, it's across geographies. So it’s 13 Fulfillment centers across geographies. And so we're very excited about it because, again, we're experiencing a look at our overall growth rates at 42% on a local currency basis. This quarter, 42%; last quarter, 37% in Q4. So again, we're growing very, very strong. So and then in terms of your second question, could you just elaborate a little bit further? I didn't..."

International saw an accelerated growth this quarter. It was 38% growth on a local currency basis. That's the strongest growth rate in any quarter that we've had in International in over five years. So we saw very good growth. And there’s a number of things that's driving it. We've added a lot of selection over the past few years. If you look back and you see just the categories that we've launched over the past few years, we continue to add selection in existing categories, but in those new categories that we've launched over the past few years. And so that growth from new and existing categories is certainly doing quite well. We're making sure that we're very competitive from a pricing standpoint, which is helping. And certainly, other things such as Prime is having a noticeable impact on the growth rate there. So that's really what's driving the growth rate. And with that accelerated growth rate in some of those newer categories, we're seeing some mix. Again, we have a number of categories that are very new there over the past few years, and they're coming up the scale. But it's still very early. So you should assume that many of those are lower gross margin categories and you can see that reflected in the EGM growth within International. So again, saw very, very strong growth there. In terms of Fulfillment centers, I mentioned this to, I think, it was to Jeetil’s question earlier. We haven't -- the plan is to add 13. You're seeing some of the cost starting in Q2 for some of those Fulfillment centers and you see more, as reflected in our guidance for Q3.

From a infrastructure standpoint, we're supporting, again, our Retail business but also we have a AWS business that's growing very, very strong right now, and so we're supporting that growth by adding CapEx. So that's what's included in the CapEx. 
In terms of the range of guidance, I just wanted to clarify a little bit. You said the upper end of the range was 40%. Keep in mind that, that anticipates approximately 300 basis points of unfavorable exchange rates, so at the high end of the range, it's more like 43% as well as on the bottom end of the range for CSOI, you mentioned 24%, it's actually 26%, and that anticipates approximately 600 basis points of exchange. So at the high end of the range, it would be 43% growth x exchange for revenue, 32% growth x -- excuse me, on the high end of the range, 43% excluding exchange for revenue and 32% growth excluding exchange on CSOI. And again, it reflects our best estimate for the high end of that range and the things that we see. But again, it anticipates some of the things that I'm talking about. It anticipates the capacity that will show up in CapEx as well as operating expense across a number of different fronts. And then the rest of the operating expenses in support of the things that we've been talking about, again, for the last several year, it's the growing retail business, both in North America and international, our Seller business, AWS, our Kindle business, Seller business, if I didn't say that.

I'll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 29% to $1.99 billion. Return on invested capital is 34%, down from 42%.

Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 29% to $1.99 billion. Return on invested capital is 34%, down from 42%. ROIC is TTM-free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. 
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 465 million shares compared with 451 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 41% to $6.57 billion, or 42%, excluding the $48 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in FX. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, fast selection with free shipping offers, including Amazon Prime. 
Media revenue increased to $2.87 billion, up 18%. EGM revenue increased to $3.49 billion, up 69%, or 70% excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 53% of worldwide sales, up from 45%. Worldwide unit growth was 39%. Active customer accounts exceeded 118 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million, up 19%. Seller units were 32% of total units. 
Consolidated gross profit grew 42% to $1.61 billion, and gross margin was 24.5%. Beginning this quarter, we no longer allocate Fulfillment costs related to third-party inventory to cost of sales. Using our prior method, gross margin in Q2 2010 was 24.1%. 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, Technology and Content and G&A combined was $1.2 billion, or 18.3% of sales, up 50 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $558 million, or 8.5% of revenue, compared with 8.4%. Using our prior method of allocating Fulfillment costs related to third-party inventory to cost of sales, Q2 2010 Fulfillment was 8.1% of revenue. Tech and Content was $350 million or 5.3% of revenue, compared with 5.5%. Marketing was $204 million, or 3.1% of revenue, up from 2.7% in the prior year. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results and, consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate segments, our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. 
In the North America segment, revenue grew 46% to $3.59 billion. Media revenue grew 15% to $1.32 billion. The sequential decline in quarter-over-quarter growth rates was driven primarily by seasonality in textbook sales and slower rates of growth in video games and video game consoles. 
EGM revenue grew 76% to $2.09 billion, representing 58% of North America revenues, up from 48%. North America segment operating income increased 61% to $200 million, a 5.6% operating margin. 
In the International segment, revenue grew 35% to $2.98 billion. Revenue growth was 38%, adjusting for the $54 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 20% to $1.55 billion, or 21% excluding foreign exchange rates. And EGM revenue grew 59% to $1.4 billion, or 63% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM now represents 47% of International revenues, up from 40%. 
International segment operating income increased 15% to $206 million, a 6.9% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, International segment operating income increased 21%. 
CSOI grew 34% to $406 million, or 6.2% of revenue, down 35 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $10 million unfavorable impact from FX, CSOI grew 37%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 71% to $270 million, or 4.1% of net sales. Q2 2009 operating income was negatively impacted by a $51 million legal settlement. 
Our income tax expense was $88 million in Q2, or a 30% rate for the quarter. During the quarter, we recorded estimated tax expense associated with tentative agreements between the Japanese and U.S. tax authorities on the allocation of income between the U.S. and Japan for 2003 through 2005, resulting in a three percentage point increase in our effective tax rate for the quarter. 
GAAP net income was $207 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared with $142 million and $0.32 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $1.9 billion year-over-year to $5.11 billion. Inventory increased 46% to $1.94 billion and inventory turns were 12.5, up from 12.4 turns a year ago, even as we extended selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. 
Accounts payable increased 41% to $3.55 billion, and accounts payable days were 65, unchanged from the prior year. Our Q2 2010 capital expenditures were $196 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including capacity to support our Fulfillment operations, additional investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, and investments in corporate office space. We expect this trend to continue throughout 2010. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and net foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. 
For Q3, we expect net sales of between $6.9 billion and $7.625 billion, a growth between 27% and 40%. This guidance anticipates approximately 300 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. 
GAAP operating income to be between $210 million and $310 million, or between a 16% decline and 24% growth. This anticipates approximately $130 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses to be between $340 million and $440 million, or be between 3% decline and 26% growth. 
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting the customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. 
Thanks. And with that, Rob, let's move to questions."

First of all, I guess as it relates to, broadly, Fulfillment. I guess can you talk about -- maybe a little bit more color on Fulfillment capacity being layered into the business? I guess, is that both Domestic and International, or just more of a U.S. kind of phenomenon? Maybe a bit more color on, I guess, how much of this incremental capacity is being allocated to your partners, seller partners out there. And I guess is this the build-up in front of the holiday season that you typically do? And then second, are you seeing consumers still buy more books in an environment where consumers have the Kindle App available on multiple devices these days?"

On the performance expense as a percentage of revenue, we have historically reallocated some of our cost from operating expenses to COGS. And when we stopped reporting gross margins last quarter, we decided this quarter not to allocate some of our cost out of operating expenses and into COGS. And the impact of that is a little over 40 basis points as a percentage of revenue. So in other words, our operating expenses for Fulfillment are about 40 basis points, as a percentage of revenue, higher than they would have been if that we have not done this. And the offset is in COGS. So then if you take a look at it, those Fulfillment expenses, we are growing very, very fast. And so we're adding capacity to support growth. And we plan on adding 13 Fulfillment centers this year after keeping our Fulfillment center structure relatively flat. Last year, we did add some capacity, but we're certainly adding a lot more this year. And that's, again, to support that growth. That's both in terms of our retail customers as well as Fulfillment by Amazon, our partners. And your question around whether it's Domestic or International, it's across geographies. So it’s 13 Fulfillment centers across geographies. And so we're very excited about it because, again, we're experiencing a look at our overall growth rates at 42% on a local currency basis. This quarter, 42%; last quarter, 37% in Q4. So again, we're growing very, very strong. So and then in terms of your second question, could you just elaborate a little bit further? I didn't..."

International saw an accelerated growth this quarter. It was 38% growth on a local currency basis. That's the strongest growth rate in any quarter that we've had in International in over five years. So we saw very good growth. And there’s a number of things that's driving it. We've added a lot of selection over the past few years. If you look back and you see just the categories that we've launched over the past few years, we continue to add selection in existing categories, but in those new categories that we've launched over the past few years. And so that growth from new and existing categories is certainly doing quite well. We're making sure that we're very competitive from a pricing standpoint, which is helping. And certainly, other things such as Prime is having a noticeable impact on the growth rate there. So that's really what's driving the growth rate. And with that accelerated growth rate in some of those newer categories, we're seeing some mix. Again, we have a number of categories that are very new there over the past few years, and they're coming up the scale. But it's still very early. So you should assume that many of those are lower gross margin categories and you can see that reflected in the EGM growth within International. So again, saw very, very strong growth there. In terms of Fulfillment centers, I mentioned this to, I think, it was to Jeetil’s question earlier. We haven't -- the plan is to add 13. You're seeing some of the cost starting in Q2 for some of those Fulfillment centers and you see more, as reflected in our guidance for Q3.

The largest pieces of the increase are related to capacity, and it's capacity both from a Fulfillment perspective and an infrastructure perspective. When I say Fulfillment, it's to support our fast-growing Retail business as well as our fast-growing Fulfillment by Amazon business, where we fulfill on behalf of our partners. From a infrastructure standpoint, we're supporting, again, our Retail business but also we have a AWS business that's growing very, very strong right now, and so we're supporting that growth by adding CapEx. So that's what's included in the CapEx. 
In terms of the range of guidance, I just wanted to clarify a little bit. You said the upper end of the range was 40%. Keep in mind that, that anticipates approximately 300 basis points of unfavorable exchange rates, so at the high end of the range, it's more like 43% as well as on the bottom end of the range for CSOI, you mentioned 24%, it's actually 26%, and that anticipates approximately 600 basis points of exchange. So at the high end of the range, it would be 43% growth x exchange for revenue, 32% growth x -- excuse me, on the high end of the range, 43% excluding exchange for revenue and 32% growth excluding exchange on CSOI. And again, it reflects our best estimate for the high end of that range and the things that we see. But again, it anticipates some of the things that I'm talking about. It anticipates the capacity that will show up in CapEx as well as operating expense across a number of different fronts. And then the rest of the operating expenses in support of the things that we've been talking about, again, for the last several year, it's the growing retail business, both in North America and international, our Seller business, AWS, our Kindle business, Seller business, if I didn't say that. So again, those are the things that we're adding resources to, to support the opportunities that we see going forward."

Additional information about the factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.
As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2009. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

I'll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 16% to $2.62 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 5% to $1.83 billion. Return on invested capital was 28%, down from 50%. ROIC i",935,"Thanks, Rob. I'll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 16% to $2.62 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 5% to $1.83 billion. Return on invested capital was 28%, down from 50%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. 
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 465 million shares compared with 451 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 39% to $7.56 million or 40%, excluding the $83 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and free shipping offers, including Amazon Prime.
Media revenue increased to $3.35 billion, up 14% or 15% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM revenue increased to $3.97 billion, up 68% or 71% excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM increased to  53% of worldwide sales, up from 43%. Worldwide unit growth was 41%. Active customer accounts were approximately 121 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than two million. Seller units were 34% of total units.
Consolidated gross profit grew 39% to $1.77 billion. The gross margin was 23.5%. 
Now I'll discuss our operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, Marketing, Technology and Content and G&A combined was $1.37 billion or 18.2% of sales, up 122 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $657 million or 8.7% of revenue compared with 8.2%. Tech and Content was $386 million or 5.1% of revenue compared with 4.9%. Marketing was $234 million or 3.1% of revenue, up from 2.6% in the prior year.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments, our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 45% to $4.13 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $1.59 billion. EGM revenue grew 80% to $2.33 billion, representing 56% of North America revenues, up from 45%. North America segment operating income increased 19% to $186 million or 4.5% operating margin.
In the International segment, revenue grew 32% to $3.43 billion. Revenue growth was 35%, adjusting for the $86 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 16% to $1.76 billion or 18% excluding FX. And the EGM revenue grew 54% to $1.64 billion or 60% excluding FX. EGM now represents 48% of International revenues, up from 41%.
International segment operating income increased 11% to $215 million, a 6.2% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income increased 20%.
CSOI grew 15% to $401 million or 5.3% of revenue, down 112 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $15 million unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, CSOI grew 19%. 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 7% to $268 million or 3.5% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $79 million in Q3 or a 27% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $231 million or $0.51 per diluted share compared with $199 million and $0.45 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $1.88 billion year-over-year to $5.88 billion. Inventory increased 56% to $2.52 billion. And inventory turns were 11.8, down from 12.1 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. 
Accounts payable increased 38% to $4.61 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 73 from 72 in the prior year. 
Our Q3 2010 capital expenditures were $315 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, capacity to support our Fulfillment operations and investments in corporate office space. We expect this trend to continue throughout 2010.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into the guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe, to date, to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand. And therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter-company balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q4, we expect net sales of between $12 billion and $13.3 billion, a growth between 26% and 40%. This guidance anticipates approximately 70 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. 
GAAP operating income to be between $360 million and $560 million or between a 24% decline and 18% growth. This includes approximately $140 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $500 million and $700 million or between 16% decline and 17% growth. 
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. 
Thanks. And with that, Rob, let's move to questions."

In terms of uptick in North America Media, we're seeing very good growth there. We're very pleased with the business that we have there. As it relates to the Books, we saw a very strong revenue growth in the quarter. In fact, from a unit perspective, we saw accelerated growth from both physical and Kindle books in Q3 relative to Q2. So very strong growth during the quarter. We did see, in a couple of categories, some softness, particularly Music and Video, as we overlap some higher revenue in last year Q3. Specifically in the Music side, we had strong last year with some of the Michael Jackson titles. We also had very strong growth with The Beatles box set. In video games, specifically video game consoles, there was very strong price reductions from the manufacturers and which caused great growth last year. And so we saw some softness that's in the North American Media numbers that you see. But again, we're very pleased with the overall categories in Media. In terms of the equity income and in terms of how you should think about it, we did have -- included in our guidance, and I'll give you the total numbers. But excluded from the guidance that we gave approximately 90 days ago, we did not include Woot acquisition. And the impact from the quarter is roughly $30 million revenue. From a CSOI perspective, we had a few million dollar loss for the quarter. And then because we had a investment in Woot, we have to step up that investment in fair value, see how the gain that's included in the other income line, the equity income line that you're referring to, which brings our net down to about $13 million net or a little under $0.03 per share.

Or are there any sort of technical limitations around that?"

We're getting very good traction in third-party within International. Also keep in mind, we're talking about one of the earlier questions, within EGM, we've launched many new categories over the past few years. They're growing. Those categories are growing very well. As I mentioned, the growth is above 60% year-over-year on a local currency basis in total. And what's ends up happening when you launch new categories is many of are low gross margins at the start. And then we work very hard over time to be more efficient, to buy better. And so those categories improve over time. So again, those are the things that are impacting gross margins. In terms of marketing, a couple of things to think about. One, you're right. We're a little over 3%, very similar to where we were from the increase year-over-year last quarter. The primary area that we spend in marketing is what paid Search and Associates. Still, keep in mind that as we look at year-over-year -- last year we didn't have Zappos. And we continue to support the marketing efforts for Zappos, which is included in that cost.

I'll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 16% to $2.62 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 5% to $1.83 billion.

Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 5% to $1.83 billion. Return on invested capital was 28%, down from 50%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. 
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 465 million shares compared with 451 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 39% to $7.56 billion or 40%, excluding the $83 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and free shipping offers, including Amazon Prime.
Media revenue increased to $3.35 billion, up 14% or 15% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM revenue increased to $3.97 billion, up 68% or 71% excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 53% of worldwide sales, up from 43%. Worldwide unit growth was 41%. Active customer accounts were approximately 121 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 34% of total units.
Consolidated gross profit grew 39% to $1.77 billion and gross margin was 23.5%. 
Now I'll discuss our operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, Marketing, Technology and Content and G&A combined was $1.37 billion or 18.2% of sales, up 122 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $657 million or 8.7% of revenue compared with 8.2%. Tech and Content was $386 million or 5.1% of revenue compared with 4.9%. Marketing was $234 million or 3.1% of revenue, up from 2.6% in the prior year.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 45% to $4.13 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $1.59 billion. EGM revenue grew 80% to $2.33 billion, representing 56% of North America revenues, up from 45%. North America segment operating income increased 19% to $186 million, a 4.5% operating margin.
In the International segment, revenue grew 32% to $3.43 billion. Revenue growth was 35%, adjusting for the $86 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 16% to $1.76 billion or 18% excluding FX. And the EGM revenue grew 54% to $1.64 billion or 60% excluding FX. EGM now represents 48% of International revenues, up from 41%.
International segment operating income increased 11% to $215 million, a 6.2% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income increased 20%.
CSOI grew 15% to $401 million or 5.3% of revenue, down 112 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $15 million unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, CSOI grew 19%. 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 7% to $268 million or 3.5% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $79 million in Q3 or a 27% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $231 million or $0.51 per diluted share compared with $199 million and $0.45 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $1.88 billion year-over-year to $5.88 billion. Inventory increased 56% to $2.52 billion. And inventory turns were 11.8, down from 12.1 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. 
Accounts payable increased 38% to $4.61 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 73 from 72 in the prior year. 
Our Q3 2010 capital expenditures were $315 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, capacity to support our Fulfillment operations and investments in corporate office space. We expect this trend to continue throughout 2010.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into the guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe, to date, to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand. And therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter-company balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q4, we expect net sales of between $12 billion and $13.3 billion, a growth between 26% and 40%. This guidance anticipates approximately 70 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. 
GAAP operating income to be between $360 million and $560 million or between 24% decline and 18% growth. This includes approximately $140 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $500 million and $700 million or between 16% decline and 17% growth. 
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.

As it relates to Books, we saw a very strong revenue growth in the quarter. In fact, from a unit perspective, we saw accelerated growth in both Physical and Kindle books in Q3 relative to Q2. So very strong growth during the quarter. We did see, in a couple of categories, some softness, particularly Music and Video, as we overlap some higher revenue in last year Q3. Specifically in the Music side, we had very strong growth last year with some of the Michael Jackson titles. We also had very strong growth with The Beatles Box Set. In video games, specifically video game consoles, there was very strong price reductions from the manufacturers and which caused great growth last year. And so we saw some softness that's in the North American Media numbers that you see. But again, we're very pleased with overall categories in Media. In terms of the equity income and in terms of how you should think about it, we did have, included in our guidance, and I'll give you the total numbers. But, sorry, excluded from the guidance that we gave approximately 90 days ago, we did not include Woot acquisition. And the impact from the quarter is roughly $30 million revenue. From a CSOI perspective, we had a few million dollar loss for the quarter. And then because we had a investment in Woot, we had to step up that investment to fair value, see how the gain that's included in the other income line, the equity income line that you're referring to, which brings our net down to about $13 million net or a little under $0.03 per share.

You've seen that in a lot of different ways in our various offerings. And we'll continue to do that as best we can on behalf of the customers over the long term, which includes Video On Demand. And then the second part of your question, sorry, was…"

It is an interesting area for us. And if you think about just the growth in connected devices, any time you can have very fast growth and high adoption of connected devices around the world where customers can get easy access to Amazon.com, we think is a good thing; it’s a tailwind for us. And so what we're trying to do is trying to make that as easy for customers with apps and other ways so that we can serve customers well, there, so they get a great experience when they connect with their device. So that’s something that certainly we're working on, and we find this interesting."

The first part, as you can probably appreciate, we don't break out any of our products or categories from a profitability standpoint. And so we have a long-standing practice of not doing that. And so the details that we've provided today, they're just the North America and International segment from a profitability standpoint. So I can't help you much there. In terms of infrastructure and capacity to serve, excuse me, in terms of fulfillment capacity, you're right. We added a lot of capacity to date. We have some more that we're adding in Q4. And that's to serve demand that we think is in front of us. And we'll have to see, wait and see what happens over the coming quarters to see what capacity we need to add. But what I can say is from a retail perspective, as you can see, our overall growth rates are very strong. And if they continue to be strong, we will have to add additional capacity. We're seeing very good traction for Fulfilled by Amazon, which we're also adding capacity for. And we like that part of the business, from a seller perspective, a lot. From an infrastructure standpoint, again, just with the growth that we're seeing from a retail perspective, we're adding capacity to support the retail websites that we have around the world. In addition to that, we have a very fast-growing Web Services business that has great traction. It continues to grow well, and you certainly should expect that we'll add capacity there over time to serve that growth."
