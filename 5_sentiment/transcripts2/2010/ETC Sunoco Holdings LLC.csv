Welcome to Sunoco’s quarterly conference call. We will be discussing the company’s fourth quarter earnings that we reported this afternoon. With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial",679,"Thank you, Rachel. Thank you and good evening, everyone. Welcome to Sunoco’s quarterly conference call. We will be discussing the company’s fourth quarter earnings that we reported this afternoon. With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer, and Clare McGrory, our Manager of Investor Relations. I will start by taking on a few introductory comments and then Brian will address business results and comment on our overall financial position.
As part of today’s call, I direct you to our website, www.sunocoinc.com, where we have posted a number of presentation slides, which may provide a useful reference as we go through the remarks. For purposes of facilitating a good discussion, I also refer you to the Safe Harbor statement as referenced in slide number two of the slide package and as included in this afternoon’s earnings release and Form 10-Q filing.
So let’s begin. As shown on slide four and five, we reported a quarterly net loss, excluding special items, of $31 million or $0.27 a share. For the year, Sunoco reported a loss, excluding special items, of $37 million or $0.32 a share. The challenging market environment had continued to impact our volumes and our margins in both the petroleum and the chemical businesses. The fourth quarter refining benchmark margins worsened from the previous quarter and the rising crude oil prices during the quarter also negatively impacted our margins. However, in this difficult environment, the company continued to take aggressive actions to address those issues within our control.
Our non-refining businesses earned $127 million in the fourth quarter, as we managed to produce strong earnings as a result of good execution and a sharp focus on cost. Retail marketing earned $21 million as rising feedstock prices put pressure on retail gasoline margins, but Logistics earned $22 million with steady contributions from Sunoco Logistics Partners LP and our Coke segment earned $78 million, including a one-time tax credit of $41 million.
During 2009, we successfully executed our business improvement initiative and we exceeded the target of $300 million in cost savings on an annualized basis by this end of the year. Excluding Tulsa, our SG&A in operating expenses in 2009 were roughly $560 million below 2008. And approximately half of this improvement is attributable to our cost reduction initiative and the other half is from lower volumes and energy costs.
These savings were partially offset by approximately $80 million in increased pension-related expenses. In 2010, we expect to see a full year’s benefit of the lower cost structure from both the business improvement initiative and the closure of the Eagle Point refinery. We will also benefit from the pension and healthcare plan modifications announced in November.
As we consider the outlook for 2010, we continue to expect a challenging market for petroleum and chemical products due to ongoing economic weakness and excess global supply. However, the company has responded to the market environment with several strategic actions to improve our competitive cost position, optimize our portfolio, and our operating performance.
Earlier this week, we announced that we have permanently shut down our previously idle Eagle Point refinery and that we’ve signed an agreement to sell our polypropylene business, which comprises of significant portion of our Chemicals business, for approximately $350 million in cash, a good value for our shareholders.
Earlier in 2009, we sold our Tulsa refinery and the Retail Home Heating Oil business. These portfolio changes addressed areas of the business that were not meeting our cost of capital and enabled the company to redeploy capital to the growth of our Logistics and Coke businesses while we continue to invest in our strong retail brand.
The company has also taken several recent actions to strengthen balance sheet and liquidity, which Brian MacDonald will discuss in more detail shortly. All of these initiatives, along with our continued focus on cost reduction, serve to strengthen the balance sheet and will enable us to maintain our financial flexibility and grow our non-refining businesses as we manage through the refining down-cycle.
So now let me turn the call over to Brian.
"
305749,84298751,48556,"Sunoco Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2010",2010-02-04,"Earnings Calls","ETC Sunoco Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Lynn. First let me comment on quarterly net income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported net income of $26 million attributable to SUN shareholders in Q4, which included $57 million of net favorable special items,",1947,"Thanks, Lynn. First let me comment on quarterly net income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported net income of $26 million attributable to SUN shareholders in Q4, which included $57 million of net favorable special items, as detailed in our earnings release and on slide six.
We incurred a $19 million provision for costs associated with MTBE litigation as well as additional charges associated with the business improvement initiative and the Eagle Point shutdown. These charges were offset by a $21 million favorable adjustment to the gain related to the divestment of the discontinued Tulsa operations as well as a $55 million gain from the liquidation of LIFO inventories in connection with the shutdown of the Eagle Point refinery.
Before addressing some specifics regarding our operating performance, our quarterly results, particularly for refining, generally reflect the continuation of market weakness as crack spreads deteriorated further from the third quarter, especially in the mid-continent region. Our non-refining operations, however, continued to make positive contributions and we continue to aggressively take actions to improve our cost structure as well as our financial position for the future.
Regarding Q4 business unit results, I direct you to slide seven. Starting with refining and supply, we had a loss there of $135 million in Q4, as gasoline margins deteriorated significantly from the prior quarter and the mid-continent margins in particular were very weak. Operationally, crude unit utilization across the system in Q4 was 84%.
With respect to Q4 margin realizations, I refer you to slide eight and nine for more detail on the refining system crude costs and product differentials versus our benchmark. Our margin realizations were challenged in Q4 by lower overall benchmark margins as well as rising crude cost and volatility in prices. While most of the factors that affect our realizations versus our benchmarks are market related, we are taking actions on identified opportunities to improve our margin realizations versus benchmark.
These actions include the reorganization of our commercial group. We will place all resources serving external market in one organization. In general, our benchmarks were down approximately $1 from the prior quarter and our realized margins moved lower with the benchmarks. Our crude cost for the quarter averaged about $1.61 above our weighted benchmark due to the impact of rising crude prices on our Northeast crude prices as well as higher transportation costs. On the product side, our average differential was $1.02 lower than the weighted benchmark, as product pricing, particularly for non-benchmark products, continued to be weak in this difficult market environment.
As compared to the third quarter, margins were held by improved yield at both the Northeast Complex and the Toledo refinery, as they recovered from maintenance work during the third quarter. The utilization rates in Q4 reflect the idling of Eagle Point refinery in early November. For the November and December period, Eagle Point volume transitioned to increase utilization at Marcus Hook in Philadelphia, which involved working through intermediate inventories and securing the appropriate mix of crude purchases for these facilities.
The Northeast Complex did experience some operational issues near year-end, which continued into January. However, we have recovered and are currently operating at approximately 90% utilization in the Northeast and expect to continue at or above these rates until the start of our planned FCC turnaround in Marcus Hook, which begins in late February. We also are planning our Toledo HCC [ph] turnaround slated for our mid-March start. Both turnarounds are expected to occur over approximately 35 to 40 days.
Now turning to our non-refining businesses, which earned an aggregate $127 million during the quarter, as detailed on slide ten. Retail marketing earned $21 million in Q4. Sales volumes were lower as compared to the prior quarter, a normal seasonal decline. And retail gasoline margins declined as wholesale prices rose steadily with crude prices during October and again in late December.
During the quarter we also continued to execute on our retail portfolio management program and generated approximately $44 million of proceeds and $6 million of after-tax gains on site sales through the sale of 62 sites primarily to Sunoco branded dealers and distributors.
In 2009, we divested a total of 157 sites and generated $120 million in proceeds. Approximately 80% of these sites divested continued to be in the Sunoco dealer or distribution portfolio. We will continue to use this program to enhance our overall return on capital employed in the business. We anticipate that an additional $60 million of proceeds will be generated through 2011.
Turning now to Chemicals, where we earned $6 million in Q4 with slight improvements related to phenol margins and lower expenses. The results continued to reflect weakness in both the polymers and phenol business, and we continue to manage volumes and margins in this difficult environment.
Logistics earned $22 million as Sunoco Logistics posted another solid quarter. The business continues to produce steady income growth from its growing asset base. Coke posted another solid quarter earning $78 million in Q4, which included a one-time tax credit of $41 million associated with our Granite City, Illinois facility. Excluding the tax credit, the business reflected a slight increase as Granite City operations started up in the fourth quarter. Granite City continues to ramp up production with full production expected to be reached in the first quarter.
Looking ahead to 2010, we expect Coke earnings to be between $125 million and $140 million, as shown on slide 11. As compared to 2009, EBITDA is expected to be about flat. The increase related to a full year of operations from Granite City is expected to be partially offset by lower revenues for Jewell Coke facility due to lower expected coal prices. We also expect to incur more cost as we increase resources dedicated to business development for international expansion and some technology enhancements.
In 2010 and going forward, the Coke business is expected to be near breakeven on a cash flow basis with the capital program we plan for this year and with no major working capital changes. We believe that this will allow us to fund its own capital requirements, which we think speaks to the strength of the business model.
Finally, let me take a few minutes to discuss our financial position at the end of the year. In conjunction with that, I direct you to slides 12 and 13. Our fourth quarter net cash flow before debt activity was a positive $338 million, driven by the liquidation of inventories related to both Tulsa and Eagle Point refinery.
From a balance sheet perspective, our overall net debt position was approximately $2.1 billion, down about $340 million from the third quarter. Of the $2.1 billion of debt, approximately $900 million was attributable to Sunoco Logistics, leaving $1.2 billion attributable to Sunoco at the parent level. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 41%. From a liquidity position, at the end of the year, we had $377 million of cash and approximately $1.4 billion of available, committed borrowing capacity, which includes approximately $200 million available to Sunoco Logistics.
Turning to slide 14, which details historic and 2010 capital spending, we were successful at managing expenditures in 2009 by reducing spending where possible in refining and chemicals while making capital available for opportunities in Sunoco Logistics. Our full-year 2009 spend was approximately $950 million, which included about $400 million in growth capital spend in Logistics and Coke. The mix of spending changed during the year as compared to our initial guidance, with the reduction of approximately $150 million in refining and coke being partially offset by higher spending at Sunoco Logistics associated with growth opportunities.
In 2010, we have about $840 million allocated for capital spending, which includes growth capital of $280 million for the construction of the Middletown coke plant and the committed logistics opportunities. Any capital requirements for Sunoco Logistics will be funded within Sunoco Logistics Partner, using its own balance sheet and access to capital. We will to continue to focus on capital discipline in 2010 as we did in 2009.
Turning to slide 15, as we look into 2010, we will continue to take appropriate actions that will assist us in maintaining our financial flexibility. We believe this proactive approach will improve performance in both the short-term and long-term and deliver increased value to shareholders. Together these actions have allowed the company to exit 2009 with a much more competitive cost structure across all of our businesses and reduced future capital calls.
Today’s earnings release also provides a recap of several actions to strengthen our balance sheet and liquidity. To start with, the company has modified the Incentive Distribution Rights, often referred to as IDRs, that entitle Sunoco to receive cash in excess of its general partner interest from Sunoco Logistics.
This transaction will provide Sunoco with approximately $200 million of cash in exchange for a portion of future cash flows from the IDRs while also improving the cost of capital of Sunoco Logistics and enhancing its long-term growth potential. This transition demonstrates the value of Sunoco’s general partner interest as we continue to recover substantial general partner distributions and we will be able to grow back into the cover level of high distributions in the future.
Secondly, Sunoco strengthened its liquidity position through the sale of 2.2 million of its Limited Partner units in Sunoco Logistics Partners for net cash proceeds of approximately $140 million, excluding the underwriter option to exercise the green shoe. This transaction demonstrates the underlying value of Sunoco’s position in Sunoco Logistics. With this sale, we will now hold a 33% interest in the partnership, including our general partnership interest.
The company plans to bolster the funded status of its pension plan with a contribution of approximately $200 million, about evenly split between cash and Sunoco common stock. The pension contributions will generate a positive cash tax benefit in the first half of 2010, and the contribution will have minimal dilutive impact to Sunoco shareholders.
Furthermore, the pension contributions are expected to eliminate the need for any legally required minimum pension contributions until 2012. The combination of these large discretionary contributions and the previously announced modifications to the company’s defined benefit pension plans and postretirement medical benefit plans significantly bolsters the funded status of these plans and reduces future funding needs for these obligations over the coming years.
All of these initiatives, along with our continued focus on cost reduction, serve to strengthen the balance sheet and will enable us to maintain our financial flexibility and grow our non-refining businesses as we manage through this refining down cycle. I’ll also advice that Sunoco’s Board of Directors today declared a cash dividend for the first quarter of $0.15 per share, and we believe that Sunoco’s current dividend level is sustainable under current conditions.
We will continue to take prudent and appropriate actions that will enable Sunoco to face the future from a position of strength. With our significant refining presence in the Northeast and Midwest, a more efficient cost structure, a strong branded retail network, significant ownership and overall control of the Logistics operation, a strong Coke business, and a much stronger balance sheet, we will be well positioned to capitalize on the eventual market recovery and take advantage of opportunities for growth.
With that, we will open up the line for questions. We’ll ask that you limit your questions to two questions each so that everyone has a chance to get their questions answered. And I know it’s been a long day in the market, so we’ll all get off the call at a reasonable time. So with that, operator, we will open up for questions.

First of all, there is an immediate cash tax benefit of putting in the stock. So if you think about it - if you put stock in at - I'll use $27, which was the calc I did before today’s market, you basically get a 35% tax deduction for that on a cash basis. So in essence, you are selling stock at $36 or a 35% premium. Secondarily, we wanted to fund the pension plan. Even though we are funding it in this year, it actually goes on last year’s tax return. And as you probably know, there is a one-time election to do tax carry-backs to five years. So we get to carry back the loss of this deduction on the pension for five years.
I think the third reason would be that if you think about it, this is an unfunded liability of the company. So we think there is good value in our stock. And so by putting the stock in the pension plan, the value that we think can be generated with the stock effectively accretes to the current shareholders as opposed to selling stock on a secondary basis. So when we kind of looked at all of this and the tax part of this, improving some of our credit metrics as well as the ability to effectively issue stock at a 35% premium, we thought it was a good way - it was a good way to improve the pension funding and the balance sheet, generate some positive cash, and allow the value that we think we can create in our stock to accrete to the current shareholders.

Secondarily, we don’t have the cash from the IDR reset yet. That won’t happen until there is a debt issuance from Sunoco Logistics. That cash needs to come first for sure. I think, as you said, a lot of this cash, we will use it as a buffer to ride through the refining down-cycle here. We had at year-end about $300 million of commercial paper outstanding short-term debt. So this will allow us to kind of wind down some of the short-term debt. But fundamentally, we wanted to put cash on the balance sheet, to kind of ride through the cycles, strengthen the balance sheet, and give us financial flexibility. There could be some interesting acquisitions for us to do out there in the growth parts of the business.
We don’t have anything specific to talk about, but we wouldn’t want to say that we are not going to do any acquisitions, but we would be doing them in our growth - in the growth areas of our business and not necessarily in refining. And then I think once we get through the - once we get through the refining down-cycle, then we will be thinking about our cash a little more broadly. I think the other piece of this, as you probably saw, our Board approved our Q1 dividend today. And we had to cut our dividend or we chose to cut our dividend back in October. But I think with the actions we’ve taken today and when we took our dividend cutback in October, we did it with a mind of having a dividend that we thought could be sustainable through the down-cycle. And we continue to believe that, especially after the actions that we’ve taken and announced over the last few days.

It took 13 months, as you know. We look to sell the whole business. We had interest in - we had some interest in the whole business, we had more interest in the polypropylene business, and a little bit of interest in the phenol business on its own. As we look at what we thought was the best option for us, it was to sell the polypropylene business in the way we did. We didn’t think the value that we could receive for phenol was appropriate for us to sell the business.
And so at this time, we are - we’ve taken the phenol business off of the market, and we are going to operate it. We will do some things around the edges to take some costs out and run it better, now that we have a clear view of it being in our portfolio. But that’s really how we ended up with selling the polypropylene business as the best option. Now, turning to your question on the tax rate, on the sale of the chemical business, it is a stock sale and so it has some - it has some tax losses associated with it. From a book perspective, I would - I'm not sure exactly what to tell you at this point in time until we work through it. But more importantly, from a cash - from a cash tax perspective, there is some benefit to it and we will realize that over time.

Clearly margins got worst in Q4 and better here in January. We are still executing - Eagle Point is down. The people are gone. Eagle Point - the Eagle Point costs are substantially out of our system. The second piece of this is moving the volume over to our two assets here in Philadelphia and running those assets and capturing all of that volume and getting all the operational efficiencies of getting that higher volume and throughput. I mean, quite frankly, we are still working on that, and as I said in my opening remarks, we had some operating issues in late December and going into January. So I think everything that we said we would get when we closed Eagle Point, we are still committing to get. And but we are still working through actually capturing it.

And then the cash, we found ourselves in a position that as the distributions grow, we were getting 50% of them. And so - so that creates some business issues for Sunoco Logistics around their cost of capital and the cost of issuing new equity and growing. And so it’s quite common with general partnerships in MLPs that when you get into what are known as the high splits or up into the 50% incremental distribution level as we were, there would be a restructuring of the distribution rights.
And so really what we did, Paul, is we took down - we basically took down our distribution rights. We got paid - we will get paid a very nice piece of cash for that. But we did not give up our rights for those distributions to grow back up. So over time, as Sunoco Logistics grow and we think it continues to grow and there is lots of good opportunities there, our distributions will grow back up into the 50% level and we could do a transaction like this again or a different flavor of this type of transaction. So I think it’s really two-fold. One, to help Sunoco Logistics with their cost of capital and their access to the market. And then secondarily, I think it really demonstrates the underlying value of Sunoco’s ownership in the GP.

Welcome to Sunoco's quarterly conference call where we will be discussing the company's first quarter earnings call that we reported this afternoon. With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer; and Clare McGrory, our Manager of Investor Relations. I'll start by making a few introductory comments and then Brian will address business results and comment on our overall financial position. As part of today's call, I will direct you to our website, www.sunocoinc.com, where we have posted number presentation slides which may provide a useful reference as we progress through the remarks. I'd also refer you to the Safe Harbor statement referenced in Slide #2 of the slide package, and as included in this afternoon's earnings release. So let's begin. 
As you can see from Slides 3 and 4, we reported quarterly net income, excluding special items of $17 million or $0.14 a share. These results reflect the market environment that remains very challenging, particularly for the Refining and Chemicals businesses which are still under significant pressure due to low demand and excess global supply. That said, during the quarter, we continue to take aggressive actions to address those issues within our control, and we are seeing the benefits of these actions in our results. 
Our first quarter Refining benchmark margins improved from the prior quarter. And we made progress in improving our Refining margin captured during the period that was challenged with low utilization due to two planned turnarounds at our Marcus Hook and Toledo refineries. We successfully completed both turnarounds in a safe manner, and are focused on running the refineries of the optimal utilization rates for the remainder of the year. 
Excluding the discontinued Polypropylene business, our Non-refining businesses earned $78 million in the first quarter versus $49 million for the same period in 2009, which is largely due to good execution and a sharp focus on cost. Retail Marketing earned $21 million in the first quarter of 2010. Logistics earned $17 million with steady contributions from Sunoco Logistics Partners LP and our Coke segment earned $37 million. 
Our sharp focus on achieving a competitive cost structure continues this year. Cash, operating expenses, excluding fuel, utilities and the polypropylene operations that were sold in the first quarter were more than $50 million lower sequentially in the first quarter of this year versus the fourth quarter of 2009. This expense measurement basis is used internally to track our progress in reducing our controllable expenses, and demonstrates our efforts and success in driving our costs to a competitive level. 
As we consider the outlook for the remainder of 2010, we continue to expect the challenging market for petroleum and chemical products due to ongoing economic weakness and excess global supply. However, Sunoco is well prepared. The early proactive steps we took during this cycle have made us stronger, leaner and more competitive. We continue to drive toward a sustainably lower cost structure, and are focused on running our refineries safely, reliably at optimal capacity utilization, lowering our break even costs per barrel and improving margin capture, all of which are designed to increase our cash generation through operations. 
Our recent actions to strengthen our balance sheet have enabled us to maintain financial flexibility, and position us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities at our Logistics, Retail Marketing and Coke businesses. One such opportunity that we can announce today is a plan that was recently approved by management to expand production at our Jewell coal mining facility. Brian will talk about this in a bit more detail shortly. 
We are also pleased to announce that we started construction at our Middletown Coke plant in early April. We have already signed an agreement with AK Steel in which they have agreed to purchase, over a 20-year period, all of the coke and available electrical power from this facility. Completion of the plant and it's first coke production is estimated for the second half of 2011. Now let me turn the call over to Brian."
305749,104692149,62252,"Sunoco Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","ETC Sunoco Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Lynn. First, let me comment on quarterly net income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items.

First, let me comment on quarterly net income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported a net loss of $63 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in Q1, which included $80 million of net unfavorable special items, as detailed in our earnings release and on Slide 5 of our web deck. 
We recorded a $44 million after-tax loss related to the divestment of the discontinued Polypropylene operations, as well as a $20 million after-tax provision for contract losses in connection with excess barge capacity resulting from the shutdown of Eagle Point refining operations. We also incurred additional charges totaling $16 million after-tax, associated with pension settlement losses and unfavorable deferred state income tax adjustments attributable to the continuing phenol operations. 
Before addressing some specifics regarding operating performance, let me just say that quarterly results, particularly for Refining, generally reflect a continuation of market weakness. While crack spreads improved from the fourth quarter, they remained depressed particularly in the Mid-Continent region. We were further challenged in Refining during the first quarter due to planned turnaround activity at two of our refineries, with significantly reduced utilization during the month of March. 
Our Non-refining operations however, continued to make positive contributions, generating returns consistent with the fourth quarter, excluding discontinued operations and the $41 million one-time tax credit that we've received in Q4. Additionally, the success of our actions to lower cost is reflected in our results. We have made some progress on margin capture, and we continue to pursue initiatives to improve our cost structure as financial positioning for the future. 
Regarding first-quarter business unit results, I direct you to Slide 6. Refining and Supply had a $70 million pretax loss or $42 million after-tax in the first quarter of 2010, compared to a pretax loss of $226 million in Q4 or $135 million after-tax in Q4. While we are not satisfied with our Refining performance in the first quarter, we believe the $156 million pretax improvement sequentially versus the fourth quarter, especially in light of the two turnarounds we had underway in the first quarter, demonstrates that the actions we have taken to improve our Refining performance are beginning to yield results. 
Market margins improved from the prior quarter, and we made progress on both margin capture and cost reduction initiatives. But the planned turnarounds resulted in reduced utilizations and prevented us from covering all of our fixed costs. Operationally, crude unit utilization across the system in the first quarter was 79%. 
Before we talk in more detail about our first quarter 2010 margin realization, I would like to call your attention to a few changes that we've made to our benchmark margins, essentially, to make them more reflective of our market. These adjustments included an increase in our crude transportation cost and the addition of a jet component to our Toledo benchmark. The updated benchmarks are detailed on Slide 23. The changes do not affect comparability of realizations, as historical benchmarks have either been reinstated in the case of crude transportation costs or not materially different as a result of the change, as was the case with the addition of the Toledo jet component. 
With respect to our Q1 margin realizations, I refer you to Slide 7 and 8 for more detail on our Refining system crude costs and product differentials versus our benchmark. Our results generally reflect improvement in the first quarter versus recent quarters due largely to improved product realizations, with offsets in higher crude transportation rates and the impact of LIFO reserves. 
Even with the challenges that the turnarounds presented in achieving ratable sales and managing inventory, we did see improvements in capturing more of the benchmark margin as compared to last quarter, in particular, during the early part of the quarter and before the turnaround activity in March. While most of the factors that affect our realizations versus our benchmarks are typically market related, we continue to aggressively take actions on identified opportunities to improve our margin realizations versus benchmark margins, and we are seeing some early positive results. 
In general, our benchmarks are up approximately $2 per barrel on average from the fourth quarter of 2009, and our realized margins are also higher by about $2 per barrel. Our crude costs for the quarter averaged about $0.90 per barrel above our weighted benchmark, due to higher transportation costs and the impact of LIFO reserves. Our crude inventories fell significantly during the quarter and we reserved for these draws at the higher quarter end crude prices. By year-end, we are still expecting to have permanent draws of crude oil and refined product inventory related to our Eagle Point closure. But we are conservatively deferring recognition of any profit related to these draws in the event that other business drivers result in inventory builds that might offset these draws. 
On the product said, our average differential was approximately $0.67 per barrel, lower than our weighted benchmark. The product differentials were challenged in March during the turnarounds due largely to the lower yield gains and the costs of reserving for refined product inventory draws at higher quarter end pricing. The turnaround activity also impact the ratability of sales and hence, realized margins, particularly in Toledo where our benchmark margins were significantly better in March versus the rest of the quarter. 
As compared to the fourth quarter, average realizations on benchmark products in the first quarter were still improved even with the lower utilization in March. We successfully completed our planned cat cracker turnaround in Marcus Hook which limited production during all of March.  Additionally, the Toledo hydrocracker turnaround impacted production for a few weeks in March and was successfully completed in mid-April. Now that we have completed the turnarounds, we have the capacity to operate at or above 90% utilization in the Northeast. 
Now let's turn to our Non-refining businesses which continued to contribute positive results. Our Retail, Marketing, Logistics and Coke businesses earned $75 million after-tax in aggregate during the quarter as detailed on Slide 9. 
Retail Marketing earned $21 million in the first quarter of 2010. Retail gasoline margins remained fairly consistent with the prior quarter but sales volumes were lower, a decline consistent with DOE statistics and attributable to poor weather conditions in the Northeast. During the quarter, we also continue to execute in our Retail Portfolio Management program and, generated approximately $8 million of proceeds and $3 million of after-tax gains on site sales through the sale of 16 sites, primarily to Sunoco branded dealers and distributors. Approximately 80% of the sites divested continue to be in the Sunoco dealer or distribution portfolio. We will continue to use this program to enhance our overall return on capital employed in the retail business. We anticipate that an additional $50 million of proceeds will be generated through 2011. 
Turning to the Logistics business, we earned $17 million in Q1. We continue to believe we have very positive growth opportunities for the Logistics business. 
Now turning to the Coke business. Coke posted another solid contribution, earning $37 million in Q1 consistent with our guidance. We have been in startup mode at our Granite City Coke facility through the first quarter of 2010. As we discussed on Slide 10, at this time, we continue to work through some challenges within the operations that have caused our ramp up to be slower than planned. We're making the necessary adjustments so that we can run the plant as designed at full charge rate. At this time, however, we maintain our full-year guidance of SunCoke net income between $125 million to $140 million, as we expect some benefit from coal pricing at lower cost to offset the negative impact of a slower than planned ramp up in the Granite City operations. 
We also have a few more positive updates related to the SunCoke business that Lynn referenced earlier. We have started construction at our Middletown plant, and look forward to our first coke production from that plant occurring in the second half of 2011. Also as Lynn referenced earlier, we would like to announce our plans to expand our coal production at our Jewell mining facility. We plan to increase our production of our high-quality mid-vol coal at our Jewell mining facility by approximately 500,000 tons per year. We believe that our plan provides the company with an opportunity for income growth. We would initiate the project in the current quarter starting with the training of new minors. Under this plan, we expect to see increased production of coal starting in January of 2011, ramping up to our target production rate for the whole facility of 1.75 million annualized tons by the end of 2012. 
The required capital for the project is projected to be approximately $25 million, with the majority of capital spend occurring in 2011 and 2012. Using conservative estimates of coal prices relative to the current market, we anticipate a slightly negative impact to income in 2010 and '11 from the expansion project due to the cost of training new minors, with positive impact to income starting in 2012. If the coal markets continue to improve, we may see benefit from the increased production earlier and conversely, we may see less benefit from coal sales if the coal market declines. 
Lastly, we have recently initiated a study to update our measure of coal reserves at our Jewell mining facility. 
Turning to our Chemicals business, to close out our discussion on Non-refining results, as announced earlier this month, we successfully closed upon the sale of our Polypropylene business on March 31, for approximately $350 million in net proceeds which were received in early April. As a result, the results of our Polypropylene business are showing as discontinued operations in the first quarter. These results reflect some improvement in margins and lower costs as compared to the fourth quarter, and also benefit from LIFO inventory profits due to inventory draws. 
Finally, let me take a few minutes to discuss our financial position at the end of March. In conjunction with that, I direct you to Slide 11 and 12. From a fund flow perspective, our first-quarter net cash flow before debt activity was a positive $449 million, largely driven by the receipt of a tax refund of approximately $394 million related to net loss carrybacks. Additionally in February, Sunoco Logistics issued $500 million of senior notes to fund the previously announced incentive distribution exchange transaction with Sunoco, as well is to out pay outstanding borrowings under the Sunoco Logistics revolving credit facility.  
From a balance sheet perspective, our overall net debt position was $1.6 billion, down about $500 million from the fourth quarter. Of the $1.6 billion net debt position, approximately $1.1 billion of net debt was attributable to Sunoco Logistics, leaving approximately $500 million of net debt attributable to Sunoco at the parent level, which does not reflect the impact of the cash from the Polypropylene sale. 
We ended the quarter with a consolidated net debt-to-capital ratio of 34%. However, at the Sunoco level, excluding Sunoco Logistics, we ended the quarter with a consolidated net debt-to-total capital of 16%. From a liquidity perspective, at March 31, we had $812 million of cash and approximately $1.9 billion of available committed borrowing capacity, which includes approximately $414 million available for Sunoco Logistics. As I mentioned earlier, the cash balance at quarter end does not include the $350 million of proceeds from the sale of the Chemicals Polypropylene business as those cash proceeds were received in early April. 
And a final balance sheet note. At March 31 current replacement cost of all inventories valued at LIFO exceeds their carrying value by $2.8 billion. As we look forward to the remainder of 2010, we will continue to take appropriate actions that will assist us in maintaining our financial flexibility. To build a better Sunoco for the future and to deliver value to shareholders, we remain focused on the fundamentals, running our refinery safely and reliably at optimal capacity utilization, lowering our break even cost per barrel and improving margin capture. This focus will help us achieve our aspiration of becoming the preferred provider of transportation fuels in our markets. With that, I'll ask the operator to open up the lines for any questions."

Welcome to Sunoco's quarterly conference call where we will be discussing the company's first quarter earnings call that we reported this afternoon. With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer; and Clare McGrory, our Manager of Investor Relations. I'll start by making a few introductory comments and then Brian will address business results and comment on our overall financial position. As part of today's call, I will direct you to our website, www.sunocoinc.com, where we have posted number presentation slides which may provide a useful reference as we progress through the remarks. I'd also refer you to the Safe Harbor statement referenced in Slide #2 of the slide package, and as included in this afternoon's earnings release. So let's begin. 
As you can see from Slides 3 and 4, we reported quarterly net income, excluding special items of $17 million or $0.14 a share. These results reflect the market environment that remains very challenging, particularly for the Refining and Chemicals businesses which are still under significant pressure due to low demand and excess global supply. That said, during the quarter, we continue to take aggressive actions to address those issues within our control, and we are seeing the benefits of these actions in our results. 
Our first quarter Refining benchmark margins improved from the prior quarter. And we made progress in improving our Refining margin captured during the period that was challenged with low utilization due to two planned turnarounds at our Marcus Hook and Toledo refineries. We successfully completed both turnarounds in a safe manner, and are focused on running the refineries at optimal utilization rates for the remainder of the year. 
Excluding the discontinued Polypropylene business, our non-Refining businesses earned $78 million in the first quarter versus $49 million for the same quarter in 2009, which is largely due to good execution and a sharp focus on cost. Retail Marketing earned $21 million in the first quarter of 2010. Logistics earned $17 million with steady contributions from Sunoco Logistics Partners LP and our Coke segment earned $37 million. 
Our sharp focus on achieving a competitive cost structure continues this year. Cash, operating expenses, excluding fuel, utilities and the polypropylene operations that were sold in the first quarter were more than $50 million lower sequentially in the first quarter of this year versus the fourth quarter of 2009. This expense measurement basis is used internally to track our progress in reducing our controllable expenses, and demonstrates our efforts and success in driving our costs to a competitive level. 
As we consider the outlook for the remainder of 2010, we continue to expect the challenging market for petroleum and chemical products due to ongoing economic weakness and excess global supply. However, Sunoco is well prepared. The early proactive steps we took during this cycle have made us stronger, leaner and more competitive. We continue to drive toward a sustainably lower cost structure, and are focused on running our refineries safely, reliably at optimal capacity utilization, lowering our break even costs per barrel and improving margin capture, all of which are designed to increase our cash generation through operations. 
Our recent actions to strengthen our balance sheet have enabled us to maintain financial flexibility, and position us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities at our Logistics, Retail Marketing and Coke businesses. One such opportunity that we can announce today is a plan that was recently approved by management to expand production at our Jewell coal mining facility. Brian will talk about this in a bit more detail shortly. 
We are also pleased to announce that we started construction at our Middletown coke plant in early April. We have already signed an agreement with AK Steel in which they have agreed to purchase, over a 20-year period, all of the coke and available electrical power from this facility. Completion of the plant and it's first coke production is estimated for the second half of 2011. Now let me turn the call over to Brian."
305749,104692149,68093,"Sunoco Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","ETC Sunoco Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Lynn. First, let me comment on quarterly net income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported a net loss of $63 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in Q1, which included $80 million of net unfavorable special i",2045,"Thanks, Lynn. First, let me comment on quarterly net income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported a net loss of $63 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in Q1, which included $80 million of net unfavorable special items, as detailed in our earnings release and on Slide 5 of our web deck. 
We recorded a $44 million after-tax loss related to the divestment of the discontinued Polypropylene operations, as well as a $20 million after-tax provision for contract losses in connection with excess barge capacity resulting from the shutdown of Eagle Point refining operations. We also incurred additional charges totaling $16 million after-tax, associated with pension settlement losses and unfavorable deferred state income tax adjustments attributable to the continuing phenol operations. 
Before addressing some specifics regarding operating performance, let me just say that quarterly results, particularly for Refining, generally reflect a continuation of market weakness. While crack spreads improved from the fourth quarter, they remained depressed particularly in the Mid-Continent region. We were further challenged in Refining during the first quarter due to planned turnaround activity at two of our refineries, with significantly reduced utilization during the month of March. 
Our non-Refining operations however, continued to make positive contributions, generating returns consistent with the fourth quarter, excluding discontinued operations and the $41 million onetime tax credit that we've received in Q4. Additionally, the success of our actions to lower cost is reflected in our results. We have made some progress on margin capture, and we continue to pursue initiatives to improve our cost structure as financial positioning for the future. 
Regarding first quarter business unit results, I direct you to Slide 6. Refining and Supply had a $70 million pretax loss or $42 million after-tax in the first quarter of 2010, compared to a pretax loss of $226 million in Q4 or $135 million after-tax in Q4. While we are not satisfied with our Refining performance in the first quarter, we believe the $156 million pretax improvement sequentially versus the fourth quarter, especially in light of the two turnarounds we had underway in the first quarter, demonstrates that the actions we have taken to improve our Refining performance are beginning to yield results. 
Market margins improved from the prior quarter, and we made progress on both margin capture and cost reduction initiatives. But the planned turnarounds resulted in reduced utilizations and prevented us from covering all of our fixed costs. Operationally, crude unit utilization across the system in the first quarter was 79%. 
Before we talk in more detail about our first quarter 2010 margin realization, I would like to call your attention to a few changes that we've made to our benchmark margins, essentially, to make them more reflective of our market. These adjustments included an increase in our crude transportation cost and the addition of a jet component to our Toledo benchmark. The updated benchmarks are detailed on Slide 23. The changes do not affect comparability of realizations, as historical benchmarks have either been reinstated in the case of crude transportation costs or not materially different as a result of the change, as was the case with the addition of the Toledo jet component. 
With respect to our Q1 margin realizations, I refer you to Slide 7 and 8 for more detail on our Refining system crude costs and product differentials versus our benchmark. Our results generally reflect improvement in the first quarter versus recent quarters due largely to improved product realizations, with offsets in higher crude transportation rates and the impact of LIFO reserves. 
Even with the challenges that the turnarounds presented in achieving ratable sales and managing inventory, we did see improvements in capturing more of the benchmark margin as compared to last quarter, in particular, during the early part of the quarter and before the turnaround activity in March. While most of the factors that affect our realizations versus our benchmarks are typically market related, we continue to aggressively take actions on identified opportunities to improve our margin realizations versus benchmark margins, and we are seeing some early positive results. 
In general, our benchmarks are up approximately $2 per barrel on average from the fourth quarter of 2009, and our realized margins are also higher by about $2 per barrel. Our crude costs for the quarter averaged about $0.90 per barrel above our weighted benchmark, due to higher transportation costs and the impact of LIFO reserves. Our crude inventories fell significantly during the quarter and we reserved for these draws at the higher quarter end crude prices. By year-end, we are still expecting to have permanent draws of crude oil and refined product inventory related to our Eagle Point closure. But we are conservatively deferring recognition of any profit related to these draws in the event that other business drivers result in inventory builds that might offset these draws. 
On the product said, our average differential was approximately $0.67 per barrel, lower than our weighted benchmark. The product differentials were challenged in March during the turnarounds due largely to the lower yield gains and the costs of reserving for refined product inventory draws at higher quarter end pricing. The turnaround activity also impact the ratability of sales and hence, realized margins, particularly in Toledo where our benchmark margins were significantly better in March versus the rest of the quarter. 
As compared to the fourth quarter, average realizations on benchmark products in the first quarter were still improved even with the lower utilization in March. We successfully completed our planned cat cracker turnaround in Marcus Hook which limited production during all of March.  Additionally, the Toledo hydrocracker turnaround impacted production for a few weeks in March and was successfully completed in mid-April. Now that we have completed the turnarounds, we have the capacity to operate at or above 90% utilization in the Northeast. 
Now let's turn to our Non-refining businesses which continued to contribute positive results. Our Retail, Marketing, Logistics and Coke businesses earned $75 million after-tax in aggregate during the quarter as detailed on Slide 9. 
Retail Marketing earned $21 million in the first quarter of 2010. Retail gasoline margins remained fairly consistent with the prior quarter but sales volumes were lower, a decline consistent with DOE statistics and attributable to poor weather conditions in the Northeast. During the quarter, we also continue to execute in our Retail Portfolio Management program and, generated approximately $8 million of proceeds and $3 million of after-tax gains on site sales through the sale of 16 sites, primarily to Sunoco branded dealers and distributors. Approximately 80% of the sites divested continue to be in the Sunoco dealer or distribution portfolio. We will continue to use this program to enhance our overall return on capital employed in the retail business. We anticipate that an additional $50 million of proceeds will be generated through 2011. 
Turning to the Logistics business, we earned $17 million in Q1. We continue to believe we have very positive growth opportunities for the Logistics business. 
Now turning to the Coke business. Coke posted another solid contribution, earning $37 million in Q1 consistent with our guidance. We have been in startup mode at our Granite City Coke facility through the first quarter of 2010. As we discussed on Slide 10, at this time, we continue to work through some challenges within the operations that have caused our ramp up to be slower than planned. We're making the necessary adjustments so that we can run the plant as designed at full charge rate. At this time, however, we maintain our full-year guidance of SunCoke net income between $125 million to $140 million, as we expect some benefit from coal pricing at lower cost to offset the negative impact of a slower than planned ramp up in the Granite City operations. 
We also have a few more positive updates related to the SunCoke business that Lynn referenced earlier. We have started construction at our Middletown plant, and look forward to our first coke production from that plant occurring in the second half of 2011. Also as Lynn referenced earlier, we would like to announce our plans to expand our coal production at our Jewell mining facility. We plan to increase our production of our high-quality mid-vol coal at our Jewell mining facility by approximately 500,000 tons per year. We believe that our plan provides the company with an opportunity for income growth. We would initiate the project in the current quarter starting with the training of new minors. Under this plan, we expect to see increased production of coal starting in January of 2011, ramping up to our target production rate for the whole facility of 1.75 million annualized tons by the end of 2012. 
The required capital for the project is projected to be approximately $25 million, with the majority of capital spend occurring in 2011 and 2012. Using conservative estimates of coal prices relative to the current market, we anticipate a slightly negative impact to income in 2010 and '11 from the expansion project due to the cost of training new minors, with positive impact to income starting in 2012. If the coal markets continue to improve, we may see benefit from the increased production earlier and conversely, we may see less benefit from coal sales if the coal market declines. 
Lastly, we have recently initiated a study to update our measure of coal reserves at our Jewell mining facility. 
Turning to our Chemicals business, to close out our discussion on Non-refining results, as announced earlier this month, we successfully closed upon the sale of our Polypropylene business on March 31, for approximately $350 million in net proceeds which were received in early April. As a result, the results of our Polypropylene business are showing as discontinued operations in the first quarter. These results reflect some improvement in margins and lower costs as compared to the fourth quarter, and also benefit from LIFO inventory profits due to inventory draws. 
Finally, let me take a few minutes to discuss our financial position at the end of March. In conjunction with that, I direct you to Slide 11 and 12. From a fund flow perspective, our first-quarter net cash flow before debt activity was a positive $449 million, largely driven by the receipt of a tax refund of approximately $394 million related to net loss carrybacks. Additionally in February, Sunoco Logistics issued $500 million of senior notes to fund the previously announced incentive distribution exchange transaction with Sunoco, as well is to out pay outstanding borrowings under the Sunoco Logistics revolving credit facility.  
From a balance sheet perspective, our overall net debt position was $1.6 billion, down about $500 million from the fourth quarter. Of the $1.6 billion net debt position, approximately $1.1 billion of net debt was attributable to Sunoco Logistics, leaving approximately $500 million of net debt attributable to Sunoco at the parent level, which does not reflect the impact of the cash from the Polypropylene sale. 
We ended the quarter with a consolidated net debt-to-capital ratio of 34%. However, at the Sunoco level, excluding Sunoco Logistics, we ended the quarter with a consolidated net debt-to-total capital of 16%. From a liquidity perspective, at March 31, we had $812 million of cash and approximately $1.9 billion of available committed borrowing capacity, which includes approximately $414 million available for Sunoco Logistics. As I mentioned earlier, the cash balance at quarter end does not include the $350 million of proceeds from the sale of the Chemicals Polypropylene business as those cash proceeds were received in early April. 
And a final balance sheet note. At March 31 current replacement cost of all inventories valued at LIFO exceeds their carrying value by $2.8 billion. As we look forward to the remainder of 2010, we will continue to take appropriate actions that will assist us in maintaining our financial flexibility. To build a better Sunoco for the future and to deliver value to shareholders, we remain focused on the fundamentals, running our refinery safely and reliably at optimal capacity utilization, lowering our break even cost per barrel and improving margin capture. This focus will help us achieve our aspiration of becoming the preferred provider of transportation fuels in our markets. With that, I'll ask the operator to open up the lines for any questions."

Welcome to Sunoco’s quarterly conference call, where we will be discussing the company’s second quarter earnings that we reported this afternoon.With me today are Brian MacDonald, our",990,"Thank you, Paula, and thank you and good evening to the audience. Welcome to Sunoco’s quarterly conference call, where we will be discussing the company’s second quarter earnings that we reported this afternoon.
With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer; and Clare McGrory, the Manager of Investor Relations.
I’ll start by making a few introductory comments, and then Brian will address business results and comment on our overall financial position.
As part of today’s call, I would direct you to our Website, www.sunocoinc.com, where we have posted a number of presentation slides, which may provide a useful reference as we progress through our remarks. I’d also refer you to the Safe Harbor statement referenced in Slide #2 of the slide package, as we included it in this afternoon’s earning release. So now let’s begin.
Our second quarter results continue to show the benefits of the aggressive actions that we’ve taken to address the business issues within our control, and I’m pleased with the progress we’re making.
Our focus on margin capture and the decisive actions we’ve taken to reduce cost and improve reliability have returned our refining business to profitability for the first time since Q1 2009, and enabled our non-refining businesses to generate value and allowed us to build our cash position to $1.5 billion.
As you can see from Slide #3 and #4, we earned $158 million in net income excluding special items, or $1.31 per share. I’ll describe how we achieved that result in three parts.
First, we brought our refining business back to profitability by improving our margin capture and continuing to drive our cost. We also ran our refineries very well during the second quarter achieving 92% crude utilization rate. That’s the highest level since 2007.
The combination of better margin capture, plus cost reduction, plus safe and reliable operations along with some help from improved benchmarked margins enabled us to earn $86 million in refining alone.
The second part of this story involves our non-refining businesses which earned $166 million pretax. In addition to providing steady earnings for yet another quarter, they continued to grow and create value.
Sunoco Logistics recently announced the purchase of Texon, a butane blending business, which holds great promise for increasing earning, and represents real progress towards offering this state-of-the-art blending capabilities at terminals that differentiate Sunoco Logistics from competitors and help Sunoco to become the premier provider of transportation fuels in its markets.
In addition the recent announcement of Project Mariner, an effort to move ethane from Western Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale to Philadelphia for eventual transport to the Gulf Coast is another promising opportunity for Logistics.
The partnership also announced that it has exercised certain rights to increase its ownership interest in Mid-Valley Pipeline Company, West Texas Gulf Pipe Line Company and West Shore Pipe Line Company. These three pipeline transactions are expected to close within the next 30 days for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $100 million.
Sunoco Logistics isn’t the only area of the business where good things are happening. In June, we also started operations at our ethanol facility plant at Fulton New York as the largest ethanol plant in Northeast where much of our retail network is located.
The plant is uniquely situated to serve our ethanol requirements. At full production, it will provide up to 20% of our ethanol needs. As always, we continue to actively evaluate additional opportunities for growth within both the Retail and Logistics business.
The third and very important, development of our second quarter story is the strength of our balance sheet, which Brian will talk about in more detail later. We currently have about $1.5 billion in cash on hand and net debt of zero at the Sunoco parent level. We have come a long way and intend to continue protecting our balance sheet going forward.
As we get deeper into 2010, we expect market conditions for petroleum and chemical products to remain challenging. Demand is weak, product inventories across the industry are high, and margins are still pressured. However, we believe we are prepared.
We are working hard to further lower our break-even cost per barrel, so that we are profitable even in the worst of times. We are focusing on sustaining the progress we have made in margin capture and we are going to continue to run our refinery safely and reliable at the optimal capacity utilization.
This relentless focus on the fundamentals of our business will get us through the rest of the current down cycle in refining, but it’s delivering to shareholders on the promise of our brand-led future in the fuels business and to separate SunCoke Energy that we are really preparing for.
Our plan to separate SunCoke Energy from the rest of Sunoco in the first half of next year was conceived to unlock shareholder value and maximize the future success of both entities. The fuels and coke business are distinct businesses, with different models, different sets of customers and no significant integration or synergy.
With a dedicated management team and direct access to capital markets, SunCoke Energy will be better able to achieve the scale needed to pursue domestic and international growth opportunities.
Similarly Sunoco’s streamlined fuels business will be better positioned to become the premier provider of transportation fuels in its markets.
Before I turn the call over to Brian, I’ll say one more thing about the brand-led strategy that’s shaping Sunoco’s future. Whether we’re talking about petroleum-based fuels, pure bio fuels or some blend of the two, liquid fuels will be around for a long time.
We think there is good value to be created by being the supplier of choice for those fuels and having an iconic brand like the Sunoco Diamond that’s visible, durable and that customer’s trust is important. Sunoco wants to be positioned to provide the transportation fuels to the marketplace demand.
Now, let me turn the call over to Brian.

305749,109559704,70599,"Sunoco Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","ETC Sunoco Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Lynn. First, let me comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported pretax income of $225 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders, which included $22 million pretax of net unfavorable special",1593,"Thanks, Lynn. First, let me comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported pretax income of $225 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders, which included $22 million pretax of net unfavorable special items.
The special items were primarily associated with pension settlement losses, employee terminations and related costs in connection with the business improvement initiative.
Our share of focus on achieving a competitive cost structure continues to yield results. Year-to-date cash operating expenses during the second quarter excluding fuel, utilities and discontinued operations were more than $100 million lower than the prior year’s expenses.
This expense measurement basis is used internally to track our progress and reducing our controllable expenses and demonstrates our efforts and success in driving our costs to a competitive level.
Before addressing some specifics regarding operating performance, let me say that we are very pleased with our performance during the quarter in which the market continued to present significant challenges. However, we cannot lose focus on the fundamentals as we believe that excess supply and low demand will continue to challenge our performance.
Regarding Q2 business unit results, I direct you to Slide #5, refining and supply had income of $138 million pretax or $86 million after-tax in the second quarter compared to the loss of $70 million pretax of $42 million after-tax in the first quarter. This represents the first quarter that we have generated profits for refining and supply since the first quarter of 2009.
While there were market factors that contributed to our strong performance, our actions to improve margin capture, our costs position and reliability were significant factors in achieving profitable results this quarter.
Operationally, we achieved a crude unit utilization rate of 92%, the highest system-wide utilization rated since 2007, and this quarter presented the first opportunity since the Eagle Point shutdown to optimize our Northeast as we underwent turnaround activity in the first quarter. Our system-wide conversion unit utilization rate was also strong at 90%.
With respect to Q2 marketing realization, I refer you to Slide #6 and #7 for more detail on our refining system crude costs and product differentials versus our benchmark. Our results reflect significant improvement in the second quarter versus recent quarters due to improved product realization as well as lower crude differentials.
As we indicated at last quarter’s conference call, we are capturing more of the benchmark margin that is available to us. While this was not very apparent in the first quarter results due to our planned turnaround activity as we increased utilization during the second quarter after our turnarounds, the progress we made is more visible in the results.
Well there are number of factors that affect our realization versus our benchmarks, we have aggressively taken actions to improve our margin realizations versus benchmark margins, and we are seeing some positive results.
In general, our benchmarks are up approximately $0.85 per barrel on average in the first quarter of 2010, while our realized margins were higher by about $3.25 per barrel.
As you can see on Slide #6, the improvement in our realized margins from the first quarter greatly exceeded the rise in the benchmark margin, and was about evenly spread between crude differentials and product differentials.
The improvement in crude differentials was largely driven by market conditions, falling crude prices specifically, while the product differential improvement can to a large degree be attributed to the success of our efforts to better match refining operations with market opportunities.
Our crude cost for the quarter averaged about $0.33 per barrel below our weighted benchmark, largely market driven as our crude prices are on a lag, and crude prices were falling during the quarter.
On the product side, our average differential was approximately $0.50 per barrel above our weighted benchmark. We are realizing better margins on our refinery production as we focus on taking advantage of the margin opportunities that exist and endeavor to ensure that our production is placed through the most profitable channels.
As the spread for higher value product such as diesel and premium gasoline widened, we shifted production to capture these opportunities. In the Northeast, we increased premium gasoline production 20% as compared to the second quarter of 2009, and across the entire system we increased ULSD production 33% from the second quarter of 2009.
In summary, our strong focus on operations and market opportunities led to strong performance in margin capture this quarter. Based on the progress, we have made we feel confident we can continue to deliver strong results within the controllable aspects of margin capture, but there can be market or operational factors which can affect our margin capture rate in any given reporting period.
Now let’s turn to the non-refining businesses which continue to contribute positive results. Our Retail Marketing, Logistics and Coke businesses earned $159 million pretax, $106 million after-tax, in aggregate during the quarter as detailed on Slide #8.
Retail Marketing earned $73 million pretax, $45 million after-tax in the second quarter of 2010. Retail gasoline margins were better than both the prior year and the first quarter of 2010 as they benefited from the decline in wholesale gasoline prices that occurred largely during May. Logistics earned $30 million pretax, $20 million after-tax. This business continues to be a source of steady earnings for Sunoco.
During the second quarter, we announced several new growth opportunities for the business and we continue to believe there are additional positive growth opportunities in the future.
Coke posted another solid contribution, earning $56 million pretax, $41 million after-tax in Q2 consistent with guidance, and as we noted last quarter, our Granite City coke facility encountered a slower startup than planned as we encountered some challenges within the operation.
We have made adjustments which should enable us to run the plant as designed at or near full charge rates for the remainder of the year. At this time, we maintain our full year guidance for SunCoke net income between $125 million to $140 million.
As Lynn previously indicated, with regard to the Coke business, construction continues as planned on our Middletown plant, and we look forward to our first coke production from that plant occurring in the second half of 2011.
Additionally, as announced last quarter, we have embarked on a project to increase our coal production at our SunCoke Jewell mining facility by approximately 0.5 million tons per year. We have initiated the project starting with the training of new miners. Lastly, our study to update the measure of our coal reserves at our Jewell mining facility is progressing.
Finally, let me take a few minutes to discuss our financial position at the end of June. In conjunction with that I direct you to Slides #9 and #10. From a cash flow perspective, our second quarter net cash flow before debt activity was approximately positive $580 million, largely driven by strong operating cash flow and a receipt of proceeds from the sale of the polypropylene business.
From a balance sheet perspective, at the Sunoco parent level, we ended the quarter with a net cash position of approximately $150 million, which included an improved cash position of $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion of debt.
On a consolidated basis, of the $1.1 billion net debt position approximately $1.2 billion of net debt was attributable to Sunoco Logistics Partners. We ended the quarter with a consolidated net debt-to-capital ratio of 25%. However, at the Sunoco level excluding Sunoco Logistics, we ended the quarter with a consolidated net debt-to-capital ratio of negative 6%.
From a liquidity standpoint at June 30, we had $1.5 billion of cash and approximately $1.8 billion of available committed borrowing capacity, which includes approximately $300 million available to Sunoco Logistics.
I also want to call your attention to a recent announcement that Sunoco was participating in the funding of Sunoco Logistics Partners acquisition of a butane blending business from Texon was $100 million loan to the partnership.
As reflected in our balance sheet, our financial position liquidity is very strong. As we look forward to the remainder of 2010, we will continue to take appropriate actions that will assist us in maintaining our financial flexibility to pursue attractive opportunities in our growth businesses.
A final balance sheet note related to inventory. At June 30, the current replacement costs of all the inventories valued at LIFO exceeds their carrying value by $2.6 billion.
I’ll take a few minutes to address our plans to separate SunCoke. As Lynn indicated earlier, this plan separation is part of a strategy to unlock shareholder value and maximize the future success of both entities. We have no changes to the plans that we discussed at our Analyst Meeting, approximately a month ago.
We still plan to affect the separation in the first half of 2011 and are in the process of evaluating appropriate form of separation in the capital structures that will exist for both entities. We will share more information when we are able to within the confines of the process.
So, in closing to build a better Sunoco and to deliver value to shareholders, we remain focused on the fundamentals, running our refineries safely and reliably at optimal capacity utilization, lowering our break-even cost per barrel, and furthering the progress we have made in capturing available margin. This focus in continued investment in our brand and ability to serve customers will help us achieve our aspiration of becoming the preferred provider of transportation fuels in our markets.
With that, I’ll ask the operator to open up the lines for your questions.

I wouldn’t say it’s systemic as much as it is market opportunity, and one, being able to take advantage of that opportunity through having good reliable operation, so that part of it you could now talk about as being systemically different in terms of we’re very, very focused on that.
But then depending on what the market suggests would be the most optimum slate to run. In some of those cases, the quality differentials in the market are going to be better, in some cases they are not going to be as good. So, I wouldn’t say that systemic as much as it is quality differentials on some of the crudes like a Doba or Syncrude change over time and they were relatively better this past quarter.
The other part of your question on the product differential; I’d tell you is much the same kind of answer that good product reliability is the key, but I would point out that on the ability to produce ultra low sulfur diesel we do have a structural change, and we were able to produce a record amount because of the Philadelphia hydrocracker project that came on in the fourth quarter of ‘09 that now that we saw some good margin in ULSD we were able to take advantage of that because of the project that had come on. And then additionally just post the Toledo hydrocracker turnaround and that hydrocracker running very well, the combination of the two led to a record on the diesel production.

As I think we’ve mentioned before, we’ve made this one of our executive compensation metrics for the company, for the entire company for 2010. So the organization is pretty focused on improving our margin capture. That all said, there will be some quarters which are better than others in terms of what’s going on in the market and what are the particular opportunities, but I think the takeaway should be that we weren’t very satisfied with how this progressed last year and we’ve made it a pretty big area of focus, and we hope that we will continue to run at a rate better than we have over the recent past.

Welcome to Sunoco's quarterly conference call where we will discuss the company's third quarter earnings that we reported this afternoon. With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer; and Clare McGrory, Manag",777,"Thank you, and good evening. Welcome to Sunoco's quarterly conference call where we will discuss the company's third quarter earnings that we reported this afternoon. With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer; and Clare McGrory, Manager of Investor Relations. I'll start by making a few introductory comments, and then Brian will address business results and comment on the overall financial position. 
As part of today's call, I'd like to direct you to our website, www.sunocoinc.com, where we have posted a number of presentation slides, which may provide a useful reference as we progress through our remarks. I would also refer you to the Safe Harbor statement referenced in Slide 2 at the Slide package and is included in the afternoon's earnings release. 
Now let's begin. In the third quarter, we faced a challenging market environment, particularly in the Northeast. Excess supply pressures margins, which deteriorated from second quarter levels. In addition, rising crude costs at the end of the quarter hurt our result. However, our year-over-year third quarter results which have comparable market conditions in both periods improved significantly, thanks to the actions that we have taken to address the business which is in our control. 
As you can see from Slide 3 and 4, we earned $27 million in net income, excluding special items or $0.22 per share. There are three aspects of our performance this quarter that I would like to review. First, I will cover the Fuels business, particularly in Retail and Logistics, which together earned $110 million in pretax income during the quarter. Either strong business that are generating significant value today, and which present promising opportunities for continued growth. 
During the third quarter, Sunoco Logistics Partners LT closed on the purchase of additional ownership interest in three pipeline joint ventures. These moves added immediate value to both Sunoco and Sunoco Logistics. And we continue to evaluate other opportunities for growth in both these businesses. 
Continuing with the Fuels business, Refining and Supply posted a loss of $70 million pretax in the quarter. We face deterioration in market margins, which at least temporarily overshadowed our ongoing work on the controllable areas of our business. Market conditions in the third quarter demonstrated that we continue to face challenges in the business segment. However, I call your attention to the fact that in Refining and Supply, we are near break even on a year-to-date basis compared to last year, that's an improvement of approximately $205 million pretax. 
Now we're certainly not satisfied with break-even performance, but that kind of improvement reflects the progress we've made. We expect that the fourth quarter will be at least as challenging as the first three quarters of 2010. And accordingly, we've maintained focus on the fundamentals of safety and reliability, margin capture and maintaining a competitive cost structure. 
The second aspect of our performance that I'll cover is the Coke business , which had a strong quarter and earned $44 million of pretax income. We benefited from strong operations in a positive market condition. Coke continued success set the stage for promising future as a stand-alone business. In addition, we continue to see strong growth opportunities in Coke both in the U.S. and internationally over the next 10 or more years. 
Finally, the third element of the quarter that I will touch on is the strength of our balance sheet, which Brian will talk about in more detail later. Our cash balance continues to be healthy and our debt position is strong at approximately $175 million, excluding Sunoco Logistics. 
At the end of the third quarter, our net debt to capital ratio for Sunoco, excluding SXL, was 6% as compared to 39% at the same time last year. Our improvement over time is evident and we will continue protecting our balance sheet going forward. 
At the third quarter, market environment has demonstrated, we expect market conditions for petroleum and chemical products to remain challenging, demand is weak, product inventories across the industry are high and margins are still under pressure. We're working hard to further lower our breakeven cost per barrel so that we're able to generate cash in difficult times. We're focused on sustaining the progress we've made in margin capture, and we're going to continue to run our refineries safely and reliably at optimal capacity utilization. 
Focus on the fundamentals of our business will get us through the rest of the current downcycle and refining and it's delivering to shareholders on the promise of our brands and Logistics led future in the Fuels business and a separate Coke company, SunCoke Energy that we're preparing for. Let me now turn the call over to Brian."
305749,114457611,83017,"Sunoco Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","ETC Sunoco Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Lynn. First, let me comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items.

First, let me comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported pretax income of $95 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in Q3, which included $62 million of pretax net favorable special items. The special items were primarily associated with pension settlement losses, employee terminations and related costs in connection with the business improvement initiative, a gain on an MTBE insurance settlement and a non-cash gain related to an acquisition accounting at Sunoco Logistics. 
While we've delivered another strong quarter in our Retail Logistics and Coke businesses, we continue to face challenging market conditions in our Refining and Supply business. As seen on Slide 4, Refining and Supply recorded a pretax loss of $70 million as excess supply and continued low demand pressured market cracks further downward from the prior quarter. While we are certainly not satisfied in posting a loss in our Refining and Supply business, the business did improve as pretax income by $112 million as compared to the same quarter of last year when market conditions were fairly similar to this quarter. We feel confident that this significant improvement is, to a large degree, the result of actions we have taken including the closure of the Eagle Point refinery, the focus on reliability and optimization of our plants, re-engineering our market strategy, and last but not the least, our initiatives around cost structure.  Our sharp focus on achieving a competitive cost structure continues to yield results. 
Year-to-date cash operating expenses to the third quarter, excluding fuel, utilities and discontinued operations, were approximately $170 million lower than the prior years. Excluding the Coke business where we're adding costs as we grow and prepare for separation, the improvement versus prior year is approximately $200 million. This expense measure of cash operating expenses x fuel and utilities is used internally to track our products and reducing our controllable expenses, and is also part of our executive compensation targets and demonstrates our efforts and success in driving our costs to a competitive level. 
A year ago, when we announced our decision to close the Eagle Point refinery, we communicated our goal to achieve breakeven cash flow in our Refining and Supply business even within the tough market environment like we were experiencing at the time. As a result of the actions we have taken, on a year-to-date basis, we are free cash flow breakeven in our Refining and Supply business, excluding working capital changes. And in the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect to generate significant cash through the permanent liquidation of inventories, largely related to the closure of the Eagle Point refinery. So we plan to achieve positive cash flow in Refining and Supply in 2010, pouring a substantial decline in the market during the fourth quarter. This reflects a significant improvement in the Refining and Supply business as compared to last year when the business experienced a significant cash burn. So while we continue to be pleased with our progress in many of the controllable aspects of our operations, it is evident that the market will continue to present significant challenges and we maintain focus on the fundamentals to ensure we are competitive with our assets. 
Regarding our Q3 business unit results, I direct you to Slides 4 through 8. Specifically, Retail Marketing earned $68 million pretax in the third quarter of 2010, while retail gasoline margins were below the strong periods of second quarter and the prior year, they were still relatively strong despite the overall rise in wholesale gasoline prices during the period, which typically pressures retail margins. 
As compared to the same quarter of the prior year, gasoline and diesel volumes were up about 1% and 8%, respectively on an open both years basis. Additionally, we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities, and we have been successful at growing our Distributor business incrementally adding net 86 tight store network during the third quarter. At the end of the third quarter, 4,829 total sites carried the Sunoco flag, and we want to grow that further. 
Logistics are in $42 million pretax as Sunoco Logistics Partners continues to be a reliable and ratable source of earnings for Sunoco. The throughput in term lien business has proven to be a ratable and growing business and is supplement to by crude oil market opportunities when contango market structures exist. 
During the third quarter, we closed on the purchase of three pipeline interest that are immediately accretive to earnings, and we continue to believe there are additional positive growth opportunities in the future. Sunoco Logistics Partners is projecting over $435 million in total capital expenditures in 2010, including both organic and acquisition projects. 
As we mentioned in our Q2 earnings calls, Sunoco has facilitated some of this growth via $100 million intercompany loan to Sunoco Logistics that occurred in Q3 and was one of the primary reasons that our cash balance is lower in Q3 versus Q2. 
Coke posted another solid contribution earning $44 million pretax in Q3. During the third quarter, we operate it well in all of our facilities, including our Granite City facility, which started operations late last year. We also benefited during this period from spot sales of Coke production from the 2009 downturn. At this time, we maintained our full year guidance for SunCoke net income at $125 million to $140 million in net income as we expect expenses to be higher from investments and growth in separation planning and no spot Coke sales in Q4. 
As shown on Slide 6, Refining and Supply had a loss of $70 million pretax in the third quarter 2010 compared to a loss of $182 million pretax in the same quarter of 2009. If you recall, last quarter was the first quarter that we generated profits for Refining and Supply since the first quarter of 2009. In our last quarterly call, we said there were market factors that contributed to our strong performance, our actions to improve margin capture, cost position and reliability were significant factors in achieving profitable results. 
In the third quarter, market conditions deteriorated particularly in the Northeast. For the aspects of our business that are under our control, we largely performed well, although we did experience some operational issues that will impact our performance in the fourth quarter. Operationally, we achieved a crude unit utilization rate of 94%, higher than last quarter and in line with our plan. However, our systemwide Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel production was down by approximately 4,000 barrels per day from the second quarter due to some operational issues. 
With respect to our Q3 margin realizations, I refer you to Slides 7 and 8 for more detail on the refining system crude costs and product differentials versus our benchmark. Our third quarter results reflect significant improvement versus the same quarter of the prior year. As we indicated at last quarter's conference call, we are capturing more of the benchmark margin that is available to us and this is evident again this quarter in the year-over-year improvement. While there are number of factors that affect our realizations versus our benchmarks, which are market related, we have taken actions on identified opportunities to improve our margin realizations versus benchmark margins, and we continue to see the benefits from these actions. 
As you can see on Slide 7, our refining-wide, Refining and Supply benchmark averaged $4.87 per barrel for the third quarter, only about $0.30 better than the same quarter of last year. However, our margin capture of 80% was significantly improved from Q3 '09 margin capture of 60%. And excluding the negative impact of crude timing, margin capture for the third quarter of 2010 was 90%. The significant improvement in margin capture versus last year can be attributed to improve reliability and the successful strategy matching the operations to market opportunities. The improved reliability in utilization is both in the Northeast and Toledo.  Overall, as compared to last year, we benefited from higher overall distillates and ULSD production as a percent of total production. 
In Q3 2010, 37% of our net production was distillates versus 33% in Q3 '09 with the offset and less of achieved for residual field. Our actions has supported this improvement include the closure of Eagle Point, adjustments in our crudes play and the operation of the new hydrocracker unit in Philadelphia. Within the distillate pool, we are operating more of the distillate ULSD versus last year and Northeast ULSD differentials have wind by more than $0.02 a gallon quarter-over-quarter. 
Using second quarter 2010 as a basis, benchmark margins and margin capture declined in the third quarter and shows us that even with the improvement from last year, we have more work to do on cost reduction and margin capture. Benchmark margins fell by $1.65 per barrel on average as neither gasoline prices nor distillate prices kept up with a rising crude cost. Realized margins were $3.88 per barrel, resulting in a margin capture of 80% versus 113% in the second quarter. The biggest driver in this decline in margin capture from the second quarter to the third quarter was within crude differentials, and largely due to market conditions, namely rising crude prices. 
Our crude cost for the quarter averaged about $0.92 per barrel above our weighted benchmark and approximately $0.50 of the $0.92 relates to the timing of our crude prices. This factor is a complete reversal from the prior quarter when crude prices were falling and timing actually provided a benefit to our realized margins. As a reminder, our crude purchases in the Northeast priced in the lag and the price of crude rose during the quarter and in particular during the latter period of pricing in the first five days of October. 
Excluding the impact of crude timing in either quarter, margin capture dropped from approximately 104% in Q2 to approximately 90% in Q3. On the product side, our average differential was approximately $0.07 per barrel below our weighted benchmark. While this bid drop off from a very strong Q2 performance, as you compare it to the last several periods, you will see that it was dramatically improved and reflects our focus on improving our reliability and placing our production through the most profitable channels. 
Relative to Q2, the product realizations were challenged by a following gasoline market. In the third quarter, the gasoline crack in the Northeast declined by almost $4 per barrel from the prior quarter. Additionally, we did not get the same lift in realized margins and margin capture from value-added products as premium and our above differentials in conventional gasoline also narrowed substantially. 
In the period of rising absolute prices, petrochemical and other non-crack product prices were not able to keep pace with the rising and volatile benchmark prices. Lastly and the fact that it was most within our control, the ULSD production, the Northeast complex dropped from the second quarter levels due to operational issues. In summary, we still feel confident that we're executing on many of the factors within our control, both operational and how we are approaching the market. As we noted last quarter, there can be market factors which affect our margin capture rate in any given reporting period as with the case this quarter. We have remain focused on the fundamentals and those elements within our control. To drive Sunoco performance in whatever environment exists. 
So in the fourth quarter, we will be performing maintenance in our Northeast system. Additionally our crude throughput and Toledo will be negatively impacted by pipeline allocations that resulted from the Enbridge line interruptions. Accordingly, we expect challenge Refining and Supply results in Q4, given the resulting low-utilization level and weak market conditions. 
Finally, let me take a few minutes to discuss our fiscal position at the end of the quarter. In conjunction with that, I direct you to Slides 9 and 10. From a funds low perspective, our third quarter net cash flow before debt activity at Sunoco, excluding Sunoco Logistics, was the use of approximately $327 million. We ended the quarter with a net debt position of approximately $175 million, excluding Sunoco Logistics. The sequential cash decline in the quarter was driven by working capital movements and the loan of $100 million by Sunoco to Sunoco Logistics to help support its acquisition of Texon, a Butane Blending business. We ended the quarter with a net debt of capital ratio of 6% at the Sunoco level, excluding Sunoco Logistics. 
At September 30, we had $1.1 billion of cash and approximately $1.5 billion of available committed borrowing capacity at Sunoco, excluding Sunoco Logistics. As reflected in our balance sheet, our financial position and liquidity continues to be very strong. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2010, we do plan to generate cash flow through the permanent liquidation of the inventory that's primarily to Eagle Point closure. As we look forward to the remaining months of 2010 and into 2011, we will continue to take appropriate actions that will assist us in maintaining our financial flexibility to pursue attractive opportunities in our growth businesses, as well as ride out the refining downturn. 
As an update to our capital plans for 2010, our latest planned capital spending for Refining and Supply in 2010 is approximately $225 million, about $50 million less than we last guided in June. This reduction has been achieved primarily due to cost efficiencies in projects as well as some deferred projects which have no impact on safe and reliable operations. There are no other changes to our 2010 capital guidance at this point in time. 
For 2011, our planned capital spending for Refining and Supply is between $225 million and $250 million in line with current year spend and below DD&A. 
A final balance sheet note related to inventory. At September 30, the current replacement cost of all inventories valued at LIFO exceeds their carrying value by $2.8 billion. I'll take a few minutes to Provide an update on our plans to separate SunCoke. As we have said, this planned separation is part of a strategy to unlock shareholder value and maximize the future success of both Sunoco and SunCoke. We still plan to affect the separation in the first half of 2011 and are in the process of evaluating the appropriate form of separation. 
During the third quarter, we announced the hiring of Fritz Henderson to lead the separated SunCoke business. We also announced that the business will relocate after the separation to a city more internationally accessible with the preferred location being Chicago. Most recently in late October, we filed our IRS private letter ruling requesting the tax re-separation. We continue to work through the other aspects of the separation process, including any filings that would be necessary if SunCoke were to be a separate public company. As you can see we are moving steadily down the path to separation in the first half of 2011, and we will share more information when we are able to within the confines of the process. 
So in closing, to build a better Sunoco and to deliver value to shareholders, we remain focused on the fundamentals: Running our refineries safely and reliably in optimal capacity; lowering our breakeven cost per barrel; and furthering the progress we have made in capturing available margins. This focus and continued investment in our brand and ability to serve customers will help us achieve our aspiration of becoming the preferred provider of transportation fuels in our markets. 
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the lines for any questions you may have."

So when we announced the closure of Eagle Point, we said that we would take out roughly between $250 million and $300 million of inventory related to that. We took about half of that out in the fourth quarter of last year. And so as we get to the fourth quarter, we become more in the range of the second half of that and they move up and down a little bit based upon market conditions and things that are going on in the operations, but that's kind of broadly the magnitude of the second half of that inventory reduction, which we said, would be permanent. The second question with regard to CapEx, and the CapEx being in refining below the DD&A, at this time, we're only giving guidance for 2011 which is obviously below DD&A. And what I would say is that over the last few years, Sunoco had invested a lot of capital into the refining assets for various consent decree and other projects. So you need to put the current capital spend against DD&A in the context of the kind of projects in particular consent decree projects that were done for most of the recent past."

Welcome to Sunoco’s quarterly conference call where we will discuss the company’s third quarter earnings that were reported this afternoon.With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer and Clare McGrory,",778,"Thank you, and good evening. Welcome to Sunoco’s quarterly conference call where we will discuss the company’s third quarter earnings that were reported this afternoon.
With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer and Clare McGrory, Manager of Investor Relations.
I’ll start by making a few introductory comments, and then Brian will address business results and comment on the overall financial position.
As part of today’s call, I would like to direct you to our Web site www.sunocoinc.com, where we have posted a number of presentation slides, which may provide a useful reference as we progress through our remarks.
I’d also refer you to the Safe Harbor statement referenced in slide two of the slide package and is included in the afternoon’s earnings release. Now, let’s begin.
In the third quarter, we faced the challenging market environment, particularly in the Northeast. Excess supply, pressures margins which deteriorated from second quarter level.
In addition, rising crude cost at the end of the quarter (inaudible) our results. However, our year-over-year third quarter results which had comparable market conditions in those periods improved significantly, thanks to the actions that we have taken to address the business systems within our control.
As you can see from slides three and four, we earned $27 million in net income excluding special items or $0.22 per share. There are three aspects of our performance this quarter that I would like to review. First, I will cover the fuels business, particularly in Retail and Logistics, which together earned $110 million in pre-tax income during the quarter. These are strong businesses that are generating significant value today and which present promising opportunities for continued growth.
During the third quarter, Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. closed on the purchase of additional ownership interests in three pipeline joint ventures. These news added immediate value to both Sunoco and Sunoco Logistics and we continue to evaluate other opportunities for growth, in both of these businesses.
Continuing with the fuels business, Refining and Supply posted a loss of $70 million pre-tax in the quarter. We faced deterioration in market margins, which at least temporarily overshadowed our ongoing work in the controllable areas of our business.
Market conditions in the third quarter demonstrated that, we continue to face challenges in this business segment; however, I call your attention to the fact that in Refining and Supply we are near breakeven on a year-to-date basis compared to last year, that’s an improvement of approximately $285 million pre-tax.
Now, we’re certainly not satisfied with breakeven performance, but that kind of improvement reflects the progress we have made. We expect that the fourth quarter will be at least as challenging as the first three quarters of 2010, and accordingly, we have maintained focus on the fundamentals of safety and reliability margin capture and maintaining competitive cost structure.
The second aspect of our performance that I will cover is the coke business which had a strong quarter and earned $44 million of pre-tax income. We benefited from strong operations and the positive market conditions.
Coke’s continued to set the stage for promising future as a standalone business. In addition, we continue to see strong growth opportunities for coke both in U.S and internationally over the next 10 or more years.
Finally, the third element of the quarter that I’ll touch on is the strength of our balance sheet which Brian will talk about in more detail later. Our cash balance continues to be healthy and our debt position is strong at approximately $175 million, excluding Sunoco Logistics.
At the end of the third quarter, our net debt to capital ratio for Sunoco excluding SXL was 6% as compared to 39% at the same time last year. Our improvement over time is evident and we will continue protecting our balance sheet going forward.
As the third quarter market environment has demonstrated, we expect market conditions for petroleum and chemical products to remain challenging, demand is weak, product inventories across the industry are high and margins are still under pressure.
We’re working hard to further lower or break even cost per barrel so that we’re able to generate cash in difficult times. We’re focused on sustaining the progress we’ve made since margin capture and we’re going to continue to run our refinery safely and reliably at optimal capacity utilization.
Focus on the fundamentals of our business will get us through the rest of the current down cycle in refining and it’s delivering to shareholders on the promise of our brand and logistics led future in the fuels business and a separate company Sunoco Energy that we’re preparing for.
Let me now turn the call over to Brian.

305749,114457611,83118,"Sunoco Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","ETC Sunoco Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Lynn.

First, let me comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported pretax income of $95 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in Q3, which included $62 million of pretax net favorable special items.
The special items were primarily associated with pension settlement losses, employee terminations and related costs in connection with the business improvement initiative, a gain on an MTBE insurance settlement and a non-cash gain related to an acquisition accounting at Sunoco Logistics.
While we’ve delivered another strong quarter in our Retail, Logistics and Coke businesses, we continued to face challenging marketing conditions in our Refining and Supply business.
As seen in slide four, Refining and Supply recorded a pretax loss of $70 million as excess supply and continued low demand pressured market cracks further downward from the prior quarter. While we are certainly not satisfied in posting a loss in our Refining and Supply business, the business did improve its pretax income by $112 million as compared to the same quarter of last year when market conditions were fairly similar to this quarter.
We feel confident that this significant improvement is to a large degree the result of actions we have taken including the closure of the Eagle Point refinery, that focused on reliability and optimization of our plants, reengineering our market strategy and last but not least our initiatives around costs structure. Our sharp focus on achieving a competitive cost structure continuously yield results.
Year-to-date cash operating expenses through the third quarter excluding fuel utilities and discontinued operations were approximately $170 million lower than the prior years, excluding the Coke business where we’re adding cost as we grow and prepare for separation, the improvement versus prior year is approximately $200 million.
This expense measure of cash operating expenses x fuel and utilities is used internally to track our progress in reducing our controllable expenses and is also part of our executive compensation target and demonstrates our efforts and success in driving our cost to a competitive level.
A year ago when we announced our decision to close the Eagle Point refinery, we communicated our goal to achieve breakeven cash flow in our Refining and Supply business even within a tough market environment like we were experiencing at the time.
As a result of the actions we have taken, on a year-to-date basis we have free cash flow breakeven in our Refining and Supply business excluding working capital changes. And in the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect to generate significant cash through the permanent liquidation of inventories largely related to the closure of the Eagle Point refinery.
So we plan to achieve positive cash flow in Refining and Supply in 2010 following a substantial decline in the market during the fourth quarter. This reflects the significant improvement in the Refining and Supply business as compared to last year when the business experienced a significant cash burn.
So while we continue to be pleased with our progress in many of the controllable aspects of our operations, it is evident that the market will continue to present significant challenges and we maintain focus on the fundamentals to ensure we are competitive with our assets.
Regarding our Q3 business unit results, I direct you to slide four through eight. Specifically, Retail Marketing earned $68 million pre-tax in the third quarter of 2010, while retail gasoline margins were below the strong periods of second quarter and the prior year, they were still relatively strong despite the overall rise in wholesale gasoline prices during the period which typically pressures retail margins.
As compared to the same quarter of the prior year, gasoline and distillate volumes were up about 1% and 8% respectively on an open both years basis. Additionally, we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and we have been successful at growing our distributor business incrementally adding net 86 sites store network during the third quarter. At the end of the third quarter, 4,829 total sites carry the Sunoco flag and we want to grow that further.
Logistics earned $42 million pre-tax and Sunoco Logistics Partners continues to be a reliable and ratable source of earning to a Sunoco. The throughput in terminalling business has proven to be a ratable and growing business and is supplemented by crude oil market opportunities when contango market structures exist.
During the third quarter, we closed on the purchase of three pipeline interests that are immediately accretive to earnings and we continue to believe there are additional positive growth opportunities in the future. Sunoco Logistics Partners is projecting over $435 million in total capital expenditures in 2010, including both organic and acquisition projects.
As we mentioned in our Q2 earnings call, Sunoco has facilitated some of this growth via $100 million intercompany loan to Sunoco Logistics that occurred in Q3 and was one of the primary reasons that our cash balance is lower in Q3 versus Q2.
Coke posted another solid contribution, earning $44 million pre-tax in Q3. During the third quarter, we operated well at all of our facilities including our Granite City facility, which started operation late last year. We also benefited during this period from spot sales of coke production from the 2009 downturn.
At this time we maintain our full-year guidance for SunCoke net income at $125 million to $140 million in net income as we expect expenses to be higher from investments in growth and separation planning and no spot Coke sales in Q4.
As shown on slide six, Refining and Supply had a loss of $70 million pre-tax in the third quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $182 million pretax in the same quarter of 2009. If you’ll recall, last quarter were the first quarter that we generated profits for refining and supply since the first quarter of 2009.
In our last quarterly call, we said that while there were market factors that contributed to our strong performance, our actions to improve margin capture, cost position and reliability were significant factors in achieving profitable results.
In the third quarter, market conditions deteriorated, particularly in the Northeast. For the aspects of our business that are under our control, we largely performed well, although we did experience some operational issues that will impact our performance in the fourth quarter.
Operationally, we achieved the crude unit utilization rate of 94%, higher than last quarter and in line with our plan. However our system-wide ultra low sulfur diesel production was down by approximately 4,000 barrels per day from the second quarter due to some operational issues.
With respect to our Q3 margins realizations, I refer you to slide seven and eight for more detail on a refining system crude cost and product differentials versus our benchmark. Our third quarter results reflect significant improvement versus the same quarter of the prior year.
As we indicated that last quarter’s conference call we are capturing more than benchmark margin that is available to us and this is evident again this quarter in the year-over-year improvement.
While there are a number of factors that affect our realizations versus our benchmarks, which are market related, we have taken actions on identified opportunities to improve our margin realizations versus benchmark margins, and we continue to see the benefit from these actions.
As you can see on slide seven, our refine-wide, Refining and Supply benchmark averaged $4.87 per barrel for the third quarter, only about $0.30 better than the same quarter of last year. However our margin capture of 80% was significantly improved from Q3 ‘09 margin capture of 60% and excluding the negative impact of crude timing, margin capture for the third quarter of 2010 was 90%.
The significant improvement in margin capture versus last year can be attributed to improve the liability and a successful strategy in matching operations to the market opportunities. Improvement liability in utilization is both in the Northeast and Toledo.
Overall as compared to last year, we benefited from higher overall distillate and ULSD production as a percent of total production. In Q3 2010 37% of our net production was distillate versus 33% in Q3 ‘09 with the offset in less of the cheaper residual fuel.
Our actions that supported this improvement include the closure of Eagle Point, adjustments in our crude slate and the operation of the new hydrocracker unit in Philadelphia. Within the distillate pool, we are operating more of the distillate for ULSD versus last year and Northeast ULSD differentials to heating oil have wind by more than $0.02 a gallon quarter-over-quarter.
Using second quarter 2010 as a basis, benchmark margins and margin caps declined in the third quarter and shows us that even with the improvement from last year we have more work to do on cost reduction and margin capture. Benchmark margins fell by $1.65 per barrel on average as neither gasoline prices nor distillate prices kept up with the rise in crude costs.
Realized margins were $3.88 per barrel resulting in a margin capture of 80% versus 113% in the second quarter. The biggest driver of this decline in margin capture from the second quarter to the third quarter was within crude differentials and largely due to market conditions namely rising crude prices.
Our crude costs for the quarter averaged about $0.92 per barrel above our weighted benchmark and approximately $0.50 of the $0.92 related to the timing of our crude prices.
This factor is a complete reversal from the prior year when crude prices were falling and timing actually provided a benefit to our realized margins. As a reminder, our crude purchases in the Northeast price in a lag and the price of crude rose during the quarter and particularly during the lag period of pricing in the first five days of October. Excluding the impact of crude timing in either quarter, margin capture dropped from approximately 104% in Q2 to approximately 90% in Q3.
On the product side, our average differential was approximately $0.07 per barrel below our weighted benchmark. While this is a bit drop off from a very strong Q2 performance as you compare to the last several periods you will see that it was dramatically improved and reflects our focus on improving our reliability and placing our production through the most profitable channels.
Relative to Q2, the product realizations were challenged by a falling gasoline market. In the third quarter, the gasoline track in the Northeast declined by almost $4 per barrel from the prior quarter.
Additionally, we did not get the same lift in realized margin and margin capture from value-added products as premium and RBOB differentials to conventional gasoline also narrowed substantially. In the period of rising absolute prices, petrochemical and other non-tracked product prices were not able to keep pace with the rising and volatile benchmark prices.
Lastly, and the factor that was most within our control, the ULSD production in the Northeast complex dropped from the second quarter levels due to operational issues.
In summary, we still feel confident that we are executing on many of the factors within our control, both operational and how we are approaching the market. As we noted last quarter, there can be market factors which affect our margin capture rate in any given reported period as was the case this quarter. We remain focused on the fundamentals and those elements within our control that drives our performance in whatever environment exists.
During the fourth quarter, we will be performing maintenance in our Northeast system. Additionally, our crude throughput in Toledo will be negatively impacted by pipeline allocations that resulted from the End Bridge line interruptions. Accordingly, we expect challenged Refining and Supply results in Q4 given the resulting and low utilization level and weak market conditions.
Finally, let me take a few minutes to discuss our financial position at the end of the quarter. In conjunction with that, I direct you to slides nine and 10. From a funds flow perspective, our third quarter net cash flow before debt activity at Sunoco, excluding Sunoco Logistics was used up approximately $327 million.
We ended the quarter with a net debt position of approximately $175 million excluding Sunoco Logistics. The sequential cash decline in the quarter was driven by working capital movements and the loan of $100 million by Sunoco to Sunoco Logistics that help supported the acquisition of Texon, a butane-blending business. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 6% at the Sunoco level excluding Sunoco Logistics.
At September 30, we had $1.1 billion of cash and approximately $1.5 billion of available committed boring capacity as Sunoco excluding Sunoco Logistics. As reflected in our balance sheet, our financial position and liquidity continues to be very strong. Additionally, in the fourth quarter 2010, we do plan to generate cash flow through the permanent liquidation of inventories that primarily relate Eagle Point closure.
As we look forward to the remaining months of 2010 and into 2011, we will continue to take appropriate actions that will assist us in maintaining our financial flexibility to pursue attractive opportunities in our growth businesses, as well as ride out the refining downturn.
As an update to our capital plans for 2010, our latest planned capital spending for Refining and Supply in 2010 is approximately $225 million, about $50 million less than we last guided in June. This reduction has been achieved primarily due to cost efficiencies in projects as well some deferred projects which have no impact on safe and reliable operations.
There are no other changes to our 2010 capital guidance at this point in time. For 2011, our planned capital spending for Refining and Supply is between $225 million and $250 million, in line with current year spend and below DD&A.
A final balance sheet note related to inventory, at September 30, the current replacement cost of all inventories valued at LIFO exceeds their carrying value by $2.8 billion.
I will take a few minutes to provide an update on our plans to separate SunCoke. As we have said, this planned separation is part of a strategy to unlock shareholder value and maximize the future success of both Sunoco and SunCoke. We still plan to effect the separation in the first half of 2011 and are in the process of evaluating the appropriate form of separation.
During the third quarter, we announced the hiring of Fritz Henderson to lead the separated SunCoke business. We also announced that the business will relocate after the separation to a city more internationally accessible with the preferred location being Chicago.
Most recently, in late October we filed our IRS private letter ruling requesting a tax free separation. We continue to work through the other aspects of the separation process including any filings that would be necessary if SunCoke were to be a separate public company.
As you can see we are moving steadily down the path of separation in the first half of 2011 and we will share more information when we are able to within the confines of the process.
So, in closing to build a better Sunoco and to deliver value to shareholders, we remain focused on the fundamentals running our refineries safely and reliably at optimal capacity, lowering our breakeven cost per barrel and furthering the progress we have made in capturing available margin.
This focus in continued investment in our brand and ability to serve customers will help us achieve our aspiration of becoming the preferred provider of transportation of fuels in our markets.
With that I’ll ask the operator to open the line for any questions you may have.

The second question with regard to CapEx, and the CapEx being in Refining (inaudible) below DD&A, at this time we’re only giving guidance for 2011 which is obviously below DD&A and what I would say is that over the last few years Sunoco had invested a lot of capital in the refining assets for various consent fees and another projects and so you need to put the current capital spend against DD&A and CD&A in the context of the kind of projects in particular consent decree projects that were done over the recent past.

Welcome to Sunoco's quarterly conference call where we will discuss the company's third quarter earnings that were reported this afternoon. With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer; and Clare McGrory, Man",776,"Thank you, and good evening. Welcome to Sunoco's quarterly conference call where we will discuss the company's third quarter earnings that were reported this afternoon. With me today are Brian MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer; and Clare McGrory, Manager of Investor Relations. I'll start by making a few introductory comments, and then Brian will address business results and comment on the overall financial position. 
As part of today's call, I'd like to direct you to our website, www.sunocoinc.com, where we have posted a number of presentation slides, which may provide a useful reference as we progress through our remarks. I would also refer you to the Safe Harbor statement referenced in Slide 2 of the Slide package that is included in the afternoon's earnings release. 
Now let's begin. In the third quarter, we faced a challenging market environment, particularly in the Northeast. Excess supply pressured margins, which deteriorated from second quarter levels. In addition, rising crude costs at the end of the quarter hurt our results. However, our year-over-year third quarter results which have comparable market conditions in both periods improved significantly, thanks to the actions that we have taken to address the business which is in our control. 
As you can see from Slides 3 and 4, we earned $27 million in net income, excluding special items or $0.22 per share. There are three aspects of our performance this quarter that I would like to review. First, I will cover the Fuels business, particularly Retail and Logistics, which together earned $110 million in pretax income during the quarter. These are strong businesses that are generating significant value today, and which present promising opportunities for continued growth. 
During the third quarter, Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. closed on the purchase of additional ownership interest in three pipeline joint ventures. These moves added immediate value to both Sunoco and Sunoco Logistics. And we continue to evaluate other opportunities for growth in both of these businesses. 
Continuing with the Fuels business, Refining and Supply posted a loss of $70 million pretax in the quarter. We face deterioration in market margins, which at least temporarily overshadowed our ongoing work on the controllable areas of our business. Market conditions in the third quarter demonstrated that we continue to face challenges in the business segment. However, I call your attention to the fact that in Refining and Supply, we are near breakeven on a year-to-date basis compared to last year, that's an improvement of approximately $285 million pretax. 
Now we're certainly not satisfied with break-even performance, but that kind of improvement reflects the progress we've made. We expect that the fourth quarter will be at least as challenging as the first three quarters of 2010. And accordingly, we've maintained focus on the fundamentals of safety and reliability, margin capture and maintaining a competitive cost structure. 
The second aspect of our performance that I'll cover is the Coke business, which had a strong quarter and earned $44 million of pretax income. We benefited from strong operations in a positive market condition. Coke’s continued success sets the stage for a promising future as a stand-alone business. In addition, we continue to see strong growth opportunities for Coke both in the U.S. and internationally over the next 10 or more years. 
Finally, the third element of the quarter that I will touch on is the strength of our balance sheet, which Brian will talk about in more detail later. Our cash balance continues to be healthy and our debt position is strong at approximately $175 million, excluding Sunoco Logistics. 
At the end of the third quarter, our net debt to capital ratio for Sunoco, excluding SXL, was 6% as compared to 39% at the same time last year. Our improvement over time is evident and we will continue protecting our balance sheet going forward. 
As the third quarter market environment has demonstrated, we expect market conditions for petroleum and chemical products to remain challenging. Demand is weak, product inventories across the industry are high and margins are still under pressure. We're working hard to further lower our break-even cost per barrel so that we're able to generate cash in difficult times. We're focused on sustaining the progress we've made in margin capture, and we're going to continue to run our refineries safely and reliably at optimal capacity utilization. 
Focus on the fundamentals of our business will get us through the rest of the current downcycle in refining and it's delivering to shareholders on the promise of our brand and Logistics-led future in the Fuels business and a separate Coke company, SunCoke Energy that we're preparing for. Let me now turn the call over to Brian."
305749,114457611,83129,"Sunoco Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","ETC Sunoco Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Lynn. First, let me comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported pretax income of $95 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in Q3, which included $62 million of pretax net favorable speci",2591,"Thanks, Lynn. First, let me comment on quarterly income attributable to Sunoco shareholders and our special items. We reported pretax income of $95 million attributable to Sunoco shareholders in Q3, which included $62 million of pretax net favorable special items. The special items were primarily associated with pension settlement losses, employee terminations and related costs in connection with the business improvement initiative, a gain on an MTBE insurance settlement and a non-cash gain related to an acquisition accounting at Sunoco Logistics. 
While we've delivered another strong quarter in our Retail, Logistics and Coke businesses, we continue to face challenging market conditions in our Refining and Supply business. As seen on Slide 4, Refining and Supply recorded a pretax loss of $70 million as excess supply and continued low demand pressured market cracks further downward from the prior quarter. While we are certainly not satisfied in posting a loss in our Refining and Supply business, the business did improve as pretax income by $112 million as compared to the same quarter of last year when market conditions were fairly similar to this quarter. We feel confident that this significant improvement is, to a large degree, the result of actions we have taken including the closure of the Eagle Point refinery, the focus on reliability and optimization of our plants, re-engineering our market strategy, and last but not least, our initiatives around cost structure. Our sharp focus on achieving a competitive cost structure continues to yield results. 
Year-to-date cash operating expenses through the third quarter, excluding fuel, utilities and discontinued operations, were approximately $170 million lower than the prior years. Excluding the Coke business where we're adding costs as we grow and prepare for separation, the improvement versus prior year is approximately $200 million. This expense measure of cash operating expenses x fuel and utilities is used internally to track our products in reducing our controllable expenses, and is also part of our executive compensation targets and demonstrates our efforts and success in driving our costs to a competitive level. 
A year ago, when we announced our decision to close the Eagle Point refinery, we communicated our goal to achieve breakeven cash flow in our Refining and Supply business even within a tough market environment like we were experiencing at the time. As a result of the actions we have taken, on a year-to-date basis, we are free cash flow breakeven in our Refining and Supply business, excluding working capital changes. And in the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect to generate significant cash through the permanent liquidation of inventories, largely related to the closure of the Eagle Point refinery. So we plan to achieve positive cash flow in Refining and Supply in 2010, barring a substantial decline in the market during the fourth quarter. This reflects a significant improvement in the Refining and Supply business as compared to last year when the business experienced a significant cash burn. So while we continue to be pleased with our progress in many of the controllable aspects of our operations, it is evident that the market will continue to present significant challenges and we maintain focus on the fundamentals to ensure we are competitive with our assets. 
Regarding our Q3 business unit results, I direct you to Slides 4 through 8. Specifically, Retail Marketing earned $68 million pretax in the third quarter of 2010, while retail gasoline margins were below the strong periods of second quarter and the prior year, they were still relatively strong despite the overall rise in wholesale gasoline prices during the period, which typically pressures retail margins. 
As compared to the same quarter of the prior year, gasoline and distillate volumes were up about 1% and 8%, respectively on an open both years basis. Additionally, we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities, and we have been successful at growing our Distributor business incrementally adding net 86 sites to our network during the third quarter. At the end of the third quarter, 4,829 total sites carried the Sunoco flag, and we want to grow that further. 
Logistics earned $42 million pretax as Sunoco Logistics Partners continues to be a reliable and ratable source of earnings for Sunoco. The throughput in terminaling business has proven to be a ratable and growing business and is supplemented by crude oil market opportunities when contango market structures exist. 
During the third quarter, we closed on the purchase of three pipeline interests that are immediately accretive to earnings, and we continue to believe there are additional positive growth opportunities in the future. Sunoco Logistics Partners is projecting over $435 million in total capital expenditures in 2010, including both organic and acquisition projects. 
As we mentioned in our Q2 earnings call, Sunoco has facilitated some of this growth via $100 million intercompany loan to Sunoco Logistics that occurred in Q3 and was one of the primary reasons that our cash balance is lower in Q3 versus Q2. 
Coke posted another solid contribution earning $44 million pretax in Q3. During the third quarter, we operated well at all of our facilities, including our Granite City facility, which started operations late last year. We also benefited during this period from spot sales of Coke production from the 2009 downturn. At this time, we maintain our full year guidance for SunCoke net income at $125 million to $140 million in net income as we expect expenses to be higher from investments in growth and separation planning and no spot Coke sales in Q4. 
As shown on Slide 6, Refining and Supply had a loss of $70 million pretax in the third quarter 2010 compared to a loss of $182 million pretax in the same quarter of 2009. If you recall, last quarter was the first quarter that we generated profits for Refining and Supply since the first quarter of 2009. In our last quarterly call, we said that while there were market factors that contributed to our strong performance, our actions to improve margin capture, cost position and reliability were significant factors in achieving profitable results. 
In the third quarter, market conditions deteriorated particularly in the Northeast. For the aspects of our business that are under our control, we largely performed well, although we did experience some operational issues that will impact our performance in the fourth quarter. Operationally, we achieved a crude unit utilization rate of 94%, higher than last quarter and in line with our plan. However, our systemwide Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel production was down by approximately 4,000 barrels per day from the second quarter due to some operational issues. 
With respect to our Q3 margin realizations, I refer you to Slides 7 and 8 for more detail on the refining system crude costs and product differentials versus our benchmark. Our third quarter results reflect significant improvement versus the same quarter of the prior year. As we indicated at last quarter's conference call, we are capturing more of the benchmark margin that is available to us and this is evident again this quarter in the year-over-year improvement. While there are a number of factors that affect our realizations versus our benchmarks, which are market-related, we have taken actions on identified opportunities to improve our margin realizations versus benchmark margins, and we continue to see the benefits from these actions. 
As you can see on Slide 7, our refining-wide, Refining and Supply benchmark averaged $4.87 per barrel for the third quarter, only about $0.30 better than the same quarter of last year. However, our margin capture of 80% was significantly improved from Q3 '09 margin capture of 60%. And excluding the negative impact of crude timing, margin capture for the third quarter of 2010 was 90%. The significant improvement in margin capture versus last year can be attributed to improved reliability and a successful strategy matching operations to market opportunities. The improved reliability in utilization is both in the Northeast and Toledo. Overall, as compared to last year, we benefited from higher overall distillate and ULSD production as a percent of total production. 
In Q3 2010, 37% of our net production was distillate versus 33% in Q3 '09 with the offset in less of the cheaper residual field. Our actions that supported this improvement include the closure of Eagle Point, adjustments in our crudes play and the operation of the new hydrocracker unit in Philadelphia. Within the distillate pool, we are operating more of the distillate ULSD versus last year and Northeast ULSD differentials for heating oil have wind [ph] by more than $0.02 a gallon quarter-over-quarter. 
Using second quarter 2010 as a basis, benchmark margins and margin capture declined in the third quarter and shows us that even with the improvement from last year, we have more work to do on cost reduction and margin capture. Benchmark margins fell by $1.65 per barrel on average as neither gasoline prices nor distillate prices kept up with the rising crude cost. Realized margins were $3.88 per barrel, resulting in a margin capture of 80% versus 113% in the second quarter. The biggest driver in this decline in margin capture from the second quarter to the third quarter was within crude differentials, and largely due to market conditions, namely rising crude prices. 
Our crude cost for the quarter averaged about $0.92 per barrel above our weighted benchmark and approximately $0.50 of the $0.92 relates to the timing of our crude prices. This factor is a complete reversal from the prior quarter when crude prices were falling and timing actually provided a benefit to our realized margins. As a reminder, our crude purchases in the Northeast priced on a lag and the price of crude rose during the quarter, in particular during the lag period of pricing in the first five days of October. 
Excluding the impact of crude timing in either quarter, margin capture dropped from approximately 104% in Q2 to approximately 90% in Q3. On the product side, our average differential was approximately $0.07 per barrel below our weighted benchmark. While this did drop off from a very strong Q2 performance, as you compare it to the last several periods, you will see that it was dramatically improved and reflects our focus on improving our reliability and placing our production through the most profitable channels. 
Relative to Q2, the product realizations were challenged by a falling gasoline market. In the third quarter, the gasoline crack in the Northeast declined by almost $4 per barrel from the prior quarter. Additionally, we did not get the same lift in realized margin and margin capture from value-added products as premium and [inaudible] differentials to conventional gasoline also narrowed substantially. 
In the period of rising absolute prices, petrochemical and other non-crack product prices were not able to keep pace with the rising and volatile benchmark prices. Lastly and the factor that was most within our control, the ULSD production at the Northeast complex dropped, from the second quarter levels due to operational issues. In summary, we still feel confident that we're executing on many of the factors within our control, both operational and how we are approaching the market. As we noted last quarter, there can be market factors which affect our margin capture rate in any given reporting period as was the case this quarter. We remain focused on the fundamentals and those elements within our control to drive strong performance in whatever environment exists. 
So in the fourth quarter, we will be performing maintenance in our Northeast system. Additionally our crude throughput in Toledo will be negatively impacted by pipeline allocations that resulted from the Enbridge line interruptions. Accordingly, we expect challenge Refining and Supply results in Q4, given the resulting low-utilization level and weak market conditions. 
Finally, let me take a few minutes to discuss our financial position at the end of the quarter. In conjunction with that, I direct you to Slides 9 and 10. From a funds flow perspective, our third quarter net cash flow before debt activity at Sunoco, excluding Sunoco Logistics, was the use of approximately $327 million. We ended the quarter with a net debt position of approximately $175 million, excluding Sunoco Logistics. The sequential cash decline in the quarter was driven by working capital movements and the loan of $100 million by Sunoco to Sunoco Logistics to help support its acquisition of Texon, a Butane Blending business. We ended the quarter with a net debt to capital ratio of 6% at the Sunoco level, excluding Sunoco Logistics. 
At September 30, we had $1.1 billion of cash and approximately $1.5 billion of available committed borrowing capacity at Sunoco, excluding Sunoco Logistics. As reflected in our balance sheet, our financial position and liquidity continues to be very strong. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2010, we do plan to generate cash flow through the permanent liquidation of inventory that primarily relates to Eagle Point closure. As we look forward to the remaining months of 2010 and into 2011, we will continue to take appropriate actions that will assist us in maintaining our financial flexibility to pursue attractive opportunities in our growth businesses, as well as ride out the refining downturn. 
As an update to our capital plans for 2010, our latest planned capital spending for Refining and Supply in 2010 is approximately $225 million, about $50 million less than we last guided in June. This reduction has been achieved primarily due to cost efficiencies in projects as well as some deferred projects which have no impact on safe and reliable operations. There are no other changes to our 2010 capital guidance at this point in time. 
For 2011, our planned capital spending for Refining and Supply is between $225 million and $250 million in line with current year spend and below DD&A. 
A final balance sheet note related to inventory. At September 30, the current replacement cost of all inventories valued at LIFO exceeds their carrying value by $2.8 billion. I'll take a few minutes to provide an update on our plans to separate SunCoke. As we have said, this planned separation is part of a strategy to unlock shareholder value and maximize the future success of both Sunoco and SunCoke. We still plan to affect the separation in the first half of 2011 and are in the process of evaluating the appropriate form of separation. 
During the third quarter, we announced the hiring of Fritz Henderson to lead the separated SunCoke business. We also announced that the business will relocate after the separation to a city more internationally accessible with the preferred location being Chicago. Most recently in late October, we filed our IRS private letter ruling requesting a tax re-separation. We continue to work through the other aspects of the separation process, including any filings that would be necessary if SunCoke were to be a separate public company. As you can see we are moving steadily down the path to separation in the first half of 2011, and we will share more information when we are able to within the confines of the process. 
So in closing, to build a better Sunoco and to deliver value to shareholders, we remain focused on the fundamentals: Running our refineries safely and reliably in optimal capacity; lowering our break-even cost per barrel; and furthering the progress we have made in capturing available margin. This focus in continued investment in our brand and ability to serve customers will help us achieve our aspiration of becoming the preferred provider of transportation fuels in our markets. 
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the lines for any questions you may have."

And so as we get through the fourth quarter, we’d be somewhere in the range of the second half of that, it may move up and down a little bit based upon market conditions and things that are going on in the operations, but that's kind of broadly the magnitude of the second half of that inventory reduction, which as we said, would be permanent. The second question with regard to CapEx, and the CapEx being in refining below the DD&A, at this time, we're only giving guidance for 2011 which is obviously below DD&A. And what I would say is that over the last few years, Sunoco had invested a lot of capital in the refining assets for various consent decrees and other projects. So you need to put the current capital spend against DD&A in the context of the kind of projects in particular consent decree projects that were done over the recent past."
