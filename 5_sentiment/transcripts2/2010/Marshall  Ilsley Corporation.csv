As you can see from our results, we continue to remain aggressive in dealing with tough credit issues.

As you can see from our results, we continue to remain aggressive in dealing with tough credit issues. Though elevated levels of charge-offs will continue for the next couple quarters, barring something unforeseen taking place in the economy we do expect charge-offs to start to decline in 2010.
We will continue to have some relationships that we need to work through the end of the recession, but the likelihood of a real estate project surviving today is a great deal different than two years ago. We are most likely at a turning point in credit quality though another quarter or two is needed to validate that condition.
As Greg Smith will review with you in a couple of minutes, early stage delinquency continues to improve, such as loans 39 days to 80 days the delinquent are now at the lowest level since 2007. This is probably our best gauge for future charge-offs. A great deal of attention is being devoted to what may occur with commercial real estate this year and over the next two to three years.
Although our delinquency in commercial real estate is higher than in 2007 the trend is toward a decline in delinquency the last two quarters. We remain optimistic, though focused on this portfolio particularly as we finish the review of all loans greater than $1 million in December.
We have no expectations that our commercial real estate portfolio will perform in any way comparable to what we’ve seen with construction and development. Our sentiments rest there due to the small average size of our loans, our concentration in the Midwest, and the extent of cash flow stabilization in this book of business. I’m sure we’ll have some issues overtime, but we expect them to be manageable.
As we move into 2010 we’ve intended to leave no struggling assets unaddressed. In addition to significant charge-offs on our portfolio over the last two years we’ve sold $2 billion of underperforming loans. We will continue to sell these loans, but we expect the pace to slow. We saw some improvement in pricing this quarter which is to be expected as real estate values begin to stabilize.
We feel the same way about properties we’ve taken into owned real estate on the commercial side of REO we have three completed projects in the process of being leased up that aggregated by $80 million to be just written down by 25%. On the consumer side, the small number of homes we own are being carried at approximately 62% of unpaid balance and the residential lots are being carried at 30% of unpaid balance.
The point is say that is read that we are addressing every matter in the same manner. We glad to put these last two years behind is and though the economies still create some uncertainty we feel like we are well positioned to remain strong as the credit cycle winds down. There are several positive indicators about the underlying strength of M&I and Greg will share some of the metrics of these non-credit aspects of our business to reinforce our sentiments.
With that, let me turn the call over to Greg.

We have included detailed credit quality slides on our website. You may want to have these printed out and available for our credit quality discussion.
Although our fourth quarter results continue to reflect the challenging operating environment that has confronted banks. Our results provide us building confidence and better recovery is underway at M&I. Our credit quality trends continue to benefit from our aggressive approach to non-performing loan identification and resolution.
As is shown by continued favorable trends in loans going on to non-performing status, continued improvement in early stage delinquencies, which decreased for the third consecutive quarter, continued improvement in total nonperforming loans which decreased for the second consecutive quarter.
The important items to focus on to better understand our fourth quarter performance include the following. We have continued our aggressive steps to address the largest risks in our loan portfolio, including our construction and development business, even though these steps continue to be the primary reason for our loss in the quarter.
In addition, we transferred $170 million of larger previously classified as renegotiated loans to non-performing status as our review showed core performance on these properties deteriorated. We will discuss these loans in more detail later in this call.
Despite the migration of these renegotiated loans, non-performing loans were down over $200 million this quarter, which reflects the impact of our continued aggressive non-performing loan workout and disposition strategies. In comparison to the prior quarter, non-performing loan inflows were down 8%, when adjusted for the previously renegotiated loans mentioned a moment ago. For the quarter our early stage loan delinquencies, those loans past due 30 to 89 days, declined by over 15%, since September to the lowest level since 2007.
As we have noted previously, we are increasingly comfortable that the pattern of large commercial real estate construction and development charge offs in Arizona is largely behind us. Since year end 2007, this portfolio has contracted by nearly 80% and is now under $300 million.
Although, we do not believe our construction and development issues are completely behind us, we are encouraged that total non-accrual C&D loans contracted for the third quarter in a row. Our non-performing loans continue to decline. Our portfolio of C&D loans on non-accrual amounts to approximately $800 million, down approximately $180 million from September 30. This decrease is largely attributable to the Arizona market.
We have increased our reserve to 3.35% of total loans, or nearly $1.5 billion and continue to make progress toward our goal of reducing our concentration of construction and development loans, which now stand at 12.5% of our loan portfolio versus 18% at the end of 2008.
For the quarter, we benefited from $46 million in after tax gains from security sales and tendering of our own debt securities. These gains are offset by further aggressive steps in non-performing asset resolution. Our Wealth Management Division continued to grow revenues as well as assets under both management and administration this quarter, reaching record highs for both. We continue to have a capital base well above any regulatory capital thresholds.
At quarter end, our tangible common equity ratio was 8 .2%, and our tier 1 risk based capital ratio is estimated to be 11.1%. During the quarter, we realized 13 bays points of net interest margin expansion, reflecting continued success in improving our funding and lending profiles and the effect of fewer loans becoming nonperforming. We finished 2009 with 106% loan to deposit ratio down from 132% just two years ago.
Now for some additional insights into the quarter and we’ll start with the net interest margin; our net interest margin increased by 13 basis points on a linked quarter basis to 2.95%. During the fourth quarter, our net interest margin benefited from credit quality improvement and the restructuring and/or retiring of certain debt instruments.
Despite recent asset quality improvements, our margin continues to be negatively impacted by non-performing assets. The negative impact is 25 basis points in total and 13 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2007. We expect that the net interest margin will trend upward slightly for the near term as we anticipate additional favorable results from the restructuring activities late in the quarter and further improvements in credit quality.
Like the industry in general, we expect to be challenged by competitive pricing, the impact of deposit and loan pricing floors, the movement of new and existing deposits into lower spread higher yielding products, wholesale funding spreads, and, of course, the yield curve. There continue to be many variables that impact margin. It is difficult to project this one data point given the current interest rate volatility occurring in the market.
Now, moving on to wealth management, in spite of market volatility, revenues increased 5% on a linked quarter basis and 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Expanding sales, enhanced investment products and investment performance generated the improved results. Sales pipelines continue to build across our divisions, especially in our institutional businesses, which include our retirement services not for profit, and outsourcing lines.
Assets under Management, reached $33 billion, up 8% compared to the end of 2008. Our Assets under Administration rose to $122 billion, or 17% greater than the same period a year ago. Our asset management acquisitions continue to perform well, Delta, Taplin, Canida & Habacht since experienced new asset additions and growth of existing relationships during the quarter.
Our brokerage and insurance division continued to experience good sales flows during the quarter as investors position their portfolios for 2010. Revenues were up 1% on a linked quarter basis and up 6% compared to the same quarter last year, reflecting improved investor confidence and greater coverage by our financial advisers.
From an expense standpoint, total non-interest expense amounted to $409 million in the fourth quarter consistent with the third quarter. Expenses for non-performing assets and other credit related items were relatively unchanged compared to last quarter at $69 million. These are largely related to collection efforts and carrying costs for non-performing assets.
Although, our reported efficiency ratio was 67%, when adjusted for these items and other credit related expenses, we view our core efficiency ratio to be 56.7%, down 1% from the prior quarter. Nonetheless, particularly in the current operating environment, M&I will continue to be very focused on maintaining our historical expense discipline.
Now, moving onto our credit quality trends, non-performing loans decreased for the second consecutive quarter, resulting in our lowest level of nonperforming loans since the end of 2008. When coupled with continued improvement in early stage delinquencies, these trends support our aggressive approach to problem credit resolution. Continuing with that approach, we increased our loan loss reserves, which now stand at $1.5 billion, or 3.35% of total loans.
Our commercial non-construction commercial real estate and consumer portfolios continue to have non-performing characteristics better than the bank as a whole while our construction and development related loans continue to show the stresses of the national housing markets. This stress continues to be most apparent in the Arizona market, where home prices have fallen over 50% from their peak in June of 2006.
Coming into 2010, we continue to anticipate a relative stabilization in non-performing loan trends, reflecting sustained improvement in early stage delinquencies, reduced inflows, and continued aggressive strategies to workout or sell non-performing credits. We were pleased that our non-performing loans again decreased for the quarter. Moving into 2010, we have strengthening confidence that we will see continued credit quality improvements.
For the quarter, we realized net charge-offs of $572 million, and we provided $639 million for loan losses. Although these are higher than we initially expected, these levels reflect our continued efforts to proactively reduce our exposure to problem relationships. Importantly, we don’t believe the charge-offs and provision for this quarter are indicative for what we expect for 2010.
Our quarter end reserve was 3.35% of period end total loans, which is an increase of $67 million from the prior quarter end. In addition to building the allowance, we’ve identified the specific loss content in non-accrual loans over $1 million and marked them to net realizable value with either a specific reserve or charge-off.
As shown in slide six, M&I has conducted a specific impairment analysis of $1.4 billion, or 70% of total non-performing loans to quantify potential impairment. On average, 27% of the unpaid principal balance of these loans has been charged off. Through building the allowance and aggressively writing down problem loans, M&I post a solid adjusted reserve coverage ratio of 191%.
As we look forward, we expect to continue taking aggressive steps to resolve our non-performing loans, the proceeds from which will be redeployed in our business. As in prior quarters, the largest proportion of charge offs, approximately 52%, were associated with the Arizona and Florida market places.
As shown on slide 31 the net charge offs by geographic location were $187 million for Arizona, and $108 million for Florida. Otherwise, charge offs were rather diversified from a geographic perspective. As expected, we are seeing a shift in Arizona charge offs away from our credits toward smaller retail related credits.
Discussing our non-performing loan trends, during the quarter, our non-performing loans decreased $205 million, which is 9% below last quarter and 15% below second quarter. For the quarter, we sold $143 million in larger stress construction and development loans. In addition, we sold a $70 million pool of non-performing or seriously delinquent single family mortgage loans resulting in a $35 million net charge off.
Like our last non-performing residential loan sale, over 60% of the underlying loans are in Arizona. As in the past, we have moved aggressively to identify potential non-performing loans and the associated loss content. This is supported by the following. 25% of our non-performing loans are current or past due less than 30 days up from 16% last quarter.
Of our loans past due 30 to 89 days, which we consider our early stage delinquencies, our $170 million are already non-performing. 34%, or $687 million of our non-performing loans, are past due less than 90 days. We have already realized partial charge offs of $810 million against our non-performing loans, represent ago 28% haircut.
Another way to look at our partial charge offs is that it represents a 52% write-down on specific non-performing loans, where a direct write-down was deemed necessary. A few comments on our construction and development portfolios, within our loan portfolios, we continue to focus on our construction and development categories, particularly residential related.
Please note on slide eight that we have segmented our commercial construction portfolio between C&I related and housing related. This slide highlights the continued strong credited quality profile of the non-housing component of the commercial construction portfolio. Less than half of our commercial construction portfolio is related too housing.
As of quarter end, we have $80 million in construction and development loans on non-performing status representing 39% of our total non-performing loans. As shown in slide 33, of these non-performing construction and development loans, 50% are in the Arizona and Florida markets. On average, these loans are already heavily reserved or charged down. Clearly our issues remain concentrated in these markets.
To provide a little more granularity on our portfolio of larger construction and development projects, the following may be helpful. We have 27 loans greater than $5 million on non-accrual status. Only nine of these are in excess of $10 million and only one of these is in excess of $20 million.
We have seen some stabilization in the residential land portfolio during the fourth quarter as non-performing loans have fallen $64 million. This portfolio is shown in slides 38 and 39. We have $1.6 billion in residential land loans to individuals and developers, $870 million or 55% are located in Arizona zip codes. The bulk of the Arizona loans, two thirds are in Maricopa County.
The loans to individuals in the Arizona portfolio are relatively modest in size with an average balance of approximately $174,000. We continue to refresh both FICO scores and LTV’s for the Arizona portfolio. Individual FICO scores average 736 at the time of origination and for the performing loans remain above 720 today.
Although we anticipate that our non-performing loans in the Arizona residential land portfolio will remain elevated. We believe we will benefit from the fact that we first tightened our underwriting standards in mid 2005 and ceased new money originations in 2008. Residential lot loans to individuals and developers account for $259 million of non-performing loans of which 47% are based in Arizona zip codes.
With regard to conventional mortgages, our portfolio continues to show that individuals are feeling continued economic stress. As we’ve noted before, we maintained our underwriting discipline through the cycle, have never originated subprime loans and have avoided many of the more risky loan products.
During the quarter, our non-performing residential loans decreased to $206 million or 4.2% of the residential mortgage portfolio. These trends highlight the benefit of our non-performing residential loan sales completed in December and July. We continue to aggressively monitor and manage this portfolio. Just a couple of comments on our consumer loan trends as the overall consumer portfolio has maintained its non-performing loan levels below those of the overall bank.
As of quarter end, only 1.4% of consumer loans were on non-performing status. As we have noted in the past, our credit quality experience with this portfolio has benefited from our historical practice of selling much of our production as we did in 2005 and 2006. Looking forward, consumer non-accruals, including both residential and home equity, are likely to remain elevated reflecting continued consumer stress although we expect that our ultimate losses will remain better than industry averages.
With regard to the commercial loan portfolio, during the course of the fourth quarter, we realized $85 million of net charge-offs in our C&I portfolio, these charge-offs are geographically disbursed. Generally our commercial portfolio has performed relatively well during this cycle, while still showing the effect of the economy. In addition, we realized a decrease of $61 million in nonperforming C&I loans.
A brief comment on bank holding company loans, as of year end, we continue to retain a portfolio of approximately $550 million of which 11% is non-performing and against which we have reserves of 17%. We are adequately reserved, but will continue to evaluate this portfolio critically. Going forward, based on the rapidly changing landscape for banks and the loss of market synergies caused by the spin-off of Metavante.
M&I’s correspondent banking strategy has been redefined to include only core relationships within our banking footprint with a primary focus on fee based activities going forward. With regard to our non-construction commercial real estate portfolio, we have $13.6 billion outstanding with $3.6 billion in multifamily and $9.3 billion in business real estate.
As shown on slide 16, our business real estate portfolio is generally concentrated in our core Midwest markets, two/thirds, with only 17% in our combined Florida and Arizona markets and another 3% in other higher risk markets, 37% of this portfolio is owner occupied. In the fourth quarter, we saw our non-performing loans in the non-construction commercial real estate category increase $75 million to 4.3%.
Contributing to this increase is the review of renegotiated loans that we noted earlier in the call. We performed a rigorous review of our commercial division renegotiated loans and found that the performance of certain related properties had deteriorated to a point where we felt non-accrual status was more appropriate. With this determination, we moved a $170 million to non-accrual status.
In addition, we are carrying the loans on our books at 44% of unpaid principal balance, through either partial charge-offs or specific reserves. A few comments on our accruing renegotiated loans. Over the past quarter, we have seen a $142 million decrease in accruing renegotiated loans to a total of $793 million. This decrease is largely result of previously discussed review of certain relationships.
On the consumer side, the vast majority of these loans continue to be related to home, land or construction loans to individuals. At quarter end, these categories accounted for approximately $647 million or 82% of the total. Within the consumer sector, our restructured loan delinquency trends continue to perform better than national averages.
Over the next few quarters, we continue to expect non-performing loan and real estate owned balances to remain elevated above historical averages, reflecting broader economic stress, though we anticipate inflows will continue to slow. We specifically anticipate that the inflows of larger construction credits are passed their peak.
As I noted in discussion slide six, through increasing the reserve and aggressively writing down problem loans, M&I has an adjusted reserve coverage ratio of 191%. We will continue to evaluate the opportunity for further sales of non-performing assets and weigh the opportunity versus the cost to keep those assets for a period of time.
Sometimes the best resolution will be to take the underlying property to maximize our interest, which will cause in creases to REO for a period of time. This quarter, our REO increased to $431 million, and this is consistent with previous expectations. We have seven commercial properties over $100 million. We continue to expect that REO balances will increase going forward and view this as a natural progression as we gain control of projects and move toward ultimate resolutions. 
A few final comments on credit quality, stresses in the national housing and commercial real estate market will continue to affect us, and we will continue to address them proactively. We have and will continue to take aggressive steps to resolve our non-performing situations. Nonetheless, should the economy continue to deteriorate beyond our current expectations, our losses could continue.
Our non-performing loans continue to be concentrated in the housing construction related components of the commercial and residential real estate portfolios particularly in our Arizona, Florida, and correspondent businesses. Despite a recent increase in Florida, we continue to believe our larger C&D challenges in the Florida and Arizona markets are behind us.
Although, we are not immune from consumer deterioration, we believe our residential and consumer portfolios will continue to perform better than the industry as a whole, and also recall that our credit card portfolio is relatively small with less than $300 million of outstandings. We will continue to maintain a strong reserve coverage ratio and we’ll continue to aggressively write down problem loans.
We remain committed to returning M&I to a level of solid credit quality and are hopeful that our declines in non-performing loans, non-performing loan inflows, and early stage delinquencies are all early indicators of achieving this goal. Changing focus to the organic balance sheet trends compared to the same quarter in 2008.
Fourth quarter 2009 average loans were $45 billion, which is 4.9 billion or 10% lower than the fourth quarter 2008. C&I loans decreased on average by $2.2 billion or 14% as we are seeing lower line utilization and seasonal borrowing from existing customers than in prior years.
Moving into 2010, we expect C&I balance to continue contracting until the economic recovery takes stronger hold. On a linked quarter basis, C&I loans contracted $960 million or 6.8%. Across all of our construction and development categories, we have seen approximately $3.7 billion or 38% contraction, since the fourth quarter of last year.
This is consistent with our broader goal of reducing our total construction and development portfolio to less than 10% of total loans. At quarter end, construction and development loans account for 12.5% of total loans, down from a high of 22.6% in the third quarter of 2007.
Non-construction commercial real estate loans increased on average by $1.6 billion or nearly 13% in comparison to the same quarter last year. This reflects the natural progression of projects to completion and lease up, most of which occurred earlier in 2009. Own a linked quarter basis loans in this category were essential flat.
Commercial real estate volumes are soft in all categories, reflecting the economy. This is translated into minimal investor activity in new construction projects with medical office being the least impacted, lack of availability of any financing is significantly impacting this marketplace.
Retail continues to soften and is expected to do so through 2010 as many retailers have cutback expansion plans. Many retailers are demanding rent concessions on existing leases potentially impacting our customers. Office continues to soften in all markets. Job losses significantly impacted this segment in 2009 and are anticipated to do so in 2010.
Hospitality softened with the economy in the second half of 2009, and is expected to remain soft. Together, these factors lead to our expectation that our non-construction commercial real estate portfolio balances will be relatively flat for 2010.
On the deposit side, we have seen good underlying dynamics this year, with average deposit balances up nearly $1 billion dollars versus the fourth quarter of 2008. Non-interest bearing deposits increased $1.9 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase is a turbulent part to low interest rate environment and continued confidence in M&I.
As we have discussed before, we have reconfigured many of our deposit product offerings. The benefit of these changes are shown by the $1.6 billion of growth in savings deposits and the $1.6 billion of growth in NOW balances since the fourth quarter of last year. In addition, we have benefited from an improved deposit mix as our time balance has declined by over $2 billion.
A few final comments, as we move into the first quarter of 2010, and to reiterate comments made earlier, we expect our financial results to reflect the benefits of aggressive credit steps that we have taken, but also the challenges of broader financial markets.
As you are aware, every economic cycle brings its own set of challenges. This economic cycle has been marked by rapid deterioration followed by more recent stabilization in general economic conditions, a challenging and prolonged low interest rate environment, competitive pricing pressures on many loan and deposit products, and a dramatic downturn in the national and residential housing marks.
As we move forward in this economic cycle, we will continue to benefit from the strength of our balance sheet, the dedication of our employees, and the diversification of our franchise.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Joining me now are Mark Furlong, our CEO, and Mark Hogan, Chief Credited Officer. They can help answer questions. Operator, you may open the line for questions, please.

We work well with the regulators, but our methodology is what we work through own a quarterly basis, and just answering your first question, the reserve build that we’re seeing right now is really a pressure that results primarily from the FAS 5 or historical loss rates, where the current quarters, if we’re in a 2.5 or a five-year average loss rate, the current quarters rates are much higher than the quarters that are dropping off at the end.
So what we need to see is, we think we need a couple more quarters where we see the portfolio trends continue to improve, and we’ve been fairly consistent with saying that, we believe in the third quarter is when we’ll start seeing the pressure, a downward pressure on the reserve and at that point we’ll look at what the portfolio looks like and the historical loss rates will have to come down. We’ll start adjusting them downward based on what our assessment is relative to the inherent risk in the remaining portfolio.

I think as we look forward, there’s a couple of factors that lead to us believe these numbers will be coming down.
Number one, as the loan trends continue to improve as well as new non-performing loan trend formation continues to improve that will certainly just stem what’s going into the pipeline. The other thing is I think, that we would expect is going to help us out here is as home prices stabilize throughout the country, we’re now finding our marks on ORE or loans held for sale are holding up better.
When you think about the type of price depreciation that we’ve had in housing over the last three years and the rapid descent of that, you could have had a piece of property that was well marked at the end of one quarter, but if you had the continued trend of home prices going down, you would have had an incremental mark the next quarter. So more stability in real estate prices is going to help us get the mark right the first time for the life of the loan, which, therefore means the ORE expenses should come down.

We have gone through that process and found that given where we are, based on exactly the same types of fact pattern and logic that we’ve discussed these in past continue to find that our deferred tax asset is an asset that does not require any valuation allowance against it. So a lot of that comes from, again items such as projected utilization of it, deemphasizing a large business line, in this case the construction and development component.

Where we are in that process, we have seen a slowdown in the inflows into renegotiated loans on the consumer side over the past quarter. We’ll be reevaluating the calendar year renegotiated debt during the first quarter, and we’ll likely move some of that out of that classification in the first quarter, but where we are in that, unemployment rate is still 10%, and our best estimate would be that it’s going to be that way for awhile.
So we continue to see a need from our borrowers to where they’ve got employment issues, where they’re going to come in and want to work through with us on some level of renegotiation of the mortgage loans. So I think we’ll see a continuation of that throughout the year.

When we think about the Wisconsin market, which is of course 40% of our business. Although, we certainly see the signs of the economic stress in this market, total non-accrual loans in this market are only 2.4% of the Wisconsin loan portfolio, so relatively happy with that performance and that is an improvement versus where we were last quarter.
Minneapolis non-performing loans are a little bit higher, but again, really like the fundamental trends we’ve seen there matter effect non-performing loans in Minneapolis improved by about half 0.5% in the course of the last quarter.
The St. Louis market non-performing loans and credit quality, again shows sign of the economic downturn and some of those signs of stress, but St. Louis and Indianapolis, have both performed well through the cycle. In terms of our core Midwest markets, we see a little bit more stress in the Kansas City market just to be fair that portfolio was a little bit more dependent on the construction category as well.
Going to transition here, just the general economic trends, and in particular, think about some of the beige book data that comes out for the Kansas City marketplace, generally, the economic downturn in many ways hasn’t hit Kansas City as badly. So, we see a great opportunity in that market as we go forward. So, hopefully that covers your questions on core Midwest markets.
Indy very similar to St. Louis I sort of rolled that in very happy with the credit quality trends that we’ve seen in that market. The team there has done quite well. As a matter of fact, non-performing loans in Indiana today are running at 2.2%. So, very happy with those trends as well.

We believe one of the reasons that we’re seeing the lower level of non-performers it just a fact that these a lot of our borrowers have been through this before, and very early in the cycle they took very quick actions, whether it was to employment or cutting back capital expenditure, whatever it might be and the decisions that they made a year and a half and two years ago are really paying off for them right now and I think it’s one of the reasons that we’re seeing reduced level of non-performers in Wisconsin.

We expect those numbers will have move up, but remember the national averages, when we see that, I think it’s either the OTS or OCC data, are running in the high 50s if not low 60s.
So we will see ours move up, but we don’t expect we’ll get near there. One of the reasons that we have that confidence is just because a borrower signs of the paperwork that makes a loan renegotiated, if you will, from a legal perspective, we don’t change it in terms of our classifications until that borrowers current for three payments. So, that changes the redefault rate in comparison to what others might report. So, it’s just one way we’re trying to be conservative on that item.

As you can see from our results, we continue to remain aggressive in dealing with tough credit issues. Though elevated levels of charge offs will continue for the next couple of quarters, barring something unforeseen taking place in the economy, we do expect to charge offs to start to decline in 2010. We will continue to have some relationships that we need to work through at the end of the recession, but the likelihood of a real estate project surviving today is a great deal different than two years ago. We're most likely at a turning point in credit quality, though another quarter too is needed to validate that condition.As Greg Smith will review with you in a couple of minutes, early-stage delinquency continues to improve such as loans 30 to 89 days delinquent are now at their lowest levels since 2007. This is probably our best gauge of future charge offs. A great deal of attention is being devoted to what may occur with commercial real estate this year and over the next two to three years. Although our delinquency in commercial real estate is higher than in 2007, the trend is toward a decline in delinquency the last two quarters.We remain optimistic though focused on this portfolio, particularly as we finished a review of all loans greater than $1 million in December. We have no expectations that our commercial real estate portfolio will perform in any way comparable to what we've seen with construction and development. Our settlement risk that are due to the small average size of our loans, our concentration in the Midwest and the extent of cash flow stabilization in this book of business. I'm sure we'll have some issues over time, but we expect them to be manageable. As we move into 2010, we've intended to leave no struggling assets unaddressed. In addition to significant charge offs on our portfolio over the last two years, we've sold $2 billion of underperforming loans. We will continue to sell these loans, but we expect the pace to slow.We saw some improvement in pricing this quarter, which is to be expected as real estate values begin to stabilize. We feel the same way about properties we've taken into owned real estate. On the commercial side of REO, we have three completed projects in the process of being leased up, at aggregate about $80 million. We've just written down about 25%. On the consumer side, the small number of homes we own are being carried at approximately 62% of unpaid balance. And the residential lots are being carried at 30% of unpaid balance. The point in saying that is to reinforce that we're dressing every matter in the same manner. We're glad to put these last two years behind us. And though the economy still creates some uncertainty, we feel like we're well positioned to remain strong as the credit cycle winds down.There are several positive indicators about the underlying strength of M&I, and Greg will share some of the metrics on these non-credit aspect of our business to reinforce our sentiments. With that, let me turn the call over to Greg."

We have included detailed credit quality slides on our website. You may want to have these printed out and available for our credit quality discussion.Although our fourth quarter results continue to reflect the challenging operating environment that has confronted banks, our results provide us building confidence that a recovery is underway at M&I. Our credit quality trends continue to benefit from our aggressive approach to non-performing loan identification and resolution, as is shown by: continued favorable trends in loans going on to non-performing status; continued improvement in early-stage delinquencies, which decreased for the third consecutive quarter; continued improvement in total nonperforming loans, which decreased for the second consecutive quarter. The important items to focus on to better understand our fourth quarter performance include the following:  We have continued our aggressive steps to address the largest risks in our loan portfolio, including our construction and development business, even though these steps continue to be the primary reason for our loss in the quarter. In addition, we transferred $170 million of larger, previously classified as renegotiated loans to non-performing status as our review showed core performance on these properties deteriorated. We will discuss these loans in more detail later in this call.Despite the migration of these renegotiated loans, non-performing loans were down over $200 million this quarter, which reflects the impact of our continued aggressive non-performing loan workout and disposition strategies. In comparison to the prior quarter, non-performing loan inflows were down 8% when adjusted for the previously renegotiated loans mentioned a moment ago.For the quarter, our early-stage loan delinquencies, those loans past due 30 to 89 days, declined by over 15% since September to the lowest levels since 2007. As we have noted previously, we are increasingly comfortable that the pattern of large commercial real estate construction and development charge offs in Arizona is largely behind us. Since year-end 2007, this portfolio has contracted by nearly 80%, and is now under $300 million.Although we do not believe our construction and development issues are completely behind us, we are encouraged that total non-accrual C&D loans contracted for the third quarter in a row. Our non-performing loans continue to decline. Our portfolio of C&D loans on non-accrual amounts to approximately $800 million, down approximately $180 million from September 30. This decrease is largely attributable to the Arizona market.We have increased our reserve to 3.35% of total loans, or nearly $1.5 billion and continue to make progress toward our goal of reducing our concentration of construction and development loans, which now stand at 12 1/2% of our loan portfolio versus 18% at the end of 2008. For the quarter, we benefited from $46 million in after-tax gains from security sales and tendering for our own debt securities. These gains are offset by further aggressive steps in non-performing asset resolution. Our wealth management division continue to grow revenues, as well as assets under both management and administration this quarter, reaching record highs for both. We continue to have a capital base, well above any regulatory capital thresholds. At quarter end, our tangible common equity ratio was 8.2% and our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is estimated to be 11.1%. During the quarter, we realized 13 basis points of Net Interest Margin expansion, reflecting continued success in improving our funding and lending profiles and the effect of fewer loans becoming a non-performing. We finished 2009 with 106% loan-to-deposit ratio, down from 132% just two years ago.Now for some additional insights into the quarter. And we'll start with the Net Interest Margin. Our Net Interest Margin increased by 13 basis points on a linked-quarter basis to 2.95%. During the fourth quarter, our Net Interest Margin benefited from credit quality improvement and the restructuring and/or retiring of certain debt instruments. Despite recent asset quality improvements, our margin continues to be negatively impacted by non-performing assets. The negative impact is 25 basis points in total, and 13 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2007. We expect that the Net Interest Margin will trend upward slightly for the near-term as we anticipate additional favorable results from the restructuring activities late in the quarter and further improvements in credit quality.Like the industry in general, we expect to be challenged by competitive pricing, the impact of deposit and loan pricing floors, the movement of new and existing deposits into lower spread, higher-yielding products, wholesale funding spreads and, of course, the yield curve. There continue to be many variables that impact margin. It is difficult to project this one data point, given the current interest rate volatility occurring in the market.Now moving on to wealth management. In spite of market volatility, revenues increased 5% on a linked-quarter basis and 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Expanding sales, enhanced investment products and investment performance generated the improved results. Sales pipelines continue to build across our divisions, especially in our institutional businesses, which include our retirement services, not-for-profit and outsourcing lines. Assets under Management reached $33 billion, up 8% compared to the end of 2008. Our assets under administration rose to $122 billion or 17% greater than the same period a year ago. Our asset management acquisitions continue to perform well. Both Delta and Taplin Canida & Habacht experienced new asset additions and growth of existing relationships during the quarter. Our brokerage and insurance division continue to experience good sales flows during the quarter as investors position their portfolios for 2010. Revenues were up 1% on a linked-quarter basis, and up 6% compared to the same quarter last year, reflecting improved investor confidence and greater coverage by our financial advisors.From an expense standpoint, total non-interest expense amounted to $409 million in the fourth quarter, consistent with the third quarter. Expenses for non-performing assets and other credit-related items were relatively unchanged, compared to last quarter, at $69 million. These are largely related to collection efforts and carrying costs for non-performing assets.Although our reported efficiency ratios is 67%, when adjusted for these items and other credit-related expenses, we view our core efficiency ratio to be 56.7%, down 1% from the prior quarter. Nonetheless, particularly in the current operating environment, M&I will continue to be very focused on maintaining our historical expense discipline.  Now moving to our credit quality trends. Non-performing loans decreased for the second consecutive quarter, resulting in our lowest level of non-performing loans since the end of 2008. When coupled with continued improvement in early-stage delinquencies, these trends support our aggressive approach to problem credit resolution. Continuing with that approach, we increased our loan loss reserves, which now stand at $1.5 billion or 3.35% of total loans. Our commercial, non-construction commercial real estate and consumer portfolios continue to have non-performing characteristics better than the bank as a whole, while our construction- and development-related loans continue to show the stresses of the national housing markets. This stress continues to be most apparent in the Arizona market where our home prices have fallen over 50% from their peak in June of 2006.Coming into 2010, we continue to anticipate a relative stabilization in non-performing loan trends, reflecting sustained improvement in early-stage delinquencies, reduced inflows and continued aggressive strategies to work out or sell non-performing credits. We were pleased that our non-performing loans again decreased for the quarter. Moving in to 2010, we have strengthening confidence that we will see continued credit quality improvements.For the quarter, we realized net charge offs of $572 million, and we provided $639 million for loan losses. Although these are higher than we initially expected, these levels reflect our continued efforts to proactively reduce our exposure to problem relationships. Importantly, we don't believe that charge offs and provision for this quarter are indicative of what we expect for 2010. Our quarter end reserve was 3.35% of period-end total loans, which is an increase of the $67 million from the prior quarter end. In addition to building the allowance, we have identified the specific loss content in non-accrual loans over $1 million and marked them to net realizable value with either a specific reserve or charge off. As shown in Slide 6, M&I has conducted a specific impairment analysis on $1.4 billion or 70% of total non-performing loans to quantify potential impairment. On average, 27% of the unpaid principal balance of these loans has been charged off. Through building the allowance and aggressively writing down problem loans, M&I posts a solid adjusted reserve coverage ratio of 191%.As we look forward, we expect to continue taking aggressive steps to resolve our non-performing loans, the proceeds from which will be redeployed in our business. As in prior quarters, the larger proportion of charge offs, approximately 52%, were associated with the Arizona and Florida marketplaces. As shown on Slide 31, the net charge offs by geographic location were $187 million for Arizona, and $108 million for Florida. Otherwise, charge offs were rather diversified from a geographic perspective. As expected, we are seeing a shift in Arizona charge offs away from our larger commercial construction credits towards smaller retail-related credits. Discussing our non-performing loan trends. During the quarter, our non-performing loans decreased $205 million, which is 9% below last quarter and 15% below the second quarter. For the quarter, we sold $143 million in larger-stressed construction and development loans. In addition, we sold a $70 million pool of non-performing or seriously delinquent single-family mortgage loans, resulting in a $35 million net charge off. Like our last non-performing residential loan sale, over 60% of the underlying loans are in Arizona.As in the past, we have moved aggressively to identify potential non-performing loans and the associated loss content. This is supported by the following: 25% of our non-performing loans are current or past due less than 30 days, up from 16% last quarter; of our loans past due 30 to 89 days, which we consider our early-stage delinquencies, $170 million are already non-performing; 34% or $687 million of our non-performing loans are past due less than 90 days. We have already realized partial charge offs of $810 million against our non-performing loans, representing a 28% haircut. Another way to look at our partial charge offs is that it represents a 52% write down on specific non-performing loans, where a direct write down was deemed necessary. A few comments on our construction and development portfolios. Within our loan portfolios, we continue to focus on our construction and development categories, particularly residential related. Please note on Slide 8 that we have segmented our commercial construction portfolio between C&I related and housing related. This slide highlights the continued strong credit quality profile of the non-housing component of the commercial construction portfolio. Less than half of our commercial construction portfolio is related to housing. As of quarter end, we have $807 million in construction and development loans on non-performing status, representing 39% of our total non-performing loans. As shown in Slide 33, of these non-performing construction and development loans, 50% are in the Arizona and Florida markets. On average, these loans are already heavily reserved or charged down. Clearly, our issues remain concentrated in these markets.To provide a little more granularity on our portfolio of larger construction and development projects, the following may be helpful: We have 27 loans greater than $5 million on non-accrual status, only nine of these are in excess of $10 million, and only one of these is in excess of $20 million. We have seen some stabilization in the residential land portfolio during the fourth quarter as non-performing loans have fallen $64 million. This portfolio is shown in Slides 38 and 39. We have $1.6 billion in residential land loans to individuals and developers, $870 million or 55% are located in Arizona zip codes, a bulk of the Arizona loans, two thirds, are in Maricopa County.The loans to individuals in the Arizona portfolio are relatively modest in size with an average balance of approximately $174,000. We continue to refresh both FICO scores and LTVs for the Arizona portfolio. Individual FICO scores average 736 at the time of origination, and for the performing loans remain above 720 today. Although we anticipate that our non-performing loans in the Arizona residential land portfolio will remain elevated, we believe we will benefit from the fact that we've first tightened our underwriting standards in mid-2005 and ceased new money originations in 2008.Residential lot loans to individual and developers account for $259 million of non-performing loans, of which 47% are based in Arizona zip codes. With regard to conventional mortgages, our portfolio continues to show that individuals are feeling continued economic stress. As we've noted before, we maintain our underwriting discipline through the cycle, have never originated sub-prime loans and have avoided many of the more risky loan products.During the quarter, our non-performing residential loans decreased to $206 million or 4.2% of the residential mortgage portfolio. These trends highlight the benefit of our non-performing residential loan sales completed in December and July. We continue to aggressively monitor and manage this portfolio.Just a couple of comments on our consumer loan trends as the overall consumer portfolio has maintained its non-performing loan levels below those of the overall bank. As of quarter end, only 1.4% of consumer loans were on non-performing status. As we've noted in the past, our credit quality experience with this portfolio has benefited from our historical practice of selling much of our production as we did in 2005 and 2006. Looking forward, consumer non-accruals, including both residential and home equity, are likely to remain elevated, reflecting continued consumer stress. Although we expect that our ultimate losses will remain better than industry averages. With regard to the commercial loan portfolio, during the course of the fourth quarter, we realized $85 million of net charge offs in our C&I portfolio. These charge offs are geographically dispersed. Generally, our commercial portfolio has performed relatively well during this cycle, while still showing the effect of the economy. In addition, we realized a decrease of $61 million in non-performing C&I loans.A brief comment on bank holding company loans. As of year end, we continue to retain a portfolio of approximately $550 million, of which 11% is non-performing, and against which we have reserves of 17%. We are adequately reserved, but will continue to evaluate this portfolio critically. Going forward, based on the rapidly changing landscape for banks and the loss of market synergies caused by the spinoff of Metavante, M&I's correspondent banking strategy has been redefined to include only core relationships that are within our banking footprint with the primary focus on fee-based activities going forward.With regard to our non-construction commercial real estate portfolio, we have $13.6 billion outstanding with $3.6 billion in multi-family and $9.3 billion in business real estate. As shown on Slide 16, our business real estate portfolio is generally concentrated in our core Midwest markets, two thirds, with only 17% than our combined Florida and the Arizona market and another 3% in other higher-risk markets. 37% of this portfolio is owner occupied. In the fourth quarter, we saw our non-performing loans in the non-construction commercial real estate category increase $75 million to 4.3%. Contributing to this increase is the review of renegotiated loans that we noted earlier in the call. We performed a rigorous review of our commercial division renegotiated loans, and found that the performance of certain related properties had deteriorated to a point where we felt non-accrual status was more appropriate. With this determination, we moved $170 million to non-accrual status. In addition, we are carrying the loans on our books at 44% of unpaid principal balance through either partial charge offs or specific reserves.A few comments on our accruing renegotiated loans. Over the past quarter, we have seen a $142 million decrease in accruing renegotiated loans to a total of $793 million. This decrease is largely a result of previously discussed review of certain relationships. On the consumer side, the vast majority of these loans continue to be related to home, land or construction loans to individuals. At quarter end, these categories accounted for approximately $647 million or 82% of the total. Within the consumer sector, our restructured loan delinquency trends continue to perform better than national averages.Over the next few quarters, we continue to expect non-performing loan and real estate owned balances to remain elevated above historical averages, reflecting broader economic stress that we anticipate inflows will continue to slow. We specifically anticipate that the inflows of larger construction credits are past their peak.As I noted in discussing Slide 6, through increasing the reserve and aggressively writing down problem loans, M&I has an adjusted reserve coverage ratio of 191%. We'll continue to violate the opportunity for further sales of non-performing assets and weigh the opportunity versus the cost to keeping those assets for a period of time. Sometimes the best resolution will be to take the underlying property to maximize our interest, which will cause increases to REO for a period of time.This quarter, our REO increased to $441 million, and this is consistent with previous expectations. We have seven commercial properties over $10 million. We continue to expect that REO balances will increase going forward, and view this as a natural progression as we gain control of projects and move towards ultimate resolutions. A few final comments on credit quality. Stresses in the national housing and commercial real estate markets will continue to affect us, and we will continue to address them proactively. We have and will continue to take aggressive steps to resolve our non-performing situation. Nonetheless, should the economy continue to deteriorate beyond our current expectations, our losses could continue. Our non-performing loans continue to be concentrated in the housing construction related components of the commercial and residential real estate portfolios, particularly in our Arizona, Florida and correspondent businesses. Despite a recent increase in Florida, we continue to believe our larger C&D challenges in the Florida and Arizona markets are behind us.Although we are not immune from consumer deterioration, we believe our residential and consumer portfolios will continue to perform better than the industry as a whole. And also recall that our credit card portfolio is relatively small, with less than $300 million of outstandings.We will continue to maintain a strong reserve coverage ratio, and we'll continue to aggressively write down problem loans. We remain committed to returning M&I to a level of solid credit quality, and are hopeful that our declines in non-performing loans, non-performing loan inflows and early-stage delinquencies are all early indicators of achieving this goal.Changing focus to the organic balance sheet trends compared to the same quarter in 2008. Fourth quarter 2009 average loans were $45 billion, which is $4.9 billion or 10% lower than the fourth quarter of 2008. C&I loans decreased on average by $2.2 billion or 14%, as we are seeing lower lying utilization and seasonal borrowing from existing customers than in prior years.Moving into 2010, we expect to see C&I balances to continue contracting until the economic recovery takes stronger hold. On a linked-quarter basis, C&I loans contracted $960 million or 6.8%. Across all of our construction and development categories, we have seen approximately $3.7 billion or 38% contraction since the fourth quarter of last year. This is consistent with our broader goal of reducing our total construction and development portfolio to less than 10% of total loans. At quarter end, construction and development loans accounted for 12.5% of total loans, down from a high of 22.6% in the third quarter of 2007.Non-construction commercial real estate loans increased on average by $1.6 billion, or nearly 13% in comparison to the same quarter last year. This reflects the natural progression of projects to completion and lease up, most of which occurred earlier in 2009.On a linked-quarter basis, loans in this category were essentially flat. Commercial real estate volumes are soft in all categories, reflecting the economy. This is translated into minimal investor activity in new construction projects with medical office being the least impacted. Lack of availability of any financing is significantly impacting this marketplace. Retail continues to soften as expected to do so through 2010, as many retailers have cut back expansion plans. Many retailers are demanding rent concessions on existing leases, potentially impacting our customers. Office continues to soften in all markets. Job loss has significantly impacted this segment in 2009, and are anticipated to do so in 2010. Hospitality softened with the economy in the second half of 2009, and is expected to remain soft.Together, these factors lead our expectation that our nonconstruction Commercial Real Estate portfolio balances will be relatively flat for 2010. On the deposit side, we have seen good underlying dynamics this year with average deposit balances up nearly $1 billion versus the fourth quarter of 2008. Non-interest-bearing deposits increased $1.9 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase is attributable in part to the low interest rate environment and continued confidence in M&I. As we have discussed before, we have reconfigured many of our deposit product offerings. The benefit of these changes are shown by the $1.6 billion of growth in savings deposits and the $1.6 billion of growth in NOW balances since the fourth quarter of last year. In addition, we have benefited from an improved deposit mix as our time balance has declined by over $2 billion.A few final comments. As we move into the first quarter of 2010, and to reiterate comments made earlier, we expect our financial results to reflect the benefits of aggressive credit steps that we have taken, but also, the challenges of broader financial markets. As you are aware, every economic cycle brings its own set of challenges. This economic cycle has been marked by rapid deterioration followed by more recent stabilization in general economic conditions, a challenging and prolonged low interest rate environment, competitive pricing pressures on many loan and deposit products and a dramatic downturn in the national residential housing markets. As we move forward in this economic cycle, we will continue to benefit from the strength of our balance sheet, the dedication of our employees and the diversification of our franchise. This concludes our prepared remarks. Joining me now are Mark Furlong, our CEO; and Mark Hogan, our Chief Credit Officer, and they can help answer questions. Operator, you may open the line for questions, please."

But as we continue to be aggressive chasing resolutions, one of driving some of that. I think as we look forward, there is a couple of factors that lead us to believe these numbers will be coming down. Number one, as the nonperforming loan trends improve, as well as new nonperforming loan formation continues to improve, that will certainly just stem what's going into the pipeline. The other thing is I think that we would expect that it's going to help us out here is as home prices stabilize throughout the country, we're now finding our marks on ORE or loans held for sale are holding up better. When you think about the type of price depreciation that we've had in housing over the last three years and the rapid descent of that, you could had a piece of property that was well marked at the end of one quarter. But if you had the continuous trend of home prices going down, you would had an incremental mark the next quarter. So more stability in real estate prices is going to help us get the mark right the first time for the life of the loan, which therefore means the ORE expenses should come down."

As you can see from our results, we continue to remain aggressive in dealing with tough credit issues. Though elevated levels of charge-offs will continue for the next couple of quarters, barring something unforeseen taking place in the economy, we do expect charge-offs to start to decline in 2010. We will continue to have some relationships that we need to work through at the end of the recession, but the likelihood of a real estate project surviving today is a great deal different than two years ago. We're most likely at a turning point in credit quality, though another quarter too is needed to validate that condition.As Greg Smith will review with you in a couple of minutes, early-stage delinquency continues to improve such as loans 30 to 89 days delinquent are now at their lowest levels since 2007. This is probably our best gauge of future charge-offs. A great deal of attention is being devoted to what may occur with commercial real estate this year and over the next two to three years. Although our delinquency in commercial real estate is higher than in 2007, the trend is toward a decline in delinquency the last two quarters.We remain optimistic though focused on this portfolio, particularly as we finished a review of all loans greater than $1 million in December. We have no expectations that our commercial real estate portfolio will perform in any way comparable to what we've seen with construction and development. Our settlement risk that are due to the small average size of our loans, our concentration in the Midwest and the extent of cash flow stabilization in this book of business. I'm sure we'll have some issues over time, but we expect them to be manageable. As we move into 2010, we've intended to leave no struggling assets unaddressed. In addition to significant charge-offs on our portfolio over the last two years, we've sold $2 billion of underperforming loans. We will continue to sell these loans, but we expect the pace to slow.We saw some improvement in pricing this quarter, which is to be expected as real estate values begin to stabilize. We feel the same way about properties we've taken into owned real estate. On the commercial side of REO, we have three completed projects in the process of being leased up, at aggregate about $80 million. We've just written down about 25%. On the consumer side, the small number of homes we own are being carried at approximately 62% of unpaid balance. And the residential lots are being carried at 30% of unpaid balance. The point in saying that is to reinforce that we're dressing every matter in the same manner. We're glad to put these last two years behind us. And though the economy still creates some uncertainty, we feel like we're well positioned to remain strong as the credit cycle winds down.There's several positive indicators about the underlying strength of M&I, and Greg will share some of the metrics on these non-credit aspects of our business to reinforce our sentiments. With that, let me turn the call over to Greg."

We have included detailed credit quality slides on our website. You may want to have these printed out and available for our credit quality discussion.Although our fourth quarter results continue to reflect the challenging operating environment that has confronted banks, our results provide us building confidence that a recovery is underway at M&I. Our credit quality trends continue to benefit from our aggressive approach to non-performing loan identification and resolution, as is shown by: Continued favorable trends in loans going on to non-performing status; continued improvement in early-stage delinquencies, which decreased for the third consecutive quarter; continued improvement in total nonperforming loans, which decreased for the second consecutive quarter. The important items to focus on to better understand our fourth quarter performance include the following: We have continued our aggressive steps to address the largest risks in our loan portfolio, including our Construction and Development business, even though these steps continue to be the primary reason for our loss in the quarter. In addition, we transferred $170 million of larger, previously classified as renegotiated loans to non-performing status as our review showed core performance on these properties deteriorated. We will discuss these loans in more detail later in this call.Despite the migration of these renegotiated loans, non-performing loans were down over $200 million this quarter, which reflects the impact of our continued aggressive non-performing loan workout and disposition strategies. In comparison to the prior quarter, non-performing loan inflows were down 8% when adjusted for the previously renegotiated loans mentioned a moment ago.For the quarter, our early-stage loan delinquencies, those loans past due 30 to 89 days, declined by over 15% since September to the lowest level since 2007. As we have noted previously, we are increasingly comfortable that the pattern of large commercial real estate construction and development charge-offs in Arizona is largely behind us. Since year-end 2007, this portfolio has contracted by nearly 80%, and is now under $300 million.Although we do not believe our construction and development issues are completely behind us, we are encouraged that total non-accrual C&D loans contracted for the third quarter in a row. Our non-performing loans continue to decline. Our portfolio of C&D loans on non-accrual amounts to approximately $800 million, down approximately $180 million from September 30. This decrease is largely attributable to the Arizona market.We have increased our reserve to 3.35% of total loans, or nearly $1.5 billion, and continue to make progress toward our goal of reducing our concentration of construction and development loans, which now stand at 12.5% of our loan portfolio versus 18% at the end of 2008. For the quarter, we benefited from $46 million in after-tax gains from security sales and tendering for our own debt securities. These gains are offset by further aggressive steps in non-performing asset resolution. Our wealth management division continue to grow revenues, as well as assets under both management and administration this quarter, reaching record highs for both. We continue to have a capital base well above any regulatory capital thresholds. At quarter end, our tangible common equity ratio was 8.2% and our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is estimated to be 11.1%. During the quarter, we realized 13 basis points of Net Interest Margin expansion, reflecting continued success in improving our funding and lending profiles and the effect of fewer loans becoming a non-performing. We finished 2009 with 106% loan-to-deposit ratio, down from 132% just two years ago.Now for some additional insights into the quarter, and we'll start with the Net Interest Margin. Our Net Interest Margin increased by 13 basis points on a linked-quarter basis to 2.95%. During the fourth quarter, our Net Interest Margin benefited from credit quality improvement and the restructuring and/or retiring of certain debt instruments. Despite recent asset quality improvements, our margin continues to be negatively impacted by non-performing assets. The negative impact is 25 basis points in total, and 13 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2007. We expect that the Net Interest Margin will trend upward slightly for the near-term as we anticipate additional favorable results from the restructuring activities late in the quarter and further improvements in credit quality.Like the industry in general, we expect to be challenged by competitive pricing, the impact of deposit and loan pricing floors, the movement of new and existing deposits into lower spread, higher-yielding products, wholesale funding spreads and, of course, the yield curve. There continue to be many variables that impact margin. It is difficult to project this one data point, given the current interest rate volatility occurring in the market.Now moving on to wealth management. In spite of market volatility, revenues increased 5% on a linked-quarter basis and 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Expanding sales, enhanced investment products and investment performance generated the improved results. Sales pipelines continue to build across our divisions, especially in our institutional businesses, which include our retirement services, not-for-profit and outsourcing lines. Assets under Management reached $33 billion, up 8% compared to the end of 2008. Our assets under administration rose to $122 billion or 17% greater than the same period a year ago. Our asset management acquisitions continue to perform well. Both Delta and Taplin Canida & Habacht experienced new asset additions and growth of existing relationships during the quarter. Our brokerage and insurance division continue to experience good sales flows during the quarter as investors position their portfolios for 2010. Revenues were up 1% on a linked-quarter basis, and up 6% compared to the same quarter last year, reflecting improved investor confidence and greater coverage by our financial advisors.From an expense standpoint, total non-interest expense amounted to $409 million in the fourth quarter, consistent with the third quarter. Expenses for non-performing assets and other credit-related items were relatively unchanged, compared to last quarter, at $69 million. These are largely related to collection efforts and carrying costs for non-performing assets.Although our reported efficiency ratios is 67%, when adjusted for these items and other credit-related expenses, we view our core efficiency ratio to be 56.7%, down 1% from the prior quarter. Nonetheless, particularly in the current operating environment, M&I will continue to be very focused on maintaining our historical expense discipline.  Now moving to our credit quality trends. Non-performing loans decreased for the second consecutive quarter, resulting in our lowest level of non-performing loans since the end of 2008. When coupled with continued improvement in early-stage delinquencies, these trends support our aggressive approach to problem credit resolution. Continuing with that approach, we increased our loan loss reserves, which now stand at $1.5 billion or 3.35% of total loans. Our commercial, non-construction commercial real estate and consumer portfolios continue to have non-performing characteristics better than the bank as a whole, while our construction- and development-related loans continue to show the stresses of the national housing markets. This stress continues to be most apparent in the Arizona market where our home prices have fallen over 50% from their peak in June of 2006.Coming into 2010, we continue to anticipate a relative stabilization in non-performing loan trends, reflecting sustained improvement in early-stage delinquencies, reduced inflows and continued aggressive strategies to work out or sell non-performing credits. We were pleased that our non-performing loans again decreased for the quarter. Moving in to 2010, we have strengthening confidence that we will see continued credit quality improvements.For the quarter, we realized net charge-offs of $572 million, and we provided $639 million for loan losses. Although these are higher than we initially expected, these levels reflect our continued efforts to proactively reduce our exposure to problem relationships. Importantly, we don't believe that charge-offs and provision for this quarter are indicative of what we expect for 2010. Our quarter-end reserve was 3.35% of period-end total loans, which is an increase of the $67 million from the prior quarter end. In addition to building the allowance, we have identified the specific loss content in non-accrual loans over $1 million and marked them to net realizable value with either a specific reserve or charge-off. As shown in Slide 6, M&I has conducted a specific impairment analysis on $1.4 billion, or 70% of total non-performing loans, to quantify potential impairment. On average, 27% of the unpaid principal balance of these loans has been charged off. Through building the allowance and aggressively writing down problem loans, M&I posts a solid adjusted reserve coverage ratio of 191%.As we look forward, we expect to continue taking aggressive steps to resolve our non-performing loans, the proceeds from which will be redeployed in our business. As in prior quarters, the larger proportion of charge-offs, approximately 52%, were associated with the Arizona and Florida marketplaces. As shown on Slide 31, the net charge-offs by geographic location were $187 million for Arizona, and $108 million for Florida. Otherwise, charge-offs were rather diversified from a geographic perspective. As expected, we are seeing a shift in Arizona charge-offs away from our larger commercial construction credits towards smaller retail-related credits. Discussing our non-performing loan trends. During the quarter, our non-performing loans decreased $205 million, which is 9% below last quarter and 15% below the second quarter. For the quarter, we sold $143 million in larger-stressed construction and development loans. In addition, we sold a $70 million pool of non-performing or seriously delinquent single-family mortgage loans, resulting in a $35 million net charge-off. Like our last non-performing residential loan sale, over 60% of the underlying loans are in Arizona.As in the past, we have moved aggressively to identify potential non-performing loans and the associated loss content. This is supported by the following: 25% of our non-performing loans are current or past due less than 30 days, up from 16% last quarter; of our loans past due 30 to 89 days, which we consider our early-stage delinquencies, $170 million are already non-performing; 34% or $687 million of our non-performing loans are past due less than 90 days. We have already realized partial charge-offs of $810 million against our non-performing loans, representing a 28% haircut. Another way to look at our partial charge-offs is that it represents a 52% writedown on specific non-performing loans, where a direct writedown was deemed necessary. A few comments on our construction and development portfolios. Within our loan portfolios, we continue to focus on our construction and development categories, particularly residential related. Please note on Slide 8 that we have segmented our commercial construction portfolio between C&I related and housing related. This slide highlights the continued strong credit quality profile of the non-housing component of the commercial construction portfolio. Less than half of our commercial construction portfolio is related to housing. As of quarter end, we have $807 million in construction and development loans on non-performing status, representing 39% of our total non-performing loans. As shown in Slide 33, of these non-performing construction and development loans, 50% are in the Arizona and Florida markets. On average, these loans are already heavily reserved or charged down. Clearly, our issues remain concentrated in these markets.To provide a little more granularity on our portfolio of larger construction and development projects, the following may be helpful: We have 27 loans greater than $5 million on non-accrual status, only nine of these are in excess of $10 million, and only one of these is in excess of $20 million. We have seen some stabilization in the residential land portfolio during the fourth quarter as non-performing loans have fallen $64 million. This portfolio is shown in Slides 38 and 39. We have $1.6 billion in residential land loans to individuals and developers, $870 million or 55% are located in Arizona zip codes. A bulk of the Arizona loans, two thirds, are in Maricopa County.The loans to individuals in the Arizona portfolio are relatively modest in size with an average balance of approximately $174,000. We continue to refresh both FICO scores and LTVs for the Arizona portfolio. Individual FICO scores average 736 at the time of origination, and for the performing loans remain above 720 today. Although we anticipate that our non-performing loans in the Arizona residential land portfolio will remain elevated, we believe we will benefit from the fact that we've first tightened our underwriting standards in mid-2005 and ceased new money originations in 2008.Residential lot loans to individual and developers account for $259 million of non-performing loans, of which 47% are based in Arizona zip codes. With regard to conventional mortgages, our portfolio continues to show that individuals are feeling continued economic stress. As we've noted before, we maintain our underwriting discipline through the cycle, have never originated sub-prime loans and have avoided many of the more risky loan products.During the quarter, our non-performing residential loans decreased to $206 million or 4.2% of the residential mortgage portfolio. These trends highlight the benefit of our non-performing residential loan sales completed in December and July. We continue to aggressively monitor and manage this portfolio.Just a couple of comments on our consumer loan trends as the overall consumer portfolio has maintained its non-performing loan levels below those of the overall bank. As of quarter end, only 1.4% of consumer loans were on non-performing status. As we've noted in the past, our credit quality experience with this portfolio has benefited from our historical practice of selling much of our production as we did in 2005 and 2006. Looking forward, consumer non-accruals, including both residential and home equity, are likely to remain elevated, reflecting continued consumer stress. Although we expect that our ultimate losses will remain better than industry averages. With regard to the commercial loan portfolio, during the course of the fourth quarter, we realized $85 million of net charge-offs in our C&I portfolio. These charge-offs are geographically dispersed. Generally, our commercial portfolio has performed relatively well during this cycle, while still showing the effect of the economy. In addition, we realized a decrease of $61 million in non-performing C&I loans.A brief comment on bank holding company loans. As of year end, we continue to retain a portfolio of approximately $550 million, of which 11% is non-performing, and against which we have reserves of 17%. We are adequately reserved, but will continue to evaluate this portfolio critically. Going forward, based on the rapidly changing landscape for banks and the loss of market synergies caused by the spinoff of Metavante, M&I's correspondent banking strategy has been redefined to include only core relationships that are within our banking footprint with the primary focus on fee-based activities going forward.With regard to our non-construction commercial real estate portfolio, we have $13.6 billion outstanding with $3.6 billion in multi-family and $9.3 billion in business real estate. As shown on Slide 16, our business real estate portfolio is generally concentrated in our core Midwest markets, two thirds, with only 17% than our combined Florida and the Arizona market and another 3% in other higher-risk markets. 37% of this portfolio is owner occupied. In the fourth quarter, we saw our non-performing loans in the non-construction commercial real estate category increase $75 million to 4.3%. Contributing to this increase is the review of renegotiated loans that we noted earlier in the call. We performed a rigorous review of our commercial division renegotiated loans, and found that the performance of certain related properties had deteriorated to a point where we felt non-accrual status was more appropriate. With this determination, we moved $170 million to non-accrual status. In addition, we are carrying the loans on our books at 44% of unpaid principal balance through either partial charge-offs or specific reserves.A few comments on our accruing renegotiated loans. Over the past quarter, we have seen a $142 million decrease in accruing renegotiated loans to a total of $793 million. This decrease is largely a result of previously discussed review of certain relationships. On the consumer side, the vast majority of these loans continue to be related to home, land or construction loans to individuals. At quarter end, these categories accounted for approximately $647 million or 82% of the total. Within the consumer sector, our restructured loan delinquency trends continue to perform better than national averages.Over the next few quarters, we continue to expect non-performing loan and real estate owned balances to remain elevated above historical averages, reflecting broader economic stress that we anticipate inflows will continue to slow. We specifically anticipate that the inflows of larger construction credits are past their peak.As I noted in discussing Slide 6, through increasing the reserve and aggressively writing down problem loans, M&I has an adjusted reserve coverage ratio of 191%. We'll continue to violate the opportunity for further sales of non-performing assets and weigh the opportunity versus the cost to keeping those assets for a period of time. Sometimes the best resolution will be to take the underlying property to maximize our interest, which will cause increases to REO for a period of time.This quarter, our REO increased to $441 million, and this is consistent with previous expectations. We have seven commercial properties over $10 million. We continue to expect that REO balances will increase going forward, and view this as a natural progression as we gain control of projects and move towards ultimate resolutions. A few final comments on credit quality. Stresses in the national housing and commercial real estate markets will continue to affect us, and we will continue to address them proactively. We have and will continue to take aggressive steps to resolve our non-performing situation. Nonetheless, should the economy continue to deteriorate beyond our current expectations, our losses could continue. Our non-performing loans continue to be concentrated in the housing construction related components of the commercial and residential real estate portfolios, particularly in our Arizona, Florida and correspondent businesses. Despite a recent increase in Florida, we continue to believe our larger C&D challenges in the Florida and Arizona markets are behind us.Although we are not immune from consumer deterioration, we believe our residential and consumer portfolios will continue to perform better than the industry as a whole. And also recall that our credit card portfolio is relatively small, with less than $300 million of outstandings.We will continue to maintain a strong reserve coverage ratio, and we'll continue to aggressively write down problem loans. We remain committed to returning M&I to a level of solid credit quality, and are hopeful that our declines in non-performing loans, non-performing loan inflows and early-stage delinquencies are all early indicators of achieving this goal.Changing focus to the organic balance sheet trends compared to the same quarter in 2008. Fourth quarter 2009 average loans were $45 billion, which is $4.9 billion or 10% lower than the fourth quarter of 2008. C&I loans decreased on average by $2.2 billion or 14%, as we are seeing lower lying utilization and seasonal borrowing from existing customers than in prior years.Moving into 2010, we expect to see C&I balances to continue contracting until the economic recovery takes stronger hold. On a linked-quarter basis, C&I loans contracted $960 million or 6.8%. Across all of our construction and development categories, we have seen approximately $3.7 billion or 38% contraction since the fourth quarter of last year. This is consistent with our broader goal of reducing our total construction and development portfolio to less than 10% of total loans. At quarter end, construction and development loans accounted for 12.5% of total loans, down from a high of 22.6% in the third quarter of 2007.Non-construction commercial real estate loans increased on average by $1.6 billion, or nearly 13% in comparison to the same quarter last year. This reflects the natural progression of projects to completion and lease up, most of which occurred earlier in 2009.On a linked-quarter basis, loans in this category were essentially flat. Commercial real estate volumes are soft in all categories, reflecting the economy. This is translated into minimal investor activity in new construction projects with medical office being the least impacted. Lack of availability of any financing is significantly impacting this marketplace. Retail continues to soften as expected to do so through 2010, as many retailers have cut back expansion plans. Many retailers are demanding rent concessions on existing leases, potentially impacting our customers. Office continues to soften in all markets. Job loss has significantly impacted this segment in 2009, and are anticipated to do so in 2010. Hospitality softened with the economy in the second half of 2009, and is expected to remain soft.Together, these factors lead our expectation that our nonconstruction Commercial Real Estate portfolio balances will be relatively flat for 2010. On the deposit side, we have seen good underlying dynamics this year with average deposit balances up nearly $1 billion versus the fourth quarter of 2008. Non-interest-bearing deposits increased $1.9 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase is attributable in part to the low interest rate environment and continued confidence in M&I. As we have discussed before, we have reconfigured many of our deposit product offerings. The benefit of these changes are shown by the $1.6 billion of growth in savings deposits and the $1.6 billion of growth in NOW balances since the fourth quarter of last year. In addition, we have benefited from an improved deposit mix as our time balance has declined by over $2 billion.A few final comments. As we move into the first quarter of 2010, and to reiterate comments made earlier, we expect our financial results to reflect the benefits of aggressive credit steps that we have taken, but also, the challenges of broader financial markets. As you are aware, every economic cycle brings its own set of challenges. This economic cycle has been marked by rapid deterioration followed by more recent stabilization in general economic conditions, a challenging and prolonged low interest rate environment, competitive pricing pressures on many loan and deposit products and a dramatic downturn in the national residential housing markets. As we move forward in this economic cycle, we will continue to benefit from the strength of our balance sheet, the dedication of our employees and the diversification of our franchise. This concludes our prepared remarks. Joining me now are Mark Furlong, our CEO; and Mark Hogan, our Chief Credit Officer, and they can help answer questions. Operator, you may open the line for questions, please."

But as we continue to be aggressive chasing resolutions, one of driving some of that. I think as we look forward, there is a couple of factors that lead us to believe these numbers will be coming down. Number one, as the nonperforming loan trends improve, as well as new nonperforming loan formation continues to improve, that will certainly just stem what's going into the pipeline. The other thing is I think that we would expect that it's going to help us out here is as home prices stabilize throughout the country, we're now finding our marks on ORE or loans held for sale are holding up better. When you think about the type of price depreciation that we've had in housing over the last three years and the rapid descent of that, you could had a piece of property that was well marked at the end of one quarter. But if you had the continuous trend of home prices going down, you would had an incremental mark the next quarter. So more stability in real estate prices is going to help us get the mark right the first time for the life of the loan, which therefore means the ORE expenses should come down."

So relatively happy with that performance. And that is an improvement versus where we were last quarter. And Minneapolis, nonperforming loans are a little bit higher, but again, we like the fundamental trends we've see there. As a matter fact, nonperforming loans in Minneapolis improved by about half a percent in the course of the last quarter. The St. Louis market, nonperforming loans in credit quality, again, shows sign of the economic downturn and some of those signs are stressed. But of some of those sign of stress. But St. Louis and Indianapolis have both performed well through the cycle. In terms of our core Midwest markets, we see a little bit more stress in the Kansas City market. Just to be fair, that portfolio was a little bit more dependent on the construction category as well. But when you transition here, just a general economic trends and in particular, think about some of the Beige Book data that comes our for the Kansas City marketplace, generally, the economic downturn in many ways hasn't hit Kansas City as badly so we see a great opportunity in that market as we go forward. So far, that covers your question on the four Midwest markets.  I would just say at one point that -- Indy, very similar in the St. Louis, I sort of rolled that in, very happy with the credit quality trends that we've seen in that market. The team there has done quite well. As matter fact, nonperforming loans in Indiana today are running at about 2.2%. So very happy with those trends as well."

As you can see from our results, we continue to remain aggressive in dealing with tough credit issues. Though elevated levels of charge-offs will continue for the next couple of quarters, barring something unforeseen taking place in the economy, we do expect charge-offs to start to decline in 2010. We will continue to have some relationships that we need to work through at the end of the recession, but the likelihood of a real estate project surviving today is a great deal different than two years ago. We're most likely at a turning point in credit quality, though another quarter too is needed to validate that condition.As Greg Smith will review with you in a couple of minutes, early-stage delinquency continues to improve such as loans 30 to 89 days delinquent are now at their lowest levels since 2007. This is probably our best gauge of future charge-offs. A great deal of attention is being devoted to what may occur with commercial real estate this year and over the next two to three years. Although our delinquency in commercial real estate is higher than in 2007, the trend is toward a decline in delinquency the last two quarters.We remain optimistic though focused on this portfolio, particularly as we finished a review of all loans greater than $1 million in December. We have no expectations that our commercial real estate portfolio will perform in any way comparable to what we've seen with construction and development. Our settlement risk that are due to the small average size of our loans, our concentration in the Midwest and the extent of cash flow stabilization in this book of business. I'm sure we'll have some issues over time, but we expect them to be manageable. As we move into 2010, we've intended to leave no struggling assets unaddressed. In addition to significant charge-offs on our portfolio over the last two years, we've sold $2 billion of underperforming loans. We will continue to sell these loans, but we expect the pace to slow.We saw some improvement in pricing this quarter, which is to be expected as real estate values begin to stabilize. We feel the same way about properties we've taken into owned real estate. On the commercial side of REO, we have three completed projects in the process of being leased up, at aggregate about $80 million. We've just written down about 25%. On the consumer side, the small number of homes we own are being carried at approximately 62% of unpaid balance. And the residential lots are being carried at 30% of unpaid balance. The point in saying that is to reinforce that we're dressing every matter in the same manner. We're glad to put these last two years behind us. And though the economy still creates some uncertainty, we feel like we're well positioned to remain strong as the credit cycle winds down.There's several positive indicators about the underlying strength of M&I, and Greg will share some of the metrics on these non-credit aspects of our business to reinforce our sentiments. With that, let me turn the call over to Greg."

We have included detailed credit quality slides on our website. You may want to have these printed out and available for our credit quality discussion.Although our fourth quarter results continue to reflect the challenging operating environment that has confronted banks, our results provide us building confidence that a recovery is underway at M&I. Our credit quality trends continue to benefit from our aggressive approach to non-performing loan identification and resolution, as is shown by: Continued favorable trends in loans going on to non-performing status; continued improvement in early-stage delinquencies, which decreased for the third consecutive quarter; continued improvement in total nonperforming loans, which decreased for the second consecutive quarter. The important items to focus on to better understand our fourth quarter performance include the following: We have continued our aggressive steps to address the largest risks in our loan portfolio, including our Construction and Development business, even though these steps continue to be the primary reason for our loss in the quarter. In addition, we transferred $170 million of larger, previously classified as renegotiated loans to non-performing status as our review showed core performance on these properties deteriorated. We will discuss these loans in more detail later in this call.Despite the migration of these renegotiated loans, non-performing loans were down over $200 million this quarter, which reflects the impact of our continued aggressive non-performing loan workout and disposition strategies. In comparison to the prior quarter, non-performing loan inflows were down 8% when adjusted for the previously renegotiated loans mentioned a moment ago.For the quarter, our early-stage loan delinquencies, those loans past due 30 to 89 days, declined by over 15% since September to the lowest level since 2007. As we have noted previously, we are increasingly comfortable that the pattern of large commercial real estate construction and development charge-offs in Arizona is largely behind us. Since year-end 2007, this portfolio has contracted by nearly 80%, and is now under $300 million.Although we do not believe our construction and development issues are completely behind us, we are encouraged that total non-accrual C&D loans contracted for the third quarter in a row. Our non-performing loans continue to decline. Our portfolio of C&D loans on non-accrual amounts to approximately $800 million, down approximately $180 million from September 30. This decrease is largely attributable to the Arizona market.We have increased our reserve to 3.35% of total loans, or nearly $1.5 billion, and continue to make progress toward our goal of reducing our concentration of construction and development loans, which now stand at 12.5% of our loan portfolio versus 18% at the end of 2008. For the quarter, we benefited from $46 million in after-tax gains from security sales and tendering for our own debt securities. These gains are offset by further aggressive steps in non-performing asset resolution. Our wealth management division continue to grow revenues, as well as assets under both management and administration this quarter, reaching record highs for both. We continue to have a capital base well above any regulatory capital thresholds. At quarter end, our tangible common equity ratio was 8.2% and our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is estimated to be 11.1%. During the quarter, we realized 13 basis points of Net Interest Margin expansion, reflecting continued success in improving our funding and lending profiles and the effect of fewer loans becoming a non-performing. We finished 2009 with 106% loan-to-deposit ratio, down from 132% just two years ago.Now for some additional insights into the quarter, and we'll start with the Net Interest Margin. Our Net Interest Margin increased by 13 basis points on a linked-quarter basis to 2.95%. During the fourth quarter, our Net Interest Margin benefited from credit quality improvement and the restructuring and/or retiring of certain debt instruments. Despite recent asset quality improvements, our margin continues to be negatively impacted by non-performing assets. The negative impact is 25 basis points in total, and 13 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2007. We expect that the Net Interest Margin will trend upward slightly for the near-term as we anticipate additional favorable results from the restructuring activities late in the quarter and further improvements in credit quality.Like the industry in general, we expect to be challenged by competitive pricing, the impact of deposit and loan pricing floors, the movement of new and existing deposits into lower spread, higher-yielding products, wholesale funding spreads and, of course, the yield curve. There continue to be many variables that impact margin. It is difficult to project this one data point, given the current interest rate volatility occurring in the market.Now moving on to wealth management. In spite of market volatility, revenues increased 5% on a linked-quarter basis and 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Expanding sales, enhanced investment products and investment performance generated the improved results. Sales pipelines continue to build across our divisions, especially in our institutional businesses, which include our retirement services, not-for-profit and outsourcing lines. Assets under Management reached $33 billion, up 8% compared to the end of 2008. Our assets under administration rose to $122 billion or 17% greater than the same period a year ago. Our asset management acquisitions continue to perform well. Both Delta and Taplin Canida & Habacht experienced new asset additions and growth of existing relationships during the quarter. Our brokerage and insurance division continue to experience good sales flows during the quarter as investors position their portfolios for 2010. Revenues were up 1% on a linked-quarter basis, and up 6% compared to the same quarter last year, reflecting improved investor confidence and greater coverage by our financial advisors.From an expense standpoint, total non-interest expense amounted to $409 million in the fourth quarter, consistent with the third quarter. Expenses for non-performing assets and other credit-related items were relatively unchanged, compared to last quarter, at $69 million. These are largely related to collection efforts and carrying costs for non-performing assets.Although our reported efficiency ratios is 67%, when adjusted for these items and other credit-related expenses, we view our core efficiency ratio to be 56.7%, down 1% from the prior quarter. Nonetheless, particularly in the current operating environment, M&I will continue to be very focused on maintaining our historical expense discipline.  Now moving to our credit quality trends. Non-performing loans decreased for the second consecutive quarter, resulting in our lowest level of non-performing loans since the end of 2008. When coupled with continued improvement in early-stage delinquencies, these trends support our aggressive approach to problem credit resolution. Continuing with that approach, we increased our loan loss reserves, which now stand at $1.5 billion or 3.35% of total loans. Our commercial, non-construction commercial real estate and consumer portfolios continue to have non-performing characteristics better than the bank as a whole, while our construction- and development-related loans continue to show the stresses of the national housing markets. This stress continues to be most apparent in the Arizona market where our home prices have fallen over 50% from their peak in June of 2006.Coming into 2010, we continue to anticipate a relative stabilization in non-performing loan trends, reflecting sustained improvement in early-stage delinquencies, reduced inflows and continued aggressive strategies to work out or sell non-performing credits. We were pleased that our non-performing loans again decreased for the quarter. Moving in to 2010, we have strengthening confidence that we will see continued credit quality improvements.For the quarter, we realized net charge-offs of $572 million, and we provided $639 million for loan losses. Although these are higher than we initially expected, these levels reflect our continued efforts to proactively reduce our exposure to problem relationships. Importantly, we don't believe that charge-offs and provision for this quarter are indicative of what we expect for 2010. Our quarter-end reserve was 3.35% of period-end total loans, which is an increase of the $67 million from the prior quarter end. In addition to building the allowance, we have identified the specific loss content in non-accrual loans over $1 million and marked them to net realizable value with either a specific reserve or charge-off. As shown in Slide 6, M&I has conducted a specific impairment analysis on $1.4 billion, or 70% of total non-performing loans, to quantify potential impairment. On average, 27% of the unpaid principal balance of these loans has been charged off. Through building the allowance and aggressively writing down problem loans, M&I posts a solid adjusted reserve coverage ratio of 191%.As we look forward, we expect to continue taking aggressive steps to resolve our non-performing loans, the proceeds from which will be redeployed in our business. As in prior quarters, the larger proportion of charge-offs, approximately 52%, were associated with the Arizona and Florida marketplaces. As shown on Slide 31, the net charge-offs by geographic location were $187 million for Arizona, and $108 million for Florida. Otherwise, charge-offs were rather diversified from a geographic perspective. As expected, we are seeing a shift in Arizona charge-offs away from our larger commercial construction credits towards smaller retail-related credits. Discussing our non-performing loan trends. During the quarter, our non-performing loans decreased $205 million, which is 9% below last quarter and 15% below the second quarter. For the quarter, we sold $143 million in larger-stressed construction and development loans. In addition, we sold a $70 million pool of non-performing or seriously delinquent single-family mortgage loans, resulting in a $35 million net charge-off. Like our last non-performing residential loan sale, over 60% of the underlying loans are in Arizona.As in the past, we have moved aggressively to identify potential non-performing loans and the associated loss content. This is supported by the following: 25% of our non-performing loans are current or past due less than 30 days, up from 16% last quarter; of our loans past due 30 to 89 days, which we consider our early-stage delinquencies, $170 million are already non-performing; 34% or $687 million of our non-performing loans are past due less than 90 days. We have already realized partial charge-offs of $810 million against our non-performing loans, representing a 28% haircut. Another way to look at our partial charge-offs is that it represents a 52% write-down on specific non-performing loans, where a direct write-down was deemed necessary. A few comments on our construction and development portfolios. Within our loan portfolios, we continue to focus on our construction and development categories, particularly residential related. Please note on Slide 8 that we have segmented our commercial construction portfolio between C&I related and housing related. This slide highlights the continued strong credit quality profile of the non-housing component of the commercial construction portfolio. Less than half of our commercial construction portfolio is related to housing. As of quarter end, we have $807 million in construction and development loans on non-performing status, representing 39% of our total non-performing loans. As shown in Slide 33, of these non-performing construction and development loans, 50% are in the Arizona and Florida markets. On average, these loans are already heavily reserved or charged down. Clearly, our issues remain concentrated in these markets.To provide a little more granularity on our portfolio of larger construction and development projects, the following may be helpful: We have 27 loans greater than $5 million on non-accrual status, only nine of these are in excess of $10 million, and only one of these is in excess of $20 million. We have seen some stabilization in the residential land portfolio during the fourth quarter as non-performing loans have fallen $64 million. This portfolio is shown in Slides 38 and 39. We have $1.6 billion in residential land loans to individuals and developers, $870 million or 55% are located in Arizona zip codes. A bulk of the Arizona loans, two thirds, are in Maricopa County.The loans to individuals in the Arizona portfolio are relatively modest in size with an average balance of approximately $174,000. We continue to refresh both FICO scores and LTVs for the Arizona portfolio. Individual FICO scores average 736 at the time of origination, and for the performing loans remain above 720 today. Although we anticipate that our non-performing loans in the Arizona residential land portfolio will remain elevated, we believe we will benefit from the fact that we've first tightened our underwriting standards in mid-2005 and ceased new money originations in 2008.Residential lot loans to individual and developers account for $259 million of non-performing loans, of which 47% are based in Arizona zip codes. With regard to conventional mortgages, our portfolio continues to show that individuals are feeling continued economic stress. As we've noted before, we maintain our underwriting discipline through the cycle, have never originated sub-prime loans and have avoided many of the more risky loan products.During the quarter, our non-performing residential loans decreased to $206 million or 4.2% of the residential mortgage portfolio. These trends highlight the benefit of our non-performing residential loan sales completed in December and July. We continue to aggressively monitor and manage this portfolio.Just a couple of comments on our consumer loan trends as the overall consumer portfolio has maintained its non-performing loan levels below those of the overall bank. As of quarter end, only 1.4% of consumer loans were on non-performing status. As we've noted in the past, our credit quality experience with this portfolio has benefited from our historical practice of selling much of our production as we did in 2005 and 2006. Looking forward, consumer non-accruals, including both residential and home equity, are likely to remain elevated, reflecting continued consumer stress. Although we expect that our ultimate losses will remain better than industry averages. With regard to the commercial loan portfolio, during the course of the fourth quarter, we realized $85 million of net charge-offs in our C&I portfolio. These charge-offs are geographically dispersed. Generally, our commercial portfolio has performed relatively well during this cycle, while still showing the effect of the economy. In addition, we realized a decrease of $61 million in non-performing C&I loans.A brief comment on bank holding company loans. As of year end, we continue to retain a portfolio of approximately $550 million, of which 11% is non-performing, and against which we have reserves of 17%. We are adequately reserved, but will continue to evaluate this portfolio critically. Going forward, based on the rapidly changing landscape for banks and the loss of market synergies caused by the spinoff of Metavante, M&I's correspondent banking strategy has been redefined to include only core relationships that are within our banking footprint with the primary focus on fee-based activities going forward.With regard to our non-construction commercial real estate portfolio, we have $13.6 billion outstanding with $3.6 billion in multi-family and $9.3 billion in business real estate. As shown on Slide 16, our business real estate portfolio is generally concentrated in our core Midwest markets, two thirds, with only 17% than our combined Florida and the Arizona market and another 3% in other higher-risk markets. 37% of this portfolio is owner occupied. In the fourth quarter, we saw our non-performing loans in the non-construction commercial real estate category increase $75 million to 4.3%. Contributing to this increase is the review of renegotiated loans that we noted earlier in the call. We performed a rigorous review of our commercial division renegotiated loans, and found that the performance of certain related properties had deteriorated to a point where we felt non-accrual status was more appropriate. With this determination, we moved $170 million to non-accrual status. In addition, we are carrying the loans on our books at 44% of unpaid principal balance through either partial charge-offs or specific reserves.A few comments on our accruing renegotiated loans. Over the past quarter, we have seen a $142 million decrease in accruing renegotiated loans to a total of $793 million. This decrease is largely a result of previously discussed review of certain relationships. On the consumer side, the vast majority of these loans continue to be related to home, land or construction loans to individuals. At quarter end, these categories accounted for approximately $647 million or 82% of the total. Within the consumer sector, our restructured loan delinquency trends continue to perform better than national averages.Over the next few quarters, we continue to expect non-performing loan and real estate owned balances to remain elevated above historical averages, reflecting broader economic stress that we anticipate inflows will continue to slow. We specifically anticipate that the inflows of larger construction credits are past their peak.As I noted in discussing Slide 6, through increasing the reserve and aggressively writing down problem loans, M&I has an adjusted reserve coverage ratio of 191%. We'll continue to violate the opportunity for further sales of non-performing assets and weigh the opportunity versus the cost to keeping those assets for a period of time. Sometimes the best resolution will be to take the underlying property to maximize our interest, which will cause increases to REO for a period of time.This quarter, our REO increased to $441 million, and this is consistent with previous expectations. We have seven commercial properties over $10 million. We continue to expect that REO balances will increase going forward, and view this as a natural progression as we gain control of projects and move towards ultimate resolutions. A few final comments on credit quality. Stresses in the national housing and commercial real estate markets will continue to affect us, and we will continue to address them proactively. We have and will continue to take aggressive steps to resolve our non-performing situation. Nonetheless, should the economy continue to deteriorate beyond our current expectations, our losses could continue. Our non-performing loans continue to be concentrated in the housing construction related components of the commercial and residential real estate portfolios, particularly in our Arizona, Florida and correspondent businesses. Despite a recent increase in Florida, we continue to believe our larger C&D challenges in the Florida and Arizona markets are behind us.Although we are not immune from consumer deterioration, we believe our residential and consumer portfolios will continue to perform better than the industry as a whole. And also recall that our credit card portfolio is relatively small, with less than $300 million of outstandings.We will continue to maintain a strong reserve coverage ratio, and we'll continue to aggressively write down problem loans. We remain committed to returning M&I to a level of solid credit quality, and are hopeful that our declines in non-performing loans, non-performing loan inflows and early-stage delinquencies are all early indicators of achieving this goal.Changing focus to the organic balance sheet trends compared to the same quarter in 2008. Fourth quarter 2009 average loans were $45 billion, which is $4.9 billion or 10% lower than the fourth quarter of 2008. C&I loans decreased on average by $2.2 billion or 14%, as we are seeing lower lying utilization and seasonal borrowing from existing customers than in prior years.Moving into 2010, we expect to see C&I balances to continue contracting until the economic recovery takes stronger hold. On a linked-quarter basis, C&I loans contracted $960 million or 6.8%. Across all of our construction and development categories, we have seen approximately $3.7 billion or 38% contraction since the fourth quarter of last year. This is consistent with our broader goal of reducing our total construction and development portfolio to less than 10% of total loans. At quarter end, construction and development loans accounted for 12.5% of total loans, down from a high of 22.6% in the third quarter of 2007.Non-construction commercial real estate loans increased on average by $1.6 billion, or nearly 13% in comparison to the same quarter last year. This reflects the natural progression of projects to completion and lease up, most of which occurred earlier in 2009.On a linked-quarter basis, loans in this category were essentially flat. Commercial real estate volumes are soft in all categories, reflecting the economy. This is translated into minimal investor activity in new construction projects with medical office being the least impacted. Lack of availability of any financing is significantly impacting this marketplace. Retail continues to soften as expected to do so through 2010, as many retailers have cut back expansion plans. Many retailers are demanding rent concessions on existing leases, potentially impacting our customers. Office continues to soften in all markets. Job loss has significantly impacted this segment in 2009, and are anticipated to do so in 2010. Hospitality softened with the economy in the second half of 2009, and is expected to remain soft. Together, these factors lead to our expectation that our non-construction commercial real estate portfolio balances will be relatively flat for 2010. On the deposit side, we have seen good underlying dynamics this year, with average deposit balances up nearly $1 billion versus the fourth quarter of 2008. Non-interest-bearing deposits increased $1.9 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase is attributable in part to the low interest rate environment and continued confidence in M&I. As we have discussed before, we have reconfigured many of our deposit product offerings. The benefit of these changes are shown by the $1.6 billion of growth in savings deposits and the $1.6 billion of growth in NOW [Negotiable Order of Withdrawal] balances since the fourth quarter of last year. In addition, we have benefited from an improved deposit mix, as our time balance has declined by over $2 billion.A few final comments. As we move into the first quarter of 2010, and to reiterate comments made earlier, we expect our financial results to reflect the benefits of aggressive credit steps that we have taken, but also the challenges of broader financial markets. As you are aware, every economic cycle brings its own set of challenges. This economic cycle has been marked by rapid deterioration followed by more recent stabilization in general economic conditions, a challenging and prolonged low interest rate environment, competitive pricing pressures on many loan and deposit products and a dramatic downturn in the national residential housing markets. As we move forward in this economic cycle, we will continue to benefit from the strength of our balance sheet, the dedication of our employees and the diversification of our franchise. This concludes our prepared remarks. Joining me now are Mark Furlong, our CEO; and Mark Hogan, our Chief Credit Officer, and they can help answer questions. Operator, you may open the line for questions, please."

The other thing is, I think that we would expect that it's going to help us out here is, as home prices stabilize throughout the country, we're now finding our marks on ORE or loans held for sale are holding up better.

So more stability in real estate prices is going to help us get the mark right the first time for the life of the loan which therefore, means the ORE expenses should come down."

Our first quarter results provide us with continued confidence that a recovery is underway at M&I. Our credit quality trends continue to benefit from our aggressive approach to non-performing loan identification and resolution, as is shown by: Continued improvement in loans going into non-performing status, which reached our lowest level since the third quarter of 2008; continued improvement in early-stage delinquencies, which decreased for the fourth consecutive quarter; continued improvement in total non-performing loans, which decreased for the third consecutive quarter. 
The important items to focus on to better understand our first quarter performance include the following. As we expected, our quarterly net loss of $141 million improved to its lowest levels since the first quarter of 2009 driven primarily by credit quality stabilization. We saw a notable improvement this quarter in the loan loss provision and net charge-offs, which were both down more than 25% from the prior quarter. Non-performing loans were down by approximately $100 million this quarter. From our high in June 2009, our non-performing loans are down nearly 20%.
For the quarter, our early-stage loan delinquencies, those performing loans past due 30 to 89 days, declined again to the lowest level since 2007. Our non-performing construction & development loans amounted to $682 million, down $126 million from December 31. This decrease is largely attributable to the Arizona market. We continue to make progress reducing our concentration of construction & development loans to be less than 10% of the total portfolio. Today, the construction & development exposure is slightly less than 12% of the total versus nearly 23% at its high. We have increased our reserve to 3.55% of total loans, or more than $1.5 billion. 
During the quarter, we realized 18 basis points of net interest margin expansion, reflecting continued success in improving our funding and lending profiles. We finished the first quarter with 102% loan-to-deposit ratio, down from 106% at the end of 2009. This highlight the progress we've made since our high of 132% in 2007. 
For the quarter, we benefited from a $30 million after-tax gain due to the sale of our non-core merchant processing business. This gain was offset by continued aggressive steps in non-performing asset resolution. Like many other companies, we were negatively impacted by the healthcare reform legislation, which caused us to take a one-time after-tax charge of $4 million. We continue to maintain a strong capital base, with a tangible common equity ratio of 8.1% and an estimated Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.1%.
Now for some additional insights into the quarter. First, the net interest margin. Our net interest margin increased by 18 basis points on a linked-quarter basis to 3.13%. During the first quarter, our net interest margin benefited from lower funding costs, partial deployment of our excess liquidity and day count. Despite recent asset quality improvements, our margin continues to be negatively impacted by non-performing assets. The negative impact is 26 basis points in total. We expect that the net interest margin will stabilize for the near term. Many variables continue to impact margin, including competitive pricing and the influence of deposit and loan floors. It is difficult to project this one data point with a high degree of accuracy given the current yield curve and competitive environment.
Now moving on to the Wealth Management business. For the quarter, our trust revenues grew by 9% compared to the same period last year. Fee revenue was up double digits in both personal and institutional trust business lines, while other lines such as securities, lending and outsourcing were down for the quarter. 
Assets under management were up 10% to almost $33 billion at quarter end compared to the first quarter of 2009 and were relatively stable on a linked-quarter basis. Assets under administration continue to grow, reaching approximately $125 billion at March 31 versus $102 billion at the same point in 2009. Compared to December 31, 2009, assets under administration were up slightly. 
Our Brokerage and Insurance division experienced good sales flow in the first quarter. Market volatility early in January impacted overall activity with a rebound later in the quarter. Private banking continued to experience excellent deposit flows reaching record levels for the unit. Overall, credit quality continues to improve as problem credits, primarily real estate-based, are purged from the portfolio.
From an expense standpoint, total non-interest expense amounted to $372 million in the first quarter and declined $38 million from the fourth quarter of 2009. Expenses for non-performing assets and other credit-related items of $47 million this quarter were lower than the prior quarter by $23 million. These expenses are largely related to collection efforts and carrying costs for non-performing assets. The decline was due to lower losses realized upon the sale of OREO properties and lower write-downs during the quarter. Salaries and employee benefits expense declined $7.6 million in the first quarter compared to the link quarter, reflecting normal incentive and employee benefit activity. 
Although our reported efficiency ratio is 58%, when adjusted for these items and other credit-related expenses, we view our core efficiency ratio to be 56%, down approximately 70 basis points from the prior quarter.  Nonetheless, particularly in the current operating environment, M&I will continue to be very focused on maintaining our historical expense discipline. 
Now moving on to our credit quality trends.
Non-performing loans decreased for the third consecutive quarter, resulting in our lowest level of non-performing loans since the end of 2008. Our commercial and consumer portfolios continue to have non-performing characteristics better than the bank as a whole, while our construction & development related loans continue to show the stresses of the national housing markets. This stress continue to be the most apparent in the Arizona market, where home prices have fallen over 50% from their peak in June 2006. We also see some stress in our residential and commercial mortgage portfolios.
We were pleased that our non-performing loans again decreased for the quarter. We continue to anticipate a relative stabilization in non-performing loan trends, reflecting sustained improvement in early-stage delinquencies, reduced inflows and continued aggressive strategies to work out or sell non-performing credits.
As we expected, our provision and charge-off levels were lower than we've seen in the prior few quarters and reflect our continued efforts to proactively reduce our exposure to problem relationships. For the quarter, we realized net charge-offs of $423 million, and we provided $458 million for loan losses. Included in these charge-off is the balance of our largest single non-performing loan at year end, which was a $50 million bank holding company loan that had been fully reserved since the second quarter of 2009. 
In addition to building the allowance, we have identified the specific loss content in non-accrual loans over $1 million, and marked them to net realizable value with either a specific reserve or charge-off. As shown on Slide 8, M&I has conducted a specific impairment analysis on $1.3 billion, or 68%, of total non-performing loans to quantify potential impairment. On average, 29% of the unpaid principal balance of these loans has been charged-off. 
Regarding net charge-offs, although the Arizona and Florida marketplaces continue to be the largest proportion of charge-offs, approximately 44%, they are decreasing in line with expectations. As shown on Slide 32, the largest concentrations of net charge-offs by geographic location, aside from the one bank holding company relationship discussed earlier, were $129 million for Arizona and $55 million for Florida. Otherwise, charge-offs were diversified from a geographic perspective.
For comparison purposes, our Arizona charge-offs of $129 million this quarter compared favorably to last quarter's $187 million and 2009's quarterly average of approximately $215 million. For Florida, this quarter's $55 million compares favorably to $108 million last quarter and is slightly better than the $60 million which was the 2009 quarterly average. As expected, we are seeing a shift in Arizona charge-offs away from our larger commercial construction credits toward the smaller consumer-related credits. From a business line perspective, our Correspondent business realized charge-offs of $66 million this quarter, which included the charge-off of the previously discussed bank holding company loan.
Discussing our non-performing loan trends. During the quarter, our non-performing loans decreased approximately $100 million, which is approximately 5% below last quarter and 20% below the second quarter of 2009. For the quarter, we sold $56 million in larger stressed construction & development loans. As in the past, we have moved aggressively to identify potential non-performing loans and the associated loss content.
27% of our non-performing loans are current or past due less than 30 days. Of our loans past due 30 to 89 days, which we consider our early-stage delinquencies, $171 million are already non-performing. 36%, or $705 million, of our non-performing loans are past due less than 90 days. Our new non-performing loan formation continued to improve this quarter, with $674 million moving to non-accrual status or a 29% improvement from the prior quarter and the lowest since the third quarter of 2008.
We have already realized partial charge-offs of $828 million against our non-performing loans, representing a 30% haircut. Another way to look at our partial charge-offs is that it represents a 56% write-down on specific non-performing loans where a direct write-down was deemed necessary.
A few comments on our construction & development portfolios. Within our portfolios, we continue to focus on construction & development categories, particularly residential-related. Please note on Slide 9 that we have segmented our commercial construction portfolio between C&I-related and housing-related. This slide highlights the continued strong credit quality profile of the non-housing component of the commercial construction portfolio.
As of quarter end, we have $682 million in construction & development loans on non-performing status, representing 35% of our total non-performing loans. We have seen some stabilization in the residential land portfolio during the first quarter, as non-performing loans have fallen $49 million. This portfolio is shown in Slides 39 and 40. 
We have $1.4 billion in residential land loans to individuals and developers. $778 million, or 55%, are located in Arizona zip codes. The bulk of the Arizona loans, 2/3, are in Maricopa County. The loans individuals in the Arizona portfolio are relatively modest in size, with an average balance of approximately $170,000. We continue to refresh both FICO scores and LTVs for the Arizona portfolio. Individual FICO scores average 737 at the time of origination. And for the performing loans, remained above 720 today. Residential lot loans to individuals and developers account for $224 million of non-performing loans, of which 45% are based in Arizona zip codes. 
With regard to the commercial loan portfolio. During the course of the first quarter, we realized $134 million of net charge-offs in our C&I portfolio. Of this, $50 million was the previously discussed fully reserved bank holding company loan. Another, approximately $25 million of C&I net charge-offs, are related to the housing sector. Otherwise, C&I charge-offs are diversified. Generally, our commercial portfolio has performed relatively well during this cycle, while still showing the effect of the economy.
With regard to our non-construction Commercial Real Estate portfolio, we have $13.5 billion outstanding with $3.6 billion in multifamily and $9.2 billion in business real estate. As shown on Slide 16, our business real estate portfolio is generally concentrated in our core Midwest markets, 2/3, with only 17% in our combined Florida and Arizona markets and another 3% in other higher risk areas. 37% of this portfolio is owner-occupied. 
In the first quarter, we saw our non-performing loans in the non-construction commercial real estate category increased approximately $70 million to 4.9%. Like others, we continue to be watchful of this portfolio and continue to stay close to our borrowers. As part of our proactive strategy with this portfolio, we continue to identify problem loans early as is shown by the fact that approximately half of our non-performing commercial real estate loans are current. Delinquencies in this portfolio continue to be manageable, with approximately $160 million of accruing notes past due 30 to 89 days. 
A few comments on our accruing renegotiated loans. Over the past quarter, we have seen a $61 million decrease in accruing renegotiated loans to a total of $732 million. On the consumer side, the vast majority of these loans continue to be related to home, land or construction loans to individuals. At quarter end, the consumer-related categories accounted for approximately $445 million or 61% of the total. Within the consumer sector, our restructured loan delinquency trends continue to perform better than national averages.
Our REO (sic) [OREO] increased this quarter to $454 million. This is consistent with previous expectations. We have six commercial properties over $10 million. We continue to expect that REO (sic) [OREO] balances will increase going forward and view this as a natural progression as we gain control of projects and move toward ultimate resolutions.
A few final comments on credit quality. We have and will continue to take aggressive steps to resolve our non-performing situations. Over the next few quarters, we continue to expect non-performing loan and real estate-owned balances to remain elevated above historical precycle averages, reflecting broader economic stress, though we anticipate inflows will continue to slow. We specifically anticipate that the inflows of larger construction credit, particularly in Florida and Arizona, are past their peak. 
Although we are not immune from consumer credit deterioration, we believe our residential and consumer portfolios will continue to perform better than the industry as a whole. We remain committed to returning M&I to a level of solid credit quality and are hopeful that our declines in non-performing loans, non-performing loan inflows and early-stage delinquencies are continuing indicators of achieving that goal.
Changing focus, the organic balance sheet trends compared to the same quarter in 2009. C&I loans decreased as we are seeing lower line utilization and seasonal borrowing from existing customers than in prior years, consistent with the slower economy. We expect C&I balances to continue contracting until the economic recovery takes stronger hold. 
Across all of our construction & development categories, we have seen approximately $3.2 billion, or 37%, contraction since the first quarter of last year. This is consistent with our broader goal of reducing our total construction & development portfolio to less than 10% of total loans. At quarter end, construction & development loans accounted for less than 12% of total loans, down from a high of approximately 23% in the third quarter of 2007.
Non-construction commercial real estate loans increased on average by $715 million or nearly 6% in comparison to same quarter last year. This reflects the natural progression of projects to completion and lease up, most of which occurred early in 2009. On a linked-quarter basis, loans in this category were down slightly as expected.
On the deposit side, we have seen good underlying dynamics with average deposit balances up $2.2 billion versus the first quarter of 2009. Non- interest-bearing deposits increased $1.3 billion compared to the first quarter of 2009. This increase is attributable in part to the low interest rate environment and continued confidence in M&I. As we have discussed before, we have reconfigured many of our deposit product offerings. The benefits of these changes are shown by the $1.7 billion growth in savings deposits since the first quarter of last year. In addition, we have benefited from an improved deposit mix as our time balances have declined by over $3 billion. 
A few final comments. As we move into the second quarter of 2010 and to reiterate comments made earlier, we expect our financial results to reflect the benefits of the aggressive credit steps we have taken, but also the challenges of the broader financial markets. As our credit quality trends continue to stabilize and improve, our attention will increasingly shift toward rebuilding our profitability profile. Nonetheless, we will not waiver in our credit quality vigilance. 
Every economic cycle brings its own set of challenges. This economic cycle has been marked by: Rapid deterioration followed by more recent stabilization and early improvement in general economic conditions; a challenging and prolonged low interest rate environment; competitive pricing pressures on many loan and deposit products; and a dramatic downturn in the national residential housing markets that has lasted over three years.  As we move forward in this economic cycle, we will continue to benefit from the strength of our balance sheet, the dedication of our employees and the diversification of our franchise.

As these projects have gone through construction and as they start to lease up, the lease rates, just from a competitive standpoint, are less than what had been originally projected. And then the absorption is taking -- it's longer. So those two things are really driving the issues. It's not so much the loan-to-value. I think anyone would stipulate that the loan-to-values are going to be lower than what was originally estimated. And as we've been saying for the past few quarters, it's all about the cash that's coming out of the project and how much NOI can be generated to service debt. And that continues to be our focus. From an ongoing stress standpoint, I don't really see things changing much. Certainly, any time this economy continues to last longer, the problems continue. It's going to put more stress on the portfolio, but we don't really see any spikes in that portfolio.

What we've been seeing in the C&I portfolio and Mark talked about that earlier, has been starting to see some indications from some of our customers that they're feeling a little bit better about what they're seeing in their own market environments, in their own industries.

And we're hearing more thoughts about that, but I wouldn't say we're seeing that flow through to utilization rates. I think that will be, for us, one of the bellwethers of the turn in loan demand. They can still continue to see that Commercial Real Estate portfolio drift to down a little bit, mainly driven by amortizations as much as anything else. And the Construction & Development portfolio will continue to come down. There is a very clear goal that, that portfolio will be below 10% of our total loan portfolio. It's currently at 12, which is incredible headway from nearly 23% a couple of years ago. But in terms of total loan volumes, we will continue to see contraction in that Construction & Development category. What I can't tell you at this point because we haven't seen it flowing through from customers into C&I demand yet, is when you'll actually see that turn. We would expect to continue to see loan portfolio contraction in the second and likely the third quarters. But I don't have a hard and fast expectation as to exactly when that turns."

By now, you had an opportunity to see our press release and supplemental financial information. We have included the detailed slides on our Web site, which you might want to have available for later in our discussion.
Our second quarter results provided us with continued confidence that a recovery underway at M&I. Our credit quality trends continued to benefit from our aggressive approach to non-performing loan identification and resolution as is shown by continued improvement in loans going into non-performing status, which reached our lowest levels since the first quarter of 2008; continued improvement in early stage delinquencies, which decreased for the fifth consecutive quarter; continued improvement in total non-performing loans, which decreased for the fourth consecutive quarter.
The important items to focus on to better understand our second quarter performance include the following, our core loss this quarter is in line with the prior quarter and substantially less than the second quarter last year. Recall that our reported results last quarter included a $48 million pretax gain from our merchant [ph] processing sale.
Our loan loss provision and net charge offs this quarter are consistent with the first quarter. They continue to reflect the progress we've made in addressing asset quality challenges to our early identification of problem credits. Our second quarter loan loss provision is 25% [ph] lower than our 2009 quarterly average, and is at its lowest level in nearly two years. We expect our provision to continue declining over time.
Non-performing loans were down $153 million this quarter. From our high in June 2009, non-performing loans are down 25%. For the quarter, early stage loan delinquencies, those performing loans past due 30 to 89 days declined again to the lowest level since 2007.
Our non-performing construction and development loans were down $120 million or 18% from March 31st. Approximately half of this decrease is attributable to the Arizona market where our non-performing construction and development loans now total only $113 million. We continue to make progress, reducing our concentration of construction development loans to be less than 10% of the total portfolio.
Today, our construction and development exposure is less than 10.7% of total loans, compared to nearly 23% at its high in the third quarter of 2007. For the quarter, our provision essentially matched charge offs. Our reserve now stands of 3.67% of total loans or more than $1.5 billion.
We continue to make progress in improving our funding profile. Our loan to deposit ratio stands at 104% highlighting the substantial progress we've made since our high of 132% in 2007. We continue to maintain a strong capital base with a tangible common equity ratio of 8.3% and an estimated Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio at 10.9%.
Now, for some additional insights into the quarter, first, the net interest margin, our net interest margin increased by four basis points on a linked-quarter basis to 3.17%. During the second quarter, our net interest margin benefited from changes in our deposit mix and deployment of our excess liquidity.
Despite recent asset quality improvements, our marking continues to be negatively impacted by non-performing assets. The negative impact is 26 basis points in total. We expect net interest margin will stabilize for the near term. Many variables continue to impact margin, including competitive pricing and the influence of deposit loan force. It is difficult to project this one data point with a high degree of accuracy given the current yield curve and competitive environment.
Now, moving on to the wealth management segment, total revenue, driven by strong trustees and private banking net interest income, grew 3% on the linked-quarter basis and 8%, compared to the second quarter of 2009.
Despite market volatility and economic headwinds, assets under management of $32 billion remain relatively constant, compared to the second quarter of 2009 due to continued expansion of our client base. Assets under administration fueled by institutional and outsourcing customer growth grows 11% to $121 billion, compared to the same period last year. Our private banking group continues to experience stable loan demand and strong deposit flows, lifting net interest income 3% on a linked-quarter basis and 24%, compared to the same quarter last year.
Credit quality within private banking continues to improve and is approaching historic normalized levels. Against the challenging market backdrop, client retention and wealth management remains at record levels reflecting our aggressive business strategies and customer focus.
From an expense standpoint, total non-interest expense amounted to $388 million in the second quarter in line with the prior year and an increase of $22 million from the first quarter. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased in the second quarter, compared to the linked-quarter reflecting normal incentive and employee benefit activity that largely occurred in the prior quarter.
Net expenses for non-performing assets and other credit related items were $38 million this quarter. Nonetheless, particularly in the current operating environment, M&I will continue to be very focused on maintaining our historical expense discipline.
Now, moving on to our credit quality trends. Non-performing loans decreased for the fourth consecutive quarter, resulting in our lowest level of non-performing loans since the end of 2008. We anticipate continued improvement in our non-performing loan trends, reflecting sustained improvement in early state delinquencies, reduced inflows, and continued aggressive strategies to work out or sell non-performing credits. We expect our early stage delinquents, but accruing loans to stabilize around the current level of 1.1% of total loans.
Our commercial and consumer portfolio continue to have non-performing characteristics better than the portfolio as a whole while our construction and development related loans continued to show distresses in national housing markets.
Our core Midwest portfolios continue to perform well through the cycle as is highlighted by our 2% non-performing loan ratio in Wisconsin, 3% in Minnesota, and 2.8% in Indiana. We have identified the specific loss content in non-accrual loans over $1 million and marked into net realizable value with either a specific reserve or charge off.
As is shown in slide 8, M&I has conducted a specific impairment analysis on $1.2 billion or 69% of total non-performing loans - by potential improvement. On average, 31% of the unpaid principal balance in these loans has been charged off.
Regarding net charge offs, for the quarter, we charged off $438 million, which is approximately 15% below last year's quarterly average. Provisions essentially managed charge offs. Although the Arizona and Florida market places continued to be the largest proportion of charge offs approximately 52%, they are decreasing as expected. As shown on slide 33, the largest concentrations of net charge offs by geographic location were $137 million for Arizona and $92 million for Florida. Otherwise, charge offs were diversified from a geographic perspective.
Discussing our non-performing loan trends, during the quarter, our non-performing loans decreased $153 million, which is 8% below last quarter and 25% the below the second quarter of 2009. For the quarter, we sold $102 million in larger (inaudible) construction and development loans.
As in the past, we had moved aggressively to identify problem loans and the associated loss content. Of our $1.8 billion in non-performing loans, $660 million or 37% are past due less than 90 days. $510 million or 28% of total non-performing loans are current.
Our new non-performing loan formation continued to improve this quarter, with $612 million moving to non-accrual status or a 9% improvement from the prior quarter and the lowest since the first quarter of 2008. We have already realized partial charge offs of $738 million against our non-performing loans, representing a 29% haircut. Another way to look at our partial charge offs is that represents a 54% write down on specific non-performing loans or a direct write down, which is deemed necessary.
We continue to see notable contraction in our residential vacant land portfolio, which has contracted 50% since its September 2007 high watermark. Residential lot loans to individuals and developers account for $183 million of non-performing loans, which is down 23% from the prior quarter. Other non-performing loans in this category, 40% are based in the Arizona market.
Shifting to the commercial loan portfolio, this portfolio continues to perform relatively well during this cycle, while still showing the effect to the economy. For the quarter, net charge offs was $309 million [ph], down substantially from the prior quarter and non-performing C&I loans were down 3%.
With regard to our non-construction commercial real estate portfolio, we have $13.3 billion outstanding, with $3.5 billion in multi-family and $9.1 billion in business real estate. As shown on slide 16, two-thirds of the business real estate portfolio is concentration on our core Midwest markets, with only 17% in our combined Florida and Arizona markets, and another 4% in other higher risk areas. Thirty-six percent of this portfolio is owner occupied.
In the second quarter, we saw our non-performing loans in the non-construction commercial real estate category remain steady at 4.9%. Like others, we continue to be watchful of this portfolio and continue to stay close to our borrowers. As part of our proactive strategy with this portfolio, we continue to identify to adapt our problem loans early as is shown by the fact that approximately half of our non-performing commercial real estate loans are still current. Delinquencies in this portfolio are down 34% from the prior quarter and continue to be manageable with approximately $75 million of accruing notes past due 30 to 89 days.
A few final comments on credit audit. We have, and will continue, to take aggressive steps to resolve our non-performing situations. We remain committed to returning M&I to a solid level of credit quality, and expect that our declines in non-performing loan inflows and early stage delinquencies are continuing indicators of achieving that goal.
Changing focus to the organic balance sheet trends, compared to the same quarter in 2009. C&I loans decreased as we continue to see stabilizing, but low-lying utilization from existing customers consistent with the slower economy. Across all of our construction and development categories, we have seen approximately $2.8 billion or 36% in average balanced contraction due to second quarter of last year.
This is consistent with our broader goal of reducing our total construction in the development portfolio to less than 10% of total loans. At quarter-end, construction and development loans accounted for less than 10.7% of total loans, down from a high approximately 23% in the third quarter of 2007.
Non-construction commercial real estate loans decreased slightly in comparison to the same quarter last year as well as on a linked-quarter basis. We expect this trend will continue.
On the deposit side, we continue to benefit from positive mix shift with average deposit balances up $1.3 billion versus the second quarter of 2009. Non-interest bearing deposits increased $570 million, compared to the second quarter of 2009.
As we have discussed before, we reconfigured many of our deposit product offerings. The benefits of these changes are shown by the $1.3 billion growth in savings deposits since the second quarter of last year. In addition, we have benefited from an improved deposit mix as our time balances have declined by over $4 billion.
A few final comments, as we move into the third quarter of 2010 and to reiterate comments made earlier, we expect our financial results to reflect the benefits of the aggressive credits steps we have taken, but also the challenges of the broader financial markets. As our credit quality trends continue to improve, our retention will increasingly shift towards rebuilding our profitability profile; nonetheless, we will not waver in our credit quality focus.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Joining me now are Mark Furlong, our CEO; and, Mark Hogan, our Chief Credit Officer.

And we certainly see that much more skewed toward the housing sector than we do any other sector.
In terms of residential mortgages in that market, you certainly continue to see stresses but we actually saw our nonperforming loan ratio for residential markets in Arizona come down about 80 basis points for the quarter itself. I think it's as much a fact we've been - we've transferred over the last two years some real important resources from this company into the Arizona market to focus on exactly this part of the portfolio.

I’ll start and Mark Furlong certainly, you’re welcome to add a comment or two. In terms of utilization rates, utilization rates were flat for the C&I portfolio from the first quarter to the second quarter. And that’s running at about 53.2%. We still see some contraction in commitments. Companies of course don't want to keep excess levels of commitments in place if they know they're not going to be using them given the growth profile in the overall economy. We’re still seeing companies cut back on what they want to have for commitments.
That said, we've also had some really nice high quality customer wins in the C&I area, and that really is across a number of our regions. So in that sense we've actually been very happy with some of the types of customer wins we've been seeing. As we look forward, I think we expect C&I balances for the rest of the year, Tony, to remain relatively stable with more of a bias to down a bit than up. And if you guys, we go - as we look past that, it’s really going to depend on how the economic recovery holds in there and hopefully expands at some point. But I think this is not the type of economic environment where you’re going to see a marked change, marked growth in C&I balances until there’s better growth profile out there.

This is Mark Hogan. I think we're at that point now where we've been talking for the last two to three quarters, that the third quarter of this year would be when - given the improving delinquency and the improving inflow, the new non-accruals, where we’d start seeing some pressure - downward pressure on the reserve. And we've already started - we started to see that in this - at the end of the first quarter on the consumer side and that’s continued in this quarter as well. And when you look at our reserve right now, a year ago our reserve was split 50-50 between the consumer and then the business related portions of our portfolio.
Today, that has shifted to 60% of the commercial portfolio, or business related and 40% of the consumer. So we've already seen the downward pressure on the reserve coming from the consumer side. And we would expect that with the continued reduction in the new non-accruals and the delinquency trends that we would start seeing at the - that our methodology would start showing some reduction in the loss rates that are attributed to the commercial side. And then also, but more importantly, the level specific reserves that were taken against new non-accruals.
We've been talking about this now for almost the last year relative to the third quarter being a pivotal quarter and we believe we're at that point. But as Greg said earlier, and we've tried to reiterate this as much as possible, now is not the time to stop being aggressive. We've been at this for two and a half years and we think we're very close to getting to the end of the credit issues. And we're just going to continue to work through the third quarter to do that. But we are starting to see some very positive results from the - from a reduction in the delinquencies and the inflows.

So we're comfortable with that. And I'll go back to what I said before just earlier that we continue to be aggressive with loan sales and working through the problems of the existing non-accrual pool to the extent that new non-accruals are refused.

So you really just don't - there's - all you have is (inaudible) proven in the portfolio here for a sustained period of time. And we will always overshoot that 10% just because there is so little that has been added.
When there is real estate also continues to contract a bit here, we'll see what the impact of changes in the yield curve will be on the residential portfolio. But ultimately, we're selling 85% plus of our residential real estate originations. So we are biased down more than that portfolio as well.

And also, well of course, we see opportunity for growth there, particularly as we've seen growth this quarter over the prior quarter and the prior years.
And finally on the banking side, really just the opportunity for the revenue growth as we rarely focus on blocking - basic banking blocking and tackling, whether it's continue to improve our process, or it's continuing to improve how we package our product opportunities. Those are the type of things we are looking at in improving every single day so that we're better positioned as we come out of the out this economic malaise we're in, to show revenue, and ultimately, profitability growth.

First of all, in terms of debit card, there's not a lot specific at this point to point to what the impact's going to be. Our debit card revenue probably runs close to $32 million a year. So that's the point, which the regulatory - that reform will - will be impacted, but we don't know what the impact would be.
More generally, on the front of regulatory reform, I think we're fortunate that our business model isn't the most diversely impacted, just given that our business model is client-focused - not focused I think like proprietary trading. Generally, as we look at that legislation, there are some benefits from it, whether it's a resolution authority or more systematic risk oversight. But we're also very cognizant, that their legislation is going to drive many new rules. And the impact of these hundreds of new rules that still has to be written, the impact's really not known yet.
And so, those are certainly beyond known consequences for the economy and customers. Debit cards, as I a mentioned, you don't know enough yet in terms of actually quantifying what the risk is. What we know is the revenue pool that's impacted is about $30 million. As we go forward, we'll certainly provide more information as the impacts of regulatory reform are more personalized for us.

So Steve, you also have to think about that where (inaudible) in the context of decreasing inflows to non-performing status and continue improvement with early stage delinquencies. Of course, non-performing loans, in total, are in balance. And what we’ve seen in the last few quarters has been an improvement in inflows to that capital. And certainly, the early stage delinquency improvements we saw again this quarter would lead us to expect inflows in the third quarter should be continue to be trending down.
One other thing, we’re at the point in a cycle where a lot of our borrowers have been - they really hung on the cycle, anywhere from two to three years depending on what industry, depending on what market you’re in. And now is not the time for them to give up. And that’s one of the things we’re seeing. We’re seeing in the improvement of the delinquencies, but also the decline in new non-accruals. We continue to see that core base of borrowers that have toughed it out through the cycle and they want to be the survivors. And we’re seeing - that’s part of what we’re seeing.

And it's primarily because as we've discussed before the exposure level on individual borrower significantly different today than it was a year ago and certainly two years ago. And to the extent that the new non-accruals are at $5 million to $10 million rather than $40 million to $50 million, it's not about the dollar amount per se, but it's about the percentage of loss. And that percentage of loss is significantly less today and smaller new non-accruals than it was on the larger new non-accruals a year ago. So we are seeing some improvement in the impairment required against those new non-accruals specifically on the construction and developmental zone on the commercial side.

Okay. Generally, we are guiding for stabilization on net interest margin. There are probably more factors by it to the positive NIM than negatives at this point in time where there is improvement in funding profile. On the asset side, certainly, spreads are - have been relatively attractive in comparison to what were. And going back to the impact of non-performing loans, they're non-performing assets on our NIM. That's still about a 26 basis-point headwind for our existing net interest margin. So although stabilization is what we're playing to, to follow more factors biased to improvement in the NIM as opposed to duration in it.

Our second quarter results provide us with continued confidence that a recovery is underway at M&I. Our credit quality trends continue to benefit from our aggressive approach to non-performing loan identification and resolution, as is shown by continued improvement in loans going into non-performing status, which reached our lowest level since the first quarter of 2008; continued improvement in early-stage delinquencies, which decreased for the fifth consecutive quarter; continued improvement in total non-performing loans, which decreased for the fourth consecutive quarter.
The important items to focus on to better understand our second quarter performance include the following: our core loss this quarter is in line with the prior quarter and substantially less than the second quarter last year. Recall that our reported results last quarter included a $48 million pretax gain from our merchant processing sale.  Our loan loss provision and net charge-offs this quarter are consistent with the first quarter. They continue to reflect the progress we have made in addressing asset quality challenges through our early identification of problem credits. Our second quarter loan loss provision is 25% lower than our 2009 quarterly average, and is at its lowest level in nearly two years. We expect our provision to continue declining over time.
Non-performing loans were down $153 million this quarter. From our high in June 2009, non-performing loans are down 25%. For the quarter, early-stage loan delinquencies, those performing loans past due 30 to 89 days, declined again to the lowest levels since 2007. Our non-performing Construction & Development loans were down $120 million or 18% from March 31. Approximately half of this decrease is attributable to the Arizona market, where our non-performing Construction & Development loans now total only $113 million. We continue to make progress reducing our concentration of Construction & Development loans to be less than 10% of the total portfolio. Today, our Construction & Development exposure is less than 10.7% of total loans compared to nearly 23% at its high in the third quarter of 2007.  For the quarter, our provision essentially match charge-offs. Our reserve now stands at 3.67% of total loans or more than $1.5 billion. 
We continue to make progress in improving our funding profile. Our loan-to-deposit ratio stands at 104%, highlighting the substantial progress we've made since our high of 132% in 2007. We continue to maintain a strong capital base, with a tangible common equity ratio of 8.3% and an estimated Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 10.9%.
Now for some additional insights into the quarter. First, the net interest margin. Our net interest margin increased by four basis points on a linked-quarter basis to 3.17%. During the second quarter, our net interest margin benefited from changes in our deposit mix and deployment of our excess liquidity. Despite recent asset quality improvements, our margin continues to be negatively impacted by non-performing assets. The negative impact is 26 basis points in total. 
We expect net interest margin will stabilize for the near term. Many variables continue to impact margin, including competitive pricing and the influence of deposit and loan floors. It is difficult to project this one data point with a high degree of accuracy, given the current yield curve and competitive environment.
Now moving on to the Wealth Management segment. Total revenue, driven by stronger trustees and private banking net interest income, grew 3% on a linked-quarter basis and 8% compared to the second quarter of 2009. Despite market volatility and economic headwinds, Assets under Management of $32 billion remained relatively constant compared to the second quarter of 2009 due to continued expansion of our client base. Assets under Administration, fueled by institutional and outsourcing customer growth, rose 11% to $121 billion compared to the same period last year. 
Our Private Banking group continues to experience stable loan demand and strong deposit flows, lifting net interest income 3% on a linked-quarter basis and 24% compared to the same quarter last year.  Credit quality within Private Banking continues to improve and is approaching historic normalized levels.  Against the challenging market backdrop, client retention in Wealth Management remains at record levels, reflecting our aggressive business strategies and customer focus.
From an expense standpoint, total noninterest expense amounted to $388 million in the second quarter, in line with the prior year and an increase of $22 million from the first quarter. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased in the second quarter compared to the linked quarter, reflecting normal incentive and employee benefit activity that largely occurred in the prior quarter.  Net expenses for non-performing assets and other credit related items were $38 million this quarter. Nonetheless particularly in the current operating environment, M&I will continue to be very focused on maintaining our historical expense discipline.
Now moving on to our credit quality trends. Non-performing loans decreased for the fourth consecutive quarter, resulting in our lowest level of non-performing loans since the end of 2008. We anticipate continued improvement in our non-performing loan trends, reflecting sustained improvement in early-stage delinquencies, reduced inflows and continued aggressive strategies to work out or sell non-performing credits. We expect our early-stage delinquent but accruing loans to stabilize around the current level of 1.1% of total loans. 
Our Commercial and Consumer portfolios continue to have non-performing characteristics, better than the portfolio as a whole, while our Construction & Development-related loans continue to show the stresses of national housing markets.  Our core Midwest portfolios continued to perform well through the cycle, as is highlighted by our 2% non-performing loan ratio in Wisconsin, 3% in Minnesota and 2.8% in Indiana. We have identified the specific loss content in non-accrual loans over $1 million and marked them to net realizable value with either a specific reserve or charge-off. As is shown in Slide 8, M&I has conducted a specific impairment analysis on $1.2 billion or 69% of total non-performing loans to quantify potential improvement. On average, 31% of the unpaid principal balance of these loans has been charged off.
Regarding net charge-offs. For the quarter, we charged off $438 million, which is approximately 15% below last year's quarterly average. Provisions essentially matched charge-offs. Although the Arizona and Florida marketplaces continue to be the largest proportion of charge-offs, approximately 52%, they are decreasing as expected. As shown on Slide 33, the largest concentrations of net charge-offs by geographic location were $137 million for Arizona and $92 million for Florida. Otherwise, charge-offs were diversified from a geographic perspective.
Discussing our non-performing loan trends. During the quarter, our non-performing loans decreased $153 million, which is 8% below last quarter and 25% below the second quarter of 2009. For the quarter, we sold $102 million in larger stress Construction & Development loans. As in the past, we have moved aggressively to identify problem loans and the associated loss content. Of our $1.8 billion in non-performing loans, $660 million or 37% are past due less than 90 days. $510 million or 28% of total non-performing loans are current.
Our new non-performing loan formation continued to improve this quarter with $612 million moving to non-accrual status or a 9% improvement from the prior quarter and the lowest since the first quarter of 2008.  We have already realized partial charge-offs of $738 million against our non-performing loans, representing a 29% haircut. Another way to look at our partial charge-offs is that it represents a 54% write-down on specific non-performing loans where a direct write-down was deemed necessary.
We continue to see notable contraction in our residential vacant land portfolio, which has contracted 50% since its September 2007 high watermark. Residential lot loans to individuals and developers account for $183 million of non-performing loans, which is down 23% from the prior quarter. Of our non-performing loans in this category, 40% are based in the Arizona market.
Shifting to the Commercial Loan portfolio. This portfolio continues to perform relatively well during this cycle, while still showing the effect of the economy. For the quarter, net charge-offs were $49 million, down substantially from the prior quarter and non-performing C&I loans were down 3%. 
With regard to our non-construction Commercial Real Estate portfolio, we have $13.3 billion outstanding with $3.5 billion in multi-family and $9.1 billion in business real estate. As shown on Slide 16, 2/3 of our Business Real Estate portfolio is concentrated in our core Midwest markets with only 17% in our combined Florida and Arizona markets and another 4% in other higher risk areas. 36% of this portfolio is owner-occupied.
In the second quarter, we saw our non-performing loans in the non-construction Commercial Real Estate category remain steady at 4.9%. Like others, we continue to be watchful of this portfolio and continue to stay close to our borrowers. As part of our proactive strategy with this portfolio, we continue to identify problem loans early, as is shown by the fact that approximately half of our non-performing Commercial Real Estate loans are still current. Delinquencies in this portfolio are down 34% from the prior quarter and continue to be manageable with approximately $75 million of accruing notes past due 30 to 89 days.
A few final comments on credit quality. We have and will continue to take aggressive steps to resolve our non-performing situations. We remain committed to returning M&I to a solid level of credit quality and expect that our declines in non-performing loan inflows and early-stage delinquencies are continuing indicators of achieving that goal.
Changing focus to the organic balance sheet trends compared to the same quarter in 2009. C&I loans decreased as we continue to see stabilizing, but low-lying utilization from existing customers consistent with the slower economy. Across all of our Construction & Development categories, we have seen approximately $2.8 billion or 36% in average balance contraction since the second quarter of last year. This is consistent with our broader goal of reducing our total Construction & Development portfolio to less than 10% of total loans. At quarter end, Construction & Development loans accounted for less than 10.7% of total loans, down from a high of approximately 23% in the third quarter of 2007.  Non-construction Commercial Real Estate loans decreased slightly in comparison to the same quarter last year as well as on a linked-quarter basis. We expect this trend will continue. 
On the deposit side, we continue to benefit from positive mix shift with average deposit balances up $1.3 billion versus the second quarter of 2009. Non-interest-bearing deposits increased $570 million compared to the second quarter of 2009. As we have discussed before, we have reconfigured many of our deposit product offerings. The benefits of these changes are shown by the $1.3 billion growth in savings deposits since the second quarter of last year.  In addition, we have benefited from an improved deposit mix, as our time balances have declined by over $4 billion.
A few final comments. As we move into the third quarter of 2010, and to reiterate comments made earlier, we expect our financial results to reflect the benefits of the aggressive credit steps we have taken, but also the challenges of the broader financial markets. As our credit quality trends continue to improve, our attention will increasingly shift toward rebuilding our profitability profile. Nonetheless, we will not waver in our credit quality focus. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Joining me now are Mark Furlong, our CEO; and Mark Hogan, our Chief Credit Officer. Operator, you may open the line for questions.[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tony Davis with Stifel, Nicolaus."

I mean, I think we keep going -- we go back and look at just the fundamental trends that we've seen over the past quarter in that portfolio. And it's much because of some of the steps that the team has taken, we've really been able to identify some of those areas that have been the most stressed and been able to bring that portfolio down. Again, I will point to Construction & Development loans in aggregate in that market being about $113 million on non-performing. And we certainly see that much more skewed toward the housing sector than we do any other sector. In terms of residential mortgages in that market, you certainly continue to see stresses. But we actually saw our non-performing loan ratio for residential markets in Arizona come down about 80 basis points for the quarter. So I think it's as much the fact that we've transferred over the last two years some real important resources from this company into the Arizona market to focus on exactly this part of the portfolio."

I'll start, and Mark Furlong certainly is welcome to add a comment or two. In terms of utilization rates, utilization rates were flat for the C&I portfolio from the first quarter to the second quarter, and that's running at about 53.2%. We still see some contraction in commitments. Companies, of course, don't want to keep excess levels of commitments in place if they know they're not going to be using them. And given the growth profile and the overall economy, we're still seeing companies cut back on what they want to have for commitments. That said, we've also had some really nice high-quality customer wins in the C&I area. And that really is across a number of our regions. So in that sense, we've actually been very happy with some of the types of customer wins we've been seeing. You know, as we look forward, I think we expect C&I balances for the rest of the year, Tony, to remain relatively stable and with more of a bias to down a bit than up. And as we look past that, it's really going to depend on how the economic recovery holds in there and hopefully expands at some point. But I think this is not the type of economic environment where you're going to see a marked change, marked growth, in C&I balances until there's better growth profile out there."

I mean, in terms of maybe specifically on the debit card and then maybe a couple of other comments on regulatory reform as well. First of all, in terms of debit cards, there's not a lot specific at this point to point to what the impact's going to be. Our debit card revenue probably runs close to $30 million a year. So that's the pool in which the regulatory -- that reform will be impacted, but we don't know what the impact will be. More generally on the front of regulatory reform, I think we feel fortunate that our business model isn't the most adversely impacted, just given that our business model is client-focused and not focused on things like proprietary trading. Generally, as we look at the legislation, there are some benefits from it, whether it's resolution authority or more systemic risk oversight. But we're also very cognizant that their legislation is going to drive many new rules, and the impact of these hundreds of new rules that still have to be written, the impact's really not known yet. And so there will certainly be unknown consequences for the economy and customers. Debit card, as I mentioned, we don't know enough yet in terms of actually quantifying what the risk is, but we know the revenue pool that's impacted is about $30 million. And as we go forward, we'll certainly provide more information as the impacts of regulatory reform are more crystallized for us."

All you have to do is look at the yield table that we have in the supplemental financial information and it will highlight that Construction & Development is not necessarily the highest spread lending asset that we have. I mean, generally, although we are guiding for stabilization on net interest margin, there is probably more factors biased to the positive than the negative at this point in time, whether it is improvement in funding profile. On the asset side, certainly spreads have been relatively attractive in comparison to what they were, and going back to the impact of non-performing loans or non-performing assets on our NIM. That's still about a 26 basis point headwind for our existing net interest margin. So although stabilization is sort of what we're pointing to, there's probably more factors biased to improvement in the NIM as opposed to deterioration in it."

We were not targeting high-risk customer base, whether on the consumer side, on individual construction or on the business side. We are targeting consistent performing local developers. And as a result, there's probably be a little more competition on yield there, but full relationship type relationships, fuller relationship banking. And then we're in two markets we're held in, in Arizona and Florida. And so as a result, that's the challenge of being in those markets as well.

Our second quarter results provide us with continued confidence that a recovery is underway at M&I. Our credit quality trends continue to benefit from our aggressive approach to non-performing loan identification and resolution, as is shown by continued improvement in loans going into non-performing status, which reached our lowest level since the first quarter of 2008; continued improvement in early-stage delinquencies, which decreased for the fifth consecutive quarter; continued improvement in total non-performing loans, which decreased for the fourth consecutive quarter.
The important items to focus on to better understand our second quarter performance include the following: our core loss this quarter is in line with the prior quarter and substantially less than the second quarter last year. Recall that our reported results last quarter included a $48 million pretax gain from our merchant processing sale.  Our loan loss provision and net charge-offs this quarter are consistent with the first quarter. They continue to reflect the progress we have made in addressing asset quality challenges through our early identification of problem credits. Our second quarter loan loss provision is 25% lower than our 2009 quarterly average, and is at its lowest level in nearly two years. We expect our provision to continue declining over time.
Non-performing loans were down $153 million this quarter. From our high in June 2009, non-performing loans are down 25%. For the quarter, early-stage loan delinquencies, those performing loans past due 30 to 89 days, declined again to the lowest levels since 2007. Our non-performing Construction & Development loans were down $120 million or 18% from March 31. Approximately half of this decrease is attributable to the Arizona market, where our non-performing Construction & Development loans now total only $113 million. We continue to make progress reducing our concentration of Construction & Development loans to be less than 10% of the total portfolio. Today, our Construction & Development exposure is less than 10.7% of total loans compared to nearly 23% at its high in the third quarter of 2007.  For the quarter, our provision essentially match charge-offs. Our reserve now stands at 3.67% of total loans or more than $1.5 billion. 
We continue to make progress in improving our funding profile. Our loan-to-deposit ratio stands at 104%, highlighting the substantial progress we've made since our high of 132% in 2007. We continue to maintain a strong capital base, with a tangible common equity ratio of 8.3% and an estimated Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 10.9%.
Now for some additional insights into the quarter. First, the net interest margin. Our net interest margin increased by four basis points on a linked-quarter basis to 3.17%. During the second quarter, our net interest margin benefited from changes in our deposit mix and deployment of our excess liquidity. Despite recent asset quality improvements, our margin continues to be negatively impacted by non-performing assets. The negative impact is 26 basis points in total. 
We expect net interest margin will stabilize for the near term. Many variables continue to impact margin, including competitive pricing and the influence of deposit and loan floors. It is difficult to project this one data point with a high degree of accuracy, given the current yield curve and competitive environment.
Now moving on to the Wealth Management segment. Total revenue, driven by stronger trustees and private banking net interest income, grew 3% on a linked-quarter basis and 8% compared to the second quarter of 2009. Despite market volatility and economic headwinds, Assets under Management of $32 billion remained relatively constant compared to the second quarter of 2009 due to continued expansion of our client base. Assets under Administration, fueled by institutional and outsourcing customer growth, rose 11% to $121 billion compared to the same period last year. 
Our Private Banking group continues to experience stable loan demand and strong deposit flows, lifting net interest income 3% on a linked-quarter basis and 24% compared to the same quarter last year.  Credit quality within Private Banking continues to improve and is approaching historic normalized levels.  Against the challenging market backdrop, client retention in Wealth Management remains at record levels, reflecting our aggressive business strategies and customer focus.
From an expense standpoint, total non-interest expense amounted to $388 million in the second quarter, in line with the prior year and an increase of $22 million from the first quarter. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased in the second quarter compared to the linked quarter, reflecting normal incentive and employee benefit activity that largely occurred in the prior quarter.  Net expenses for non-performing assets and other credit related items were $38 million this quarter. Nonetheless particularly in the current operating environment, M&I will continue to be very focused on maintaining our historical expense discipline.
Now moving on to our credit quality trends. Non-performing loans decreased for the fourth consecutive quarter, resulting in our lowest level of non-performing loans since the end of 2008. We anticipate continued improvement in our non-performing loan trends, reflecting sustained improvement in early-stage delinquencies, reduced inflows and continued aggressive strategies to work out or sell non-performing credits. We expect our early-stage delinquent but accruing loans to stabilize around the current level of 1.1% of total loans. 
Our Commercial and Consumer portfolios continue to have non-performing characteristics, better than the portfolio as a whole, while our Construction & Development-related loans continue to show the stresses of national housing markets.  Our core Midwest portfolios continued to perform well through the cycle, as is highlighted by our 2% non-performing loan ratio in Wisconsin, 3% in Minnesota and 2.8% in Indiana. We have identified the specific loss content in non-accrual loans over $1 million and marked them to net realizable value with either a specific reserve or charge-off. As is shown in Slide 8, M&I has conducted a specific impairment analysis on $1.2 billion or 69% of total non-performing loans to quantify potential improvement. On average, 31% of the unpaid principal balance of these loans has been charged off.
Regarding net charge-offs. For the quarter, we charged off $438 million, which is approximately 15% below last year's quarterly average. Provisions essentially matched charge-offs. Although the Arizona and Florida marketplaces continue to be the largest proportion of charge-offs, approximately 52%, they are decreasing as expected. As shown on Slide 33, the largest concentrations of net charge-offs by geographic location were $137 million for Arizona and $92 million for Florida. Otherwise, charge-offs were diversified from a geographic perspective.
Discussing our non-performing loan trends. During the quarter, our non-performing loans decreased $153 million, which is 8% below last quarter and 25% below the second quarter of 2009. For the quarter, we sold $102 million in larger stress Construction & Development loans. As in the past, we have moved aggressively to identify problem loans and the associated loss content. Of our $1.8 billion in non-performing loans, $660 million or 37% are past due less than 90 days. $510 million or 28% of total non-performing loans are current.
Our new non-performing loan formation continued to improve this quarter with $612 million moving to non-accrual status or a 9% improvement from the prior quarter and the lowest since the first quarter of 2008.  We have already realized partial charge-offs of $738 million against our non-performing loans, representing a 29% haircut. Another way to look at our partial charge-offs is that it represents a 54% write-down on specific non-performing loans where a direct write-down was deemed necessary.
We continue to see notable contraction in our Residential Vacant Land portfolio, which has contracted 50% since its September 2007 high watermark. Residential lot loans to individuals and developers account for $183 million of non-performing loans, which is down 23% from the prior quarter. Of our non-performing loans in this category, 40% are based in the Arizona market.
Shifting to the Commercial Loan portfolio. This portfolio continues to perform relatively well during this cycle, while still showing the effect of the economy. For the quarter, net charge-offs were $49 million, down substantially from the prior quarter and non-performing C&I loans were down 3%. 
With regard to our non-construction Commercial Real Estate portfolio, we have $13.3 billion outstanding with $3.5 billion in multi-family and $9.1 billion in business real estate. As shown on Slide 16, 2/3 of our Business Real Estate portfolio is concentrated in our core Midwest markets with only 17% in our combined Florida and Arizona markets and another 4% in other higher risk areas. 36% of this portfolio is owner-occupied.
In the second quarter, we saw our non-performing loans in the non-construction Commercial Real Estate category remain steady at 4.9%. Like others, we continue to be watchful of this portfolio and continue to stay close to our borrowers. As part of our proactive strategy with this portfolio, we continue to identify problem loans early, as is shown by the fact that approximately half of our non-performing Commercial Real Estate loans are still current. Delinquencies in this portfolio are down 34% from the prior quarter and continue to be manageable with approximately $75 million of accruing notes past due 30 to 89 days.
A few final comments on credit quality. We have and will continue to take aggressive steps to resolve our non-performing situations. We remain committed to returning M&I to a solid level of credit quality and expect that our declines in non-performing loan inflows and early-stage delinquencies are continuing indicators of achieving that goal.
Changing focus to the organic balance sheet trends compared to the same quarter in 2009. C&I loans decreased as we continue to see stabilizing, but low-lying utilization from existing customers consistent with the slower economy. Across all of our Construction & Development categories, we have seen approximately $2.8 billion or 36% in average balance contraction since the second quarter of last year. This is consistent with our broader goal of reducing our total Construction & Development portfolio to less than 10% of total loans. At quarter end, Construction & Development loans accounted for less than 10.7% of total loans, down from a high of approximately 23% in the third quarter of 2007.  Non-construction Commercial Real Estate loans decreased slightly in comparison to the same quarter last year as well as on a linked-quarter basis. We expect this trend will continue. 
On the deposit side, we continue to benefit from positive mix shift with average deposit balances up $1.3 billion versus the second quarter of 2009. Non-interest-bearing deposits increased $570 million compared to the second quarter of 2009. As we have discussed before, we have reconfigured many of our deposit product offerings. The benefits of these changes are shown by the $1.3 billion growth in savings deposits since the second quarter of last year.  In addition, we have benefited from an improved deposit mix, as our time balances have declined by over $4 billion.
A few final comments. As we move into the third quarter of 2010, and to reiterate comments made earlier, we expect our financial results to reflect the benefits of the aggressive credit steps we have taken, but also the challenges of the broader financial markets. As our credit quality trends continue to improve, our attention will increasingly shift toward rebuilding our profitability profile. Nonetheless, we will not waver in our credit quality focus.

And we certainly see that much more skewed toward the housing sector than we do any other sector. In terms of residential mortgages in that market, you certainly continue to see stresses. But we actually saw our non-performing loan ratio for residential markets in Arizona come down about 80 basis points for the quarter. So I think it's as much the fact that we've transferred over the last two years some real important resources from this company into the Arizona market to focus on exactly this part of the portfolio."

In terms of utilization rates, utilization rates were flat for the C&I portfolio from the first quarter to the second quarter, and that's running at about 53.2%. We still see some contraction in commitments. Companies, of course, don't want to keep excess levels of commitments in place if they know they're not going to be using them. And given the growth profile and the overall economy, we're still seeing companies cut back on what they want to have for commitments. That said, we've also had some really nice high-quality customer wins in the C&I area. And that really is across a number of our regions. So in that sense, we've actually been very happy with some of the types of customer wins we've been seeing. You know, as we look forward, I think we expect C&I balances for the rest of the year, Tony, to remain relatively stable and with more of a bias to down a bit than up. And as we look past that, it's really going to depend on how the economic recovery holds in there and hopefully expands at some point. But I think this is not the type of economic environment where you're going to see a marked change, marked growth, in C&I balances until there's better growth profile out there."

More generally on the front of regulatory reform, I think we feel fortunate that our business model isn't the most adversely impacted, just given that our business model is client-focused and not focused on things like proprietary trading. Generally, as we look at the legislation, there are some benefits from it, whether it's resolution authority or more systemic risk oversight. But we're also very cognizant that their legislation is going to drive many new rules, and the impact of these hundreds of new rules that still have to be written, the impact's really not known yet.

All you have to do is look at the yield table that we have in the supplemental financial information and it will highlight that Construction & Development is not necessarily the highest-spread lending asset that we have. I mean, generally, although we are guiding for stabilization on net interest margin, there is probably more factors biased to the positive than the negative at this point in time, whether it is improvement in funding profile. On the asset side, certainly spreads have been relatively attractive in comparison to what they were, and going back to the impact of non-performing loans or non-performing assets on our NIM. That's still about a 26 basis point headwind for our existing net interest margin. So although stabilization is sort of what we're pointing to, there's probably more factors biased to improvement in the NIM as opposed to deterioration in it."

Our third quarter results provide us with continued confidence that a recovery is underway at M&I. Our credit quality trends continue to stabilize as shown by continued lower levels of loans going into non-performing status in comparison to the prior year, continued low levels of early-stage delinquencies, continued improvement in total non-performing loans, which increased for the fifth consecutive quarter and are at our lowest levels since 2008. The important items are spoken on to better understand the third quarter performance include the following: A loss this quarter is in line with the prior quarter and substantially less than the third quarter last year. Our credit quality improvement this quarter has been masked by steps we have taken that bring one sizable hospitality relationship to find a resolution. Recall that we have discussed this credit in previous call going back to the second quarter of last year. Related to this relationship, in this quarter, we moved to the remaining $83 million from renegotiate to non-accrual, charged off $201 million across all properties, $86 million of which required incremental loan loss provision. 
We now carry these 10 properties at a substantial discount to unpaid principal balance, which we'd establish using the lowest end of any valuation range. The incremental provision associated with this hospitality relationship cost us $0.10 per share. This quarter, net charge-offs totaled $560 million. Excluding the hospitality relationship, charge-offs would have been $359 million, our lowest level since the third quarter of 2009. Similarly, without this relationship, our loan loss provision would have been a $346 million, our lowest level since the third quarter of 2008. This is 21% below last quarter. 
Non-performing loans were down $203 million this quarter. From our high in June 2009, non-performing loans are down 34%. We continue to see stabilization in our NPL formation trends. This quarter, we revised approximately $700 million of new non-performing loans, which is higher than the prior quarter. Included in this inflow is $148 million in previously renegotiated loans, which masks the $559 million of core new inflows and is 4% better than last quarter. With the movement of these renegotiated commercial loans to NPL status, we now have only $131 million in remaining commercial and Commercial Real Estate renegotiated loans. We will be less likely to renegotiate significant amounts of commercial and Commercial Real Estate loans going forward. The Economy has proven that once a degree of stress reaches a real estate project, the likelihood of a successful outcome is greatly diminished. On the other hand, we are pleased with our success in restructuring consumer home mortgages. 
On a linked quarter basis, non-performing loans declined 11% while non-performing assets declined 10%. If you include renegotiated loans in non-performing loans and non-performing assets, the declines are 15% and 13%, respectively. For the quarter, early-stage loan delinquencies, those performing loans past due 30 to 89 days increased slightly but remained at levels not seen since 2007. 
Our non-performing Construction & Development loans were down $32 million this quarter or 6% from June 30. Approximately 44% of this decrease is attributable to the Arizona market where our non-performing Construction & Development loans are less than $100 million. We have reduced our concentration of Construction & Development loans to approximately 9% of total loans, compared to nearly 23% at a tie in the third quarter of 2007.  As we have noted many times before, we expect continued construct contraction in this portfolio, reflecting the reality of this economic environment. 
For the quarter, charge offs exceeded provisions by $128 million. This reduction in the reserve is the result of charging down loans that already had specific reserves and is almost entirely related to the single hospitality relationship. We do not expect a sustained trend declines in the loan loss reserve just yet. Our reserve now stands at 3.49% of total loans. 
We continue to make progress in improving our funding profile. Our loan-to-deposit ratio stands at 104%, highlighting the substantial progress we made since our tie of 132% in 2007. During the quarter, we revised securities and other net gains for $43 million. These gains were partially offset by the non-cash expense of $29 million to terminate $2.3 billion in the wholesale CDs. We continue to maintain a strong capital base with a tangible common equity ratio of 8.3% and an estimated Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 10.8%. 
Now for some additional insights into the quarter. First, the net interest margin. Our net interest margin decreased by three basis points on a linked quarter basis to 3.14%. For the quarter, our net interest margin benefited from an improved funding mix, but was constrained by higher-than-anticipated cash balances. Like other banks, we only earn 25 basis points on our excess cash balances held at the Fed. Despite recent asset quality improvements, our margin continues to be negatively impacted by non-performing assets. The negative impact is 26 basis points in total. We continue to expect net interest margin will remain in this area for the near term with deposit and longer-term upward trend. Many variables continue to impact margin including competitive pricing and the influence of deposit and loan floors. It is difficult to project this one data point with a high degree of accuracy given the current yield curve and competitive environment. 
Now moving on to the Wealth Management segment. For the quarter, strong sales and client retention push revenues higher by 4% compared to the third quarter of 2009. On a link quarter basis, revenues were up slightly. Our continued strong Asset Management performance drove new relationships and sales and continues to positively impact our pipelines. Overall, fee income continued to expand as reflected in sales and pipeline growth in both institutional and personal business lines. Aggressive management of our Private Banking portfolios resulted in reduced charge offs and delinquencies as evidenced by a lower provision for the third quarter versus the second quarter and significantly lower versus the third quarter of last year. 
In spite of accounting [ph] market conditions during the quarter, Assets under Management finished the quarter at $33 billion, up in comparison to both the prior year and the linked quarter. Assets under administration were $139 billion, up in comparison to the same periods. With strong investment performance and natural recognition, Wealth Management continues to expand its reach outside of our core footprint but more importantly, improving penetration with existing customers. 
From a revenue standpoint, total noninterest expense amounted to $420 million in the third quarter. This includes the expense of the wholesale CD terminations discussed earlier, which amounted to $29 million for the quarter. Net expenses for non-performing assets and other current related items were $3.7 million [ph] this quarter. None the less, particularly in the current operating environment, M&I will continue to be very focused on maintaining our historical expense discipline. In the course of the upcoming quarter, we will review many aspects of our business to ensure that we're operating a more reasonable expense base. 
Now moving on to our credit quality trends. Non-performing loans decreased for the fifth consecutive quarter, resulting in our lowest level of non-performing loans since the end of 2008. We anticipate continued improvement in our non-performing loan trends reflecting sustained improvement in early-stage delinquency, reduced inflows and continued aggressive strategy to work out or sell non-performing credits. We expect early stage accruing delinquent loans to remain in the low 1% area. 
Our Commercial and Consumer portfolios continue to have non-performing characteristics better than the bank as a whole, while our Construction & Development loans continue to show stresses of national housing markets. Our core Wisconsin portfolio continues to perform well through the cycle as is highlighted by our 2% non-performing loan ratio. We have identified the specific loss content in non-accrual loans over $1 million, and more than the net realizable value with either a specific reserve or charge-off. As shown in Slide 8, M&I has conducted a specific impairment analysis of $1.1 billion or 67% of total non-performing loans to quantify potential impairment. On average, 38% of the unpaid principal balance of these loans has been charged off. 
Related to the charge-offs, during the quarter, and adjusted for a hospitality relationship discussed earlier, we charged off $359 million, which is 18% below last quarter. Although the Arizona and Florida marketplaces continue to be the largest proportion of charge-offs, approximately 47%, not including the previously discussed hospitality relationship, they are decreasing as expected. As shown on Slide 33, the largest concentrations in net charge-offs by geographic location were $106 million for Arizona, which is at its lowest level since September of 2008 and $62 million for Florida. 
Discussing our non-performing loan trends, during the quarter, our non-performing loans decreased $203 million, which is 11% below last quarter and 34% below our high watermark in the second quarter of 2009. For the quarter, we sold approximately $87 million in larger stressed Construction & Development loans. As in the past, we have moved aggressively to identify problem loans and the associated loss content. Of our non-performing loans, $648 million or 41% are past due less than 90 days. $448 million or 28% of total non-performing loans are current. Our new non-performing loan formation continue to stabilize this quarter with approximately $700 million moving to non-accrual status, of which $148 million were previously recognized as primarily three specific commercial renegotiated relationships. 
We have already realized partial charge-offs of $821 million against our non-performing loans, representing a 34% haircut. Another way to look our partial charge-offs is that represents a 57% write down on specific non-performing loans where a direct write-down was deemed necessary. We continue to see notable contraction in our Residential Vacant Land portfolio, which has declined approximately 55% since September 2007 high watermark. Residential lot loans to individuals and developers account for $143 million of non-performing loans, which is down 22% from the prior quarter. Of our non-performing loans in this category, 42% are based in the Arizona market. 
Shifting to the Commercial Loan portfolio, this portfolio continues to perform relatively well during this cycle, while still showing the effect of the economy. For the quarter, net charge-offs were $56 million, down substantially from the prior quarter, and non-performing C&I loans were down 6% from the prior quarter. With regard to our non-construction Commercial Real Estate portfolio, we have $13.1 billion outstanding with $3.5 billion in Multifamily and $8.8 billion in Business Real Estate. As shown on Slide 16, our Business Real Estate portfolio is generally concentrated in our core midwest markets, 2/3, with only 17% in our combined Florida and Arizona markets and another 3% in other higher-risk areas. 40% of this portfolio was owner-occupied. 
In the third quarter, we saw our non-performing loans in the non-construction Commercial Real Estate category decreased to 3.7%. Like others, we continue to be watchful of this portfolio and continue to stay close to our borrowers. The delinquencies in this portfolio continue to be manageable with approximately $99 million of accruing notes or 0.8% of total performing Commercial Real Estate loans past due 30 to 89 days. 
A few final comments on credit quality, we have and we'll continue to take aggressive steps to resolve our non-performing situations. We remain committed to returning M&I to a level of solid credit quality and expect that our declines in non-performing loans, relative stability in non-performing loan inflows and early-stage delinquencies are continuing indicators of achieving this goal. Changing focus to the organic balance sheet trends compared to the same quarter in 2009. C&I loans decrease as we continue to see stabilizing but low-lying utilization from existing customers, consistent with the slower economy. Across all of our Construction & Development category, what we have seen approximately $2.5 billion or 37% in average balance contraction since the third quarter of last year. At quarter end, Construction & Development loans accounted for approximately 9% of total loans, down from high of approximately 23% in the third quarter of 2007. Non-construction Commercial Real Estate loans decreased $700 million in comparison to the same quarter last year and decreased $348 million on a linked quarter basis. We expect this trend will continue. 
On the deposit side, we can see the benefit from positive mix shift. In comparison to the same quarter last year, our core transaction deposits have increased by more than $2.5 billion or 12.2% while consistent with our strategy to improve our deposit mix, our time and wholesale deposits have contracted by $4.8 billion or 23.5%. 
A few final comments. As we move into the fourth quarter of 2010, and to reiterate comments made earlier, not only do we expect our financial results to reflect the benefits of the aggressive credit steps we have taken, but also the challenges of the broader financial markets. As our credit quality trends continue to improve, our intention will increasingly shift to rebuilding our profitability profile. Nonetheless, we will not waiver in our credit quality focus.

Well, it's kind of an evolving nature with [indiscernible]  Over the year ago, the loan was restructed and their annuity initially started to form according to what we thought the performance level should be. Over the course of spring and summer, the performance level wasn't what we thought it should be and the borrower discussed with us some alternatives. And one of the alternatives was considering selling the property. And our view was that, that was probably the right decision, that if it wasn't going to perform throughout the summer. Anyway, it had not performed throughout the summer to a level we thought it should. So when they went to that exercise and we went through the valuation exercise prior to it going on the market, two industry experts were brought into the valuation. We took the lowest valuation of the two industry experts, so they did a low, medium and high, and that's what we booked to and then the reason was our experience has been -- that the valuation is coming closer to that. But there's also some element of conservatism. So at the unique onset [ph], it was a very long-term relationship, M&I and there is nothing that even resembles a relationship like this in the banks. So that's really how we got to that valuation. Had the property perform like it did last fall and continue to perform -- continuing to improving in the economy, that would have been necessary and I doubt that the sale would have been necessary. By the way, we agreed with the concept of selling the property. We believed that the value of the current debt level wouldn't sustain itself. So it would have been just prolonging the inevitable."

They had a couple of real estate credits, they had to deal with it by and large, had a clean portfolio, had done a lot of work on that portfolio before joining us.

And they've been both C&Is, as well as a couple of Commercial Real Estate relationships that have performed well. I think that market will perform very well for us. So we have fair coverage of that market right now. So hopefully, we'll grow. And finally, St. Louis is kind of in between building [ph] this relatively long period of time since '03.

That economy has struggled, nothing like the fast growth economy in terms of real estate, but it's had kind of gone through the economic cycle as well due to their -- they've hung on to their relationships.

But more importantly, the customer didn't believe that was going to change materially. And so we agreed with the customer's decision to put those for sale. So we had $115 million of reserve allocated specifically to those credits. We used two valuation experts. We recorded the value of the properties in our financial statements at the lowest end of the two valuation experts ranges and therefore required an additional $86 million of loan loss provision. So $115 million plus $86 million gives you the $201 million of reserve. Then we charged off that reserve because they believe that was a permanent impairment. If we've overstated -- should it sell in the fourth quarter, that would be a recovery. Our deal was that we weren't going to take the risk of having it as another valuation range, and maybe being more optimistic than situation warrants it.

And he'd been talking to me about it for probably two years, and was just trying to pick the right moment. Clearly, we're in a recovery stage at this point in time, and so we'll still remain active on board, but not the Chairman role. Mark has over three decades of time with M&I, and I just came to a point in this cycle where he wanted to step away and do some other stuff. And we talked him in to staying engaged with this through the end of the year and did an advisory role, so less time available to us in 2011. And so we think we can make that both [ph] in and we had a very capable executive and Ben Scruiter [ph] can step into that role immediately and bridge the GAAP while we do a search. In the meantime, we have the benefit of Mark in the house and that we're able to go through that exercise we think reasonably seamless. Tom Ellis' has been a high-performing executive, has worked in Milwaukee and then outside Milwaukee, led teams on the C&I side of the business. And more recently, spent the last couple of years on the retail side of the business and has been responsible with those teams, where some very positive movement in our retail deposit base. And so this is kind of been in the coming for probably 12 to 18 months or longer at least. So we thought that was the right time to go through that. We also have a couple of market presence that we announced this morning, that worked on the national transition of senior executives in their markets that were being promoted to take on roles within the company in the succession planning based on [indiscernible] over several years there position them well to be able to move the next executive into the market President role. We've gone through an exercise over the course of the last -- really on the course of 2010 in realigning our focus and customer segments, which is how we deliver our services. And in doing so, looked at the appropriate leadership in each one of those segments and each one of those businesses. And it was all coming to a head this quarter and decided that this is as good a time that they need to announce that as we continue to move forward. So that's really been kind of the driver of it. Any company has these cycles and certainly, it's been a rugged economic cycle for us, nothing like that before in the company's history. And we did a lot of bid order assessment as to what our strengths were in the markets and I think if you look at some of the acquisition activity that we have done prior to this economic cycle, as we went into some markets, I think we tried to be everything to everybody, and that probably wasn't the most effective strategy. So our reassessment helped us focus on more segments that we can go after successfully and deliver products and services that the customer wants in Wisconsin, but more tailored focus on the other markets where our market share is not as high and our presence to them [ph] is high. And then this exercise ins kind of culminated in that outcome, with this tailored focus on certain segments in certain markets, and where we think we can be successful and grow the business. So it means in some cases, maybe less people or facilities, but will be evaluated over a period of time. And everything had to align itself with the segment in each market that we're trying to attract. And I guess you'll see the M&I history has been somewhat built on the business segment, and that will continue to be a focus where we had great success and where we think we can lever the other parts of the business as well."

We have included detailed slides on our website, which you may want to have available for later in our discussion. 
Our third quarter results provide us with continued confidence that a recovery is underway at M&I. Our credit quality trends continue to stabilize as shown by continued lower levels of loans going into non-performing status in comparison to the prior year, continued low levels of early-stage delinquencies, continued improvement in total non-performing loans, which increased for the fifth consecutive quarter and are at our lowest levels since 2008. The important items are spoken on to better understand the third quarter performance include the following: A loss this quarter is in line with the prior quarter and substantially less than the third quarter last year. Our credit quality improvement this quarter has been masked by steps we have taken that bring one sizable hospitality relationship to find a resolution. Recall that we have discussed this credit in previous call going back to the second quarter of last year. Related to this relationship, in this quarter, we moved to the remaining $83 million from renegotiate to non-accrual, charged off $201 million across all properties, $86 million of which required incremental loan loss provision. 
We now carry these 10 properties at a substantial discount to unpaid principal balance, which we'd establish using the lowest end of any valuation range. The incremental provision associated with this hospitality relationship cost us $0.10 per share. This quarter, net charge-offs totaled $560 million. Excluding the hospitality relationship, charge-offs would have been $359 million, our lowest level since the third quarter of 2009. Similarly, without this relationship, our loan loss provision would have been a $346 million, our lowest level since the third quarter of 2008. This is 21% below last quarter. 
Non-performing loans were down $203 million this quarter. From our high in June 2009, non-performing loans are down 34%. We continue to see stabilization in our NPL formation trends. This quarter, we revised approximately $700 million of new non-performing loans, which is higher than the prior quarter. Included in this inflow is $148 million in previously renegotiated loans, which masks the $559 million of core new inflows and is 4% better than last quarter. With the movement of these renegotiated commercial loans to NPL status, we now have only $131 million in remaining commercial and Commercial Real Estate renegotiated loans. We will be less likely to renegotiate significant amounts of commercial and Commercial Real Estate loans going forward. The Economy has proven that once a degree of stress reaches a real estate project, the likelihood of a successful outcome is greatly diminished. On the other hand, we are pleased with our success in restructuring consumer home mortgages. 
On a linked quarter basis, non-performing loans declined 11% while non-performing assets declined 10%. If you include renegotiated loans in non-performing loans and non-performing assets, the declines are 15% and 13%, respectively. For the quarter, early-stage loan delinquencies, those performing loans past due 30 to 89 days increased slightly but remained at levels not seen since 2007. 
Our non-performing Construction & Development loans were down $32 million this quarter or 6% from June 30. Approximately 44% of this decrease is attributable to the Arizona market where our non-performing Construction & Development loans are less than $100 million. We have reduced our concentration of Construction & Development loans to approximately 9% of total loans, compared to nearly 23% at a tie in the third quarter of 2007.  As we have noted many times before, we expect continued construct contraction in this portfolio, reflecting the reality of this economic environment. 
For the quarter, charge offs exceeded provisions by $128 million. This reduction in the reserve is the result of charging down loans that already had specific reserves and is almost entirely related to the single hospitality relationship. We do not expect a sustained trend declines in the loan loss reserve just yet. Our reserve now stands at 3.49% of total loans. 
We continue to make progress in improving our funding profile. Our loan-to-deposit ratio stands at 104%, highlighting the substantial progress we made since our tie of 132% in 2007. During the quarter, we revised securities and other net gains for $43 million. These gains were partially offset by the non-cash expense of $29 million to terminate $2.3 billion in the wholesale CDs. We continue to maintain a strong capital base with a tangible common equity ratio of 8.3% and an estimated Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 10.8%. 
Now for some additional insights into the quarter. First, the net interest margin. Our net interest margin decreased by three basis points on a linked quarter basis to 3.14%. For the quarter, our net interest margin benefited from an improved funding mix, but was constrained by higher-than-anticipated cash balances. Like other banks, we only earn 25 basis points on our excess cash balances held at the Fed. Despite recent asset quality improvements, our margin continues to be negatively impacted by non-performing assets. The negative impact is 26 basis points in total. We continue to expect net interest margin will remain in this area for the near term with deposit and longer-term upward trend. Many variables continue to impact margin including competitive pricing and the influence of deposit and loan floors. It is difficult to project this one data point with a high degree of accuracy given the current yield curve and competitive environment. 
Now moving on to the Wealth Management segment. For the quarter, strong sales and client retention push revenues higher by 4% compared to the third quarter of 2009. On a link quarter basis, revenues were up slightly. Our continued strong Asset Management performance drove new relationships and sales and continues to positively impact our pipelines. Overall, fee income continued to expand as reflected in sales and pipeline growth in both institutional and personal business lines. Aggressive management of our Private Banking portfolios resulted in reduced charge offs and delinquencies as evidenced by a lower provision for the third quarter versus the second quarter and significantly lower versus the third quarter of last year. 
In spite of accounting [ph] market conditions during the quarter, Assets under Management finished the quarter at $33 billion, up in comparison to both the prior year and the linked quarter. Assets under administration were $139 billion, up in comparison to the same periods. With strong investment performance and natural recognition, Wealth Management continues to expand its reach outside of our core footprint but more importantly, improving penetration with existing customers. 
From a revenue standpoint, total noninterest expense amounted to $420 million in the third quarter. This includes the expense of the wholesale CD terminations discussed earlier, which amounted to $29 million for the quarter. Net expenses for non-performing assets and other current related items were $3.7 million [ph] this quarter. None the less, particularly in the current operating environment, M&I will continue to be very focused on maintaining our historical expense discipline. In the course of the upcoming quarter, we will review many aspects of our business to ensure that we're operating a more reasonable expense base. 
Now moving on to our credit quality trends. Non-performing loans decreased for the fifth consecutive quarter, resulting in our lowest level of non-performing loans since the end of 2008. We anticipate continued improvement in our non-performing loan trends reflecting sustained improvement in early-stage delinquency, reduced inflows and continued aggressive strategy to work out or sell non-performing credits. We expect early stage accruing delinquent loans to remain in the low 1% area. 
Our Commercial and Consumer portfolios continue to have non-performing characteristics better than the bank as a whole, while our Construction & Development loans continue to show stresses of national housing markets. Our core Wisconsin portfolio continues to perform well through the cycle as is highlighted by our 2% non-performing loan ratio. We have identified the specific loss content in non-accrual loans over $1 million, and more than the net realizable value with either a specific reserve or charge-off. As shown in Slide 8, M&I has conducted a specific impairment analysis of $1.1 billion or 67% of total non-performing loans to quantify potential impairment. On average, 38% of the unpaid principal balance of these loans has been charged off. 
Related to the charge-offs, during the quarter, and adjusted for a hospitality relationship discussed earlier, we charged off $359 million, which is 18% below last quarter. Although the Arizona and Florida marketplaces continue to be the largest proportion of charge-offs, approximately 47%, not including the previously discussed hospitality relationship, they are decreasing as expected. As shown on Slide 33, the largest concentrations in net charge-offs by geographic location were $106 million for Arizona, which is at its lowest level since September of 2008 and $62 million for Florida. 
Discussing our non-performing loan trends, during the quarter, our non-performing loans decreased $203 million, which is 11% below last quarter and 34% below our high watermark in the second quarter of 2009. For the quarter, we sold approximately $87 million in larger stressed Construction & Development loans. As in the past, we have moved aggressively to identify problem loans and the associated loss content. Of our non-performing loans, $648 million or 41% are past due less than 90 days. $448 million or 28% of total non-performing loans are current. Our new non-performing loan formation continue to stabilize this quarter with approximately $700 million moving to non-accrual status, of which $148 million were previously recognized as primarily three specific commercial renegotiated relationships. 
We have already realized partial charge-offs of $821 million against our non-performing loans, representing a 34% haircut. Another way to look our partial charge-offs is that represents a 57% write down on specific non-performing loans where a direct write-down was deemed necessary. We continue to see notable contraction in our Residential Vacant Land portfolio, which has declined approximately 55% since September 2007 high watermark. Residential lot loans to individuals and developers account for $143 million of non-performing loans, which is down 22% from the prior quarter. Of our non-performing loans in this category, 42% are based in the Arizona market. 
Shifting to the Commercial Loan portfolio, this portfolio continues to perform relatively well during this cycle, while still showing the effect of the economy. For the quarter, net charge-offs were $56 million, down substantially from the prior quarter, and non-performing C&I loans were down 6% from the prior quarter. With regard to our non-construction Commercial Real Estate portfolio, we have $13.1 billion outstanding with $3.5 billion in Multifamily and $8.8 billion in Business Real Estate. As shown on Slide 16, our Business Real Estate portfolio is generally concentrated in our core midwest markets, 2/3, with only 17% in our combined Florida and Arizona markets and another 3% in other higher-risk areas. 40% of this portfolio was owner-occupied. 
In the third quarter, we saw our non-performing loans in the non-construction Commercial Real Estate category decreased to 3.7%. Like others, we continue to be watchful of this portfolio and continue to stay close to our borrowers. The delinquencies in this portfolio continue to be manageable with approximately $99 million of accruing notes or 0.8% of total performing Commercial Real Estate loans past due 30 to 89 days. 
A few final comments on credit quality, we have and we'll continue to take aggressive steps to resolve our non-performing situations. We remain committed to returning M&I to a level of solid credit quality and expect that our declines in non-performing loans, relative stability in non-performing loan inflows and early-stage delinquencies are continuing indicators of achieving this goal. Changing focus to the organic balance sheet trends compared to the same quarter in 2009. C&I loans decrease as we continue to see stabilizing but low-lying utilization from existing customers, consistent with the slower economy. Across all of our Construction & Development category, what we have seen approximately $2.5 billion or 37% in average balance contraction since the third quarter of last year. At quarter end, Construction & Development loans accounted for approximately 9% of total loans, down from high of approximately 23% in the third quarter of 2007. Non-construction Commercial Real Estate loans decreased $700 million in comparison to the same quarter last year and decreased $348 million on a linked quarter basis. We expect this trend will continue. 
On the deposit side, we can see the benefit from positive mix shift. In comparison to the same quarter last year, our core transaction deposits have increased by more than $2.5 billion or 12.2% while consistent with our strategy to improve our deposit mix, our time and wholesale deposits have contracted by $4.8 billion or 23.5%. 
A few final comments. As we move into the fourth quarter of 2010, and to reiterate comments made earlier, not only do we expect our financial results to reflect the benefits of the aggressive credit steps we have taken, but also the challenges of the broader financial markets. As our credit quality trends continue to improve, our intention will increasingly shift to rebuilding our profitability profile. Nonetheless, we will not waiver in our credit quality focus. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Joining me now are Mark Furlong, our Chairman and CEO; and Mark Hogan, our Chief Credit Officer. During the Q&A session, Mark Furlong will be prepared to answer questions relating to both of today's press releases. Operator, you may open the line for questions."

More broadly, in terms of capital, we continue to believe our capital levels are sufficient from our perspective.

Well, it's kind of an evolving nature with [indiscernible]  Over the year ago, the loan was restructed and their annuity initially started to form according to what we thought the performance level should be. Over the course of spring and summer, the performance level wasn't what we thought it should be and the borrower discussed with us some alternatives. And one of the alternatives was considering selling the property. And our view was that, that was probably the right decision, that if it wasn't going to perform throughout the summer. Anyway, it had not performed throughout the summer to a level we thought it should. So when they went to that exercise and we went through the valuation exercise prior to it going on the market, two industry experts were brought into the valuation. We took the lowest valuation of the two industry experts, so they did a low, medium and high, and that's what we booked to and then the reason was our experience has been -- that the valuation is coming closer to that. But there's also some element of conservatism. So at the unique onset [ph], it was a very long-term relationship, M&I and there is nothing that even resembles a relationship like this in the banks. So that's really how we got to that valuation. Had the property perform like it did last fall and continue to perform -- continuing to improving in the economy, that would have been necessary and I doubt that the sale would have been necessary. By the way, we agreed with the concept of selling the property. We believed that the value of the current debt level wouldn't sustain itself. So it would have been just prolonging the inevitable."

Over a year ago, we booked -- approximately a year ago, we booked reserves on that of $115 million, so loan loss provision exits the charge-offs. And restructuring the notes, in the course of that restructuring, the properties began to form as we would expect that they would. But then as the season when those hospitality units should have been more productive, they were not. And we didn't believe that, that was going to change materially. But more importantly, the customer didn't believe that was going to change materially. And so we agreed with the customer's decision to put those for sale. So we had $115 million of reserve allocated specifically to those credits. We used two valuation experts. We recorded the value of the properties in our financial statements at the lowest end of the two valuation experts ranges and therefore required an additional $86 million of loan loss provision. So $115 million plus $86 million gives you the $201 million of reserve. Then we charged off that reserve because they believe that was a permanent impairment. If we've overstated -- should it sell in the fourth quarter, that would be a recovery. Our deal was that we weren't going to take the risk of having it as another valuation range, and maybe being more optimistic than situation warrants it. So we'll find out, I think, over the course of the next 30 to 60 days where that stands and hopefully, that will close in the fourth quarter."

We had a half a dozen or so developer relationships upside. I just mentioned one upside, that $35 million one. And I think the challenge there was too much -- with any of the developers, too much land. Most of our Commercial Real Estate portfolio here is income-producing. So that's quite performed well through the cycle. On the C&I side, I'd say that the bulk of the companies here are probably held, and I think they performed well during this cycle. They've maintained excess liquidity. They've always maintained this, but they maintained even more so during the decline in the economy. And I think it's in pretty good shape, and I think it will come back pretty quickly here. The benefit that Wisconsin has is where it would have been very hard, it's kind of three decades ago, to have diversified substantially well. Many companies still have some auto dependency. It's much less, and so they're not nearly as price sensitive anymore. And they show us going through the cycle. So I think the economy is in good shape. The rise in prices, results have benefited the farm community, which is a big part of this economy substantially during this cycle. Then you have a lot of farmers that look at our portfolio that have sold their crop forward and really locked in these gains. So now they have the gain books or they will get it booked. So I think there's lots of parts of the economy that will do well here. Unemployment is high, but it's not as high as it is nationally. And there's always some challenges going on in communities where we have struggling inner city. And we have a piece of that too. But by and large, I think it's in pretty good shape."

And he'd been talking to me about it for probably two years, and was just trying to pick the right moment. Clearly, we're in a recovery stage at this point in time, and so we'll still remain active on board, but not the Chairman role. Mark has over three decades of time with M&I, and I just came to a point in this cycle where he wanted to step away and do some other stuff. And we talked him in to staying engaged with this through the end of the year and did an advisory role, so less time available to us in 2011. And so we think we can make that both [ph] in and we had a very capable executive and Ben Scruiter [ph] can step into that role immediately and bridge the GAAP while we do a search. In the meantime, we have the benefit of Mark in the house and that we're able to go through that exercise we think reasonably seamless. Tom Ellis' has been a high-performing executive, has worked in Milwaukee and then outside Milwaukee, led teams on the C&I side of the business. And more recently, spent the last couple of years on the retail side of the business and has been responsible with those teams, where some very positive movement in our retail deposit base. And so this is kind of been in the coming for probably 12 to 18 months or longer at least. So we thought that was the right time to go through that. We also have a couple of market presence that we announced this morning, that worked on the national transition of senior executives in their markets that were being promoted to take on roles within the company in the succession planning based on [indiscernible] over several years there position them well to be able to move the next executive into the market President role. We've gone through an exercise over the course of the last -- really on the course of 2010 in realigning our focus and customer segments, which is how we deliver our services. And in doing so, looked at the appropriate leadership in each one of those segments and each one of those businesses. And it was all coming to a head this quarter and decided that this is as good a time that they need to announce that as we continue to move forward. So that's really been kind of the driver of it. Any company has these cycles and certainly, it's been a rugged economic cycle for us, nothing like that before in the company's history. And we did a lot of bid order assessment as to what our strengths were in the markets and I think if you look at some of the acquisition activity that we have done prior to this economic cycle, as we went into some markets, I think we tried to be everything to everybody, and that probably wasn't the most effective strategy. So our reassessment helped us focus on more segments that we can go after successfully and deliver products and services that the customer wants in Wisconsin, but more tailored focus on the other markets where our market share is not as high and our presence to them [ph] is high. And then this exercise ins kind of culminated in that outcome, with this tailored focus on certain segments in certain markets, and where we think we can be successful and grow the business. So it means in some cases, maybe less people or facilities, but will be evaluated over a period of time. And everything had to align itself with the segment in each market that we're trying to attract. And I guess you'll see the M&I history has been somewhat built on the business segment, and that will continue to be a focus where we had great success and where we think we can lever the other parts of the business as well."

Our third quarter results provide us with continued confidence that a recovery is underway at M&I. Our credit quality trends continue to stabilize as shown by continued lower levels of loans going into non-performing status in comparison to the prior year, continued low levels of early-stage delinquencies, continued improvement in total non-performing loans, which decreased for the fifth consecutive quarter and are at our lowest levels since 2008. The important items spoken on to better understand the third quarter performance include the following: A loss this quarter is in line with the prior quarter and substantially less than the third quarter last year. Our credit quality improvement this quarter has been matched by steps we have taken that bring one sizable hospitality relationship to final resolution. Recall that we have discussed this credit in previous calls going back to the second quarter of last year. Related to this relationship, in this quarter, we moved the remaining $83 million from renegotiate to non-accrual, charged off $201 million across all properties, $86 million of which required incremental loan loss provision. 
We now carry these 10 properties at a substantial discount to unpaid principal balance, which we'd establish using the lowest end of any valuation range. The incremental provision associated with this hospitality relationship cost us $0.10 per share. This quarter, net charge-offs totaled $560 million. Excluding the hospitality relationship, charge-offs would have been $359 million, our lowest level since the third quarter of 2009. Similarly, without this relationship, our loan loss provision would have been $346 million, our lowest level since the third quarter of 2008. This is 21% below last quarter. 
Non-performing loans were down $203 million this quarter. From our high in June 2009, non-performing loans are down 34%. We continue to see stabilization in our NPL formation trends. This quarter, we revised approximately $700 million of new non-performing loans, which is higher than the prior quarter. Included in this inflow is $148 million in previously renegotiated loans, which masks the $559 million of core new inflows and is 4% better than last quarter. With the movement of these renegotiated commercial loans to NPL status, we now have only $131 million in remaining commercial and Commercial Real Estate renegotiated loans. We will be less likely to renegotiate significant amounts of commercial and Commercial Real Estate loans going forward. The Economy has proven that once a degree of stress reaches a real estate project, the likelihood of a successful outcome is greatly diminished. On the other hand, we are pleased with our success in restructuring consumer home mortgages. 
On a linked quarter basis, non-performing loans declined 11% while non-performing assets declined 10%. If you include renegotiated loans in non-performing loans and non-performing assets, the declines are 15% and 13%, respectively. For the quarter, early-stage loan delinquencies, those performing loans past due 30 to 89 days increased slightly but remained at levels not seen since 2007. 
Our non-performing Construction & Development loans were down $32 million this quarter or 6% from June 30. Approximately 44% of this decrease is attributable to the Arizona market where our non-performing Construction & Development loans are less than $100 million. We have reduced our concentration of Construction & Development loans to approximately 9% of total loans, compared to nearly 23% at a tie in the third quarter of 2007.  As we have noted many times before, we expect continued construct contraction in this portfolio, reflecting the reality of this economic environment. 
For the quarter, charge offs exceeded provisions by $128 million. This reduction in the reserve is the result of charging down loans that already had specific reserves and is almost entirely related to the single hospitality relationship. We do not expect a sustained trend in declines in the loan loss reserve just yet. Our reserve now stands at 3.49% of total loans. 
We continue to make progress in improving our funding profile. Our loan-to-deposit ratio stands at 104%, highlighting the substantial progress we made since our tie of 132% in 2007. During the quarter, we revised securities and other net gains for $43 million. These gains were partially offset by the non-cash expense of $29 million to terminate $2.3 billion in the wholesale CDs. We continue to maintain a strong capital base with a tangible common equity ratio of 8.3% and an estimated Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 10.8%. 
Now for some additional insights into the quarter. First, the net interest margin. Our net interest margin decreased by three basis points on a linked quarter basis to 3.14%. For the quarter, our net interest margin benefited from an improved funding mix, but was constrained by higher-than-anticipated cash balances. Like other banks, we only earn 25 basis points on our excess cash balances held at the Fed. Despite recent asset quality improvements, our margin continues to be negatively impacted by non-performing assets. The negative impact is 26 basis points in total. We continue to expect net interest margin will remain in this area for the near term with a positive longer-term upward trend. Many variables continue to impact margin including competitive pricing and the influence of deposit and loan floors. It is difficult to project this one data point with a high degree of accuracy given the current yield curve and competitive environment. 
Now moving on to the Wealth Management segment. For the quarter, strong sales and client retention push revenues higher by 4% compared to the third quarter of 2009. On a link quarter basis, revenues were up slightly. Our continued strong Asset Management performance drove new relationships and sales and continues to positively impact our pipelines. Overall, fee income continued to expand as reflected in sales and pipeline growth in both institutional and personal business lines. Aggressive management of our Private Banking portfolios resulted in reduced charge offs and delinquencies as evidenced by a lower provision for the third quarter versus the second quarter and significantly lower versus the third quarter of last year. 
In spite of accounting [ph] market conditions during the quarter, Assets under Management finished the quarter at $33 billion, up in comparison to both the prior year and the linked quarter. Assets under administration were $139 billion, up in comparison to the same periods. With strong investment performance and natural recognition, Wealth Management continues to expand its reach outside of our core footprint while more importantly improving penetration with existing customers. 
From an expense standpoint, total noninterest expense amounted to $420 million in the third quarter. This includes the expense of the wholesale CD terminations discussed earlier, which amounted to $29 million for the quarter. Net expenses for non-performing assets and other current related items were $37 million [ph] (22:08) this quarter. None the less, particularly in the current operating environment, M&I will continue to be very focused on maintaining our historical expense discipline. In the course of the upcoming quarter, we will review many aspects of our business to ensure that we're operating a more reasonable expense base. 
Now moving on to our credit quality trends. Non-performing loans decreased for the fifth consecutive quarter, resulting in our lowest level of non-performing loans since the end of 2008. We anticipate continued improvement in our non-performing loan trends reflecting sustained improvement in early-stage delinquency, reduced inflows and continued aggressive strategy to work out or sell non-performing credits. We expect early stage accruing delinquent loans to remain in the low 1% area. 
Our Commercial and Consumer portfolios continue to have non-performing characteristics better than the bank as a whole, while our Construction & Development loans continue to show the stresses of national housing markets. Our core Wisconsin portfolio continues to perform well through the cycle as is highlighted by our 2% non-performing loan ratio. We have identified the specific loss content in non-accrual loans over $1 million, and marked them to net realizable value with either a specific reserve or charge-off. As shown in Slide 8, M&I has conducted a specific impairment analysis of $1.1 billion or 67% of total non-performing loans to quantify potential impairment. On average, 38% of the unpaid principal balance of these loans has been charged off. 
Related to the charge-offs, during the quarter, and adjusted for the hospitality relationship discussed earlier, we charged off $359 million, which is 18% below last quarter. Although the Arizona and Florida marketplaces continue to be the largest proportion of charge-offs, approximately 47%, not including the previously discussed hospitality relationship, they are decreasing as expected. As shown on Slide 33, the largest concentrations in net charge-offs by geographic location were $106 million for Arizona, which is at its lowest level since September of 2008 and $62 million for Florida. 
Discussing our non-performing loan trends, during the quarter, our non-performing loans decreased $203 million, which is 11% below last quarter and 34% below our high watermark in the second quarter of 2009. For the quarter, we sold approximately $87 million in larger stressed Construction & Development loans. As in the past, we have moved aggressively to identify problem loans and the associated loss content. Of our non-performing loans, $648 million or 41% are past due less than 90 days. $448 million or 28% of total non-performing loans are current. Our new non-performing loan formation continued to stabilize this quarter with approximately $700 million moving to non-accrual status, of which $148 million were previously recognized as primarily three specific commercial renegotiated relationships. 
We have already realized partial charge-offs of $821 million against our non-performing loans, representing a 34% haircut. Another way to look our partial charge-offs is that represents a 57% write down on specific non-performing loans where a direct write-down was deemed necessary. We continue to see notable contraction in our Residential Vacant Land portfolio, which has declined approximately 55% since September 2007 high watermark. Residential lot loans to individuals and developers account for $143 million of non-performing loans, which is down 22% from the prior quarter. Of our non-performing loans in this category, 42% are based in the Arizona market. 
Shifting to the Commercial Loan portfolio, this portfolio continues to perform relatively well during this cycle, while still showing the effect of the economy. For the quarter, net charge-offs were $56 million, down substantially from the prior quarter, and non-performing C&I loans were down 6% from the prior quarter. With regard to our non-construction Commercial Real Estate portfolio, we have $13.1 billion outstanding with $3.5 billion in Multifamily and $8.8 billion in Business Real Estate. As shown on Slide 16, our Business Real Estate portfolio is generally concentrated in our core midwest markets, 2/3, with only 17% in our combined Florida and Arizona markets and another 3% in other higher-risk areas. 40% of this portfolio was owner-occupied. 
In the third quarter, we saw our non-performing loans in the non-construction Commercial Real Estate category decreased to 3.7%. Like others, we continue to be watchful of this portfolio and continue to stay close to our borrowers. The delinquencies in this portfolio continue to be manageable with approximately $99 million of accruing notes or 0.8% of total performing Commercial Real Estate loans past due 30 to 89 days. 
A few final comments on credit quality, we have and will continue to take aggressive steps to resolve our non-performing situations. We remain committed to returning M&I to a level of solid credit quality and expect that our declines in non-performing loans, relative stability in non-performing loan inflows and early-stage delinquencies are continuing indicators of achieving this goal. Changing focus to the organic balance sheet trends compared to the same quarter in 2009. C&I loans decrease as we continue to see stabilizing but low-lying utilization from existing customers consistent with the slower economy. Across all of our Construction & Development category, what we have seen approximately $2.5 billion or 37% in average balance contraction since the third quarter of last year. At quarter end, Construction & Development loans accounted for approximately 9% of total loans, down from high of approximately 23% in the third quarter of 2007. Non-construction Commercial Real Estate loans decreased $700 million in comparison to the same quarter last year and decreased $348 million on a linked quarter basis. We expect this trend will continue. 
On the deposit side, we can see the benefit from positive mix shift. In comparison to the same quarter last year, our core transaction deposits have increased by more than $2.5 billion or 12.2% while consistent with our strategy to improve our deposit mix, our time and wholesale deposits have contracted by $4.8 billion or 23.5%. 
A few final comments. As we move into the fourth quarter of 2010, and to reiterate comments made earlier, not only do we expect our financial results to reflect the benefits of the aggressive credit steps we have taken, but also the challenges of the broader financial markets. As our credit quality trends continue to improve, our intention will increasingly shift to rebuilding our profitability profile. Nonetheless, we will not waiver in our credit quality focus.

Well, it's kind of an evolving nature with [indiscernible]  Over the year ago, the loan was restructed and the after annuity [ph] initially started to form according to what we thought the performance level should be. Over the course of spring and summer, the performance level wasn't what we thought it should be and the borrower discussed with us some alternatives. And one of the alternatives was considering selling the properties. And our view was that, that was probably the right decision, that if it wasn't going to perform throughout the summer -- it had not performed throughout the summer to a level we thought it should. So when they went to that exercise and we went through the valuation exercise prior to it going on the market, two industry experts were brought into the valuation. We took the lowest valuation of the two industry experts, so they did a low, medium and high, and that's what we booked to and then the reason was our experience has been -- that the valuation is coming closer to that. But there's also some element of conservatism. So itÕs a unique onset [ph], it was a very long-term relationship, M&I and there is nothing that even resembles a relationship like this in the banks. So that's really how we got to that valuation. Had the property performed like it did last fall and continue to perform -- continuing to improving in the economy, that wouldnÕt have been necessary and I doubt that the sale would have been necessary. By the way, we agreed with the concept of selling the property. We believed that the value of the current debt level wouldn't sustain itself. So it would have been just prolonging the inevitable."

The cash flow and they're on, by and large, most are on principal amortization. They may have the odd property here or there but it's not -- that has a short interest-only period.

It kind of comes in waves and so there were a couple acquisitions occurred a few years ago here, and there's nothing like the new entry to the market, and they set a big goal. So this is speaking first from Wisconsin's standpoint. So I think our team is more than up for the challenge to anyone that comes here that wants to take market share, and I think you'll find us to be relatively aggressive in maintaining our market share here. Well, you never let your guard down and you never want to get too arrogant about your position. And we feel pretty confident that we can work hard and maintain our position here. If you kind of just go around the markets of the three you mentioned, the Midwest, have all performed relatively well. The Minneapolis team has been with us by far the longest in through a period of acquisitions. And they've performed well, both as a team, and as well in the market. And it really solidified the strong number three position there in the business community in terms of a lot of outbound calling and a lot of community involvement. So I think that they're going to continue to do well there. And we hope the few facilities there -- well of course, the last couple of years, they performed reasonably well despite a pretty tough economy. So I feel pretty confident that the Indianapolis market joined us last, come to St. Louis in just second, but the Indianapolis market joined us last. And they've really performed well during the recession. They had a couple of real estate credits, they had to deal with the by and large, had a clean portfolio, had done a lot of work on that portfolio before joining us. And they have continued to add some good names particularly in the business side throughout this recession. And they've been both C&Is, as well as a couple of Commercial Real Estate relationships that have performed well. I think that market will perform very well for us, and we have fair coverage of that market right now. So hopefully, we'll grow. And then finally, St. Louis is kind of in between building [ph] this relatively long period of time since '03. And they have as well performed well. That economy has struggled, nothing like the fast growth economies in terms of real estate, but it's had to kind of gone through the economic cycle as well due to their -- they've hung on to their relationships. And I think we're going to do well. I think all three of those markets outside Wisconsin will perform well for M&I. And we have a lot of penetration opportunity in the business since we have their side [ph]. I think we feel pretty good about how theyÕve performed during this economy and the ability to perform well coming out. I mean the key is holding on to the key relationship bankers as we go through this cycle and all three of those markets have done that pretty well"

Over a year ago, we booked -- approximately a year ago, we booked reserves on that of $115 million, so loan loss provision exits the charge-offs. And restructuring the notes, in the course of that restructuring, the properties began to form as we would expect that they would. But then as the season when those hospitality units should have been more productive, they were not. And we didn't believe that, that was going to change materially. But more importantly, the customer didn't believe that was going to change materially. And so we agreed with the customer's decision to put those for sale. So we had $115 million of reserve allocated specifically to those credits. We used two valuation experts. We recorded the value of the properties in our financial statements at the lowest end of the two valuation experts ranges and therefore required an additional $86 million of loan loss provision. So $115 million plus $86 million gets you to $201 million of reserve. Then we charged off that reserve because they believe that was a permanent impairment. If we've overstated -- should it sell in the fourth quarter, that would be a recovery. Our view was that we weren't going to take the risk of having it as another valuation range, and maybe being more optimistic than situation warrants it. So we'll find out, I think, over the course of the next 30 to 60 days where that stands and hopefully, that will close in the fourth quarter."

And I think the challenge there was too much -- with any of the developers, too much land. Most of our Commercial Real Estate portfolio here is income-producing. So that's quite performed well through the cycle. On the C&I side, I'd say that the bulk of the companies here are probably held, and I think they performed well during this cycle. They've maintained excess liquidity. They've always maintained it, but they maintained it even more so during the decline in the economy. And I think it's in pretty good shape, and I think it will come back pretty quickly here. The benefit that Wisconsin has is where it would have been very hard kind of three decades ago, to have diversified substantially well. Many companies still have some auto dependency. It's much less, and so they're not nearly as price sensitive anymore. And they show us going through the cycle. So I think the economy is in good shape. The rise in grain prices has also benefited the farm community, which is a big part of this economy substantially during this cycle. Then you have a lot of farmers that look at our portfolio that have sold their crop forward and really locked in these gains. So now they have the gain books or they will get books. So I think there's lots of parts of the economy that will do well here. Unemployment is high, but it's not as high as it is nationally. And there's always some challenges going on in communities where we have struggling inner city. And we have a piece of that too. But by and large, I think it's in pretty good shape."

And he'd been talking to me about it for probably two years, and was just trying to pick the right moment. Clearly, we're in a recovery stage at this point in time, and so he'll still remain active on board, but not in the Chairman role. Mark has over three decades of time with M&I and just came to a point in this cycle where he wanted to step away and do some other stuff. And we talked him in to staying engaged with this through the end of the year and in an advisory role, so less time but available to us in 2011. And so we think we can make that work, and we had a very capable executive, and Ben Scruiter [ph] can step into that role immediately and bridge the gap while we do a search. In the meantime, we have the benefit of Mark in the house, and we're able to go through that exercise we think reasonably seamless. Tom Ellis' has been a high-performing executive, has worked in Milwaukee and then outside Milwaukee, led teams on the C&I side of the business. And more recently, spent the last couple of years on the retail side of the business and has been responsible with those teams, where some very positive movement in our retail deposit base. And so this is kind of been in the coming for probably 12 to 18 months or longer at least. So we thought that was the right time to go through that. We also had a couple of market presence that we announced this morning, that worked on the national transition of senior executives in their markets that were being promoted to take on roles within the company in the succession planning we made on [indiscernible] over several years there positioned them well to be able to move the next executive into the market President role. We've gone through an exercise over the course of the last Ð really, over the course of 2010 in realigning our focus and customer segments, which is how we deliver our services, and in doing so, looked at the appropriate leadership in each one of those segments and each one of those businesses. And it was all coming to a head this quarter and decided that this is as good a time that any to announce that as we continue to move forward. So that's really been kind of the driver of it. Any company has these cycles and certainly, it's been a rugged economic cycle for us, nothing like that before in the company's history. And we did a lot of bid order [ph] assessment as to what our strengths were in the markets and I think if you look at some of the acquisition activity that we have done prior to this economic cycle, as we went into some markets, I think we tried to be everything to everybody, and that probably wasn't the most effective strategy. So our reassessment helped us focus on more segments that we can go after successfully and deliver products and services that the customer wants in Wisconsin, but more tailored focus than the other markets where our market share is not as high and our presence isnÕt as high. And then this exercise kind of culminated in that outcome, with this tailored focus on certain segments in certain markets, and where we think we can be successful and grow the business. So it means in some cases, maybe less people or facilities, but that will be evaluated over a period of time. And everything had to align itself with the segments in each market that we're trying to attract. And I guess you'll see the M&I history has been somewhat built on the business segment, and that will continue to be a focus where weÕve had great success and where we think we can lever the other parts of the business as well."

Those are little bit larger and they were [ph] with the bank for a long, long time. In that mix, it's kind of a combination of real estate customers that have a lot of income-producing properties, a couple of auto dealers, but performing pretty well this point in the cycle. Obviously, if they reached a little bit of stress earlier in the cycle, they're obviously profitable and doing well and cash flowing today.  So while there is always a strain on a property here or there in one of the larger Commercial Real Estate Developer portfolios, by and large there because they're substantially income-producing, that in many cases, they're actually in pretty good shape. So overall, so they might have one source of [ph] strain, but the others are amortizing principal and interest so we think they're in pretty good shape.

Our third quarter results provide us with continued confidence that a recovery is underway at M&I. Our credit quality trends continue to stabilize as shown by continued lower levels of loans going into non-performing status in comparison to the prior year, continued low levels of early-stage delinquencies, continued improvement in total non-performing loans, which decreased for the fifth consecutive quarter and are at our lowest levels since 2008. The important items spoken on to better understand the third quarter performance include the following: A loss this quarter is in line with the prior quarter and substantially less than the third quarter last year. Our credit quality improvement this quarter has been matched by steps we have taken that bring one sizable hospitality relationship to final resolution. Recall that we have discussed this credit in previous calls going back to the second quarter of last year. Related to this relationship, in this quarter, we moved the remaining $83 million from renegotiate to non-accrual, charged off $201 million across all properties, $86 million of which required incremental loan loss provision. 
We now carry these 10 properties at a substantial discount to unpaid principal balance, which we'd establish using the lowest end of any valuation range. The incremental provision associated with this hospitality relationship cost us $0.10 per share. This quarter, net charge-offs totaled $560 million. Excluding the hospitality relationship, charge-offs would have been $359 million, our lowest level since the third quarter of 2009. Similarly, without this relationship, our loan loss provision would have been $346 million, our lowest level since the third quarter of 2008. This is 21% below last quarter. 
Non-performing loans were down $203 million this quarter. From our high in June 2009, non-performing loans are down 34%. We continue to see stabilization in our NPL formation trends. This quarter, we revised approximately $700 million of new non-performing loans, which is higher than the prior quarter. Included in this inflow is $148 million in previously renegotiated loans, which masks the $559 million of core new inflows and is 4% better than last quarter. With the movement of these renegotiated commercial loans to NPL status, we now have only $131 million in remaining commercial and Commercial Real Estate renegotiated loans. We will be less likely to renegotiate significant amounts of commercial and Commercial Real Estate loans going forward. The Economy has proven that once a degree of stress reaches a real estate project, the likelihood of a successful outcome is greatly diminished. On the other hand, we are pleased with our success in restructuring consumer home mortgages. 
On a linked quarter basis, non-performing loans declined 11% while non-performing assets declined 10%. If you include renegotiated loans in non-performing loans and non-performing assets, the declines are 15% and 13%, respectively. For the quarter, early-stage loan delinquencies, those performing loans past due 30 to 89 days increased slightly but remained at levels not seen since 2007. 
Our non-performing Construction & Development loans were down $32 million this quarter or 6% from June 30. Approximately 44% of this decrease is attributable to the Arizona market where our non-performing Construction & Development loans are less than $100 million. We have reduced our concentration of Construction & Development loans to approximately 9% of total loans, compared to nearly 23% at a tie in the third quarter of 2007.  As we have noted many times before, we expect continued construct contraction in this portfolio, reflecting the reality of this economic environment. 
For the quarter, charge offs exceeded provisions by $128 million. This reduction in the reserve is the result of charging down loans that already had specific reserves and is almost entirely related to the single hospitality relationship. We do not expect a sustained trend in declines in the loan loss reserve just yet. Our reserve now stands at 3.49% of total loans. 
We continue to make progress in improving our funding profile. Our loan-to-deposit ratio stands at 104%, highlighting the substantial progress we made since our tie of 132% in 2007. During the quarter, we revised securities and other net gains for $43 million. These gains were partially offset by the non-cash expense of $29 million to terminate $2.3 billion in the wholesale CDs. We continue to maintain a strong capital base with a tangible common equity ratio of 8.3% and an estimated Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 10.8%. 
Now for some additional insights into the quarter. First, the net interest margin. Our net interest margin decreased by three basis points on a linked quarter basis to 3.14%. For the quarter, our net interest margin benefited from an improved funding mix, but was constrained by higher-than-anticipated cash balances. Like other banks, we only earn 25 basis points on our excess cash balances held at the Fed. Despite recent asset quality improvements, our margin continues to be negatively impacted by non-performing assets. The negative impact is 26 basis points in total. We continue to expect net interest margin will remain in this area for the near term with a positive longer-term upward trend. Many variables continue to impact margin including competitive pricing and the influence of deposit and loan floors. It is difficult to project this one data point with a high degree of accuracy given the current yield curve and competitive environment. 
Now moving on to the Wealth Management segment. For the quarter, strong sales and client retention push revenues higher by 4% compared to the third quarter of 2009. On a link quarter basis, revenues were up slightly. Our continued strong Asset Management performance drove new relationships and sales and continues to positively impact our pipelines. Overall, fee income continued to expand as reflected in sales and pipeline growth in both institutional and personal business lines. Aggressive management of our Private Banking portfolios resulted in reduced charge offs and delinquencies as evidenced by a lower provision for the third quarter versus the second quarter and significantly lower versus the third quarter of last year. 
In spite of accounting [ph] market conditions during the quarter, Assets under Management finished the quarter at $33 billion, up in comparison to both the prior year and the linked quarter. Assets under administration were $139 billion, up in comparison to the same periods. With strong investment performance and natural recognition, Wealth Management continues to expand its reach outside of our core footprint while more importantly improving penetration with existing customers. 
From an expense standpoint, total noninterest expense amounted to $420 million in the third quarter. This includes the expense of the wholesale CD terminations discussed earlier, which amounted to $29 million for the quarter. Net expenses for non-performing assets and other current related items were $37 million [ph] (22:08) this quarter. None the less, particularly in the current operating environment, M&I will continue to be very focused on maintaining our historical expense discipline. In the course of the upcoming quarter, we will review many aspects of our business to ensure that we're operating a more reasonable expense base. 
Now moving on to our credit quality trends. Non-performing loans decreased for the fifth consecutive quarter, resulting in our lowest level of non-performing loans since the end of 2008. We anticipate continued improvement in our non-performing loan trends reflecting sustained improvement in early-stage delinquency, reduced inflows and continued aggressive strategy to work out or sell non-performing credits. We expect early stage accruing delinquent loans to remain in the low 1% area. 
Our Commercial and Consumer portfolios continue to have non-performing characteristics better than the bank as a whole, while our Construction & Development loans continue to show the stresses of national housing markets. Our core Wisconsin portfolio continues to perform well through the cycle as is highlighted by our 2% non-performing loan ratio. We have identified the specific loss content in non-accrual loans over $1 million, and marked them to net realizable value with either a specific reserve or charge-off. As shown in Slide 8, M&I has conducted a specific impairment analysis of $1.1 billion or 67% of total non-performing loans to quantify potential impairment. On average, 38% of the unpaid principal balance of these loans has been charged off. 
Related to the charge-offs, during the quarter, and adjusted for the hospitality relationship discussed earlier, we charged off $359 million, which is 18% below last quarter. Although the Arizona and Florida marketplaces continue to be the largest proportion of charge-offs, approximately 47%, not including the previously discussed hospitality relationship, they are decreasing as expected. As shown on Slide 33, the largest concentrations in net charge-offs by geographic location were $106 million for Arizona, which is at its lowest level since September of 2008 and $62 million for Florida. 
Discussing our non-performing loan trends, during the quarter, our non-performing loans decreased $203 million, which is 11% below last quarter and 34% below our high watermark in the second quarter of 2009. For the quarter, we sold approximately $87 million in larger stressed Construction & Development loans. As in the past, we have moved aggressively to identify problem loans and the associated loss content. Of our non-performing loans, $648 million or 41% are past due less than 90 days. $448 million or 28% of total non-performing loans are current. Our new non-performing loan formation continued to stabilize this quarter with approximately $700 million moving to non-accrual status, of which $148 million were previously recognized as primarily three specific commercial renegotiated relationships. 
We have already realized partial charge-offs of $821 million against our non-performing loans, representing a 34% haircut. Another way to look our partial charge-offs is that represents a 57% write down on specific non-performing loans where a direct write-down was deemed necessary. We continue to see notable contraction in our Residential Vacant Land portfolio, which has declined approximately 55% since September 2007 high watermark. Residential lot loans to individuals and developers account for $143 million of non-performing loans, which is down 22% from the prior quarter. Of our non-performing loans in this category, 42% are based in the Arizona market. 
Shifting to the Commercial Loan portfolio, this portfolio continues to perform relatively well during this cycle, while still showing the effect of the economy. For the quarter, net charge-offs were $56 million, down substantially from the prior quarter, and non-performing C&I loans were down 6% from the prior quarter. With regard to our non-construction Commercial Real Estate portfolio, we have $13.1 billion outstanding with $3.5 billion in Multifamily and $8.8 billion in Business Real Estate. As shown on Slide 16, our Business Real Estate portfolio is generally concentrated in our core midwest markets, 2/3, with only 17% in our combined Florida and Arizona markets and another 3% in other higher-risk areas. 40% of this portfolio was owner-occupied. 
In the third quarter, we saw our non-performing loans in the non-construction Commercial Real Estate category decreased to 3.7%. Like others, we continue to be watchful of this portfolio and continue to stay close to our borrowers. The delinquencies in this portfolio continue to be manageable with approximately $99 million of accruing notes or 0.8% of total performing Commercial Real Estate loans past due 30 to 89 days. 
A few final comments on credit quality, we have and will continue to take aggressive steps to resolve our non-performing situations. We remain committed to returning M&I to a level of solid credit quality and expect that our declines in non-performing loans, relative stability in non-performing loan inflows and early-stage delinquencies are continuing indicators of achieving this goal. Changing focus to the organic balance sheet trends compared to the same quarter in 2009. C&I loans decrease as we continue to see stabilizing but low-lying utilization from existing customers consistent with the slower economy. Across all of our Construction & Development category, what we have seen approximately $2.5 billion or 37% in average balance contraction since the third quarter of last year. At quarter end, Construction & Development loans accounted for approximately 9% of total loans, down from high of approximately 23% in the third quarter of 2007. Non-construction Commercial Real Estate loans decreased $700 million in comparison to the same quarter last year and decreased $348 million on a linked quarter basis. We expect this trend will continue. 
On the deposit side, we can see the benefit from positive mix shift. In comparison to the same quarter last year, our core transaction deposits have increased by more than $2.5 billion or 12.2% while consistent with our strategy to improve our deposit mix, our time and wholesale deposits have contracted by $4.8 billion or 23.5%. 
A few final comments. As we move into the fourth quarter of 2010, and to reiterate comments made earlier, not only do we expect our financial results to reflect the benefits of the aggressive credit steps we have taken, but also the challenges of the broader financial markets. As our credit quality trends continue to improve, our intention will increasingly shift to rebuilding our profitability profile. Nonetheless, we will not waiver in our credit quality focus. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Joining me now are Mark Furlong, our Chairman and CEO; and Mark Hogan, our Chief Credit Officer.

First, we need to return to profitability before we start thinking about crossing that bridge. More broadly, in terms of capital, we continue to believe our capital levels are sufficient from our perspective.

Well, it's kind of an evolving nature with [indiscernible]  Over the year ago, the loan was restructed and the after annuity [ph] initially started to form according to what we thought the performance level should be. Over the course of spring and summer, the performance level wasn't what we thought it should be and the borrower discussed with us some alternatives. And one of the alternatives was considering selling the properties. And our view was that, that was probably the right decision, that if it wasn't going to perform throughout the summer -- it had not performed throughout the summer to a level we thought it should. So when they went to that exercise and we went through the valuation exercise prior to it going on the market, two industry experts were brought into the valuation. We took the lowest valuation of the two industry experts, so they did a low, medium and high, and that's what we booked to and then the reason was our experience has been -- that the valuation is coming closer to that. But there's also some element of conservatism. So it’s a unique onset [ph], it was a very long-term relationship, M&I and there is nothing that even resembles a relationship like this in the banks. So that's really how we got to that valuation. Had the property performed like it did last fall and continue to perform -- continuing to improving in the economy, that wouldn’t have been necessary and I doubt that the sale would have been necessary. By the way, we agreed with the concept of selling the property. We believed that the value of the current debt level wouldn't sustain itself. So it would have been just prolonging the inevitable."

So I think that they're going to continue to do well there.

So I feel pretty confident that the Indianapolis market joined us last, come to St. Louis in just second, but the Indianapolis market joined us last.

They had a couple of real estate credits, they had to deal with the by and large, had a clean portfolio, had done a lot of work on that portfolio before joining us.

And they've been both C&Is, as well as a couple of Commercial Real Estate relationships that have performed well.

And then finally, St. Louis is kind of in between building [ph] this relatively long period of time since '03. And they have as well performed well. That economy has struggled, nothing like the fast growth economies in terms of real estate, but it's had to kind of gone through the economic cycle as well due to their -- they've hung on to their relationships.

But more importantly, the customer didn't believe that was going to change materially. And so we agreed with the customer's decision to put those for sale. So we had $115 million of reserve allocated specifically to those credits. We used two valuation experts. We recorded the value of the properties in our financial statements at the lowest end of the two valuation experts ranges and therefore required an additional $86 million of loan loss provision. So $115 million plus $86 million gets you to $201 million of reserve. Then we charged off that reserve because they believe that was a permanent impairment. If we've overstated -- should it sell in the fourth quarter, that would be a recovery. Our view was that we weren't going to take the risk of having it as another valuation range, and maybe being more optimistic than situation warrants it.

It's much less, and so they're not nearly as price sensitive anymore. And they show us going through the cycle. So I think the economy is in good shape. The rise in grain prices has also benefited the farm community, which is a big part of this economy substantially during this cycle. Then you have a lot of farmers that look at our portfolio that have sold their crop forward and really locked in these gains. So now they have the gain books or they will get books.

And he'd been talking to me about it for probably two years, and was just trying to pick the right moment. Clearly, we're in a recovery stage at this point in time, and so he'll still remain active on board, but not in the Chairman role. Mark has over three decades of time with M&I and just came to a point in this cycle where he wanted to step away and do some other stuff. And we talked him in to staying engaged with this through the end of the year and in an advisory role, so less time but available to us in 2011. And so we think we can make that work, and we had a very capable executive, and Ben Scruiter [ph] can step into that role immediately and bridge the gap while we do a search. In the meantime, we have the benefit of Mark in the house, and we're able to go through that exercise we think reasonably seamless. Tom Ellis' has been a high-performing executive, has worked in Milwaukee and then outside Milwaukee, led teams on the C&I side of the business. And more recently, spent the last couple of years on the retail side of the business and has been responsible with those teams, where some very positive movement in our retail deposit base. And so this is kind of been in the coming for probably 12 to 18 months or longer at least. So we thought that was the right time to go through that. We also had a couple of market presence that we announced this morning, that worked on the national transition of senior executives in their markets that were being promoted to take on roles within the company in the succession planning we made on [indiscernible] over several years there positioned them well to be able to move the next executive into the market President role. We've gone through an exercise over the course of the last Ð really, over the course of 2010 in realigning our focus and customer segments, which is how we deliver our services, and in doing so, looked at the appropriate leadership in each one of those segments and each one of those businesses. And it was all coming to a head this quarter and decided that this is as good a time that any to announce that as we continue to move forward. So that's really been kind of the driver of it. Any company has these cycles and certainly, it's been a rugged economic cycle for us, nothing like that before in the company's history. And we did a lot of bid order [ph] assessment as to what our strengths were in the markets and I think if you look at some of the acquisition activity that we have done prior to this economic cycle, as we went into some markets, I think we tried to be everything to everybody, and that probably wasn't the most effective strategy. So our reassessment helped us focus on more segments that we can go after successfully and deliver products and services that the customer wants in Wisconsin, but more tailored focus than the other markets where our market share is not as high and our presence isn’t as high. And then this exercise kind of culminated in that outcome, with this tailored focus on certain segments in certain markets, and where we think we can be successful and grow the business. So it means in some cases, maybe less people or facilities, but that will be evaluated over a period of time. And everything had to align itself with the segments in each market that we're trying to attract. And I guess you'll see the M&I history has been somewhat built on the business segment, and that will continue to be a focus where we’ve had great success and where we think we can lever the other parts of the business as well."

As you can see from our results, we continue to remain aggressive in dealing with tough credit issues. Though elevated levels of charge-offs will continue to the next couple of quarters, barring something unforeseen taking place in the economy, we do expect charge-offs to start to decline in 2010. 
We will continue to have some relationships that we need to work through at the end of the recession, but the likelihood of a real estate project surviving today is a great deal different than two years ago. We are most likely at a turning point in credit quality, though another quarter or two is needed to validate that condition. As Greg Smith will review with you in a couple of minutes, early stage delinquency continues to improve such as loans 30 to 89 days delinquent are now at their lowest levels since 2007. This is probably our best gauge of future charge-offs.
A great deal of attention is being devoted to what may occur with Commercial Real Estate this year and over the next two to three years. Although our delinquency in Commercial Real Estate is higher than in 2007, the trend is toward a decline in delinquency in the last two quarters. We remain optimistic, though focused on this portfolio, particularly as we finished the review of all loans greater than $1 million in December. We have no expectations that our Commercial Real Estate portfolio will perform in any way comparable to what we've seen with Construction & Development. Our sentiments rest there due to the small average size of our loans, our concentration in the Midwest and the extended cash flow stabilization in this book of business. I'm sure we'll have some issues over time, but we expect them to be manageable.
As we move into 2010, we've intended to leave no struggling asset unaddressed. In addition to significant charge-offs on our portfolio over the last two years, we sold $2 billion of underperforming loans. We will continue to sell these loans, but we expect the pace to slow. We saw some improvement in pricing this quarter, which is to be expected as real estate values begin to stabilize. We feel the same way about properties we've taken into owned real estate. On the commercial side of REO, we have three completed projects in the process of being leased up that aggregate about $80 million, each is written down about 25%. 
On the consumer side, the small number of homes we own are being carried at approximately 62% of unpaid balance, and the residential lots are being carried at 30% of unpaid balance. The point in saying that is to reinforce that we are addressing every matter in the same manner. We are glad to put these last two years behind us and though the economy still creates some uncertainty, we feel like we are well positioned to remain strong as the credit cycle winds down. There are several positive indicators about the underlying strength of M&I, and Greg will share some of the metrics on these non-credit aspects of our business to reinforce our sentiments. With that, let me turn the call over to Greg."
286484,84102409,91781,"Marshall & Ilsley Corporation, Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2010",2010-01-20,"Earnings Calls","Marshall & Ilsley Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and thank you everyone for joining us today.

We have included detailed credit quality slides on our website. You may want to have these printed out and available for our credit quality discussion. 
Although our fourth quarter results continue to reflect the challenging operating environment that has confronted banks, our results provide us building confidence that a recovery is underway at M&I. Our credit quality trends continue to benefit from our aggressive approach to non-performing loan identification and resolution as is shown by continued favorable trends in loans going on to nonperforming status; continued improvement in early stage delinquencies, which decreased for the third consecutive quarter; continued improvement in total nonperforming loans, which decreased for the second consecutive quarter. 
The important items to focus on to better understand our fourth quarter performance include the following: We have continued our aggressive steps to address the largest risks in our loan portfolio, including our Construction & Development business even though these steps continue to be the primary reason for our loss in the quarter. In addition, we transferred a $170 million of larger previously classified as renegotiated loans to nonperforming status as our review showed core performance of these properties deteriorated. We will discuss these loans in more detail later in this call. 
Despite the migration of these renegotiated loans, nonperforming loans were down over $200 million this quarter, which reflects the impact of our continued aggressive nonperforming loan workout and disposition strategies. In comparison to the prior quarter, nonperforming loan inflows were down 8% when adjusted for the previously renegotiated loans mentioned a moment ago.
For the quarter, our early stage loan delinquencies, those loans past due 30 to 89 days declined by over 15% since September to the lowest levels since 2007. As we have noted previously, we are increasingly comfortable that the pattern of large Commercial Real Estate Construction & Development charge-offs in Arizona is largely behind us. Since year end 2007, this portfolio has contracted by nearly 80% and is now under $300 million. Although we do not believe our Construction & Development issues are completely behind us, we are encouraged that total non-accrual C&D loans contracted for the third quarter in a row, our nonperforming loans continue to decline. Our portfolio of C&D loans on non-accrual amounts to approximately $800 million, down approximately $180 million from September 30. This decrease is largely attributable to the Arizona market.
We have increased our reserve to 3.35% of total loans or nearly $1.5 billion and continue to make progress toward our goal of reducing our concentration of Construction & Development loans, which now stand at 12.5% of our loan portfolio versus 18% at the end of 2008. 
For the quarter, we benefited from $46 million in after tax gains from security sales and tendering for our own debt securities. These gains are offset by further aggressive steps in nonperforming asset resolution. 
Our Wealth Management division continued to grow revenues, as well as assets under both management and administration this quarter, reaching record highs for both. We continue to have a capital base well above any regulatory capital thresholds. At quarter end, our tangible common equity ratio was 8.2%, and our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is estimated to be 11.1%. During the quarter, we realized 13 basis points of net interest margin expansion, reflecting continued success in improving our funding and lending profiles and the effect of fewer loans becoming nonperforming. We finished 2009 with 106% loan-to-deposit ratio, down from 132% just two years ago.
Now for some additional insights into the quarter, and we'll start with the net interest margin. Our net interest margin increased by 13 basis points on a linked-quarter basis to 2.95%. During the fourth quarter, our net interest margin benefited from credit quality improvement and the restructuring and/or retiring of certain debt instruments. Despite recent asset quality improvements, our margin continues to be negatively impacted by nonperforming assets. The negative impact is 25 basis points in total and 13 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2007. We expect that the net interest margin will trend upward slightly for the near term as we anticipate additional favorable results from the restructuring activities late in the quarter and further improvements in credit quality.
Like the industry in general, we expect to be challenged by competitive pricing, the impact of deposit and loan pricing floors, the movement of new and existing deposits into lower spread higher-yielding products, wholesale funding spreads and of course, the yield curve. There continue to be many variables that impact margin. It is difficult to project this one data point given the current interest rate volatility occurring in the market. 
Now moving on to Wealth Management. In spite of market volatility, revenues increased 5% on a linked-quarter basis and 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Expanding sales, enhanced investment products and investment performance generated the improved results. Sales pipelines continue to build across our divisions especially in our institutional businesses, which include our retirement services, not-for-profit and outsourcing lines. 
Assets under Management reached $33 billion, up 8% compared to the end of 2008. Our assets under Administration rose to $122 billion or 17% greater than the same period a year ago. Our Asset Management acquisitions continue to perform well. Both Delta and Taplin, Canida & Habacht experienced new asset additions and growth of existing relationships during the quarter. 
Our Brokerage and Insurance division continue to experience good sales flows during the quarter, as investors position their portfolios for 2010. Revenues were up 1% on a linked quarter basis and up 6% compared to the same quarter last year, reflecting improved investor confidence and greater coverage by our financial advisors.
From an expense standpoint, total noninterest expense amounted to $409 million in the fourth quarter, consistent with the third quarter. Expenses for nonperforming assets and other credit-related items were relatively unchanged compared to last quarter at $69 million. These are largely related to collection efforts and carrying costs for nonperforming assets. Although our reported efficiency ratio is 67%, when adjusted for these items and other credit-related expenses, we view our core efficiency ratio to be 56.7%, down 1% from the prior quarter. Nonetheless, particularly in the current operating environment, M&I will continue to be very focused on maintaining our historical expense discipline. 
Now moving on to our credit quality trends. Nonperforming loans decreased for the second consecutive quarter resulting in our lowest level of nonperforming loans since the end of 2008. When coupled with continued improvement in early-stage delinquencies, these trends support our aggressive approach to problem credit resolution. Continuing with that approach, we increased our loan loss reserves, which now stands at $1.5 billion or 3.35% of total loans. Our commercial, non-construction Commercial Real Estate and consumer portfolios continue to have nonperforming characteristics better than the bank as a whole, while our Construction & Development-related loans continue to show the stresses of the national housing markets. This stress continues to be most apparent in the Arizona market where home prices have fallen over 50% from their peak in June 2006.
Coming into 2010, we continue to anticipate a relative stabilization in nonperforming loan trends, reflecting sustained improvement in early-stage delinquencies, reduced inflows and continued aggressive strategies to work out or sell nonperforming credits. We were pleased that our nonperforming loans again decreased for the quarter. Moving into 2010, we have strengthening confidence that we will see continued credit quality improvements.
For the quarter, we realized net charge-offs of $572 million, and we provided $639 million for loan losses. Although these are higher than we initially expected, these levels reflect our continued efforts to proactively reduce our exposure to problem relationships. Importantly, we don't believe that charge-offs and provision for this quarter are indicative of what we expect for 2010. Our quarter end  reserve was 3.35% of period end total loans, which is an increase of $67 million from the prior quarter end.
In addition to building the allowance, we have identified the specific loss content in non-accrual loans over $1 million marked them to net realizable value with either specific reserve or charge-offs. As shown on Slide 6, M&I has conducted a specific impairment analysis of $1.4 billion or 70% of total nonperforming loans to quantify potential impairment. On average, 27% of the unpaid principal balance of these loans has been charged off. Through building the allowance and aggressively writing down problem loans, M&I post a solid adjusted reserve coverage ratio of 191%.
As we look forward, we expect to continue taking aggressive steps to resolve our nonperforming loans, the proceeds from which will be redeployed in our business. As in prior quarters, the largest proportion of charge-offs, approximately 52%, were associated with the Arizona and Florida marketplaces. As shown on Slide 31, the net charge-offs by geographic location were $187 million for Arizona and $108 million for Florida. Otherwise, charge-offs were rather diversified from a geographic perspective. As expected, we are seeing a shift in Arizona charge-offs away from our larger commercial construction credits toward smaller, retail-related credits.
Discussing our nonperforming loan trends. During the quarter, our nonperforming loans decreased $205 million, which is 9% below last quarter and 15% below the second quarter. For the quarter, we sold $143 million in larger stress Construction & Development loans. In addition, we sold a $70 million pool of nonperforming or seriously delinquent single-family mortgage loans resulting in a $35 million net charge-off. Like our last nonperforming residential loan sale, over 60% of the underlying loans are in Arizona.
As in the past, we have moved aggressively to identify potential nonperforming loans and the associated loss content. This is supported by the following: 25% of our nonperforming loans are current or past due less than 30 days up from 16% last quarter. Of our loans past due 30 to 89 days, which we consider our early-stage delinquencies, $170 million are already nonperforming. 34% or $687 million of our nonperforming loans are past due less than 90 days. We have already realized partial charge-offs of $810 million against our nonperforming loans, representing a 28% haircut. Another way rate to look at our partial charge-offs that it represents a 52% write-down on specific nonperforming loans where a direct write-down was deemed necessary.
A few comments on our Construction & Development portfolios. With our loan portfolios, we continue to focus on our Construction & Development categories, particularly residential-related. Please note on Slide 8 that we have segmented our commercial construction portfolio between C&I-related and housing-related. This slide highlights the continued strong credit quality profile of the non-housing component of the commercial construction portfolio. Less than half of our commercial construction portfolio is related to housing. As of quarter end, we have $807 million in Construction & Development loans on nonperforming status, representing 39% of our total nonperforming loans. 
As shown on Slide 33, of these nonperforming Construction & Development loans, 50% are in the Arizona and Florida markets. On average, these loans are already heavily reserved or charged down. Clearly, our issues remain concentrated in these markets. To provide a little bit more granularity on our portfolio of larger Construction & Development projects, the following may be helpful: We have 27 loans greater than $5 million on non-accrual status. Only nine of these are in excess of $10 million, and only one of these is in excess of $20 million.
We have seen some stabilization in the residential land portfolio during the fourth quarter as nonperforming loans have fallen $64 million. This portfolio is shown in Slides 38 and 39. We have $1.6 billion in residential land loans to individuals and developers, $870 million or 55% are located in Arizona zip codes. The bulk of the Arizona loans, 2/3 are in Maricopa County. The loans to individuals in the Arizona portfolio are relatively modest in size with an average balance of approximately $174,000. We continue to refresh both FICO scores and LTVs for the Arizona portfolio. Individual FICO scores averaged 736 at the time of origination, and for the performing loans remain above 720 today. Although we anticipate that our nonperforming loans in the Arizona residential land portfolio will remain elevated, we believe we will benefit from the fact that we first tightened our underwriting standards in mid-2005 and ceased new money originations in 2008. Residential lot loans to individuals and developers account for $259 million of nonperforming loans, of which 47% are based in Arizona zip codes.
With regard to conventional mortgages, our portfolio continues to show that individuals are feeling continued economic stress. As we've noted before, we maintained our underwriting discipline through the cycle, have never originated subprime loans and have avoided many of the more risky loan products. During the quarter, our nonperforming residential loans decreased to $206 million or 4.2% of the residential mortgage portfolio. These trends highlight the benefit of our nonperforming residential loan sales completed in December and July. We continue to aggressively monitor and manage this portfolio.
Just a couple of comments on our consumer loan trends as the overall consumer portfolio has maintained its nonperforming loan levels below those of the overall bank. As of quarter end, only 1.4% of consumer loans were on nonperforming status. As we've noted in the past, our credit quality experience with this portfolio has benefited from our historical practice of selling much of our production as we did in 2005 and 2006. Looking forward, consumer non-accruals, including both residential and home equity, are likely to remain elevated, reflecting continued consumer stress although we expect that our ultimate losses will remain better than industry averages.
With regard to the commercial loan portfolio. During the course of the fourth quarter, we realized $85 million of net charge-offs in our C&I portfolio. These charge-offs are geographically dispersed. Generally, our commercial portfolio has performed relatively well during this cycle while still showing the effect of the economy. In addition, we realized a decrease of $61 million in nonperforming C&I loans. 
A brief comment on bank holding company loans. As of year end, we continue to retain a portfolio of approximately $550 million, of which 11% is nonperforming and against which we have reserves of 17%. We are adequately reserved, but we'll continue to evaluate this portfolio critically. Going forward, based on the rapidly changing landscape for banks and the loss of market synergies caused by the spinoff of Metavante, M&I's correspondent banking strategy has been redefined to include only core relationships that are within our banking footprint with a primary focus on fee-based activities going forward.
With regard to our nonconstruction Commercial Real Estate portfolio. We have $13.6 billion outstanding with $3.6 billion in multi-family and $9.3 billion in business real estate. As shown on Slide 16, our business real estate portfolio is generally concentrated in our core Midwest markets, 2/3, with only 17% that are combined Florida and Arizona markets and another 3% in other higher risk markets. 37% of this portfolio is owner occupied. In the fourth quarter, we saw our nonperforming loans in the non-construction Commercial Real Estate category increase $75 million to 4.3%. Contributing to this increase is the review of renegotiated loans that we noted earlier in the call. We performed a rigorous review of our Commercial division renegotiated loans and found that the performance of certain related properties that deteriorated to a point where we felt non-accrual status was more appropriate. With this determination, we moved $170 million to non-accrual status. In addition, we are carrying the loans on our books at 44% of unpaid principal balance through either partial charge-offs or specific reserves.
A few comments on our accruing renegotiated loans. Over the past quarter, we have seen a $142 million decrease in accruing renegotiated loans to a total of $793 million. This decrease is largely a result of previously discussed review of certain relationships. On the consumer side, the vast majority of these loans continue to be related to home, land or construction loans to individuals. At quarter end, these categories accounted for approximately $647 million or 82% of the total. Within the consumer sector, our restructured loan delinquency trends continue to perform better than national averages. 
Over the next few quarters, we continue to expect nonperforming loan and real estate-owned balances to remain elevated above historical averages, reflecting broader economic stress that we anticipate inflows will continue to slow. We specifically anticipate that the inflows of larger construction credits are past their peak. As I noted in discussing Slide 6, through increasing the reserve and aggressively writing down problem loans, M&I has an adjusted reserve coverage ratio of 191%.
We will continue to evaluate the opportunity for further sales of nonperforming assets and weigh the opportunity versus the cost in keeping those assets for a period of time. Sometimes, the best resolution will be to take the underlying property to maximize our interest, which will cause increases to REO for a period of time. This quarter, our REO increased to $431 million, and this is consistent with previous expectations. We have seven commercial properties over $10 million. We continue to expect that REO balances will increase going forward and view this as a natural progression as we gain control of projects and move toward ultimate resolutions. 
A few final comments on credit quality. Stresses in the national housing and Commercial Real Estate markets will continue to affect us, and we will continue to address them proactively. We have and will continue to take aggressive steps to resolve our nonperforming situations. Nonetheless, should the economy continue to deteriorate beyond our current expectations, our losses could continue.
Our nonperforming loans continue to be concentrated in the housing construction-related in the Commercial Real Estate portfolios, particularly in our Arizona, Florida and correspondent businesses. Despite a recent increase in Florida, we continue to believe our larger C&D challenges in the Florida and Arizona markets are behind us. Although we are not immune from consumer deterioration, we believe our residential and consumer portfolios will continue to perform better than the industry as a whole and also recall that our credit card portfolio is relatively small with less than $300 million of outstandings. We will continue to maintain a strong reserve coverage ratio and will continue to aggressively write down problem loans. We remain committed to returning M&I to a level of solid credit quality and are hopeful that our declines in nonperforming loans, nonperforming loan inflows and early-stage delinquencies are all early indicators of achieving this goal, changing focus to the organic balance sheet trends compared to the same quarter in 2008. 
Fourth quarter 2009 average loans were $45 billion, which is $4.9 billion or 10% lower than the fourth quarter of 2008. C&I loans decreased on average by $2.2 billion or 14% as we are seeing lower line utilization and seasonal borrowing from existing customers than in prior years. Moving into 2010, we expect C&I balances to continue contracting until the economic recovery takes stronger hold. On a linked-quarter basis, C&I loans contracted $960 million or 6.8%. Across all of our Construction & Development categories, we have seen approximately $3.7 billion or 38% contraction since the fourth quarter of last year. This is consistent with our broader goal of reducing our total Construction & Development portfolio to less than 10% of total loans. At quarter end, Construction & Development loans accounted for 12.5% of total loans, down from a high of 22.6% in the third quarter of 2007.
Non-construction Commercial Real Estate loans increased on average by $1.6 billion or nearly 13% in comparison to the same quarter last year. This reflects the natural progression of projects to completion and lease up, most of which occurred earlier in 2009. On a linked quarter basis, loans in this category were essentially flat.
Commercial real estate volumes are soft in all categories reflecting the economy. This is translated to minimal investor activity in new construction projects with medical office being the least impacted. Lack of availability of any financing is significantly impacting this marketplace. Retail continues to soften as expected to do so through 2010 as many retailers have cut back expansion plans. Many retailers are demanding rent concessions on existing leases potentially impacting our customers. Office continues to soften in all markets. Job losses significantly impacted this segment in 2009 and are anticipated to do so in 2010. Hospitality softened with the economy in the second half of 2009 and is expected to remain soft. Together, these factors lead to our expectation that our non-construction Commercial Real Estate portfolio balances will be relatively flat for 2010. 
On the deposit side, we have seen good underlying dynamics this year with average deposit balances up nearly $1 billion versus the fourth quarter of 2008. Non-interest-bearing deposits increased $1.9 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase is attributable in part to low interest rate environment and continued confidence in M&I. As we have discussed before, we have reconfigured many of our deposit product offerings. The benefit of these changes are shown by the $1.6 billion of growth in savings deposits and a $1.6 billion of growth in NOW balances since the fourth quarter of last year. In addition, we have benefited from an improved deposit mix as our time balance have declined by over $2 billion.
A few final comments. As we move into the first quarter of 2010 and to reiterate comments made earlier, we expect our financial results to reflect the benefits of aggressive credit steps that we have taken, but also the challenges of broader financial markets. As you are aware, every economic cycle brings its own set of challenges. This economic cycle has been marked by rapid deterioration, followed by more recent stabilization in general economic conditions, a challenging and prolonged low interest rate environment, competitive pricing pressures on many loan and deposit products and a dramatic downturn in the national residential housing markets. As we move forward in this economic cycle, we will continue to benefit from the strength of our balance sheet, the dedication of our employees and the diversification of our franchise.

Number one, as the nonperforming loan trends improve, as well as new nonperforming loan formation continues to improve, that'll certainly just stem what's going into the pipeline. The other thing is I think that we would expect is going to help us out here is as home prices stabilize throughout the country, we're now finding our marks on ORE or loans held for sale, are holding up better. When you think about the type of price depreciation that we've had in housing over the last three years and the rapid descent of that, you could've had a piece of property that was well marked at the end of one quarter, but if you had the continuing trend of home prices going down, you would add an incremental mark the next quarter. So more stability in real estate prices is going to help us get the mark right the first time for the life of the loan, which therefore means the ORE expenses should come down."

In terms of our how we look at the deferred tax assets, certainly, as we've indicated before, as we came up to year end, we were going to have to give it a particularly thorough review. We have gone through that process and found that given where we are based on exactly the same types of fact pattern and logic that we've discussed on these calls in the past, continue to find that our deferred tax asset is an asset that does not require any valuation allowance against it.

And Minneapolis, nonperforming loans are a little bit higher, but again, we really like the fundamental trends we've seen there.

The St. Louis market, nonperforming loans in credit quality again slow sign of the economic downturn, and some of those signs of stress, but St. Louis and Indianapolis have both performed well through the cycle. In terms of our core Midwest markets, we see a little bit more stress in the Kansas City market. Just to be fair, that portfolio was a little bit more dependent on the construction category as well. But when you transition here just to general economic trends and in particular think about some of the Beige Book data that comes out for the Kansas City marketplace, generally, the economic downturn in many ways hasn't hit Kansas City as badly.

So we will see ours move up, but we don't expect we'll get near there. One of the reasons that we have that confidence is just because a borrower signs the paperwork that makes a loan renegotiated, if you will from a legal perspective, we don't change it in terms of our classifications until that borrower's current for three payments.

So we're down maybe, I guess, 6% in terms of earning assets. Where would you expect the balance sheet to trough? Or what sort of decline are we looking for in aggregate?"

We've already commented that we expect C&I loans to contract until the economy recovers. We've talked about CRE remaining kind of in the same ballpark that it's been in, although as Mark Hogan mentioned, these are largely amortizing loans in the Commercial Real Estate portfolio. And for the near term, we're going to continue selling one to four originations into the secondary market. If I had to hazard a guess, and it's not going to be a lot more than a guess, probably would expect that the balance sheet would continue contracting, but also begin rebounding in the course of 2010."

Again, and we did mentioned this earlier, we would expect those numbers to start coming down as a combination of the nonperforming loan formation and then just the impact of that going through the pipeline. It should help as well as there's just better stability on real estate-related prices in the market today. And that should -- if nothing else, just helps the accuracy, both the sustained accuracy over time in terms of our marks.
