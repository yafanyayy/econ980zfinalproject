Thank you for joining American Tower's conference call regarding our fourth quarter and full year 2009 financial results. Please note that we have posted a brief presentation to accompany this morning's call on our website, which is www.americantower.com. If you haven't done so already, you may want to download this presentation as we will refer to it at various times throughout our prepared remarks.The agenda for this morning's call will be as follows. First, I will provide an introduction and highlight certain key metrics on our fourth quarter and full year 2009 financial results. Following this, Tom Bartlett, our Chief Financial Officer, will go over our financial results in more detail and provide color on our 2010 outlook; and finally, Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, will then give closing remarks including his current thoughts in key business trends. As always after these remarks, we will open up the call for your questions.Before I begin, I'd like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include statements regarding our 2010 outlook, our stock repurchase program, our pending acquisition in India, our credit market conditions and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's press release and those set forth in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, and other fillings with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update this information contained in the call to reflect subsequently occurring events or circumstances. And with that, I will begin the call and highlight some of our results.Please turn to Slide 4 of the presentation for a summary of fourth quarter results, as well as our full year 2009 results compared against the year-ago period. With regards to our fourth quarter results, we reported total revenues of approximately $448 million, reflecting growth of 9.7% from the year-ago period. Tom will provide additional color on the core growth of our Rental and Management business, exuding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and straight-line accounting. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $308 million, which is 10.1% increase from the year-ago period. Our operating income for the quarter increased 15.5% to over $176 million. And income from continuing operations was approximately $64 million or $0.16 for both basic and diluted common share. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

I'm again pleased to report that American Tower continued its track record of consistently delivering strong revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth during the fourth quarter of 2009. Please turn to Slide 5 to revie",1903,"Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I'm again pleased to report that American Tower continued its track record of consistently delivering strong revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth during the fourth quarter of 2009. Please turn to Slide 5 to review some of the highlights. Our reported Rental and Management segment revenue growth was 10.4%. Our core growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and straight-line lease accounting, was 10.2% relative to the fourth quarter of 2008. In the U.S., our growth was supported by an overall increase in leasing demand from customers such as Clearwire, as they ramp up spending to deploy the first 4G data network in the U.S., and three of the four national carriers who continue to invest in their networks to prepare for and meet growing data demand. In addition, our International businesses delivered another solid quarter with revenue attributable to the our operations in Mexico, Brazil and India now accounting for over 17% of our Tower revenues.During the quarter, foreign currency translation became a tailwind for our results as the Mexican peso and Brazilian real both strengthened against the U.S. dollar relative to the fourth quarter of 2008. I'd also like to highlight that we had just under $3 million of net non-recurring revenue items in the quarter. In addition, we remain focused and disciplined while evaluating opportunities to selectively deploy our capital. We believe these investments will not only drive core growth in our portfolio, but also enhance our return on invested capital. Investment highlights during the quarter include the construction of over 350 towers across our portfolio. The construction of 10 inbuilding DAS networks and the acquisition of over 500 towers in India and the United States. So overall, we're very pleased with our strong finish to 2009.Turning to Slide 6, you can see from the chart on the upper left-hand side of the page that while our reported adjusted EBITDA growth was 10.1%, our core growth versus the fourth quarter of 2008 would have been 10.6% on a currency neutral basis and excluding the impacts of the straight-line lease accounting. The majority of our core growth has been supported by our legacy sites, which continue to generate solid levels of new business. As you know, we are also pursuing investments in new sites in the U.S. and abroad to augment our organic growth and to provide a strong foundation for growth. We are pleased to report that even including the cost relative to the 3,500 sites we added to the portfolio since the beginning of the year, our Adjusted EBITDA margin held steady and at industry-leading levels.Turning to Slide 7, we delivered approximately 24% and 25% recurring free cash flow and recurring free cash flow per share growth, respectively, in the quarter versus the year-ago period. This growth was primarily driven by the following: Our strong adjusted EBITDA core growth; lower capital expenditures, which are primarily a result of the completion of an international site redevelopment project which was winding down in the fourth quarter of 2008; and slightly lower cash taxes and interest expense. We believe that the investments we have made and will continue to make in our legacy and expansion markets, as well as in our stock repurchase program, will continue to drive future recurring free cash flow and recurring free cash flow per share growth.Turning to Slide 8, I'd like to briefly review three key highlights from our full year 2009 results. First, our core growth in both Tower revenue and adjusted EBITDA were approximately 10%, which is in line with our 2009 outlook. Second, in a year with challenging global macroeconomic trends, our business model showed resilience and delivered consistent growth. And finally, as we look to drive further shareholder value, we believe recurring free cash flow per share growth is a solid indicator of value creation, which we expect to be generated by the following sources: Our focus on driving core growth in adjusted EBITDA from our legacy, as well as expansion markets; our capital allocation strategy, which focuses on reinvesting in our core business through CapEx as well as through selective acquisitions; and our balance sheet, which we anticipate will provide us with access to attractive financing, enabling us to return our excess cash to our shareholders through our stock repurchase program and minimizing our exposure to cash taxes both in the U.S. as well as abroad. Looking to the future, while we are pleased with our recurring free cash flow growth in 2009, we do expect it to moderate to the mid-teens in 2010 as our recurring capital expenditures are expected to remain at levels comparable to 2009.Turning to Slide 9, our investments in 2009 remain consistent with our stated capital allocation strategy. We generated approximately $840 million of cash from operations and redeployed nearly all of it into either our existing sites, new sites or our stock repurchase program. Our 2009 capital expenditures of $250 million included discretionary capital spending of $179 million, of which $49 million was for land purchases and $127 million was for the construction of over 1,000 new sites. In addition, we spent $296 million to acquire over 2,500 new sites, with $215 million of our remaining cash flow used to fund our stock repurchase program. Our discretionary investments in 2009 specifically focused on pursuing portfolio growth opportunities. And I'm pleased to report that we were successful in Brazil and India where we've increased the size of our portfolios to over 1,600 and 2,600 sites, respectively. We expect that we will continue to focus on expanding our U.S. and existing international markets while potentially pursuing new markets where our communication site leasing expertise provides our customers with a strong value proposition. Turning to Slide 10, and before we get to our outlook for 2010, I'd like to highlight the areas we intend to focus on for the year. Our first priority is to drive strong top line sustainable revenue growth. To achieve this, our primary focus will be organic revenue growth, which we believe produces the highest incremental returns on our invested capital for our shareholders. We will also seek to augment our organic growth with selective asset acquisitions. This includes the transaction we announced this morning, whereby our Indian subsidiary has acquired approximately 4,500 sites from Essar to further strengthen our presence in India. In addition, operational excellence will continue to be a focus for our organization. Our teams are continually using Six Sigma methodologies to drive efficiencies in our processes to ultimately achieve cost savings. Meanwhile, we will also seek to invest in our infrastructure in 2010 to assure that we can scale to support our growth. Finally, we will continue to capitalize on our balance sheet to opportunistically raise additional funds to finance our future expansion plans or our stock repurchase program. All of our objectives are focused on driving long-term value creation for our shareholders.Turning to Slide 11, we're introducing our outlook for 2010. We expect our Rental and Management segment to produce about $140 million to $170 million of incremental revenue in 2010, which reflects a stronger site leasing environment than 2009, the full year contribution of the new sites added in 2009, as well as approximately 1,200 to 1,600 new sites, which we expect to construct during 2010, as well as our contractual lease escalations. Additionally, we completed a lease extension, as of the beginning of 2010, with one of our major U.S. customers, which will result in an overall increase in straight-line revenue for the year of about $14 million compared to 2009. In addition, our outlook reflects stronger currencies in Mexico, Brazil and India relative to their 2009 average levels. These positive impacts to growth are expected to be partially offset by a slightly higher than historical level of churn in 2010 from analog TV broadcasters in the U.S. and the impact of a wind down of a customer take-or-pay agreement in the United States. Please note that until we close our acquisition in India, we'll not include the impact of these new sites in our outlook. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, straight-line lease accounting and the material one item from 2009, which was a result of a broadcast customer termination fee we discussed in the last quarter, we expect core growth for Rental and Management segment revenue to be approximately 8% to 9% in 2010. Furthermore, our 2010 core revenue growth rate would be approximately 2% higher excluding the impacts of the broadcast analog churn in our take-or-pay agreement. Turning to adjusted EBITDA, we expect to generate about $80 million to $110 million of incremental adjusted EBITDA in 2010, which reflects a lower adjusted EBITDA conversion ratio than 2009. This is primarily attributable to cost and related past due revenue related to 3,500 new sites we added to our Rental and Management segment portfolio in 2009, as well as the construction of 1,200 to 1,600 new sites in 2010. Excluding the past due revenue and corresponding cost, our 2010 outlook conversion ratio would be approximately 10% higher. Additionally, we are making selective investments in SG&A, which we believe will better support our growth and expansion initiatives. We expect core growth for adjusted EBITDA to be approximately 6% to 8% in 2010. Finally, cash provided by operating activities is expected to increase $110 million to $140 million in 2010, which reflects the expected increase in adjusted EBITDA, as well as a benefit from our lower borrowing cost related to our recent investment grade issuance. Turning to Slide 12, I'd like to highlight some of our capital plans for 2010. With our cash on hand, plus our outlook for cash generated from operating activities, we will have access to over $1 billion of internally-generated funds available for investment. Our first priority is to redeploy this cash back into our business and to that extent, we anticipate that we will utilize approximately $300 million to $350 million in capital projects. Our outlook for CapEx reflects comparable levels of redevelopment, capital improvements and corporate capital expenditures versus 2009. We are forecasting $50 million for land purchases and $165 million to $205 million for other discretionary projects, including the construction of 1,200 to 1,600 new sites. Consequently, over 2/3 of our 2010 capital program is success-based. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we will also seek to add new tower assets to our portfolio via acquisitions. If we are unable to find transactions that meet our long-term risk-adjusted hurdle rates, we will return the capital to shareholders through our stock repurchase program.Turning to Slide 13 and in conclusion, we are focused on driving growth in our core business by investing in our existing sites, as well as new tower assets. We successfully reinvested approximately $550 million in 2009, and we'll have access to nearly $1 billion in internally-generated capital to seek out additional opportunities in 2010. We will continue to pursue expansion opportunities where we can replicate our site leasing best practices to drive strong value creation for our customers. Finally, our balance sheet further strengthens our foundation for growth. We believe we have the capacity within our stated leverage targets to pursue meaningful transactions that will drive long-term growth and return on invested capital and recurring free cash flow per share, which should in turn drive long-term shareholder value. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim."

As you just heard, we had a strong finish to 2009, with double-digit growth in both fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA. That performance is a real tribute to our dedicated employees in the U.S",1152,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone on the call. As you just heard, we had a strong finish to 2009, with double-digit growth in both fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA. That performance is a real tribute to our dedicated employees in the U.S., Mexico, Brazil and India. It's also a tribute to our customers who keep advancing the reach and capabilities of increasingly robust wireless service. Among our currently four served markets, our U.S. customers are driving most aggressively for providing ubiquitous and affordable wireless broadband data services. We believe that this will be a multi-year endeavor and so will underpin sustained demand for tower space in the United States for some time to come.Market research that we have commissioned indicates that domestic smartphone penetration doubled between year-end 2007 and 2009 and that it will double again between year-end 2009 and 2011. And at the same time, smartphone data usage per unit is also increasing substantially. The research shows that basic smartphones consume about 5x of data capacity of the average handset. However, advanced smartphones, such the iPhone and the Droid, consume upwards of 30x the data capacity of the average handset in a month.As the deployment of these super phones become more widespread, data demands on wireless networks will increase steadily over time. U.S. wireless carriers are stepping up to the challenge of delivering much higher mobile bandwidth to many more of their customers. For the carriers as an industry, facing this challenge and investing in the network is an imperative. Our projections are that the U.S. wireless industry will sustain relatively stable annual voice revenues in the $120 billion to $125 billion annual range over the next few years. Voice revenues therefore will continue to deliver sizable operating cash flows to carriers that they can reinvest in their businesses. But it also means that essentially, all wireless carrier industry revenue growth during this time will come from wireless data services.Both Verizon Wireless and AT&T Mobility recently reported that their fourth quarter wireless data revenues were up more than 26%. Both also indicated that their wireless capital expenditures will increase in 2010 due to elevated demand for smartphones and higher data usage. In addition, T-Mobile USA continues to invest in its 3G network build out and is partnering closely with Google to bring attractive broadband handsets to its customer base. From a tower industry perspective, it's important to note that for the next two to three years, a substantial amount of the additional super phone and data service demand from Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile subscribers must be met with 3G technology and spectrum, since 4G LTE handsets and widely-deployed network base stations won't be in place till then. As a result, we expect these major carriers to conduct substantial cell site equipment augmentation and cell splitting of their 3G networks, while also laying the groundwork for 4G coverage over the next few years.Another positive development for the tower industry has been Sprint Nextel's strategic decision to introduce 4G earlier to its customer base through its investment in Clearwire. Sprint Nextel recently announced an additional billion dollar investment in that venture, making a significant contribution to Clearwire's fully-funded business plan to reach 120 million covered pops. Additionally, Sprint Nextel also stated recently that it was increasing its 2010 capital investment in its own iDEN and CDMA 3G networks by as much as 25% over 2009. In sum, we believe that the major U.S. wireless carriers collective drive towards expanding broadband data services will result in 2010 commence [ph] new business on our existing towers to be at or above the levels we experienced in 2009. Also in 2009, our U.S. customers contributed 85% of our company's total revenue and also delivered the bulk of our $840 million plus of cash from operations. We expect this comps [ph] that it'll generate nearly a billion dollars in cash from operations in 2010. And our primary objective for this cash is to reinvest it  into our business at attractive rates of return for the benefit of our shareholders. So our investments in new tower construction, acquired portfolios of towers and new market entries will add to our new organic growth on our existing towers and to the escalation on existing contracts during the year that particular investment's made. But even more important is the long-term future effect of organic growth and escalation on the new assets. This is why in addition to our efforts in our flagship U.S. markets, we are actively seeking attractive investments in high-growth markets, such as Brazil and India. Given that these types of markets are at earlier stages in wireless penetration and especially in the adoption of broadband data, we believe that they will provide both strong growth in the short term and additional meaningful growth for an extended period into the future. Simply put, when we evaluate international investments, we consider both the magnitude and the likely duration of enhanced revenue growth opportunities for our company. We are very pleased, therefore, to announce our pending acquisition of the Essar tower business in India. We view this transaction as strategic for our India market, bringing American Tower to approximately 7,000 sites. The Essar portfolio further strengthens our position in the eastern portion of the country and has enabled us to achieve the scale for long-term success in the India tower market. The portfolio comes with 1.8 tenants on average per tower and is well positioned for further lease up. The transaction requires government approvals in India, which we hope to obtain within the next two to three months. And now before turning to your questions, I'll leave you with a few core beliefs held by our management team as we plan and execute our strategy for 2010 and beyond. First, we believe U.S. consumers strongly desire mobile broadband service and are increasingly using wireless devices for entertainment in addition to communications. Second, U.S. wireless carriers depend on broadband mobile data for growth and they have the conviction and the means to make the necessary investments to get there. Third, American Tower's existing U.S.-focused business, with its high operating margins, manageable and stable interest costs and relatively low maintenance and redevelopment CapEx, will generate very strong cash from operations. Fourth, our solid balance sheet and access to investment grade credit markets provide for further funding to expand the asset base in the U.S. and abroad. And finally, our management skills, operational excellence and systems we believe are extendable to high-growth international markets that meet our rigorous investment criteria. So in closing, we're looking forward to a great year, and we're counting down to 39 days until Gold Medal Mogul Skier, Hannah Kearney, throws out the first pitch at Fenway and the Red Sox chuck out their first win of the season against the soon-to-be former world champion, Yankees. Operator, Tom and I are ready for questions at this time."

I was wondering, is it changing anyway your relationship with your customers and the things they're asking for from you? And some of the things I'm thinking about are the time frames that they need to get on to the tower? Are you seeing an increasing interest in doing augmentations versus full new sites? Is there a stronger interest in towers that already have fiber backhaul going in Stanford [ph], for example?"

Generally, I think the drive to broadband is deepening our business relationship with most, if not all, of our customers on a couple of dimensions. One is your correct speed to deployment is important. That's something we've been focusing on for years in American Tower, as we've really dedicated our Six Sigma effort to a cycle-time reductions, both for new tower builds, new cell sites on existing towers and even to augmentations on existing cell sites on our towers. So that's some place where I think our investments have paid off and helped us with customers. On the second dimension, customers in some cases want us to do more, so we're beginning to expand the footprint of what we do for some of our customers including looking into, although not entering yet, helping bring or encouraging others to bring fiber to our particular sites. So that's the second dimension where customers would like a broader relationship with us. We're doing things as we've talked about like share generators and other activities to help with that. So I do think it's helpful. Augmentation versus new cell sites, Brett, doesn't necessarily depend on speed, it really depends on what the engineering decision is on the RF design. And so again, we need to be good at both and we think we are quite strong on cycle time and delivery performance on those."

And I would think, just from talking to some of the others in the industry, it seems like you're running to a lot more competition at this level as opposed to maybe the middle segment, where there's four or five operators where you'd run into a probably a less competitive process, just wondering, thinking about sort of the puts and takes there because it does seem like the strategy shifted in the U.S. a little bit. And then second, just quick question on the ground lease activity, just what prevents you from being sort of a larger player in this market in 2010?"

I'll start off and then Tom can follow up on both of those questions. First of all, on the domestic M&A, we've consistently participated in essentially every asset trade over the last years, since Spector [ph] sides, some had been big and some small. Some of the small ones, we've won were not sizable enough to report on individually but we have, over the years, acquired small of trisis [ph] of towers from third party or private equity-backed owners. None have risen to the side of Cincinnati Bell though, so that was one that was worth pointing out announcing. And frankly, we've used the same approach ever since Spector [ph] site on these smaller portfolios. And recently, we've been able to come out the winner at a couple of the key transactions that we've been involved with. Couple of reasons for that: One is, we have a durable balance sheet. We've had access to capital all through this time. And not only that, we've been able to reduce our cost to capital, which reduces our weighted average cost to capital that we use to assess what we're going to pay for assets. So I think, it's just another kind of an outcome of a steady strategy over time and up-and-down capital markets, where we can act when others perhaps can't, and we can be competitive in those time frames."

And think of market like the investment in Cincinnati Bell, even while we've had that, and we've only had that for six, eight weeks, the lease of activity in that asset has far exceeded what we actually thought it was going to be. So we like those doubles and triples and clearly, they're not the homeruns, but they're easy to absorb and they're easy to integrate into our business."

And if we can't hit our hurdle rate there, we just don't do the transactions. So we could buy more but we'd have to relax our standards and we're not willing to do that."

But kind of given current course and speed, that's what our kind of our forecast look like over the next couple of years. And we continue to evaluate the process of moving to a REIT. I think that, as you all know, our assets fit right squarely in the middle of what we qualify as a REIT. We have certain parts of our business that would be excluded. Some of the services type of activity in the United States. And with the international businesses, we're looking at kind of net asset values and how we might allocate capital in some of those areas to be able to hit some of those triggers. But this is a year that Jim and I are focused on getting through all of the homework, if you will, on both the tax side, as well as all the capital market elements to it. And that we are really looking at this as merely being a tax election. We want this to be a minimal impact on our overall business. So we want to make sure that we have ample cash to be able to reinvest in our business and to be able to achieve the kind of growth expectations that we have, ourselves, for our business. And there's nothing that we see right now that wouldn't allow us to be able to have access to that cash to be able to continue the growth expectations. So we're right kind of in the middle of it.

And in fact, this relates to Essar indirectly also and then those have been covering us for a few years may recall that I came out like two years ago now and suggested to the investor base that not only do we have a great U.S.-based business here, in American Tower, but we were also wanting to sort of turbocharge that business over the next three to five years with three or four new areas of business, whether be geographic or product line, that each might generate, say, on the order of $50 million of EBITDA a year. So we want to complement the sort of the growth core engine of the U.S., Mexico and Brazil businesses we had with some projects, if you will, Mike. So that's kind of what you're referring to. Domestically, we've chosen a path to be distributing antenna systems on a wider scale to complement our existing sites with generators and some other equipment. And again, we're just now scratching the surface on doing participated and kind of being back to fiber loops and such. So on that front, now we've built another 20 or so into our DAS systems recently. It's still about 1% of our revenue. We did complete our first Outdoor DAS system in the fourth quarter and we have customer up and running on that. There's 350, 400 nodes in the pipeline that we've got under contract in addition to that project, so we're up and running. We'd like to get that to the $50 million of EBITDA a year level. So you combine into an outdoor DAS, could [ph] it sum maybe 3% or 4%, maybe 5% of our revenue five years from now, we hope it could, but we're still at that 1% to 2% level, Mike, at this point. When you look at India then, we've gone from 1% of our revenue in 2009 coming from that country. To free Essar we would have predicted probably 3%. This year, a full year of Essar in our run rate business in India would be 6% to 7% of revenue, so now we're starting to get there. Those are the kind of programs that we're running and that's the stats of at least those two, Mike."

Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $308 million, which is 10.1% increase from the year-ago period. Our operating income for the quarter increased 15.5% to over $176 million. And income from continuing operations was approximately $64 million or $0.16 for both basic and diluted common share. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

I'm again pleased to report that American Tower continued its track record of consistently delivering strong revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth during the fourth quarter of 2009. Please turn to Slide 5 to revie",1907,"Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I'm again pleased to report that American Tower continued its track record of consistently delivering strong revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth during the fourth quarter of 2009. Please turn to Slide 5 to review some of the highlights. Our reported Rental and Management segment revenue growth was 10.4%. Our core growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and straight-line lease accounting, was 10.2% relative to the fourth quarter of 2008. In the U.S., our growth was supported by an overall increase in leasing demand from customers such as Clearwire, as they ramped up spending to deploy the first 4G data network in the U.S., and three of the four national carriers who continue to invest in their networks to prepare for and meet growing data demand. In addition, our International businesses delivered another solid quarter with revenue attributable to the our operations in Mexico, Brazil and India now accounting for over 17% of our Tower revenues.During the quarter, foreign currency translation became a tailwind for our results as the Mexican peso and Brazilian real both strengthened against the U.S. dollar relative to the fourth quarter of 2008. I'd also like to highlight that we had just under $3 million of net non-recurring revenue items in the quarter. In addition, we remain focused and disciplined while evaluating opportunities to selectively deploy our capital. We believe these investments will not only drive core growth in our portfolio, but also enhance our return on invested capital. Investment highlights during the quarter include the construction of over 350 towers across our portfolio. The construction of 10 inbuilding DAS networks and the acquisition of over 500 towers in India and the United States. So overall, we're very pleased with our strong finish to 2009.Turning to Slide 6, you can see from the chart on the upper left-hand side of the page that while our reported adjusted EBITDA growth was 10.1%, our core growth versus the fourth quarter of 2008 would have been 10.6% on a currency neutral basis and excluding the impacts of the straight-line lease accounting. The majority of our core growth has been supported by our legacy sites, which continue to generate solid levels of new business. As you know, we are also pursuing investments in new sites in the U.S. and abroad to augment our organic growth and to provide a strong foundation for growth. We are pleased to report that even including the cost relative to the 3,500 sites we added to the portfolio since the beginning of the year, our adjusted EBITDA margin held steady and at industry-leading levels.Turning to Slide 7, we delivered approximately 24% and 25% recurring free cash flow and recurring free cash flow per share growth, respectively, in the quarter versus the year ago period. This growth was primarily driven by the following: Our strong adjusted EBITDA core growth; lower capital expenditures, which are primarily a result of the completion of an international site redevelopment project which was winding down in the fourth quarter of 2008; and slightly lower cash taxes and interest expense. We believe that the investments we have made and will continue to make in our legacy and expansion markets, as well as in our stock repurchase program, will continue to drive future recurring free cash flow and recurring free cash flow per share growth.Turning to Slide 8, I'd like to briefly review three key highlights from our full year 2009 results. First, our core growth in both Tower revenue and adjusted EBITDA were approximately 10%, which is in line with our 2009 outlook. Second, in a year with challenging global macroeconomic trends, our business model showed resilience and delivered consistent growth. And finally, as we look to drive further shareholder value, we believe recurring free cash flow per share growth is a solid indicator of value creation, which we expect to be generated by the following sources: Our focus on driving core growth in adjusted EBITDA from our legacy, as well as expansion markets; our capital allocation strategy, which focuses on reinvesting in our core business through CapEx as well as through selective acquisitions; and our balance sheet, which we anticipate will provide us with access to attractive financing, enabling us to return our excess cash to our shareholders through our stock repurchase program and minimizing our exposure to cash taxes both in the U.S. as well as abroad. Looking to the future, while we are pleased with our recurring free cash flow growth in 2009, we do expect it to moderate to the mid teens in 2010 as our recurring capital expenditures are expected to remain at levels comparable to 2009.Turning to Slide 9, our investments in 2009 remain consistent with our stated capital allocation strategy. We generated approximately $840 million of cash from operations and redeployed nearly all of it into either our existing sites, new sites or our stock repurchase program. Our 2009 capital expenditures of $250 million included discretionary capital spending of $179 million, of which $49 million was for land purchases and $127 million was for the construction of over 1,000 new sites. In addition, we spent $296 million to acquire over 2,500 new sites, with $215 million of our remaining cash flow used to fund our stock repurchase program. Our discretionary investments in 2009 specifically focused on pursuing portfolio growth opportunities. And I'm pleased to report that we were successful in Brazil and India where we've increased the size of our portfolios to over 1,600 and 2,600 sites, respectively. We expect that we will continue to focus on expanding our U.S. and existing international markets while potentially pursuing new markets where our communication site leasing expertise provides our customers with a strong value proposition. Turning to Slide 10, and before we get to our outlook for 2010, I'd like to highlight the areas we intend to focus on for the year. Our first priority is to drive strong, top line, sustainable revenue growth. To achieve this, our primary focus will be organic revenue growth, which we believe produces the highest incremental returns on our invested capital for our shareholders. We will also seek to augment our organic growth with selective asset acquisitions. This includes the transaction we announced this morning, whereby our Indian subsidiary has agreed to acquire approximately 4,500 sites from Essar to further strengthen our presence in India. In addition, operational excellence will continue to be a focus for our organization. Our teams are continually using Six Sigma methodologies to drive efficiencies in our processes to ultimately achieve cost savings. Meanwhile, we will also seek to invest in our infrastructure in 2010 to assure that we can scale to support our growth. Finally, we will continue to capitalize on our balance sheet to opportunistically raise additional funds to finance our future expansion plans or our stock repurchase program. All of our objectives are focused on driving long-term value creation for our shareholders.Turning to Slide 11, we're introducing our outlook for 2010. We expect our Rental and Management segment to produce about $140 million to $170 million of incremental revenue in 2010, which reflects a stronger site leasing environment than 2009, the full year contribution of the new sites added in 2009, as well as approximately 1,200 to 1,600 new sites, which we expect to construct during 2010, as well as our contractual lease escalations. Additionally, we completed a lease extension, as of the beginning of 2010, with one of our major U.S. customers, which will result in an overall increase in straight-line revenue for the year of about $14 million compared to 2009. In addition, our outlook reflects stronger currencies in Mexico, Brazil and India relative to their 2009 average levels. These positive impacts to growth are expected to be partially offset by a slightly higher than historical level of churn in 2010 from analog TV broadcasters in the U.S. and the impact of a wind down of a customer take-or-pay agreement in the United States. Please note that until we close our acquisition in India, we'll not include the impact of these new sites in our outlook. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, straight-line lease accounting and the material one item from 2009, which was a result of a broadcast customer termination fee we discussed in the last quarter, we expect core growth for Rental and Management segment revenue to be approximately 8% to 9% in 2010. Furthermore, our 2010 core revenue growth rate would be approximately 2% higher excluding the impacts of the broadcast analog churn in our take-or-pay agreement. Turning to adjusted EBITDA, we expect to generate about $80 million to $110 million of incremental adjusted EBITDA in 2010, which reflects a lower adjusted EBITDA conversion ratio than 2009. This is primarily attributable to cost and related past due revenue related to 3,500 new sites we added to our Rental and Management segment portfolio in 2009, as well as the construction of 1,200 to 1,600 new sites in 2010. Excluding the past due revenue and corresponding cost, our 2010 outlook conversion ratio would be approximately 10% higher. Additionally, we are making selective investments in SG&A, which we believe will better support our growth and expansion initiatives. We expect core growth for adjusted EBITDA to be approximately 6% to 8% in 2010. Finally, cash provided by operating activities is expected to increase $110 million to $140 million in 2010, which reflects the expected increase in adjusted EBITDA, as well as a benefit from our lower borrowing cost related to our recent investment grade issuance. Turning to Slide 12, I'd like to highlight some of our capital plans for 2010. With our cash on hand, plus our outlook for cash generated from operating activities, we will have access to over $1 billion of internally-generated funds available for investment. Our first priority is to redeploy this cash back into our business and to that extent, we anticipate that we will utilize approximately $300 million to $350 million in capital projects. Our outlook for CapEx reflects comparable levels of redevelopment, capital improvements and corporate capital expenditures versus 2009. We are forecasting $50 million for land purchases and $165 million to $205 million for other discretionary projects, including the construction of 1,200 to 1,600 new sites. Consequently, over 2/3 of our 2010 capital program is success-based. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we will also seek to add new tower assets to our portfolio via acquisitions. If we are unable to find transactions that meet our long-term risk-adjusted hurdle rates, we will return the capital to shareholders through our stock repurchase program.Turning to Slide 13 and in conclusion, we are focused on driving growth in our core business by investing in our existing sites, as well as new tower assets. We successfully reinvested approximately $550 million in 2009, and we'll have access to nearly $1 billion in internally-generated capital to seek out additional opportunities in 2010. We will continue to pursue expansion opportunities where we can replicate our site leasing best practices to drive strong value creation for our customers. Finally, our balance sheet further strengthens our foundation for growth. We believe we have the capacity within our stated leverage targets to pursue meaningful transactions that will drive long-term growth and return on invested capital and recurring free cash flow per share, which should in turn drive long-term shareholder value. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim."

As you just heard, we had a strong finish to 2009, with double-digit growth in both fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA. That performance is a real tribute to our dedicated employees in the U.S",1150,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone on the call. As you just heard, we had a strong finish to 2009, with double-digit growth in both fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA. That performance is a real tribute to our dedicated employees in the U.S., Mexico, Brazil and India. It's also a tribute to our customers who keep advancing the reach and capabilities of increasingly robust wireless service.Among our currently four served markets, our U.S. customers are driving most aggressively for providing ubiquitous and affordable wireless broadband data services. We believe that this will be a multi-year endeavor and so will underpin sustained demand for tower space in the United States for some time to come.Market research that we have commissioned indicates that domestic smartphone penetration doubled between year-end 2007 and 2009 and that it will double again between year-end 2009 and 2011. And at the same time, smartphone data usage per unit is also increasing substantially. The research shows that basic smartphones consume about 5x of data capacity of the average handset. However, advanced smartphones, such the iPhone and the Droid, consume upwards of 30x the data capacity of the average handset in a month.As the deployment of these super phones become more widespread, data demands on wireless networks will increase steadily over time. U.S. wireless carriers are stepping up to the challenge of delivering much higher mobile bandwidth to many more of their customers. For the carriers as an industry, facing this challenge and investing in the network is an imperative. Our projections are that the U.S. wireless industry will sustain relatively stable annual voice revenues in the $120 billion to $125 billion annual range over the next few years. Voice revenues therefore will continue to deliver sizable operating cash flows to carriers that they can reinvest in their businesses. But it also means that essentially, all wireless carrier industry revenue growth during this time will come from wireless data services.Both Verizon Wireless and AT&T Mobility recently reported that their fourth quarter wireless data revenues were up more than 26%. Both also indicated that their wireless capital expenditures will increase in 2010 due to elevated demand for smartphones and higher data usage. In addition, T-Mobile USA continues to invest in its 3G network build out and is partnering closely with Google to bring attractive broadband handsets to its customer base. From a tower industry perspective, it's important to note that for the next two to three years, a substantial amount of the additional super phone and data service demand from Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile subscribers must be met with 3G technology and spectrum, since 4G LTE handsets and widely-deployed network base stations won't be in place till then. As a result, we expect these major carriers to conduct substantial cell site equipment augmentation and cell splitting of their 3G networks, while also laying the groundwork for 4G coverage over the next few years.Another positive development for the tower industry has been Sprint Nextel's strategic decision to introduce 4G earlier to its customer base through its investment in Clearwire. Sprint Nextel recently announced an additional billion dollar investment in that venture, making a significant contribution to Clearwire's fully-funded business plan to reach 120 million covered pops. Additionally, Sprint Nextel also stated recently that it was increasing its 2010 capital investment in its own iDEN and CDMA 3G networks by as much as 25% over 2009. In sum, we believe that the major U.S. wireless carriers collective drive towards expanding broadband data services will result in 2010 commence new business on our existing towers to be at or above the levels we experienced in 2009. Also in 2009, our U.S. customers contributed 85% of our company's total revenue and also delivered the bulk of our $840 million plus of cash from operations. We expect, as Tom said,  that it'll generate nearly a billion dollars in cash from operations in 2010. And our primary objective for this cash is to reinvest it  into our business at attractive rates of return for the benefit of our shareholders. So our investments in new tower construction, acquired portfolios of towers and new market entries will add to our new organic growth on our existing towers and to the escalation on existing contracts during the year that particular investment's made. But even more important is the long-term future effect of organic growth and escalation on the new assets. This is why in addition to our efforts in our flagship U.S. markets, we are actively seeking attractive investments in high-growth markets, such as Brazil and India. Given that these types of markets are at earlier stages in wireless penetration and especially in the adoption of broadband data, we believe that they will provide both strong growth in the short term and additional meaningful growth for an extended period into the future. Simply put, when we evaluate international investments, we consider both the magnitude and the likely duration of enhanced revenue growth opportunities for our company. We are very pleased, therefore, to announce our pending acquisition of the Essar tower business in India. We view this transaction as strategic for our India market, bringing American Tower to approximately 7,000 sites. The Essar portfolio further strengthens our position in the eastern portion of the country and has enabled us to achieve the scale for long-term success in the India tower market. The portfolio comes with 1.8 tenants on average per tower and is well positioned for further lease up. The transaction requires government approvals in India, which we hope to obtain within the next two to three months. And now before turning to your questions, I'll leave you with a few core beliefs held by our management team as we plan and execute our strategy for 2010 and beyond. First, we believe U.S. consumers strongly desire mobile broadband service and are increasingly using wireless devices for entertainment in addition to communications. Second, U.S. wireless carriers depend on broadband mobile data for growth and they have the conviction and the means to make the necessary investments to get there. Third, American Tower's existing U.S.-focused business, with its high operating margins, manageable and stable interest costs and relatively low maintenance and redevelopment CapEx, will generate very strong cash from operations. Fourth, our solid balance sheet and access to investment grade credit markets provide for further funding to expand the asset base in the U.S. and abroad. And finally, our management skills, operational excellence and systems we believe are extendable to high-growth international markets that meet our rigorous investment criteria. So in closing, we're looking forward to a great year, and we're counting down to 39 days until Gold Medal Mogul Skier, Hannah Kearney, throws out the first pitch at Fenway and the Red Sox chuck out their first win of the season against the soon-to-be former world champion, Yankees. Operator, Tom and I are ready for questions at this time."

I was wondering, is it changing anyway your relationship with your customers and the things they're asking for from you? And some of the things I'm thinking about are the time frames that they need to get on to the tower? Are you seeing an increasing interest in doing augmentations versus full new sites? Is there a stronger interest in towers that already have fiber backhaul going in Stanford [ph], for example?"

Generally, I think the drive to broadband is deepening our business relationship with most, if not all, of our customers on a couple of dimensions. One is your correct speed to deployment is important. That's something we've been focusing on for years in American Tower, as we've really dedicated our Six Sigma effort to a cycle-time reductions, both for new tower builds, new cell sites on existing towers and even to augmentations on existing cell sites on our towers. So that's some place where I think our investments have paid off and helped us with customers. On the second dimension, customers in some cases want us to do more, so we're beginning to expand the footprint of what we do for some of our customers including looking into, although not entering yet, helping bring or encouraging others to bring fiber to our particular sites. So that's the second dimension where customers would like a broader relationship with us. We're doing things as we've talked about like share generators and other activities to help with that. So I do think it's helpful. Augmentation versus new cell sites, Brett, doesn't necessarily depend on speed, it really depends on what the engineering decision is on the RF design. And so again, we need to be good at both and we think we are quite strong on cycle time and delivery performance on those."

None have risen to the side of Cincinnati Bell though, so that was one that was worth pointing out and announcing. And frankly, we've used the same approach ever since  SpectraSite on these smaller portfolios. And recently, we've been able to come out the winner at a couple of the key transactions that we've been involved with. Couple of reasons for that: One is, we have a durable balance sheet. We've had access to capital all through this time. And not only that, we've been able to reduce our cost to capital, which reduces our weighted average cost to capital that we use to assess what we're willing to pay for assets. So I think it's just another kind of an outcome of a steady strategy over time in up-and-down capital markets, where we can act when others perhaps can't, and we can be competitive in those time frames."

I think our cost of capital does give us a bit of an advantage in terms of some of those markets. And think of market like the investment in Cincinnati Bell, even while we've had that, and we've only had that for six, eight weeks, the lease of activity in that asset has far exceeded what we actually thought it was going to be. So we like those doubles and triples and clearly, they're not the homeruns. But they're easy to absorb and they're easy to integrate into our business."

We are again disciplined when it comes into investing in ground just like we're disciplined when it comes to investing in towers like we just been talking about. So the same kind of analytical process and rigor goes to the ground lease negotiation, which is a one-at-a-time individual negotiation that we have a pretty capable team doing with individual land owners across the country. And if we can't hit our hurdle rate there, we just don't do the transactions. So we could buy more, but we'd have to relax our standards and we're not willing to do that."

We expect and continue to expect them to expire into 2012 timeframe. I'm hopeful that we use the NOLs more quickly. But kind of given current course and speed, that's what our kind of our forecast look like over the next couple of years. And we continue to evaluate the process of moving to a REIT. I think that, as you all know, our assets fit right squarely in the middle of what we qualify as a REIT. We have certain parts of our business that would be excluded. Some of the services type of activity in the United States. And with the international businesses, we're looking at kind of net asset values and how we might allocate capital in some of those areas to be able to hit some of those triggers. But this is a year that Jim and I are focused on getting through all of the homework, if you will, on both the tax side, as well as all the capital market elements to it. And that we are really looking at this as merely being a tax election. We want this to be a minimal impact on our overall business. So we want to make sure that we have ample cash to be able to reinvest in our business and to be able to achieve the kind of growth expectations that we have, ourselves, for our business. And there's nothing that we see right now that wouldn't allow us to be able to have access to that cash to be able to continue the growth expectations. So we're right kind of in the middle of it. And as I said, I think we would expect to be more completed with the homework by the end of the year."

And in fact, this relates to Essar indirectly also and then those have been covering us for a few years may recall that I came out like two years ago now and suggested to the investor base that not only do we have a great U.S.-based business here in American Tower, but that we were also wanting to sort of turbocharge that business over the next three to five years with three or four new areas of business, whether be geographic or product line, that each might generate, say, on the order of $50 million of EBITDA a year. So we want to complement the sort of the growth core engine of the U.S., Mexico and Brazil businesses we had with some projects, if you will, Mike. So that's kind of what you're referring to. Domestically, we've chosen a path to be distributing antenna systems on a wider scale to complement our existing sites with generators and some other equipment. And again, we're just now scratching the surface on doing, participating and kind of being back to fiber loops and such. So on that front, now we've built another 20 or so into our DAS systems recently. It's still about 1% of our revenue. We did complete our first Outdoor DAS system in the fourth quarter and we have customer up and running on that. There's 350, 400 nodes in the pipeline that we've got under contract in addition to that project, so we're up and running. We'd like to get that to the $50 million of EBITDA a year level. So you combine into an outdoor DAS, could  it sum maybe 3% or 4%, maybe 5% of our revenue five years from now, we hope it could. But we're still at that 1% to 2% level, Mike, at this point. When you look at India then, we've gone from 1% of our revenue in 2009 coming from that country. Pre-Essar, we would have predicted probably 3%. This year, a full year of Essar in our run rate business in India would be 6% to 7% of revenue, so now we're starting to get there. Those are the kind of programs that we're running and that's the status of at least those two, Mike."

Following this, Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will deliver go over our financial results and provide an overview of our expectations for 2010.

You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.
Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's press release and those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 and in our other fillings with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. And with that, I will begin the call with some highlights from our first quarter 2010 results.
Please turn to Slide 4 of the presentation, which provides a summary of our first quarter 2010 results, compared against the year-ago period.
We reported total revenues of approximately $454 million, reflecting growth of 11.2% from the year-ago period. Tom will provide additional color on the core growth of our Rental and Management segment, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and straight-line lease accounting. 
Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was approximately $312 million, which is a 10.8% increase from the prior-year period. Additionally, our operating income for the quarter increased 19%, to nearly $179 million. Income from continuing operations was approximately $96 million or $0.24 per basic and diluted common share, attributable to American Tower Corporation. 
During the quarter, our effective tax rate was 22.7%, which reflects a year-over-year decline of over 17% and was primarily the result of the implementation of one of our tax-cutting initiatives in Latin America, which was discrete for the quarter.
For the full year 2010, we anticipate our effective tax rate will be approximately 40%. And now, I would like to turn the call to Tom, who will discuss our results in more detail."

I'm pleased to report that our first quarter 2010 results came in right on plan as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities for the year.
Please turn to Slide 5. And I'd like to begin with some highlights from our Rental and Management segment.
Overall, we reported Rental and Management segment revenue growth of 12.1%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and straight-line lease accounting, our core growth was 9.2% relative to the first quarter of 2009. Our reported revenue was negatively impacted by approximately 1.8% as a result of three discrete items, which we discussed last quarter including: First, incremental churn resulting from the sunset of some analog broadcast services; second, the wind down in the fourth quarter of 2009 of a take or pay agreement with one of our customers; and lastly, the completion of the amortization of a customer settlement, which wrapped up at the end of last year. Excluding the impact of these items, our core growth would've been over 11%.
In the U.S., core growth for Tower revenue was 8.8%, excluding the impact of these discrete items. We experienced a strong leasing environment during the quarter with signed new business up by nearly 40% from the same quarter of 2009. Our leasing demand was led by customers like Clearwire, AT&T and Verizon, who continue to invest in their networks as demand for data services grows.
Our solid performance in the U.S. was complemented by over a 25% core growth in revenues from our international markets. This is a result of our recent investments we made in both Brazil and India, plus the organic growth which our international portfolios are experiencing. For example, as of the first quarter, the average tenancy on our sites in India, nearly all of which have been acquired or constructed over the past 18 months, was approximately 1.5 tenants per tower. This rate illustrates this strong lease-up demand we are experiencing in India, which in fact are about 2x our other served markets. 
And finally, as I've previously highlighted on our year-end earnings call, we successfully completed a contract extension with one of our major U.S. customers. This extension was the primary driver of the $3.7 million increase in straight-line revenue from the year-ago period and a $6 million increase on a sequential basis from the fourth quarter of 2009.
Turning to Slide 6. I'd like to highlight the current distribution of our Rental and Management segment revenue, as well as our expectations regarding our sources of new business for 2010. 
We continue to generate approximately 83% of our Rental and Management segment revenue in the U.S., with the remaining 17% from our international markets. Pro forma for a pending transaction in India, revenue from our international markets will increase to about 21%.
We continue to expect that the sources of our new business in 2010 will be balanced across our diverse site portfolio. Specifically, our customers in the U.S. continue to invest in their 3G networks while planning for or deploying their initial 4G network overlays. This activity will also be complemented by Clearwire's aggressive rollout of WiMAX. 
Our international markets provide additional diversification with demand in 2010 coming from carriers such as Vodafone, Telefonica, Nextel International and Tata. Further, we expect that as spectrum auctions are completed in our international markets, many of our customers will further seek to invest in expanding their footprints as well as deploying 3G across their existing networks. These trends support our conviction that the leasing environment will be solid in 2010 as our international strategy continues to provide us with a complementary source of growth.
Turning to Slide 7. Our reported adjusted EBITDA growth from the first quarter of 2009 was 10.8%, with core growth of 8% on a currency-neutral basis and excluding the impacts of straight-line lease accounting. In addition, the impact of our discrete 2010 items, which I mentioned earlier, negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA growth by about 2.6%. Excluding these items, adjusted EBITDA core growth would have been well over 10%.
During the quarter, we maintained our adjusted EBITDA margins of 69%. We experienced a lower adjusted EBITDA conversion rate, which was a direct result of the following: First, the impact of pass-through revenue expense related to our international markets reduced our conversion rate by about 10%. Additionally, since the beginning of the first quarter of 2009, we've added nearly 4,000 new sites to our portfolio, which currently have gross margins of approximately 57% due to their average tenancy of approximately 1.3.
Of these new sites, approximately 1/3 were added in the U.S. and Latin America with the remainder related to our launch of operations in India. As we continue to increase the utilization of these sites, we expect their margins to approach our legacy portfolio levels. 
In addition during 2010, we continue to make selective investments in our regional overhead, systems and corporate functions, including professional services to provide guidance as we explore potential conversion to a restructure. We believe that these investments will position us well to help us scale and support our objective of generating significant, sustainable value for our shareholders.
As outlined in Slide 8. During the first quarter, we continued our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Specifically, we spent a total of $55 million on total capital expenditures, including $32 million of spending on discretionary capital projects, primarily related to the completion of 236 new sites and approximately $9 million on land purchases. We completed the acquisition of 164 sites in the United States for approximately $89 million. And we spent approximately $52 million to repurchase 1.2 million shares during the first quarter.
For the remainder of 2010, we expect to continue to ramp up new site investment in the United States and our existing international markets. Additionally, we continue to seek expansion opportunities in new markets, where we can exceed our risk-adjusted hurdle rates. As a baseline, the location must meet our international operational risk criteria, including favorable macroeconomic and political characteristics, and there must be a vibrant and competitive wireless market where co-location can add value to the deployment of wireless networks. Internationally, our risk adjusted return hurdle rates have been in the low- to mid-teens.
Turning to Slide 9. We delivered approximately 17% growth in both recurring free cash flow and recurring free cash flow per share in the quarter versus the year-ago period. This growth was primarily driven by the following: Our core growth in adjusted EBITDA; lower capital expenditures, which were primarily a result of an international site augmentation project, which was substantially completed in the first quarter of 2009; and the impact of our recent refinancing activities, which have lowered our interest expense and overall cost of debt. 
We are optimistic about our ability to capitalize on growth opportunities, deliver consistent operational results and reduce our diluted share count, all of which we believe will continue to drive recurring free cash flow and recurring free cash flow per share growth.
These trends, along with our recent investments and attractive discretionary projects, including the acquisitions we've made over the past five quarters, where we have targeted near 10% IRRs in the U.S. and low- to mid-teen IRRs in our international markets, have resulted in the consistent improvement in our return on invested capital, which today stands at 11%.
Turning to Slide 10. As a result of our performance to plan in the first quarter of 2010, we are reaffirming our 2010 outlook. This includes full year Rental and Management segment revenue of $1.81 billion to $1.84 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of approximately 9% to 10%; adjusted EBITDA $1.26 billion to $1.29 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 7% to 9%; and cash provided by operating activities of $950 million to $980 million, representing an increase of 13% to 17% over 2009. 
Please note that until we close our acquisition of Essar Telecom Infrastructure in India, we will not include the impact of these new sites in our outlook. But I will provide some details on our expectations for the portfolio in a few minutes.
Turning to Slide 11. I'd like to reiterate our expectations for revenue growth in our Rental and Management segment for 2010. We expect our Rental and Management segment to produce about $140 million to $170 million of incremental revenue in 2010, which reflects our contractual lease escalations, a stronger site leasing environment in 2009, the full year contribution of new sites added in 2009, as well as approximately 1,200 to 1,600 new sites, which we expect to construct during 2010.
The impact of customer churn is expected to be approximately 80 basis points higher than normal in 2010, which is specifically attributable to broadcast customers. We expected the majority of this activity will be completed during the first half of 2010 and then our churn will return to historic levels within the range of 1.5% to 2% annually going forward.
We have the two additional discrete items as I mentioned previously, including the take-or-pay agreement and customer settlement, which combined are negatively impacting our revenue growth in 2010 by approximately 1.1%.
Finally, we continue to expect an overall increase in straight line revenue for the year of $14 million compared to 2009, which is primarily the result of the customer lease extension we completed during the first quarter in the United States.  With respect to foreign exchange, our outlook reflects stronger currencies in Mexico, Brazil and India relative to their 2009 average levels.
Turning to Slide 12. We expect to generate about $80 million to $110 million of incremental adjusted EBITDA in 2010, which reflects a lower adjusted EBITDA conversion ratio than 2009 primarily attributable to the cost and related pass-through revenue related to more than the 3,500 new sites we added to our Rental and Management segment portfolio in 2009, as well as the construction of 1,200 to 1,600 new sites in 2010.
Additionally, we are making selective investments in SG&A, which we believe will better support our strategic operational and financial initiatives. These investments include staffing our India operations and DAS sales team in the United States, hiring select administrator functions to ensure we have the scale and breadth to pursue our growth initiatives, implementing common IT systems globally and finally, we are incurring costs related to the diligence work pertaining to our exploration of a REIT structure.
Turning to Slide 13. I'd like to highlight our investment profile for 2010. Through the combination of our outlook for cash provided by operations and anticipated incremental borrowing during the year, we will have access to nearly $1.5 billion of capital to deploy in 2010. 
Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we will first seek to invest this cash back into our current portfolio through our annual capital plan, which is currently expected to be between $300 million to $350 million. This includes the expected construction of between 1,200 and 1,600 new sites. In addition, to CapEx, we will seek to add new assets pursuing select acquisitions, which year-to-date account for approximately $519 million. This includes the $89 million spent in the first quarter for the 164 towers purchased in the United States, as well as our pending acquisition in India.
Finally, we expect to return our excess capital to shareholders via our stock repurchase program. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares for $52 million. We expect to increase the pacing of our share buybacks during the second quarter.
Turning to Slide 14. And in conclusion, I'd like to summarize a few key takeaways for the quarter. First, our first quarter results were on plan with total signed new business increasing approximately 40% from the year-ago period. Second, we remain disciplined and consistent with our investments in capital allocation strategy. 
In the first quarter, we added 400 sites to our portfolio primarily in the U.S. and India. Our current new build pipeline is robust and we expect it to ramp up towards the second half of 2010.
Third, we are currently progressing through the regulatory review process for our acquisition of the Essar Telecom towers. The transaction will support our strategy in India and we expect an IRR in line with our mid-teen targets hurdle rates. 
Pro forma for the transaction, approximately 6% of our Rental and Management segment revenue, will be attributable to our presence in India. Assuming a mid-year close, subject to the completion of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, the portfolio would add approximately $40 million to $45 million in revenues, $20 million to $25 million in tower cash flows and $15 million to $20 million in adjusted EBITDA to our 2010 results.
Our key focus in India, post-closing, will be to integrate the organization and drive strong organic growth on our existing tower sites.
Fourth, we continue to seek opportunities to expand our presence, including those end markets which we currently serve. Our first priority is to invest in the United States. However, we also have teams in various geographies, including Latin America, Asia and EMEA who are working with counterparties to explore acquisitions or build-to-suit opportunities.
Fifth, with respect to our balance sheet, we currently have approximately $975 million of liquidity. As a result, we expect we will begin to utilize a portion of our current financial capacity to increase the pacing of our share repurchases.
And finally, we will continue to monitor the capital markets to seek opportunistic transactions that lower our cost of debt in the ladder and extend our maturities. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim."

American Tower got off to a strong start in 2010, achieving our objectives for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and recurring free cash flow growth for the first quarter. We also continue to drive opportunities to add new assets that we believe will meet our return on investment criteria. We added 400 new sites in Q1, which increased the size of our portfolio to nearly 28,000.
As you can surmise from our actions, we strongly believe in the future of the Tower Leasing business and are continuing to seek attractive opportunities to further expand our asset base, both in the U.S, where we completed our most recent transactions and in selected international markets, as Tom said.
In American Tower, we're confident that the advancement of wireless communications and now entertainment to the next major stage is fully in progress. Processes at this stage of the wireless industry’s development can be measured in three dimensions: First, what are the effective transmission rates of wireless devices? Second, how many of those devices are in service and over what period of time are they being adopted? And third, in which markets are these devices being deployed?
As to the first question, device average transmission rates on the downlink are inexorably increasing from roughly 500 kilobits a second at 2.5G. to one megabit per second at 3G, to about three megabits per second for upgraded 3G and on to five to 10 megabits per second at 4G.
As for the second question of device penetration, deployment of these advanced handsets in the U.S. is increasing rapidly. Our research indicates in the range of about 30% basic 3G or better Smartphone penetration, currently. And that's going to be growing to the range of 60%, we think, over the next three years.
In addition, network demand generated by these Smartphones will be further augmented with their growing adoption of faster mobile computing devices, such as USB modems, embedded chip modems and tablet-type devices. I just got my 3G iPad yesterday.
As for the third question of geography, the U.S. and other developed markets are in the midst of this technology migration today. With the U.S. being perhaps the most vibrant developed market per share of wireless infrastructure providers like us. 
Moreover, we also believe that many emerging markets are at earlier stages of a similar deployment curve that we're seeing in the U.S. now. Consequently, we expect to see similar developments in advanced wireless communications and entertainment in countries such as Mexico, Brazil and India. And these will be beginning to ramp up during the next few years.
Given the trends in device speeds, the rapidly expanding number of these high-speed devices and the global geographic pattern of their deployment, we're taking an active approach to capturing as much of the related infrastructure demand as we can. While at the same time, we're maintaining our disciplined return on investment criteria. And so to capture the optimal amount of growth opportunities while simultaneously enhancing returns, we're taking a balanced approach on a number of dimensions.
For example, we seek to balance out our customer lease duration, so that we extend renewal dates into the future and limit the proportion of renewals that occur in any given year. These lease extensions often come with an increase in straight-line revenue, which we explicitly identify for you each quarter. 
We also seek to balance out our underlying ground leases, by either extending their termination dates well into the future or by buying the land outright. And within that, we further balance our land management program by applying our return on investment discipline to land purchase decisions versus capital leases.
We also have a balanced approach to investments in new assets. We're very active in pursuing M&A opportunities in both the U.S. and overseas. For example, we are expanding the resources and management time dedicated to pursuing small acquisitions in the U.S., along with any large portfolios if and when they become available here. Similarly, we put in place regionally-based teams and are committing management time also to evaluate and pursue additional assets in both our existing and potentially new international markets. 
We believe that this opens up a much wider horizon of investment opportunities, from which we can choose the most attractive, based on our risk-adjusted return criteria. I would offer that American Tower has developed a capability to assess, negotiate and integrate wireless infrastructure assets on a global basis as a true core competency of our company.
Our balanced approach to growth and returns is reflected in our recent allocations of capital. In 2009, we deployed over $750 million on behalf of you, our shareholders. About 40% was invested in acquisitions, about 33% to our capital expense program and the balance was returned to our investors via our share repurchase program.
Similarly in the first quarter of 2010, we deployed nearly $200 million, about 45% for acquisitions, 28% for CapEx and about 27% for buybacks.  Optimal capital allocation is a top priority for Tom and I. And we continually adjust the balance to achieve what we calculate to deliver the best long-term results for the company and for our investors. 
And so in order to accomplish this, we also take a balanced approach to our capital structure. We strive to maintain efficient access to capital to fund our aspirations for asset growth, while also providing attractive returns on equity for our investors. We believe that our target financial leverage range of three to 5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA provides this balance. We seek to further reduce financial risk by actively extending debt maturities and by laddering these maturities over time. 
Within our capital structure, we also take a balanced approach of the types of financial instruments that we employ. Of our $4.2 billion in debt, approximately 42% is securitized today, 25% is unsecured bank debt at the holding company level, and 33% is in the form of unsecured bonds, also at the holding company.
And as we take this active approach to optimizing our capital allocation and capital structure, we also place great emphasis on getting the best performance we can out of our existing assets. For example, we continue to work with each of our major customers on how we can better synchronize our operational processes with theirs and how to best invest our capital to support their strategic objectives, thereby improving our revenue growth prospects.
We're also enhancing things like IT systems that can enable direct customer visibility via the web into our lease processing pipeline and to provide online site applications on the internet, to name just one other of our operational focus areas.
To do all this requires a great team of people and I'm fortunate to be working with a terrific management team, and motivated, enthusiastic folks throughout our organization. Many of whom will be enjoying the upcoming Red Sox sweep of the Yankees this weekend. So thanks to everyone for joining in the call today. And operator, you can now open the line for questions at this time."

Don't forget, we did just give guidance about a month and a half ago. So we had pretty good visibility in terms of what the first quarter was going to be. So I don't think it's unexpected in terms of what the sign was or even the commence was, which was in the 15% and the 20% with new builds. So I think with regards to the transaction in India that will add the $40 million to $45 million and the incremental EBITDA. So from that standpoint, although we're not including it in guidance because we haven't concluded the deal -- because we hadn't haven't concluded the deal as of yet, we would consider that expected assuming that we do close the deal for the balance of the year. With regards to the kind of the capital allocation, the way we're looking at this allocation has been consistent for a number of years now. Our Tower builds, we believe, average in the 14% to 16% IRR ranges. The acquisitions that we're doing, IRR is in the low teens. The U.S. they're around a 10% range. But offshore, they're in the 14% to 15% range. So I think we feel really good about the kind of IRRs that we're able to generate there. In terms of some of the multiples, you may see some of the larger multiples on some of the larger deals, but there are a number of other transactions that you may not have as much visibility into where the multiples aren't quite as high. And as we produce more cash, then we're able to reinvest back into the business, we feel it is best to return to the shareholders via our buyback programs as our leverage ratios are optimized. So again, we're going to stay right down the middle in terms of what our allocation programs is. And as we say, we feel good about the IRRs we're generating both in builds as well as on the acquisitions."

Again, the vast majority of this touch screen phone and new tablets, et cetera, is going to be carried by necessity on 3G networks for the next few years. In advance of the next trend of growth, you're right, LTE is starting to be deployed, certainly by one national carrier and in trial a little bit beyond that by a second national carrier. And of course, when you talk about LTE, I think you do need to round out Sprint Nextel's play here, which is just a different chip technology that Clearwire is deploying on their behalf. So let me take those in two pieces. A traditional LTE deployment again, getting into your phased approach point, is going to happen and generally it’s three phases: The first one, Mike, that we talked about in the past is that there'll be certain markets that a signal will be put in place to cover that territory. That signal is not necessarily designed to carry much, if any, traffic. Once Phase 1 is completed then handsets and devices can be sold in those markets. Trends go up, of course, in usage and penetration. And then you get into Phase 2, which is sort of filling in the coverage holes and meeting the demand. And then once you get large numbers of penetration of these technology devices, you're going to have to handle a lot better coverage quality and you're going to have to handle a lot more capacity. So as you sort of suggested, Verizon, we think is, and they’ve said, is most of the way through Phase 1 in certain markets of the country. And so they're going to have a multi-year deployment plan. It's going to definitely be included in their CapEx spending for the next few years at an increasing level, I would imagine, vis-à-vis 3G. And then AT&T, based on the schedule they've announced will follow along after that. And of course, Clearwire right now is one of the largest spenders on network deployments in the country and they're in full swing. And you can probably consider them a sort of a Phase 2 program because of the schedule they have. So hopefully that helps a little bit, but we think this is going to be again another set of demands that feather in over the next few years for Tower space."

Current course and speed, we would expect to utilize all the NOLs probably by the middle of 2012. Hopefully, we'll beat that and accelerate more quickly. But right now, kind of current course and speed is looking at the middle of 2012. We're continually moving down the path on a number of different fronts within the evaluation of the REIT. The first thing is that we’re just about ready to apply for a Private Letter Ruling with the IRS, which will connect all the I’s and the Ts. And while we think that our Tower assets are right down the middle in terms of what qualifies as a REIT, we want to make sure of it. Secondly, we are now in the middle of our kind of earnings and profits evaluation and E&P study that we need to do to determine if there will be any purging dividend, if you will, right prior to us moving to a REIT. And we continue to through all the due diligence work internally, looking at all of our MLAs and all of our assets to be well positioned to move into a REIT. So while we have a year and half, if you will, before we ran out of our NOLs, we want to make sure that we’re doing all of our homework right up front. With regards to the international assets, the way we're thinking about that is that most of our international assets, if not all, would fall into the taxable REIT subsidiary status. There are asset tests and income tests, as you well know, in a REIT structure. And we think that our international assets would fit nicely within the TRS structure, as well as perhaps other services that we're doing even within the United States that may not qualify as qualified REIT income."

We want to make sure that we extend the relationship as long as we can and don't have any sort of towers of lease terminations that might happen in any given year, et cetera. So those are constant discussions going on. We try to align all the interests and make adjustments to our master lease agreements once it's the right time to do that. Secondly to SkyTerra, it is certainly real. It's got a financial backer and it's got spectra. When we expect to get a commenced lease it depends on four things: One is the spectra being available. The second is not only the investor, but the full funding, as you said, needs to be in place. The third thing is a business plan that other investors can believe in over time and it is credible, which we're anticipating seeing hopefully from SkyTerra, but haven't necessarily yet in complete form. And then finally, you got to have as a carrier OEM and device selections, handsets and suppliers that are willing to support the spectrum you have and the business model that you're talking about.

Examples of these statements include statements regarding our 2010 outlook, our stock repurchase program, our pending acquisition of Essar Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.
Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's press release and those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 and in our other fillings with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. And with that, I will begin the call with some highlights from our first quarter 2010 results.
Please turn to Slide 4 of the presentation, which provides a summary of our first quarter 2010 results, compared against the year-ago period.
We reported total revenues of approximately $454 million, reflecting growth of 11.2% from the year-ago period. Tom will provide additional color on the core growth of our Rental and Management segment, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and straight-line lease accounting. 
Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was approximately $312 million, which is a 10.8% increase from the prior-year period. Additionally, our operating income for the quarter increased 19%, to nearly $179 million. Income from continuing operations was approximately $96 million or $0.24 per basic and diluted common share, attributable to American Tower Corporation. 
During the quarter, our effective tax rate was 22.7%, which reflects a year-over-year decline of over 17% and was primarily the result of the implementation of one of our tax-cutting initiatives in Latin America, which was discrete for the quarter.
For the full year 2010, we anticipate our effective tax rate will be approximately 40%. And now, I would like to turn the call to Tom, who will discuss our results in more detail."

And I'd like to begin with some highlights f",2266,"Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that our first quarter 2010 results came in right on plan as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities for the year.
Please turn to Slide 5. And I'd like to begin with some highlights from our Rental and Management segment.
Overall, we reported Rental and Management segment revenue growth of 12.1%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and straight-line lease accounting, our core growth was 9.2% relative to the first quarter of 2009. Our reported revenue was negatively impacted by approximately 1.8% as a result of three discrete items, which we discussed last quarter including: First, incremental churn resulting from the sunset of some analog broadcast services; second, the wind down in the fourth quarter of 2009 of a take or pay agreement with one of our customers; and lastly, the completion of the amortization of a customer settlement, which wrapped up at the end of last year. Excluding the impact of these items, our core growth would've been over 11%.
In the U.S., core growth for Tower revenue was 8.8%, excluding the impact of these discrete items. We experienced a strong leasing environment during the quarter with signed new business up by nearly 40% from the same quarter of 2009. Our leasing demand was led by customers like Clearwire, AT&T and Verizon, who continue to invest in their networks as demand for data services grows.
Our solid performance in the U.S. was complemented by over a 25% core growth in revenues from our international markets. This is a result of our recent investments we made in both Brazil and India, plus the organic growth which our international portfolios are experiencing. For example, as of the first quarter, the average tenancy on our sites in India, nearly all of which have been acquired or constructed over the past 18 months, was approximately 1.5 tenants per tower. This rate illustrates this strong lease-up demand we are experiencing in India, which in fact are about 2x our other served markets. 
And finally, as I've previously highlighted on our year-end earnings call, we successfully completed a contract extension with one of our major U.S. customers. This extension was the primary driver of the $3.7 million increase in straight-line revenue from the year-ago period and a $6 million increase on a sequential basis from the fourth quarter of 2009.
Turning to Slide 6. I'd like to highlight the current distribution of our Rental and Management segment revenue, as well as our expectations regarding our sources of new business for 2010. 
We continue to generate approximately 83% of our Rental and Management segment revenue in the U.S., with the remaining 17% from our international markets. Pro forma for a pending transaction in India, revenue from our international markets will increase to about 21%.
We continue to expect that the sources of our new business in 2010 will be balanced across our diverse site portfolio. Specifically, our customers in the U.S. continue to invest in their 3G networks while planning for or deploying their initial 4G network overlays. This activity will also be complemented by Clearwire's aggressive rollout of WiMAX. 
Our international markets provide additional diversification with demand in 2010 coming from carriers such as Vodafone, Telefonica, Nextel International and Tata. Further, we expect that as spectrum auctions are completed in our international markets, many of our customers will further seek to invest in expanding their footprints, as well as deploying 3G across their existing networks. These trends support our conviction that the leasing environment will be solid in 2010 as our international strategy continues to provide us with a complementary source of growth.
Turning to Slide 7. Our reported adjusted EBITDA growth from the first quarter of 2009 was 10.8%, with core growth of 8% on a currency-neutral basis and excluding the impacts of straight-line lease accounting. In addition, the impact of our discrete 2010 items, which I mentioned earlier, negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA growth by about 2.6%. Excluding these items, adjusted EBITDA core growth would have been well over 10%.
During the quarter, we maintained our adjusted EBITDA margins of 69%. We experienced a lower adjusted EBITDA conversion rate, which was a direct result of the following: First, the impact of pass-through revenue expense related to our international markets reduced our conversion rate by about 10%. Additionally, since the beginning of the first quarter of 2009, we've added nearly 4,000 new sites to our portfolio, which currently have gross margins of approximately 57% due to their average tenancy of approximately 1.3.
Of these new sites, approximately 1/3 were added in the U.S. and Latin America with the remainder related to our launch of operations in India. As we continue to increase the utilization of these sites, we expect their margins to approach our legacy portfolio levels. 
In addition during 2010, we continue to make selective investments in our regional overhead, systems and corporate functions, including professional services to provide guidance as we explore potential conversion to a restructure. We believe that these investments will position us well to help us scale and support our objective of generating significant, sustainable value for our shareholders.
As outlined in Slide 8, during the first quarter, we continued our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Specifically, we spent a total of $55 million on total capital expenditures, including $32 million of spending on discretionary capital projects, primarily related to the completion of 236 new sites and approximately $9 million on land purchases. We completed the acquisition of 164 sites in the United States for approximately $89 million. And we spent approximately $52 million to repurchase 1.2 million shares during the first quarter.
For the remainder of 2010, we expect to continue to ramp up new site investment in the United States and our existing international markets. Additionally, we continue to seek expansion opportunities in new markets, where we can exceed our risk-adjusted hurdle rates. As a baseline, the location must meet our international operational risk criteria, including favorable macroeconomic and political characteristics, and there must be a vibrant and competitive wireless market where co-location can add value to the deployment of wireless networks. Internationally, our risk adjusted return hurdle rates have been in the low- to mid-teens.
Turning to Slide 9. We delivered approximately 17% growth in both recurring free cash flow and recurring free cash flow per share in the quarter versus the year-ago period. This growth was primarily driven by the following: Our core growth in adjusted EBITDA; lower capital expenditures, which were primarily a result of an international site augmentation project, which was substantially completed in the first quarter of 2009; and the impact of our recent refinancing activities, which have lowered our interest expense and overall cost of debt. 
We are optimistic about our ability to capitalize on growth opportunities, deliver consistent operational results and reduce our diluted share count, all of which we believe will continue to drive recurring free cash flow and recurring free cash flow per share growth.
These trends, along with our recent investments and attractive discretionary projects, including the acquisitions we've made over the past five quarters, where we have targeted near 10% IRRs in the U.S. and low- to mid-teen IRRs in our international markets, have resulted in the consistent improvement in our return on invested capital, which today stands at 11%.
Turning to Slide 10. As a result of our performance to plan in the first quarter of 2010, we are reaffirming our 2010 outlook. This includes full year Rental and Management segment revenue of $1.81 billion to $1.84 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of approximately 9% to 10%; adjusted EBITDA $1.26 billion to $1.29 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 7% to 9%; and cash provided by operating activities of $950 million to $980 million, representing an increase of 13% to 17% over 2009. 
Please note that until we close our acquisition of Essar Telecom Infrastructure in India, we will not include the impact of these new sites in our outlook. But I will provide some details on our expectations for the portfolio in a few minutes.
Turning to Slide 11. I'd like to reiterate our expectations for revenue growth in our Rental and Management segment for 2010. We expect our Rental and Management segment to produce about $140 million to $170 million of incremental revenue in 2010, which reflects our contractual lease escalations, a stronger site leasing environment in 2009, the full year contribution of new sites added in 2009, as well as approximately 1,200 to 1,600 new sites, which we expect to construct during 2010.
The impact of customer churn is expected to be approximately 80 basis points higher than normal in 2010, which is specifically attributable to broadcast customers. We expected the majority of this activity will be completed during the first half of 2010 and then our churn will return to historic levels within the range of 1.5% to 2% annually going forward.
We have the two additional discrete items as I mentioned previously, including the take-or-pay agreement and customer settlement, which combined are negatively impacting our revenue growth in 2010 by approximately 1.1%.
Finally, we continue to expect an overall increase in straight line revenue for the year of $14 million compared to 2009, which is primarily the result of the customer lease extension we completed during the first quarter in the United States.  With respect to foreign exchange, our outlook reflects stronger currencies in Mexico, Brazil and India relative to their 2009 average levels.
Turning to Slide 12. We expect to generate about $80 million to $110 million of incremental adjusted EBITDA in 2010, which reflects a lower adjusted EBITDA conversion ratio than 2009 primarily attributable to the cost and related pass-through revenue related to more than the 3,500 new sites we added to our Rental and Management segment portfolio in 2009, as well as the construction of 1,200 to 1,600 new sites in 2010.
Additionally, we are making selective investments in SG&A, which we believe will better support our strategic operational and financial initiatives. These investments include staffing our India operations and DAS sales team in the United States, hiring select administrator functions to ensure we have the scale and breadth to pursue our growth initiatives, implementing common IT systems globally and finally, we are incurring costs related to the diligence work pertaining to our exploration of a REIT structure.
Turning to Slide 13. I'd like to highlight our investment profile for 2010. Through the combination of our outlook for cash provided by operations and anticipated incremental borrowing during the year, we will have access to nearly $1.5 billion of capital to deploy in 2010. 
Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we will first seek to invest this cash back into our current portfolio through our annual capital plan, which is currently expected to be between $300 million to $350 million. This includes the expected construction of between 1,200 and 1,600 new sites. In addition, to CapEx, we will seek to add new assets pursuing select acquisitions, which year-to-date account for approximately $519 million. This includes the $89 million spent in the first quarter for the 164 towers purchased in the United States, as well as our pending acquisition in India.
Finally, we expect to return our excess capital to shareholders via our stock repurchase program. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares for $52 million. We expect to increase the pacing of our share buybacks during the second quarter.
Turning to Slide 14. And in conclusion, I'd like to summarize a few key takeaways for the quarter. First, our first quarter results were on plan with total signed new business increasing approximately 40% from the year-ago period. Second, we remain disciplined and consistent with our investments in capital allocation strategy. 
In the first quarter, we added 400 sites to our portfolio primarily in the U.S. and India. Our current new build pipeline is robust and we expect it to ramp up towards the second half of 2010.
Third, we are currently progressing through the regulatory review process for our acquisition of the Essar Telecom towers. The transaction will support our strategy in India and we expect an IRR in line with our mid-teen targets hurdle rates. 
Pro forma for the transaction, approximately 6% of our Rental and Management segment revenue, will be attributable to our presence in India. Assuming a mid-year close, subject to the completion of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, the portfolio would add approximately $40 million to $45 million in revenues, $20 million to $25 million in tower cash flows and $15 million to $20 million in adjusted EBITDA to our 2010 results.
Our key focus in India, post-closing, will be to integrate the organization and drive strong organic growth on our existing tower sites.
Fourth, we continue to seek opportunities to expand our presence, including those end markets which we currently serve. Our first priority is to invest in the United States. However, we also have teams in various geographies, including Latin America, Asia and EMEA who are working with counterparties to explore acquisitions or build-to-suit opportunities.
Fifth, with respect to our balance sheet, we currently have approximately $975 million of liquidity. As a result, we expect we will begin to utilize a portion of our current financial capacity to increase the pacing of our share repurchases.
And finally, we will continue to monitor the capital markets to seek opportunistic transactions that lower our cost of debt in the ladder and extend our maturities. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim."

American Tower got off to a strong start in 2010, achieving our objectives for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and recurring free cash flow growth for the first quarter. We also continue to drive opportunities to add new assets that we believe will meet our return on investment criteria. We added 400 new sites in Q1, which increased the size of our portfolio to nearly 28,000.
As you can surmise from our actions, we strongly believe in the future of the Tower Leasing business and are continuing to seek attractive opportunities to further expand our asset base, both in the U.S, where we completed our most recent transactions and in selected international markets, as Tom said.
In American Tower, we're confident that the advancement of wireless communications and now entertainment to the next major stage is fully in progress. Processes at this stage of the wireless industry’s development can be measured in three dimensions: First, what are the effective transmission rates of wireless devices? Second, how many of those devices are in service and over what period of time are they being adopted? And third, in which markets are these devices being deployed?
As to the first question, device average transmission rates on the downlink are inexorably increasing from roughly 500 kilobits a second at 2.5G. to one megabit per second at 3G, to about three megabits per second for upgraded 3G and on to five to 10 megabits per second at 4G.
As for the second question of device penetration, deployment of these advanced handsets in the U.S. is increasing rapidly. Our research indicates in the range of about 30% basic 3G or better Smartphone penetration, currently. And that's going to be growing to the range of 60%, we think, over the next three years.
In addition, network demand generated by these Smartphones will be further augmented with their growing adoption of faster mobile computing devices, such as USB modems, embedded chip modems and tablet-type devices. I just got my 3G iPad yesterday.
As for the third question of geography, the U.S. and other developed markets are in the midst of this technology migration today. With the U.S. being perhaps the most vibrant developed market per share of wireless infrastructure providers like us. 
Moreover, we also believe that many emerging markets are at earlier stages of a similar deployment curve that we're seeing in the U.S. now. Consequently, we expect to see similar developments in advanced wireless communications and entertainment in countries such as Mexico, Brazil and India. And these will be beginning to ramp up during the next few years.
Given the trends in device speeds, the rapidly expanding number of these high-speed devices and the global geographic pattern of their deployment, we're taking an active approach to capturing as much of the related infrastructure demand as we can. While at the same time, we're maintaining our disciplined return on investment criteria. And so to capture the optimal amount of growth opportunities while simultaneously enhancing returns, we're taking a balanced approach on a number of dimensions.
For example, we seek to balance out our customer lease duration, so that we extend renewal dates into the future and limit the proportion of renewals that occur in any given year. These lease extensions often come with an increase in straight-line revenue, which we explicitly identify for you each quarter. 
We also seek to balance out our underlying ground leases, by either extending their termination dates well into the future or by buying the land outright. And within that, we further balance our land management program by applying our return on investment discipline to land purchase decisions versus capital leases.
We also have a balanced approach to investments in new assets. We're very active in pursuing M&A opportunities in both the U.S. and overseas. For example, we are expanding the resources and management time dedicated to pursuing small acquisitions in the U.S., along with any large portfolios if and when they become available here. Similarly, we put in place regionally-based teams and are committing management time also to evaluate and pursue additional assets in both our existing and potentially new international markets. 
We believe that this opens up a much wider horizon of investment opportunities, from which we can choose the most attractive, based on our risk-adjusted return criteria. I would offer that American Tower has developed a capability to assess, negotiate and integrate wireless infrastructure assets on a global basis as a true core competency of our company.
Our balanced approach to growth and returns is reflected in our recent allocations of capital. In 2009, we deployed over $750 million on behalf of you, our shareholders. About 40% was invested in acquisitions, about 33% to our capital expense program and the balance was returned to our investors via our share repurchase program.
Similarly in the first quarter of 2010, we deployed nearly $200 million, about 45% for acquisitions, 28% for CapEx and about 27% for buybacks.  Optimal capital allocation is a top priority for Tom and I. And we continually adjust the balance to achieve what we calculate to deliver the best long-term results for the company and for our investors. 
And so in order to accomplish this, we also take a balanced approach to our capital structure. We strive to maintain efficient access to capital to fund our aspirations for asset growth, while also providing attractive returns on equity for our investors. We believe that our target financial leverage range of three to 5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA provides this balance. We seek to further reduce financial risk by actively extending debt maturities and by laddering these maturities over time. 
Within our capital structure, we also take a balanced approach of the types of financial instruments that we employ. Of our $4.2 billion in debt, approximately 42% is securitized today, 25% is unsecured bank debt at the holding company level and 33% is in the form of unsecured bonds, also at the holding company.
And as we take this active approach to optimizing our capital allocation and capital structure, we also place great emphasis on getting the best performance we can out of our existing assets. For example, we continue to work with each of our major customers on how we can better synchronize our operational processes with theirs and how to best invest our capital to support their strategic objectives, thereby improving our revenue growth prospects.
We're also enhancing things like IT systems that can enable direct customer visibility via the Web into our lease processing pipeline and to provide online site applications on the Internet, to name just one other of our operational focus areas.
To do all this requires a great team of people and I'm fortunate to be working with a terrific management team, and motivated, enthusiastic folks throughout our organization. Many of whom will be enjoying the upcoming Red Sox sweep of the Yankees this weekend. So thanks to everyone for joining in the call today. And, operator, you can now open the line for questions at this time."

So I don't think it's unexpected in terms of what the sign was or even the commence was, which was in the 15% and the 20% with new builds. So I think with regards to the transaction in India that will add the $40 million to $45 million and the incremental EBITDA. So from that standpoint, although we're not including it in guidance because we haven't concluded the deal -- because we hadn't haven't concluded the deal as of yet, we would consider that expected assuming that we do close the deal for the balance of the year. With regards to the kind of the capital allocation, the way we're looking at this allocation has been consistent for a number of years now. Our Tower builds, we believe, average in the 14% to 16% IRR ranges. The acquisitions that we're doing, IRR is in the low teens. The U.S. they're around a 10% range. But offshore, they're in the 14% to 15% range. So I think we feel really good about the kind of IRRs that we're able to generate there. In terms of some of the multiples, you may see some of the larger multiples on some of the larger deals, but there are a number of other transactions that you may not have as much visibility into where the multiples aren't quite as high. And as we produce more cash, then we're able to reinvest back into the business, we feel it is best to return to the shareholders via our buyback programs as our leverage ratios are optimized. So again, we're going to stay right down the middle in terms of what our allocation programs is. And as we say, we feel good about the IRRs we're generating both in builds as well as on the acquisitions."

I mean spectrum auctions historically, wherever they’ve been accomplished, have led to usually one or both of the following: which are either new entrants coming in and building networks or existing carriers adding technologies and faster speeds to what the networks they already have. We think that's going to happen in Mexico, Brazil and India because there are 3G designated bands of spectrum being auctioned in all three countries this year. Auctions tend to take longer than everyone thinks. We expect that there will be spectrum awarded in 2010 in all three markets and processes are ongoing, as you know, in a couple of those already. And by the end of this year, there'll be lots of network planning going on. The winners of the auctions will know who they are. Those who didn't win will know who they are. And they'll be planning for deployments in 2011, which is a timeframe we think we'll see material commencements of leases that then hit our revenue based on these auctions."

Again, the vast majority of this touch screen phone and new tablets, et cetera, is going to be carried by necessity on 3G networks for the next few years. In advance of the next trend of growth, you're right, LTE is starting to be deployed, certainly by one national carrier and in trial a little bit beyond that by a second national carrier. And of course, when you talk about LTE, I think you do need to round out Sprint Nextel's play here, which is just a different chip technology that Clearwire is deploying on their behalf. So let me take those in two pieces. A traditional LTE deployment again, getting into your phased approach point, is going to happen and generally it’s three phases: The first one, Mike, that we talked about in the past is that there'll be certain markets that a signal will be put in place to cover that territory. That signal is not necessarily designed to carry much, if any, traffic. Once Phase 1 is completed then handsets and devices can be sold in those markets. Trends go up, of course, in usage and penetration. And then you get into Phase 2, which is sort of filling in the coverage holes and meeting the demand. And then once you get large numbers of penetration of these technology devices, you're going to have to handle a lot better coverage quality and you're going to have to handle a lot more capacity. So as you sort of suggested, Verizon, we think is, and they’ve said, is most of the way through Phase 1 in certain markets of the country. And so they're going to have a multi-year deployment plan. It's going to definitely be included in their CapEx spending for the next few years at an increasing level, I would imagine, vis-à-vis 3G. And then AT&T, based on the schedule they've announced will follow along after that. Of course, Clearwire right now is one of the largest spenders on network deployments in the country and they're in full swing. And you can probably consider them a sort of a Phase 2 program because of the schedule they have. So hopefully that helped a little bit, but we think this is going to be again another set of demands that feather in over the next few years for tower space."

Current course and speed, we would expect to utilize all the NOLs probably by the middle of 2012. Hopefully, we'll beat that and accelerate more quickly. But right now, kind of current course of speed looking at the middle of 2012. We're continually moving down the path on a number of different fronts within the evaluation of the REIT. The first thing is that we’re just about ready to apply for a Private Letter Ruling with the IRS, which will connect all the Is and the Ts. And while we think that our Tower assets are right down the middle in terms of what qualifies as a REIT, we want to make sure of it. Secondly, we are now in the middle of our kind of earnings and profits evaluation and E&P study that we need to do to determine if there will be any purging dividend, if you will, right prior to us moving to a REIT. And we continue to move through all the due diligence work internally, looking at all of our MLAs and all of our assets to be well positioned to move into a REIT. So while we have a year and a half, if you will, before we ran out of our NOLs, we want to make sure that we’re doing all of our homework right up front. With regards to the international assets, the way we're thinking about that is that most of our international assets, if not all, would fall into the taxable REIT subsidiary status. There are asset tests and income tests, as you well know, in a REIT structure. And we think that our international assets would fit nicely within the TRS structure, as well as perhaps other services that we're doing even within the United States that may not qualify as qualified REIT income."

Secondly to SkyTerra, it is certainly real. It's got a financial backer and it's got spectra. When we expect to get a commenced lease it depends on four things: One is the spectra being available. The second is not only the investor, but the full funding, as you said, needs to be in place. The third thing is a business plan that other investors can believe in over time and it is credible, which we're anticipating seeing hopefully from SkyTerra, but haven't necessarily yet in complete form. And then finally, you got to have as a carrier OEM and device selections, handsets and suppliers that are willing to support the spectrum you have and the business model that you're talking about.

With regards to the other discrete items in the quarter, I think you would expect them to be pretty well spread out throughout the year, a little bit more in the first half of the year and then winding down into the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. But pretty well and evenly spread throughout the year."

The agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: I will provide a brief introduction and highlight certain key metrics from our second quarter 2010 financial results. Following this, Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will go over our financial results and provide an additional overview of our expectations for 2010; and finally, Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, will give closing remarks including his current thoughts on key industry trends. After these comments, we'll open up the call for your questions.
To maximize participation during the Q&A portion of the call, we kindly ask that you limit your question to no more than two parts. If you do have more than two questions or if you think of additional question, feel free to add yourself back to the queue and we'll do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the allotted time. 
Before I begin, I would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding our 2010 outlook, our stock repurchase program, our pending acquisition of Essar Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's press release and those set forth in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, and our other fillings with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. And with that, I would like to begin the call with some highlights from our second quarter 2010 results.
Please turn to Slide 4 of the presentation which provides a summary of our second quarter 2010 results compared against the year-ago period. We reported total revenues of approximately $470 million reflecting growth of 11% from the year-ago period. Tom will provide additional color on the core growth of our Rental Management segment, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and straight-line lease accounting. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was approximately $321 million, which is an 11.7% increase from the year-ago period. Additionally, our operating income for the quarter increased over 13% nearly $189 million. Income from continuing operations including income from non-controlling interest with approximately $100 million or $0.25 per basic and diluted common share, attributable to American Tower Corporation.
During the quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.3%, which reflects a year-over-year decline of over 17% and was primarily the result of two items, including a foreign earnings and profit study, which created a 2.8% benefit related to the U.S. taxable income that has been predicated on original earnings and profit estimate and a 13.3% benefit triggered by the reassessment of the realized ability of certain acquired NOLs, based on formal studies that were completed during the quarter. Both items were discrete to the quarter and for the full year, 2010, we currently anticipate our effective tax rate will be approximately 33%.  
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Tom, who will discuss our results in more detail."

I'm pleased to report that our second quarter 2010 results came in right on plan as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities for the year. If you'll please turn to Slide 5, I'd like to begin with some",2207,"Thanks, Leah, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that our second quarter 2010 results came in right on plan as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities for the year. 
If you'll please turn to Slide 5, I'd like to begin with some highlights from our Rental and Management segment. Overall, we reported Rental and Management segment revenue growth of 12.2%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and straight-line lease accounting, our core growth was 8.6% relative to the second quarter of 2009 with foreign exchange positively impacting our reported results by 1.4% and straight-line positively impacting our reported results by 2.2%. 
Additionally, and as I highlighted on our last call, three discrete items will continue to impact our results during 2010. These items include the impact of broadcast analog churn, the completion of a customer take-or-pay agreement, and a customer settlement, which combined, negatively impact our reported revenue by about 1.7%. So excluding the impact of these items, our core growth would have been over 10%.  In the U.S., core growth for Tower revenue was 8.4%, excluding the impact of these discrete items. During the quarter, we continued to experience a strong leasing environment with signed new business up by approximately 10% and commenced new business up approximately 25% relative to the same quarter of 2009. Our solid performance in the U.S. was complemented by over a 21% core growth in revenues from our international markets.
And finally, our results include a year-over-year increase of approximately $9.8 million in straight-line revenue, which reflect a contract extension with one of our major U.S. customers from the beginning of 2010, which we highlighted for you during our first quarter call, and the impact of a new agreement with our largest customers in Latin America which contributed to the year-over-year increase and one of the primary driver of the sequential increase in straight-line revenue for the quarter of about $5.3 million.
Turning to Slide 6. Our reported adjusted EBITDA growth relative to the second quarter of 2009 was 11.7% with core growth of 7.2% on a currency neutral basis and excluding the impacts of straight-line lease accounting. In addition, the impact of our discrete 2010 items, which I mentioned earlier, negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA growth by about 2.4%. So excluding these items, adjusted EBITDA core growth would have been about 9.6%.
During the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 68%. Our adjusted EBITDA conversion rate was about 72%, which was a direct result of the following. Some pass-through revenue and expense related to our international markets, negatively impacted our conversion rate by over 10%. And additionally, since the beginning of the second quarter of 2009, we've added over 4,100 new sites to our portfolio, which currently have gross margins of about 57% due to our average tenancy of approximately 1.3%.  As we continue to increase the utilization of these sites, we expect their margins will approach our legacy portfolio levels.
Excluding the impact of both past due revenue and the new sites, we have added over the past 12 months, our EBITDA conversion rate would have been in excess of 90%. In addition, during 2010, we have continued to make selective investments in our regional overhead systems and corporate functions. We've made substantial progress in our corporate initiatives year-to-date and continue to focus on our key projects which include our ongoing due diligence on a possible REIT conversion, as well as IT projects such as their global implementation of common financial systems. Please note, corporate expense for the second quarter of 2010 also include at about $1 million of accrued severance costs. 
As outlined in Slide 7, during the second quarter, we continued our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Specifically, we spent about $77.5 million on total capital expenditures, including $47 million of spending on discretionary capital projects, primarily related to the completion of 237 new sites and about $18 million on land purchases. In addition, we completed the acquisition of 36 sites in the United States and a 113 sites in Chile for a total of about $44 million. And finally, rounding out our capital deployment for the quarter and consistent with our previously announced plans to increase the pacing of our share repurchase program, we nearly tripled our buyback pacing and accordingly spent approximately $145 million to repurchase 3.5 million shares during the second quarter.
I'd like to spend a moment on our recent launch of operations in Chile. A few weeks ago, we issued a press release outlining our agreement to purchase approximately 287 sites from Telefónica, closing on 113 sites during the quarter. We are excited about our development team's recent success, and I'd like to highlight for you some of the key reasons for our investment and expansion into Chile. 
First, Chile currently is one of the strongest macroeconomic environment in Latin America, which should provide us with a solid foundation in which to invest. Second, Chile has a vibrant and competitive wireless market where customers in our existing Latin American market already conduct business today. Third, our recent spectrum auction placed 3G spectrum into the hands of a new entrant, VTR, and an existing incumbent, Nextel International, both of which are expected to deploy meaningful amount of capital to build nationwide 3G networks in Chile over the next couple of years. And finally, the government has already indicated its interest in auctioning additional spectrum for 4G deployments, possibly in late 2011, which we'll provide further opportunities for organic growth. Simply put, we're excited about our new market and expect to add through new site construction and select acquisitions to further build our portfolio, our expansion into Chile will over time provide a nice compliment to our existing Latin American markets with return hurdles that are consistent with our other Latin American markets. We also were to continue to pursue additional expansion opportunities in other complementary Latin American markets.
Turning to Slide 8. We delivered approximately 23% growth in both recurring free cash flow and recurring free cash flow per share in the quarter versus the same period last year. This growth was primarily driven by the following: our core growth and adjusted EBITDA, lower redevelopment and maintenance capital spending, and an income tax refund of approximately $9 million which we received during the second quarter. Our year-to-date performance and recurring free cash flow has exceeded our expectations. We continue though to expect mid-teen annual growth and recurring free cash flow for the year largely due to the increased interest expense resulting from the planned acquisition of the towers from Essar. These trends, along with our recent investments and attractive discretionary projects including the acquisitions we made over the past five quarters, have resulted in a consistent improvement in our return on invested capital, which today stands at 11.3%.
Turning to Slide 9. As a result of our performance being unplanned during the first half of 2010, our recent and pending acquisitions, year-to-date customer contract extensions and our new agreement with our largest customers in Latin America, we've updated our 2010 outlook. A few of the highlights include: we've increased the midpoint of our full year Rental and Management segment revenue outlook by $40 million and consequently our range to $1.85 billion to $1.88 billion, which now represents year-over-year growth of approximately 11% to 13%. We've increased the midpoint of our full year adjusted EBITDA outlook by $20 million and accordingly our range to $1.28 billion to $1.31 billion which now represents year-over-year growth of 8% to 11%.  And finally, we've increased the midpoint of our full year cash provided by operating activities outlook by $10 million and its corresponding range to $960 million to $990 million, which now represents an increase of 14% to 18% over 2009. Please note our outlook estimates reflect our acquisitions during the quarter, as well as the 63 communication tower sites in the United States we most recently purchased in July and the company's pending acquisition of approximately 450 communication tower sites from Essar Telecom, which we expect will close during the quarter.
Turning to Slide 10. I'd like to discuss the key drivers that have resulted in our increase in 2010 outlook for Rental and Management segment revenue. As I mentioned previously, we're increasing our expectations for our Rental and Management segment revenue by $40 million at the midpoint, which is primarily a result of four key items: The core business continues to perform in line with plan, our recent and pending acquisitions, which includes our acquisition of Essar's towers in India, which we will expect will close during the quarter; customer contract extensions primarily in the U.S.; and a new agreement with our largest customer in Latin America, which was finalized during the second quarter.
Turning to Slide 11. We've also increased our 2010 outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $20 million at the midpoint, which in addition to the items discussed with respect to revenue, is a result of the lower adjusted EBITDA margins on our recently completed or pending acquisitions, which is primarily a result of our acquisition in India or approximately one third of the current revenue relates to past due fuel costs. And as a result, we currently estimate we'll have initial adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 40% to 45%. And approximately $5 million of additional cost, primarily as a result of greater than originally anticipated development opportunities, is our pipeline for opportunities continues to grow.
Turning to Slide 12. I'd like to highlight our current investment profile for 2010. Through the combination of our outlook for cash provided by operations, an incremental borrowing required to end the year at our targeted 3.5x net debt to last 12 months adjusted EBITDA, we will have access to over $1.5 billion of capital to deploy in 2010. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we will first seek to invest this cash back into our current portfolio through our annual capital plan, which is currently expected to be between $300 million to $350 million. This includes the expected construction of between 1,200 and 1,600 new sites and the purchase of approximately $50 million of land under our towers. 
In addition to CapEx, we will seek to add new assets to our portfolio for pursuing select acquisitions, which together with pending acquisitions accounts for over $600 million year-to-date and includes approximately $430 million from our pending acquisition of roughly 4,450 sites in India from Essar. And finally, we continue to expect that we will return our excess capital to shareholders via our stock repurchase program. 
During the second quarter and consistent with our previous statements, we increased the pacing of our share repurchase program, and accordingly repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares for about $145 million. Year-to-date, we have spent approximately $196 million on our share repurchase program, and we'll manage the pacing of the program during the third quarter to continue to move our net leverage towards our year-end target of 3.5x net debt to last 12 months adjusted EBITDA. With our target of 3.5x net debt as of year end, we currently estimate that the remaining capacity for investment in 2010 is about $530 million, which we expect will be allocated consistent with our capital allocation strategy.
And turning to Slide 13 and in conclusion, I'd like to summarize a few key takeaways for the quarter. Our second quarter results were right on plan with solid performance supported by year-over-year improvements in both signed and commenced new business. We remain disciplined and consistent with respect to our investments and capital allocation strategy. In the second quarter, we added 386 sites to our portfolio, primarily in the U.S., India and Chile. In addition, excluding the Essar acquisition, we have added over 4,300 new sites to our portfolio since the beginning of 2009. 
We have received all necessary regulatory approvals for our acquisition of Essar Telecom and expect that the transaction will close during the third quarter. Our key focus in India, post-closing, will be on integration and driving strong organic growth on our existing tower sites. We continue to seek opportunities to expand our presence, including those in which we currently serve. As we previously mentioned, our first priority is to invest in the United States. However, we also have teams in various geographies including Latin America, Asia and EMEA who are working with counter parties to explore acquisitions who are built-to-suit opportunities. 
With respect to our balance sheet, we currently have approximately $925 million of liquidity. And as a result, we expect we will continue to utilize a portion of our current financial capacity to continue the pacing of our share repurchase program as we work our way towards our year-end target of 3.5x. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we drew down approximately $350 million of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which we will use to fund our cash obligations in connection with our acquisition of Essar's towers. Pro forma for acquisition, our 2Q '10 net debt to EBITDA was 3.3x. And finally, we will continue to monitor the capital markets to seek opportunistic transactions that lower our cost of debt. And ladder and extend our maturities. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim."

Our strong second quarter results show the Tower business model is driving as the wireless communications industry transitions to delivering true broadband data services to consumers.",2004,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call today. Our strong second quarter results show the Tower business model is driving as the wireless communications industry transitions to delivering true broadband data services to consumers. 
At American Tower, we continue to be excited about both the current and future prospects for our industry and for our company. We're confident that the robust advancement of high-speed wireless data services will continue. First in developed markets such as the U.S., followed by developing economies around the world. A number of key trends support this conclusion. Let's first consider handsets. 
Global handset sales were up 13% in the second quarter suggesting that wireless growth is back on track in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Moreover, major handset manufacturers, including Nokia, Samsung, Motorola, Sony Ericsson, RIM [Research In Motion] and Apple are emphasizing Smartphone investments and the sales opportunities that they bring to drive their future growth. 
And there's plenty of offsite for the deployment of Smartphones. Even in the U.S. and Western Europe, Smartphone shipments were just 30% of all handsets. And in developing markets, in the EMEA region, Asia and Latin America, the proportion of handset shipments that were Smartphones was only 10%. With the handset manufacturers focus on Smartphone unit growth, prices should come down and choices to consumers should increase. Thereby, leading to greater penetration of Smartphones in both the U.S. and internationally. 
The U.S. is the leading market with respect to innovation in wireless and consumer readiness for Smartphones and carriers are reporting shortages of their most high-end handset offerings, such as AT&T's Apple iPhone 4, Verizon's Droid and Sprint's HTC EVO 4G. Consumer demand for faster wireless data services is proving to be voracious, and a competitive mobile broadband platform is essential for any wireless carriers continued success over time. Consequently, we believe there'll be even greater burdens on wireless networks to deliver the new level of service that Smartphone owners are demanding. 
Substantial investments in 3G and now 4G technologies are being made by carriers in order to meet this demand. Fortunately, for both the wireless carriers and for the tower industry, consumer are willing to pay for these enhanced services. As a result, wireless data is now the primary growth engine for U.S. carrier revenues. 
In the second quarter, AT&T, Verizon increase data revenues by 27% and 24%, respectively. Both carriers in turn reaffirmed their commitment to significant levels of capital investment to further develop these types of services while also increasing the proportion of overall corporate CapEx devoted to wireless. In addition, Sprint announced that it has been adding new CDMA sites to its network this year and T-Mobile continues to deploy its upgrade to its current 3G system.
And looking ahead from 3G to 4G, each carrier has restated their plans to support next-generation investments. In Sprint's case, to the support of Clearwire. At Verizon, the launch of LTE markets in the second quarter of 2010. And at AT&T, the launch of 4G markets beginning in 2011. Moreover, MetroPCS and LightSquared have announced their own LTE market launches starting in 2010 and 2011 as well. 
Once again, taking a more global view, 3G penetration in Western Europe and the U.S. is only now approaching about 40% of subscribers. Indicating significant additional subscribers and network requirements to come over the next few years for 3G and with the onset of 4G at scale to follow. Developing markets in the EMEA region, Asia and Latin America are only at the nation's stage of 3G penetration and only approximately the 5% range in those places. 
We anticipate that there will be terrific future potential in these types of markets for wireless data. In addition, the compelling handsets and ongoing network investments, another key factor in the development of 3G and 4G data services is the availability of sufficient spectrum. Overall in the U.S., the three largest carriers, AT&T, Verizon and Sprint, through its relationship with Clearwire, appear to have sufficient spectrum to deliver today's expected levels of service at current penetration rates. But both the wireless carrier community and the U.S. government are looking ahead to open more spectrum for advanced wireless services. The recent government clearance of spectrum for use by LightSquared is an example of these efforts. And both the FCC and the Obama administration are working towards making additional spectrum available over the next few years.
Many developing markets are right now in the process of ensuring availability of sufficient spectrum for a competitive advanced data services for their consumers. In fact, new 3G spectrum is being made available in all four of our international markets, Mexico, Brazil, Chile and India. We believe that this new spectrum, combined with the financial strength of the leading carriers in each of these markets and lower cost Smartphone handsets are being developed will lead to the deployment of high-speed data networks at all of our served markets over the course of the coming years. Given this three strong global trends in wireless, proliferation of affordable Smartphone, wireless carrier investment plans and additional spectrum availability, we at American Tower, are very pleased with our strategic position. 
In the U.S., all four of the national carriers, Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile, are in the midst of a multi-year upgrade cycle. That is, each is in the process of deploying additional equipment primarily on towers to deliver wireless data services. And substantial part, Verizon and AT&T are currently utilizing amendments to existing cell site leases for 3G and 4G equipment while also splitting 3G cells for capacity and/or coverage. 
American Tower is in a strong position to garner Amendment business from both AT&T and Verizon as approximately 20% of those carriers respective cell sites reside on our towers. Sprint is now adding net subscribers and it's also adding some new sites. Additionally, Sprint is also deploying its next-generation 4G service capability via Clearwire. 
We also expect additional new co-location business in the 2011 timeframe from smaller regional carriers and from the LightSquared venture. So these are contingent on sufficient funding. Given American Tower's portfolio of over 20,000 locations in the United States, we are also positioned well to catch a significant share of new cell site installations on our towers. While the U.S. market is the foundation of American Tower's business, delivering over 80% of our second quarter Tower revenue, we're putting substantial effort into building a framework for complementary international expansion. We found that to earn the credibility and the local market knowledge to engage in significant transactions and with the highest-quality counter parties, it doesn't take months, it takes years. 
In Latin America, we've established a track record of operational credibility and staying power over a 10-year period in Mexico and over nine years in Brazil. We serve multi-market carriers in both those countries such as América Móvil, Telefónica and Nextel International. The value of our track record and market reputation was demonstrated by our recent agreement to acquire nearly 300 towers in Telefónica in Chile, and we hope to extend the success in the region through additional opportunities. 
In India, we've had teams on the ground for three years and I'll be making my sixth visit to the market in a couple of weeks. By investing time and resources in that region, American Tower has gained a relevant place in the market, and we're now in a final process of closing our third acquisition, which will bring our tower count in India to over 7,000 sites. Given the inherent growth in the Indian wireless industry, we've experienced co-location rates there, there about double that of the U.S. Which we believe will contribute to healthy returns on our investment and region over time. 
Our overall goal, as a management team, is to combine unmatched market knowledge, both domestically and internationally, with our financial strength to make superior capital allocation decisions on your behalf. As Tom mentioned, our first priority is to fund our CapEx programs for the year. For each tower that we build or augment and each Distributed Antenna Systems that we install, has both the credit-worthy anchor tenant and solid prospects for the future leasing growth. Each project is judged on its own merits individually and this holds true for land purchases as well. 
We also applied a disciplined approach to tower portfolio acquisitions, be they large or small. There are two types of acquisitions, third-party independent tower operators and carrier tower portfolios. Key decision criteria for third-party acquisitions includes the quality of the tower and ground space design, nature of existing lease contracts, the revenue per tower, future leasing prospects and many others. And criteria for carrier-owned tower portfolios also include the viability and market position of the selling carrier and the rates and terms of that carriers willing to commit to in the attached master list agreements since the seller, of course, is the primary lease customer on this portfolio. Each tower deal is therefore, different and a simple comparison of multiples is often invalid. We believe that there's no one better at judging the value of a tower portfolio than our regional and senior executive teams.
In any given year, our objective to deploy the cash generated from operations. Which for 2010 at American Tower is expected to approach $1 billion plus the proceeds for many additional debt capacity generated by our growth in EBITDA. Roughly an additional $400 million to $500 million each year. We wanted to deploy this funds to new assets that meet our investment requirements. However, we don't lower the bar on our expected investment returns to deploy all this capital, rather it's our policy to return excess capital, as Tom mentioned to you, when cash available exceeds our anticipated investment requirements. Now taken over the past few years, we've chosen the mechanism of share repurchase to return excess capital to shareholders. In the event that the company determines to elect Real Estate Investment Trust or REIT status in its future tax returns, this will be by no means signal a significant change in our capital allocation strategy at all. Our priorities would remain the same, investing on our CapEx program and an acquisitions that meet our returned expectations, and thereafter, returning excess capital to shareholders.
Under a REIT election, we'd of course include the additional mechanism of dividends for returning some of our cash to shareholders. However, we expect that American Tower would be able to both meet the dividend obligation under a REIT election and have sufficient cash from operations to reinvest in the business and/or continue to conduct share repurchases at some level under the capital allocation strategy outlined earlier in my remarks. 
So in conclusion, I'd just like to reemphasize a couple of points. First, we've increased our full year 2009 guidance, including elevating our expectations for cash from operations to over $970 million at the midpoint. As nearly a billion dollars of cash generated from the business in 2010 to reinvest on your behalf. Second, we're actively engaged in numerous initiatives in the U.S. and in select key international markets to seek out, evaluate and execute on new investments, designed to ensure long-term, robust growth for our company, and I emphasize the long-term. And third, our overall goal is to leverage our current and new assets, to both form a recurring free cash flow on a per share basis while at the same time expanding returns on invested capital from one year to the next. We strive to be one of those relatively few companies that can accomplish both growth and increasing returns on investment on a consistent, sustainable basis. 
And as we wrap up the call, I should mention that the Red Sox have the same kind of can-do attitude that we do and they'll be getting healthy just in time to exact revenge on the Yankees this weekend and launch their surge back into first place in August. 
Operator, you can now open the call for questions at this time."

We like to take it from a couple of percent up to 5% of revenue as we grow the rest of the company, so it will be meaningful. It's again one of those five or six complementary initiatives to our core U.S. Tower business that we'd like to develop and boost growth. And then from a carrier interest perspective, it's similar I think over the last 18 to 24 months, some interest was generated on some mid-solutions. They are more expensive and harder to engineer for the carrier so they haven't elevated in the priority list, but now and then, the carriers are willing to go to that solution.

Regards revenue, we are now reflecting the acquisition of Essar Telecom, as you suggested, which should be about $30 million. We're also reflecting additional straight line and FX revenue of about $20 million due to the weakening of the dollar, our recent renegotiated plan with a large carrier in Latin America and some straight line revenue in the United States. We're also including some additional discount with that large carrier in Latin America of about $10 million as you suggested due to our renegotiated plan, which is offset by the contract extensions and higher minimum escalations. So all told, an increase of $40 million, 12% growth at the midpoint, 9% to 10% core growth. Regards to EBITDA, we're increasing EBITDA by about $20 million as I said as a result of the increased Essar-related revenue of $30 million plus the increased straight line and FX revenue of $20 million, offset by the $10 million cash discount with a large Latin American customer. Offset by Essar, direct expenses of about $15 million or so, associated with the $30 million of revenue. And business development expenses of about $5 million. So our increase in EBITDA is largely non-cash related. Consequently, our EBITDA growth is in the 10% range with our core growth in the 7% range. A couple of additional thoughts relative to the second part of your question. In the quarter, we have about $20 million of past due revenue and cost, about $7 million more than the second quarter of 2009. So if you back out these revenues and expenses which is margin-neutral, it takes our EBITDA conversion rate from about 72% to well over 80%, as I mentioned in my remarks, and then aiming on our 4,300 towers, takes it up to over 90%. And relative to our outlook, we're increasing revenues year-over-year by about $200 million and EBITDA $120 million. Past due is about $30 million higher in 2010 versus 2009 so our EBITDA growth of $120 million should be viewed to be on about $170 million of revenue. Aiding on some of our business development cost, SG&A cost to scale our business and the lower margins of the new towers with the lower tenancies, again our conversion rate is significant. So as we said in the past and as Jim remarked, we're investing for the long-term growth of the business and believe we can manage strong growth while continuing to generate industry-leading margins. Hopefully, that's helpful."

We've got two outdoor DAS installations up and running with about 300 nodes in process, a number of more outdoor DAS projects in front of customers which we think many of those will be secured.

I'm not sure it's ever necessarily been proven to be exactly one-to-one. There are timing issues as you've actually suggested here. There's also was the CapEx going into. At this point, couple of carriers, for example, are mainly investing in some software upgrades with some of their capital expenditures. Some are investing in backhaul from the towers that is through fiber or cable or other elements the towers don't necessarily provide. So there's a mix and a timing adjustment to try to make a correlation to tower leasing revenue. Having said that though, generally CapEx goes up, it means the carriers have dedicated to rolling out more advanced networks that's going to hit the tower industry in a big way over again some period of time in some fashion with mix, so we think it's a very positive correlation. It just may not be an exactly a mathematical one-to-one."

So we're essentially 100% involved in microwave backhaul because there's a piece of the rent that's dedicated then to the microwave dish in installation. More of a coordinating role, I'd call it, on fiber to the tower or fiber backhaul. We would selectively invest, or co-invest I should say, with fiber providers that would like to reach the tower. We haven't done much any of that yet. But we're willing to do it. And so I say, it's more of a coordinating role with some potential investment in return on the Fiber side and it's a very involved role on the Microwave side."

The agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: I will provide a brief introduction and highlight certain key metrics from our second quarter 2010 financial results. Following this, Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will go over our financial results and provide an additional overview of our expectations for 2010; and finally, Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, will give closing remarks including his current thoughts on key industry trends.

If you do have more than two questions or if you think of additional question, feel free to add yourself back to the queue and we'll do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the allotted time. 
Before I begin, I would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding our 2010 outlook, our stock repurchase program, our pending acquisition of Essar Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's press release and those set forth in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, and our other fillings with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. And with that, I would like to begin the call with some highlights from our second quarter 2010 results.
Please turn to Slide 4 of the presentation which provides a summary of our second quarter 2010 results compared against the year-ago period. We reported total revenues of approximately $470 million reflecting growth of 11% from the year-ago period. Tom will provide additional color on the core growth of our Rental and Management segment, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and straight-line lease accounting. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was approximately $321 million, which is an 11.7% increase from the year-ago period. Additionally, our operating income for the quarter increased over 13% nearly $189 million. Income from continuing operations including income from non-controlling interest was approximately $100 million or $0.25 per basic and diluted common share, attributable to American Tower Corporation.
During the quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.3%, which reflects a year-over-year decline of over 17% and was primarily the result of two items, including a foreign earnings and profit study, which created a 2.8% benefit related to the U.S. taxable income that has been predicated on original earnings and profit estimate, and a 13.3% benefit triggered by the reassessment of the realized ability of certain acquired NOLs, based on formal studies that were completed during the quarter. Both items were discrete to the quarter and for the full year 2010, we currently anticipate our effective tax rate will be approximately 33%.  
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Tom, who will discuss our results in more detail."

I'm pleased to report that our second quarter 2010 results came in right on plan as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities for the year. If you'll please turn to Slide 5, I'd like to begin with some",2205,"Thanks, Leah, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that our second quarter 2010 results came in right on plan as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities for the year. 
If you'll please turn to Slide 5, I'd like to begin with some highlights from our Rental and Management segment. Overall, we reported Rental and Management segment revenue growth of 12.2%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and straight-line lease accounting, our core growth was 8.6% relative to the second quarter of 2009 with foreign exchange positively impacting our reported results by 1.4% and straight-line positively impacting our reported results by 2.2%. 
Additionally, and as I highlighted on our last call, three discrete items will continue to impact our results during 2010. These items include the impact of broadcast analog churn, the completion of a customer take-or-pay agreement, and a customer settlement, which combined, negatively impact our reported revenue by about 1.7%. So excluding the impact of these items, our core growth would have been over 10%.  In the U.S., core growth for Tower revenue was 8.4%, excluding the impact of these discrete items. During the quarter, we continued to experience a strong leasing environment with signed new business up by approximately 10% and commenced new business up approximately 25% relative to the same quarter of 2009. Our solid performance in the U.S. was complemented by over a 21% core growth in revenues from our international markets.
And finally, our results include a year-over-year increase of approximately $9.8 million in straight-line revenue, which reflect a contract extension with one of our major U.S. customers from the beginning of 2010, which we highlighted for you during our first quarter call, and the impact of a new agreement with our largest customer in Latin America which contributed to the year-over-year increase and one of the primary driver of the sequential increase in straight-line revenue for the quarter of about $5.3 million.
Turning to Slide 6. Our reported adjusted EBITDA growth relative to the second quarter of 2009 was 11.7% with core growth of 7.2% on a currency neutral basis and excluding the impacts of straight-line lease accounting. In addition, the impact of our discrete 2010 items, which I mentioned earlier, negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA growth by about 2.4%. So excluding these items, adjusted EBITDA core growth would have been about 9.6%.
During the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 68%. Our adjusted EBITDA conversion rate was about 72%, which was a direct result of the following. Some pass-through revenue and expense related to our international markets, negatively impacted our conversion rate by over 10%. And additionally, since the beginning of the second quarter of 2009, we've added over 4,100 new sites to our portfolio, which currently have gross margins of about 57% due to our average tenancy of approximately 1.3%. As we continue to increase the utilization of these sites, we expect their margins will approach our legacy portfolio levels.
Excluding the impact of both past due revenue and the new sites, we have added over the past 12 months, our EBITDA conversion rate would have been in excess of 90%. In addition, during 2010, we have continued to make selective investments in our regional overhead systems and corporate functions. We've made substantial progress in our corporate initiatives year-to-date and continue to focus on our key projects, which include our ongoing due diligence on a possible REIT conversion, as well as IT projects such as their global implementation of common financial systems. Please note, corporate expense for the second quarter of 2010 also included about $1 million of accrued severance costs. 
As outlined in Slide 7, during the second quarter, we continued our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Specifically, we spent about $77.5 million on total capital expenditures, including $47 million of spending on discretionary capital projects, primarily related to the completion of 237 new sites and about $18 million on land purchases. In addition, we completed the acquisition of 36 sites in the United States and a 113 sites in Chile for a total of about $44 million. And finally, rounding out our capital deployment for the quarter and consistent with our previously announced plans to increase the pacing of our share repurchase program, we nearly tripled our buyback pacing and accordingly spent approximately $145 million to repurchase 3.5 million shares during the second quarter.
I'd like to spend a moment on our recent launch of operations in Chile. A few weeks ago, we issued a press release outlining our agreement to purchase approximately 287 sites from Telefónica, closing on 113 sites during the quarter. We're excited about our development team's recent success, and I'd like to highlight for you some of the key reasons for our investment and expansion into Chile. 
First, Chile currently is one of the strongest macroeconomic environments in Latin America, which should provide us with a solid foundation in which to invest. Second, Chile has a vibrant and competitive wireless market where customers in our existing Latin American market already conduct business today. Third, our recent spectrum auction placed 3G spectrum into the hands of a new entrant, VTR, and an existing incumbent, Nextel International, both of which are expected to deploy meaningful amount of capital to build nationwide 3G networks in Chile over the next couple of years. And finally, the government has already indicated its interest in auctioning additional spectrum for 4G deployments, possibly in late 2011, which would provide further opportunities for organic growth. Simply put, we're excited about our new market and expect to add through new site construction and select acquisitions to further build our portfolio, our expansion into Chile will over time provide a nice compliment to our existing Latin American markets with return hurdles that are consistent with our other Latin American markets. We also were to continue to pursue additional expansion opportunities in other complementary Latin American markets.
Turning to Slide 8. We delivered approximately 23% growth in both recurring free cash flow and recurring free cash flow per share in the quarter versus the same period last year. This growth was primarily driven by the following: our core growth and adjusted EBITDA, lower redevelopment and maintenance capital spending, and an income tax refund of approximately $9 million which we received during the second quarter. Our year-to-date performance and recurring free cash flow has exceeded our expectations. We continue though to expect mid-teen annual growth and recurring free cash flow for the year largely due to the increased interest expense resulting from the planned acquisition of the towers from Essar. These trends, along with our recent investments and attractive discretionary projects including the acquisitions we made over the past five quarters, have resulted in a consistent improvement in our return on invested capital, which today stands at 11.3%.
Turning to Slide 9. As a result of our performance being unplanned during the first half of 2010, our recent and pending acquisitions, year-to-date customer contract extensions and our new agreement with our largest customer in Latin America, we've updated our 2010 outlook. A few of the highlights include: we've increased the midpoint of our full year Rental and Management segment revenue outlook by $40 million and consequently our range to $1.85 billion to $1.88 billion, which now represents year-over-year growth of approximately 11% to 13%. We've increased the midpoint of our full year adjusted EBITDA outlook by $20 million and accordingly our range to $1.28 billion to $1.31 billion, which now represents year-over-year growth of 8% to 11%.  And finally, we've increased the midpoint of our full year cash provided by operating activities outlook by $10 million and its corresponding range to $960 million to $990 million, which now represents an increase of 14% to 18% over 2009. Please note our outlook estimates reflect our acquisitions during the quarter, as well as the 63 communication tower sites in the United States we most recently purchased in July and the company's pending acquisition of approximately 450 communication tower sites from Essar Telecom, which we expect will close during the quarter.
Turning to Slide 10. I'd like to discuss the key drivers that have resulted in our increase in 2010 outlook for Rental and Management segment revenue. As I mentioned previously, we're increasing our expectations for our Rental and Management segment revenue by $40 million at the midpoint, which is primarily a result of four key items: The core business continues to perform in line with plan, our recent and pending acquisitions, which includes our acquisition of Essar's towers in India, which we will expect will close during the quarter; customer contract extensions primarily in the U.S.; and a new agreement with our largest customer in Latin America, which was finalized during the second quarter.
Turning to Slide 11. We've also increased our 2010 outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $20 million at the midpoint, which in addition to the items discussed with respect to revenue, is a result of the lower adjusted EBITDA margins on our recently completed or pending acquisitions, which is primarily a result of our acquisition in India or approximately one third of the current revenue relates to past due fuel costs. And as a result, we currently estimate we'll have initial adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 40% to 45%. And approximately $5 million of additional cost, primarily as a result of greater than originally anticipated development opportunities, is our pipeline for opportunities continues to grow.
Turning to Slide 12. I'd like to highlight our current investment profile for 2010. Through the combination of our outlook for cash provided by operations, an incremental borrowing required to end the year at our targeted 3.5x net debt to last 12 months adjusted EBITDA, we will have access to over $1.5 billion of capital to deploy in 2010. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we will first seek to invest this cash back into our current portfolio through our annual capital plan, which is currently expected to be between $300 million to $350 million. This includes the expected construction of between 1,200 and 1,600 new sites and the purchase of approximately $50 million of land under our towers. 
In addition to CapEx, we will seek to add new assets to our portfolio for pursuing select acquisitions, which together with pending acquisitions accounts for over $600 million year-to-date and includes approximately $430 million from our pending acquisition of roughly 4,450 sites in India from Essar. And finally, we continue to expect that we will return our excess capital to shareholders via our stock repurchase program. 
During the second quarter and consistent with our previous statements, we increased the pacing of our share repurchase program, and accordingly repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares for about $145 million. Year-to-date, we have spent approximately $196 million on our share repurchase program, and we'll manage the pacing of the program during the third quarter to continue to move our net leverage towards our year-end target of 3.5x net debt to last 12 months adjusted EBITDA. With our target of 3.5x net debt as of year end, we currently estimate that the remaining capacity for investment in 2010 is about $530 million, which we expect will be allocated consistent with our capital allocation strategy.
And turning to Slide 13 and in conclusion, I'd like to summarize a few key takeaways for the quarter. Our second quarter results were right on plan with solid performance supported by year-over-year improvements in both signed and commenced new business. We remain disciplined and consistent with respect to our investments and capital allocation strategy. In the second quarter, we added 386 sites to our portfolio, primarily in the U.S., India and Chile. In addition, excluding the Essar acquisition, we have added over 4,300 new sites to our portfolio since the beginning of 2009. 
We have received all necessary regulatory approvals for our acquisition of Essar Telecom and expect that the transaction will close during the third quarter. Our key focus in India, post-closing, will be on integration and driving strong organic growth on our existing tower sites. We continue to seek opportunities to expand our presence, including those in which we currently serve. As we previously mentioned, our first priority is to invest in the United States. However, we also have teams in various geographies including Latin America, Asia and EMEA who are working with counter parties to explore acquisitions who are built-to-suit opportunities. 
With respect to our balance sheet, we currently have approximately $925 million of liquidity. And as a result, we expect we will continue to utilize a portion of our current financial capacity to continue the pacing of our share repurchase program as we work our way towards our year-end target of 3.5x. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we drew down approximately $350 million of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which we will use to fund our cash obligations in connection with our acquisition of Essar's towers. Pro forma for acquisition, our 2Q '10 net debt to EBITDA was 3.3x. And finally, we will continue to monitor the capital markets to seek opportunistic transactions that lower our cost of debt. And ladder and extend our maturities.

Our strong second quarter results show the Tower business model is driving as the wireless communications industry transitions to delivering true broadband data services to consumers.",2004,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call today. Our strong second quarter results show the Tower business model is driving as the wireless communications industry transitions to delivering true broadband data services to consumers. 
At American Tower, we continue to be excited about both the current and future prospects for our industry and for our company. We're confident that the robust advancement of high-speed wireless data services will continue. First in developed markets such as the U.S., followed by developing economies around the world. A number of key trends support this conclusion. Let's first consider handsets. 
Global handset sales were up 13% in the second quarter suggesting that wireless growth is back on track in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Moreover, major handset manufacturers, including Nokia, Samsung, Motorola, Sony Ericsson, RIM [Research In Motion] and Apple are emphasizing Smartphone investments and the sales opportunities that they bring to drive their future growth. 
And there's plenty of offsite for the deployment of Smartphones. Even in the U.S. and Western Europe, Smartphone shipments were just 30% of all handsets. And in developing markets, in the EMEA region, Asia and Latin America, the proportion of handset shipments that were Smartphones was only 10%. With the handset manufacturers focus on Smartphone unit growth, prices should come down and choices to consumers should increase. Thereby, leading to greater penetration of Smartphones in both the U.S. and internationally. 
The U.S. is the leading market with respect to innovation in wireless and consumer readiness for Smartphones and carriers are reporting shortages of their most high-end handset offerings, such as AT&T's Apple iPhone 4, Verizon's Droid and Sprint's HTC EVO 4G. Consumer demand for faster wireless data services is proving to be voracious, and a competitive mobile broadband platform is essential for any wireless carriers continued success over time. Consequently, we believe there'll be even greater burdens on wireless networks to deliver the new level of service that Smartphone owners are demanding. 
Substantial investments in 3G and now 4G technologies are being made by carriers in order to meet this demand. Fortunately, for both the wireless carriers and for the tower industry, consumer are willing to pay for these enhanced services. As a result, wireless data is now the primary growth engine for U.S. carrier revenues. 
In the second quarter, AT&T, Verizon increase data revenues by 27% and 24%, respectively. Both carriers in turn reaffirmed their commitment to significant levels of capital investment to further develop these types of services while also increasing the proportion of overall corporate CapEx devoted to wireless. In addition, Sprint announced that it has been adding new CDMA sites to its network this year and T-Mobile continues to deploy its upgrade to its current 3G system.
And looking ahead from 3G to 4G, each carrier has restated their plans to support next-generation investments. In Sprint's case, to the support of Clearwire. At Verizon, the launch of LTE markets in the second quarter of 2010. And at AT&T, the launch of 4G markets beginning in 2011. Moreover, MetroPCS and LightSquared have announced their own LTE market launches starting in 2010 and 2011 as well. 
Once again, taking a more global view, 3G penetration in Western Europe and the U.S. is only now approaching about 40% of subscribers. Indicating significant additional subscribers and network requirements to come over the next few years for 3G and with the onset of 4G at scale to follow. Developing markets in the EMEA region, Asia and Latin America are only at the nation's stage of 3G penetration and only approximately the 5% range in those places. 
We anticipate that there will be terrific future potential in these types of markets for wireless data. In addition, the compelling handsets and ongoing network investments, another key factor in the development of 3G and 4G data services is the availability of sufficient spectrum. Overall in the U.S., the three largest carriers, AT&T, Verizon and Sprint, through its relationship with Clearwire, appear to have sufficient spectrum to deliver today's expected levels of service at current penetration rates. But both the wireless carrier community and the U.S. government are looking ahead to open more spectrum for advanced wireless services. The recent government clearance of spectrum for use by LightSquared is an example of these efforts. And both the FCC and the Obama administration are working towards making additional spectrum available over the next few years.
Many developing markets are right now in the process of ensuring availability of sufficient spectrum for a competitive advanced data services for their consumers. In fact, new 3G spectrum is being made available in all four of our international markets, Mexico, Brazil, Chile and India. We believe that this new spectrum, combined with the financial strength of the leading carriers in each of these markets and lower cost Smartphone handsets are being developed will lead to the deployment of high-speed data networks at all of our served markets over the course of the coming years. Given this three strong global trends in wireless, proliferation of affordable Smartphone, wireless carrier investment plans and additional spectrum availability, we at American Tower, are very pleased with our strategic position. 
In the U.S., all four of the national carriers, Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile, are in the midst of a multi-year upgrade cycle. That is, each is in the process of deploying additional equipment primarily on towers to deliver wireless data services. And substantial part, Verizon and AT&T are currently utilizing amendments to existing cell site leases for 3G and 4G equipment while also splitting 3G cells for capacity and/or coverage. 
American Tower is in a strong position to garner Amendment business from both AT&T and Verizon as approximately 20% of those carriers respective cell sites reside on our towers. Sprint is now adding net subscribers and it's also adding some new sites. Additionally, Sprint is also deploying its next-generation 4G service capability via Clearwire. 
We also expect additional new co-location business in the 2011 timeframe from smaller regional carriers and from the LightSquared venture. So these are contingent on sufficient funding. Given American Tower's portfolio of over 20,000 locations in the United States, we are also positioned well to catch a significant share of new cell site installations on our towers. While the U.S. market is the foundation of American Tower's business, delivering over 80% of our second quarter Tower revenue, we're putting substantial effort into building a framework for complementary international expansion. We found that to earn the credibility and the local market knowledge to engage in significant transactions and with the highest-quality counter parties, it doesn't take months, it takes years. 
In Latin America, we've established a track record of operational credibility and staying power over a 10-year period in Mexico and over nine years in Brazil. We serve multi-market carriers in both those countries such as América Móvil, Telefónica and Nextel International. The value of our track record and market reputation was demonstrated by our recent agreement to acquire nearly 300 towers in Telefónica in Chile, and we hope to extend the success in the region through additional opportunities. 
In India, we've had teams on the ground for three years and I'll be making my sixth visit to the market in a couple of weeks. By investing time and resources in that region, American Tower has gained a relevant place in the market, and we're now in a final process of closing our third acquisition, which will bring our tower count in India to over 7,000 sites. Given the inherent growth in the Indian wireless industry, we've experienced co-location rates there, there about double that of the U.S. Which we believe will contribute to healthy returns on our investment and region over time. 
Our overall goal, as a management team, is to combine unmatched market knowledge, both domestically and internationally, with our financial strength to make superior capital allocation decisions on your behalf. As Tom mentioned, our first priority is to fund our CapEx programs for the year. For each tower that we build or augment and each Distributed Antenna Systems that we install, has both the credit-worthy anchor tenant and solid prospects for the future leasing growth. Each project is judged on its own merits individually and this holds true for land purchases as well. 
We also applied a disciplined approach to tower portfolio acquisitions, be they large or small. There are two types of acquisitions, third-party independent tower operators and carrier tower portfolios. Key decision criteria for third-party acquisitions includes the quality of the tower and ground space design, nature of existing lease contracts, the revenue per tower, future leasing prospects and many others. And criteria for carrier-owned tower portfolios also include the viability and market position of the selling carrier and the rates and terms of that carriers willing to commit to in the attached master list agreements since the seller, of course, is the primary lease customer on this portfolio. Each tower deal is therefore, different and a simple comparison of multiples is often invalid. We believe that there's no one better at judging the value of a tower portfolio than our regional and senior executive teams.
In any given year, our objective to deploy the cash generated from operations. Which for 2010 at American Tower is expected to approach $1 billion plus the proceeds for many additional debt capacity generated by our growth in EBITDA. Roughly an additional $400 million to $500 million each year. We wanted to deploy this funds to new assets that meet our investment requirements. However, we don't lower the bar on our expected investment returns to deploy all this capital, rather it's our policy to return excess capital, as Tom mentioned to you, when cash available exceeds our anticipated investment requirements. Now taken over the past few years, we've chosen the mechanism of share repurchase to return excess capital to shareholders. In the event that the company determines to elect Real Estate Investment Trust or REIT status in its future tax returns, this will be by no means signal a significant change in our capital allocation strategy at all. Our priorities would remain the same, investing on our CapEx program and an acquisitions that meet our returned expectations, and thereafter, returning excess capital to shareholders.
Under a REIT election, we'd of course include the additional mechanism of dividends for returning some of our cash to shareholders. However, we expect that American Tower would be able to both meet the dividend obligation under a REIT election and have sufficient cash from operations to reinvest in the business and/or continue to conduct share repurchases at some level under the capital allocation strategy outlined earlier in my remarks. 
So in conclusion, I'd just like to reemphasize a couple of points. First, we've increased our full year 2009 guidance, including elevating our expectations for cash from operations to over $970 million at the midpoint. As nearly a billion dollars of cash generated from the business in 2010 to reinvest on your behalf. Second, we're actively engaged in numerous initiatives in the U.S. and in select key international markets to seek out, evaluate and execute on new investments, designed to ensure long-term, robust growth for our company, and I emphasize the long-term. And third, our overall goal is to leverage our current and new assets, to both form a recurring free cash flow on a per share basis while at the same time expanding returns on invested capital from one year to the next. We strive to be one of those relatively few companies that can accomplish both growth and increasing returns on investment on a consistent, sustainable basis. 
And as we wrap up the call, I should mention that the Red Sox have the same kind of can-do attitude that we do and they'll be getting healthy just in time to exact revenge on the Yankees this weekend and launch their surge back into first place in August. 
Operator, you can now open the call for questions at this time."

So A, I want to see if that's sort of the right map and then B, as we look at how the guidance sort of makes its way down to EBITDA with the $20 million hike there, just given all the moving parts, can you help us think through how the revenue down EBITDA conversion sort of filters through? It seems like the incremental margins might have suggest they're a little higher than EBITDA hike?"

We're also reflecting additional straight line and",423,"Jason, with regard to guidance overall, let me just review a couple of items. Regards revenue, we are now reflecting the acquisition of Essar Telecom, as you suggested, which should be about $30 million. We're also reflecting additional straight line and FX revenue of about $20 million due to the weakening of the dollar, our recent renegotiated plan with a large carrier in Latin America and some straight line revenue in the United States. We're also including some additional discount with that large carrier in Latin America of about $10 million as you suggested due to our renegotiated plan, which is offset by the contract extensions and higher minimum escalations. So all told, an increase of $40 million, 12% growth at the midpoint, 9% to 10% core growth. Regards to EBITDA, we're increasing EBITDA by about $20 million as I said as a result of the increased Essar-related revenue of $30 million plus the increased straight line and FX revenue of $20 million, offset by the $10 million cash discount with a large Latin American customer. Offset by Essar, direct expenses of about $15 million or so, associated with the $30 million of revenue. And business development expenses of about $5 million. So our increase in EBITDA is largely non-cash related. Consequently, our EBITDA growth is in the 10% range with our core growth in the 7% range. A couple of additional thoughts relative to the second part of your question. In the quarter, we have about $20 million of past due revenue and cost, about $7 million more than the second quarter of 2009. So if you back out these revenues and expenses which is margin-neutral, it takes our EBITDA conversion rate from about 72% to well over 80%, as I mentioned in my remarks, and then aiming on our 4,300 towers, takes it up to over 90%. And relative to our outlook, we're increasing revenues year-over-year by about $200 million and EBITDA $120 million. Past due is about $30 million higher in 2010 versus 2009 so our EBITDA growth of $120 million should be viewed to be on about $170 million of revenue. Aiding on some of our business development cost, SG&A cost to scale our business and the lower margins of the new towers with the lower tenancies, again our conversion rate is significant. So as we said in the past and as Jim remarked, we're investing for the long-term growth of the business and believe we can manage strong growth while continuing to generate industry-leading margins. Hopefully, that's helpful."

I'm not sure it's ever necessarily been proven to be exactly one-to-one. There are timing issues as you've actually suggested here. There's also was the CapEx going into. At this point, couple of carriers, for example, are mainly investing in some software upgrades with some of their capital expenditures. Some are investing in backhaul from the towers that is through fiber or cable or other elements the towers don't necessarily provide. So there's a mix and a timing adjustment to try to make a correlation to tower leasing revenue. Having said that though, generally CapEx goes up, it means the carriers have dedicated to rolling out more advanced networks that's going to hit the tower industry in a big way over again some period of time in some fashion with mix, so we think it's a very positive correlation. It just may not be an exactly a mathematical one-to-one."

The agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: I will provide a brief introduction and highlight certain key metrics from our third quarter financial results. Following this, Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss our financial results and provide an overview of our expectation for the remainder of 2010. And finally, Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, will give closing remarks, including his current thoughts on key industry trends. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions.

Examples of these statements include those regarding our 2010 outlook, our stock repurchase program, our pending acquisitions and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.
Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's press release and those set forth in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2010, and in our other fillings with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
And with that, I'd like to begin the call with some highlights from our third quarter results. Please turn to Slide 4 of the presentation, which provides a summary of our results compared against the prior year period. We reported total revenues of approximately $513 million, reflecting growth of over 15% from the prior year period. Tom will provide additional color on the core growth of our Rental and Management segment, which excludes the impact of foreign currency, straight-line lease accounting and a onetime gain from the prior year period. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was approximately $350 million, which is, an increase of over 15% from the prior year. Additionally, our operating income for the quarter increased over 19% to approximately $213 million.
Income from continuing operations, including income from noncontrolling interest, was approximately $94 million or $0.23 per basic and diluted common share. And now I would like to turn the call over to Tom, who will discuss our results in more detail."

If you please turn to Slide 5, I'd like to begin with some highlights from our Rental and Management segment. Overall, we reported Rental and Management segment revenue growth of 16.1%. Core growth in Rental and Management segment revenue was 11.6% relative to the third quarter of 2009, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, which positively impacted our reported results by 0.8%, straight-line, which positively impacted our reported results by 5.7% and a onetime gain from the third quarter of 2009, which is related to a onetime termination fee, which we received from one of our broadcast customers.
Additionally and as I highlighted on our last call, three discrete items continue to impact our results during 2010. These items include the impact of broadcast analog churn, the completion of a customer take-or-pay agreement and a customer settlement, which combined, negatively impacted our reported revenue by approximately 1.7%. Excluding the impact of these items, our core growth would have been over 13%.
Excluding the impact of these discrete items, core Tower revenue growth in the United States was 10.3%, of which 7.8% was generated from sites owned during the full comparable period, and 2.5% was generated from new sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the third quarter of 2009. In addition, during the quarter, our U.S. division continue to experience a strong leasing environment with total signed new business up by approximately 18% relative to the same quarter of 2009. Furthermore, amendment activity continued to increase, accounting for approximately 45% of our signed new business in the quarter.
Our solid performance in the U.S. was complemented by core growth of 27% in revenues from our international markets, which reflects our acquisition of towers from Essar, which contributed nearly $15 million or approximately 3.5% to our total revenue growth for the quarter. And as a result of our international expansion, our pass-through revenue, which represents principally land and fuel expenses that we incur and are able to get reimbursed by our customers, has increased by approximately $9 million from the year ago period, which is primarily attributable to our growth in India.
Finally, our results include a year-over-year increase of over $25 million in straight-line revenue, which is a result of our successful customer contract extensions in the United States. Nearly $21 million of the increase for the quarter was a result of a new master lease agreement with one of our U.S. customers, which was completed during the quarter. 
Before I move on to the rest of our financial results, I'd like to take a minute to walk you through some of the highlights of this new agreement and how it provides key strategic benefits for both parties. First, as our customers seek to add additional equipment to their existing tower sites to meet the rapidly growing demand for data services efficiently and with flexibility, our new agreement essentially provides our customer the ability to install additional equipment on their existing RAD centers in exchange for an incremental fixed annual increase in their run rate billing.
Therefore, the new agreement provides speed-to-market advantages for our customer, while providing us with a committed level of annual cash revenue growth above their recent historical levels. Finally, we've extended the remaining average current term of our leases with them to 10 years, which provides further stability to our cash flows. 
Turning to Slide 6. Our reported adjusted EBITDA growth relative to the third quarter of 2009 was 15.1%, with core growth for the quarter at 8.4% on a currency-neutral basis and excluding the impacts of straight-line lease accounting, as well as the onetime item, which I mentioned earlier.
Further adjusting for the 2010 discrete items, which negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA growth by 2.4%, our core growth would have been nearly 11%. During the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 68%, and our adjusted EBITDA conversion rate was approximately 66%, which was a direct result of the following: the $9 million increase in pass-through revenue and expense as I mentioned earlier, negatively impacted our conversion rate by approximately 10%. Additionally, since the beginning of the third quarter of 2009, we've added over 7,500 new sites to our portfolio, which currently have gross margins of approximately 57% due to their average tenancy of approximately 1.6%. 
As we continue to increase the utilization of these sites, we expect their margins will approach our legacy portfolio levels. Excluding the impact of both pass-through revenue and the new sites, we have added over the past 12 months, our EBITDA conversion rate would have been over 90%. 
Furthermore, during the third quarter, we continue to make selective investments in our regional overhead, systems and corporate functions. In addition to our ongoing costs related to certain global business development initiatives, our main focus continues to be on our key projects for 2010, including our IT initiatives such as global implementations of common financial consolidation systems, as well as our ongoing due diligence with respect to a possible REIT conversion. We have made substantial progress in these initiatives year-to-date, and we'll continue this focus for the remainder of the year.
As outlined in Slide 7, during the third quarter, we continued our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Specifically, we spent approximately $96 million on total capital expenditures, including $54 million of spending on discretionary capital projects, primarily related to the construction of 196 new sites and $23 million on land purchases.
In addition, during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of 81 sites in the United States and launched operations in Peru and Colombia as a result of our acquisition of 356 sites from Telefónica. Further, we closed on our acquisitions of Essar, which increased our portfolio in India by over 4,600 sites for a cash consideration of approximately $430 million. Finally, consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we spent approximately $150 million to repurchase 3.2 million shares during the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 8. We delivered approximately 11% growth in recurring free cash flow and approximately 12% growth in recurring free cash flow per share relative to the third quarter of 2009. The growth was primarily driven by the following: our core growth in adjusted EBITDA and lower interest expense and higher interest income, which were primarily due to lower borrowing costs as a result of our recent refinancing activities and higher cash balances, respectively.
Our performance of recurring free cash flow year-to-date is on plan. And as a result, we continue to expect mid-teen annual growth in recurring free cash flow per share for the full year. These trends, along with our recent investments in attractive discretionary projects, including the acquisitions we've made over the past six quarters have resulted in the consistent improvement in our return on invested capital, which is growing to 11.3%.
Turning to Slide 9. We've updated our prior outlook. We've increased the midpoint of our full year Rental and Management segment revenue outlook by $60 million and consequently, our range to $1.92 billion to $1.93 billion, which now represents year-over-year growth of over 15% at the midpoint. 
This increase is primarily the result of the following key items: $18 million related to strong year-to-date core growth, which is progressing slightly ahead of plan as a result of slightly higher escalations and lower cancellations, plus the early close of our acquisition of towers from Essar and our recent and pending acquisitions in Latin America from Telefónica; and $42 million as a result of the impact of straight line and foreign currency, which is primarily related to our most recent customer contract extensions and master lease negotiations in the United States. Additionally, we've increased the midpoint of our full year adjusted EBITDA outlook by $48 million. And accordingly, our range to $1.34 billion to $1.35 billion, which now represents year-over-year growth of 13.7% at the midpoint. 
This increase is primarily the result of the following key items: increase in our Rental and Management segment revenue, offset by costs associated with the early close of our acquisition of towers from Essar and operating expenses and initial start-up costs associated with our new towers in our new Latin American markets, which brings their contribution for the purposes of our 2010 outlook to near zero.
Turning to Slide 10. We've provided an updated year-over-year bridge of our Rental and Management segment revenue growth based on our new outlook. Looking forward to 2011, while we will provide detailed guidance when we release our full year 2010 results, we wanted to provide you now with some expected trends related to our Rental and Management segment revenue core growth. Our contract escalators should continue to contribute approximately 3.5%. We currently expect that the leasing environment will be at or above comparable levels with 2010 based on trends such as our U.S. customers seeking to deploy initial 4G networks while continuing to aggressively invest to improve the quality of their 3G networks. 
This demand will be complemented by investments by our customers in our international markets who are seeking to roll out new spectrum. And we expect that our annual churn rate will attenuate and return to normalized levels between 1.5% to 2%. Finally, we expect that our organic growth will be complemented by new tower builds. We also intend to pursue further acquisitions opportunities in both the U.S. and select international markets.
Turning to Slide 11. And as I mentioned previously, we have increased our 2010 outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $48 million at the midpoint. 2010 has been a year of significant investment for American Tower as we've sought to further our global presence and uniquely position ourselves to capture a portion of the growing global demand for wireless services. As we have successfully entered new geographies, we have spurred revenue growth, while also incurring initial start-up costs. 
In addition, we have ramped our spending, particularly in new regions such as Africa where we currently have no operations. We believe that the current levels of development spending will position us well for future growth, and we are pleased that despite this incremental spending, we've been able to maintain our adjusted EBITDA margins at 68%.
Turning to Slide 12. I'd like to highlight our current investment profile for 2010. Through the combination of our outlook for cash provided by operations and incremental borrowing required to end the year at about 3.5x net debt to last 12 months adjusted EBITDA, we would expect to have access to over $1.7 billion of capital to invest in 2010. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, our primary objective will be to invest this cash back into our current portfolio through our annual capital plan, which is currently expected to be between $300 million and $320 million. This includes the expected construction of between 1,000 and 1,200 new sites, and the purchase of approximately $60 million of land under our towers.
In addition to CapEx, we will continue to seek new assets to our portfolio by pursuing select acquisitions. We've spent $665 million year-to-date. Finally, we expect to continue returning our excess capital to shareholders via our stock repurchase program. Year-to-date, we have spent approximately $346 million on our share repurchase program.
With our target of about 3.5x net debt as of year end, we currently estimate that our remaining capacity for investment in 2010 is approximately $390 million, which we intend to utilize in line with our capital allocation strategy. 
Turning to Slide 13, I would like to take a moment to discuss our recent development activities in our international markets. During the quarter and continuing the momentum of our recent market launch in Chile, we further expanded our Latin American presence with the launch of operations in both Peru and Colombia. As of today, have closed on a total of 231 towers in Peru and 610 towers in Colombia. In addition, we expect to acquire an additional 1,300 towers in our existing markets in Latin America by the end of 2010.
Combined, these acquisitions would bring our Latin American portfolio to a total of over 6,500 towers. I'd also like to take this opportunity to update you on our progress in Chile, where our team recently completed an agreement with the new market entrant VTR, a subsidiary of Liberty Global. Since our launch of operations in June, our team has worked with our new customer as they plan the deployment of their recently awarded 3G spectrum. We expect VTR will utilize our towers as they pursue their nationwide rollout, plus we have agreed to acquire approximately 140 of their existing towers, which we would expect to complete during 2011. Our local teams and our new markets are off to a fast start, and we're very pleased with their progress so far.
We believe that our development activities in Latin America have further illustrated our ability to be patient and disciplined as we seek to enter new markets. Our ability to leverage local teams to extend our existing relationships with our current customers and follow them into new markets provides us an unrivaled opportunity for growth in the region. 
Separately and as we've announced this morning, we've also launched operations in South Africa with the pending acquisition of up to approximately 1,400 towers from Cell C, the third-largest carrier in the country. Pursuant to this agreement, we may acquire up to 1,800 additional sites that are currently under construction or are slated for development over the next two-plus years. We are excited about the expansion of our operations into these new markets, and I'd like to take a moment to highlight some key reasons for investment in Peru, Colombia and South Africa. 
First, each of these markets represents a strong macroeconomic environment, providing us a solid foundation in which to invest. Second, the wireless markets in these geographies are competitive, with at least three main carriers operating competitively and a possibility of new entrants arising. Third, in both Peru and Colombia, there has been strong support from government entities to increase mobile broadband access throughout these nations. This support has been exhibited by recent 3G spectrum auctions in Colombia and possible auctions occurring in Peru in the near future. Both markets have been aggressively focused on increasing the quality of voice services provided to subscribers. As a more mature wireless market, South Africa has experienced strong demand for voice and advanced data services. As a result, we believe this market provides us a strong foundation to selectively grow from in sub-Sahara Africa. Overall, we believe that these new geographies will be a strong complement to our existing markets and will drive strong growth for us in the future.
Turning to Slide 14. And in conclusion, I'd like to summarize a few key takeaways for the quarter. Our third quarter results were solid with our performance supported by year-over-year improvements in commenced new business and our customer contract negotiations. We remain disciplined and consistent with respect to our investments in capital allocation strategy. 
In the third quarter, we added approximately 5,300 new sites to our portfolio, primarily in India with the closing of our acquisition of towers from Essar. We continue to seek opportunities to expand our asset base, including in those markets which we currently operate. As we've previously mentioned, we expect to close on additional acquisitions in Latin America in the fourth quarter, which we anticipate will be accompanied by further growth in the U.S., as well as our markets in Asia and EMEA. We have development teams located in various geographies who continue to explore acquisition and build-to-suit opportunities that we believe will add significant value and growth opportunity to our current portfolio.
With respect to our balance sheet, we currently have approximately $1.2 billion of liquidity and expect we will continue to utilize a portion of our current financial capacity to manage the pacing of our share repurchase program, which may fluctuate based on our current acquisition pipeline as we work our way towards our year-end target of 3.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. 
Further during the quarter, we completed our offering of the 5.05% senior notes due 2020 with the principal amount of $700 million, which provided us the ability to repay a portion of our revolver and increase our total liquidity. Finally, we will continue to monitor the capital markets to seek opportunistic transactions that lower our cost of debt in latter and extend our maturities. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim."
24766,114976251,85877,"American Tower Corporation (REIT), Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2010",2010-11-05,"Earnings Calls","American Tower Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Today, I'll focus my remarks on our strategic planning assumptions that will serve as the foundation for our 2011 guidance, which we'll lay out for you on our next quarterly call. Our future plans and expectations are predicated on three ma",2104,"Thanks, Tom. Today, I'll focus my remarks on our strategic planning assumptions that will serve as the foundation for our 2011 guidance, which we'll lay out for you on our next quarterly call. 
Our future plans and expectations are predicated on three major assumption sets: First, that advanced data deployments in the U.S. will drive demand for infrastructure, that level's commensurate with what we have experienced over the past number of years; second, that key international markets are also poised for advancements in wireless communications that will also generate demand for additional infrastructure; and third, that American Tower will effectively apply our operational expertise and financial strength, both domestically and internationally for the continued benefit of our shareholders. 
So let's start with the phenomenon of wireless data in the U.S. market from where American Tower derived 80% of its Tower revenue in the third quarter. We hold three basic hypotheses about the U.S. mobile data phenomenon: First, that consumers want this product, and just as in the previous decades, nearly every one at the U.S. subscribed to wireless voice service; and that over the course of the current decade, we believe that nearly everyone will subscribe to high-speed mobile data service too. As a result of this adoption curve that we expect, increasing data usage for subscriber and higher transmission speeds, we anticipate that mobile data consumption will double every year for at least the next four years.
Our second hypothesis is around the U.S. wireless data phenomenon that the leading U.S. wireless carriers are fully committed to launching robust 3G and 4G data services, and that these companies are growing both revenue and operating profit as a result. Thereby, that will further justify ongoing investment by them. For example, AT&T just announced wireless service revenue growth in the third quarter of over 10%, nearly 3/4 of which was driven by data. Moreover at AT&T's wireless operating income increased by 15% and therefore, half again faster than revenue growth. Consequently, AT&T has shifted its investment priority meaningfully towards wireless. Its year-to-date wireless CapEx was up over 55%, and the company is on a pace to invest $8 billion in wireless capital expenditures this year.
Now second example is Verizon whose wireless service revenue growth in Q3 was about 8%, all of which was attributable to data. Also at Verizon, wireless EBITDA grew at over 11%, half again above the revenue growth rate. Therefore, Verizon's also shifted its investment priority meaningfully to wireless. Its year-to-date wireless CapEx was up over 20%, and it's also on a pace to invest $8 billion in wireless capital expenditures this year.
Our third hypothesis regarding the U.S. is that the market is so large and competitive that all major wireless service providers must eventually offer their customers a robust data product in order to be successful. Each carrier will have to overcome whatever challenges that may be facing to deliver high-grade 3G and/or 4G services, while at the same time, carefully managing churn risk out their existing customer base. And for both Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile USA, spectrum availability is a critical component to sustaining their current customer bases while preparing to deliver data services that will ultimately be able to compete with Verizon and AT&T's 4G service at 700 megahertz. 
Currently, two entities control the spectrum that could make these competitive services a reality. One is Clearwire, with over 100 megahertz of spectrum. The other is LightSquared with about 60 megahertz of spectrum. While there are a few possible combinations and permutations here, we believe that some or all of these 160 megahertz of spectrum will be utilized by Sprint Nextel and/or by T-Mobile for advanced wireless data services. 
While specific outcomes are not yet known, the possibilities include a sale of some portion of Clearwire spectrum, a further investment by Sprint or public investors in Clearwire or a joint venture of wholesale arrangement between one or more carriers in LightSquared. Therefore, we do believe that both Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile will ultimately get access to sufficient spectrum, and that they'll further invest in next-generation data services to remain competitive in the U.S. market. Any of the aforementioned outcomes here would then be a positive for the tower industry in the U.S. 
Moreover, MetroPCS, Leap, U.S. Cellular and other regional carriers will also need to garner access to spectrum or service for 4G and make the necessary investments in data to also stay competitive. So the synthesis of all of this in our planning process is that we expect solid new business opportunities for us in the U.S. going forward, and that churn rate should be manageable, especially with analog broadcast churn behind us. We see our company stepping up its ongoing CapEx investments somewhat in the U.S. We also plan to bump up our traditional pace of new tower and indoor DAS system builds. We'll also advance our investments in our newer products expansions such as outdoor DAS and shared generators, so these types of products will still be considered a niche in the broader scope of current network deployments.
We also maintain our interest in acquiring assets in the U.S. where we can find opportunities that meet our valuation standards. But when those are not available, we have other investment opportunities internationally as you've heard, as well as our share repurchase program that's already in place. 
Let's now turn from the vibrant U.S. market to our second major planning assumption, and as the key international markets are also poised for advancements in wireless communication. And as a result, we expect strong demand for communications infrastructure in these markets that will be faster in rate and/or longer in duration than even in the U.S.
Through our multi-year investments in regionally deployed teams and business processes in systems development, we feel that American Tower is uniquely positioned to leverage our existing international assets and to make effective new investments in three target areas: Latin America, South Central Asia, primarily India; and select countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In each of these targeted areas, we intend to have one or two anchor stores and then to bolt on, choose an adjacent markets to gain customer and operating synergies. Given our 10 years operating in the region, Latin America is the furthest advanced in respect to this approach. Our two anchor stores, Mexico and Brazil, have mature business systems, long-standing customer relationships and experienced and capable management teams.
In 2010, we achieved our objective of launching operations in all of our currently targeted bolt-on markets in the region: Chile, Peru and Colombia. In all three of these new markets, we have common customers from our anchor stores. We've ceded U.S. and regional management into key leadership positions, and we're utilizing common companies systems and shared services from our anchor stores. 
With additional voice penetration to come in many of our Latin America markets, new spectrum and data services being deployed in all of them and a competitive wireless market of at least three carriers in each country, we see excellent prospects for leasing up the assets we own and that we have under contract, as well as strong potential for new asset acquisitions in the region going forward. 
2010 was also the year that we achieved our original strategic objective in India, reaching sufficient scale of the market to be a meaningful supplier to our customers and to reach our initial internal financial targets for EBITDA contribution and return on investment. We still view India as the fastest-growing major wireless market in the world. With just a bit over 50% voice penetration in India as of mid-2010, this market has plenty of upside at voice subscribers, which will take years to fulfill. Moreover, both 3G and fixed wireless spectrum auctions were held recently in India. And as a result, the development of both mobile and fixed wireless services will accelerate in a country that lacks an extensive existing cable or DSL wire data network. 
Not only has India found a substantial wireless, voice and data growth, but it's wireless carrier market is also very competitive, with 12 to 14 service providers in each region of the country. We fully expect that there will be carrier consolidation in India. However, we do anticipate that this will take some time to play out, and in the end, there is still likely to be at least six or seven players per region. And as a reference point today, approximately 90% of our revenue in India is from the seven largest carriers.
In 2011, our major goals for our India operation are to drive leasing activity on our base of approximately 8,000 towers including those recently acquired in the Essar transaction, also, to pursue an active program for building additional towers and to seek and evaluate any additional complementary assets that would enhance our tower portfolio footprint.
We're also very pleased to announce the launch of our first market in the Europe, Middle East, Africa or as we call it, the EMEA region. Similar to Brazil in South America and India in South Asia, South Africa is the obvious anchor store market for sub-Saharan Africa. South Africa firmly meets our country-level qualification criteria for developing market investments and has a competitive wireless carrier environment with three established carriers today, and other entrants expected as well. We, therefore, view South Africa both as a highly attractive market in and of itself, and as a solid platform from which to closely evaluate our very short list of other specifically targeted markets and counterparties in that region. 
In summary, our international expansion initiative has always been designed to add diversified sources of growth to complement our foundational U.S. business from which we also expect strong growth. We're now succeeding in this endeavor on three dimensions: in Latin America, in India and now in Africa. So we're very excited about what this will mean in terms of total company growth in 2011 and beyond. 
Finally, our planning assumptions include our demonstrated ability to drive operational excellence in our existing and new markets, to maintain a strong balance sheet that provides access to capital for our expansion initiatives and to continually optimize our corporate structure. All these designed to maximize benefits to our shareholders. As to operational excellence, we've made advanced investment in people and financial resources over the past three years to pursue business development opportunities in new markets and for product expansions such as outdoor DAS. We believe that those investments are about to pay off in terms of future revenue and operating profit growth. 
In addition, during this period of time, we've improved or maintained our company's operating margins and simultaneously expanded our return on invested capital as Tom's pointed out. Our goals are to continue to deliver this type of performance on each of these key metrics as we integrate the many acquisitions and newly built towers from 2010, while perhaps adding even more assets as we go along.
We'll also plan to maintain a strong balance sheet with financial leverage within that 3x to 5x EBITDA range. We continue to believe that this range does provide us with the optimal mix of enhanced shareholder returns, maintaining our broad access to capital of relatively low cost by our investment grade credit rating too. So many of the transactions that we're signing and closing this year, in fact, resulted from discussions that were either initiated or sustained during the financial crisis. 
By credibly maintaining access to capital during that period, we preserved our ability to initiate or sustain new market entry and acquisition projects with counterparties. Also within our planning horizon is optimizing our corporate structure. As we've mentioned previously, the company is actively working to fully understand, evaluate and prepare for a potential conversion to a real estate investment trust or REIT. While there has not yet been a decision to take this step, we are taking actions that we believe are needed to keep this option available to us.
Before we move on to your questions, I would like to take a moment to recognize our dedicated employees throughout the company who work together to deliver the type of performance that Tom described in such detail, while also driving forward the many growth initiatives that I have outlined for you today. While we do celebrate our success, I can assure you that we're not all at all complacent. We're all looking forward to a strong finish to this year, thereby generating strong momentum into 2011. 
So thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. And now, operator, we'll open it up for questions."

I mean, particularly now, when you take a look a lot of the international investments we've done, international expansion, that gives us additional places from which to grow. So we don't think it will impact our growth rates in 2011. With regards to the REIT and the bonus depreciation, that is an opportunity for us. I mean, we've been able to take advantage of bonus depreciation in prior years. Given our level of capital deployment, we're looking for additional depreciation probably, bonus depreciation in the area of $30 million to $40 million to kind of $50 million, if you will, of additional depreciation.

One is to get co-location by right as we call it, meaning that have those zoning barriers to co-locations or augmentations on existing towers. That's something I think all tower companies can agree on and all carriers can agree on as a good thing. And then second initiative, which again we're hopeful that we'll come to fruition, is that the public safety network, the spectrum and the leadership that needs to come around the for it to get deployed.

But AT&T is moving strong ahead with both 3G bolstering that network, which is again, 3G is the primary network for all the carriers today that the high-speed data that we're all using and experiencing is coming from. So that 3G network we think will remain an investment priority for AT&T and others. And they're going to start their initial LTE deployments too. There'll be some cell splitting we think by that company as it adds more and more heavy-use devices well. Verizon and other national carrier, again, has to keep developing. We think it's 3G network into next year. They're all further advanced on the schedule of their LTE deployment and have a robust plan publicly stated for next year as well. So the two largest national carriers in terms of subscribers we think are going to do as well for us next year as they've done for us this year. And then T-Mobile, I think, will also be a major participant next year, probably, hopefully, more so than this. And Sprint Nextel, same situation as they kind of move into high-speed data projects as well. When it comes to Clearwire, LightSquared and others, as I said in my prepared remarks, that spectrum that they control is highly valuable. And if it comes online a quarter plus or minus, or it's public or its private investors that help get it out there, or it's a JV or a wholesale agreement, it's going to happen and it's going to benefit the tower industry. So again, through the course of 2011, we think that those companies are, if not both at least one, will be able to keep that form. So the U.S. should be a good market for all the tower companies that participate in 2011. Moving into Latin America, as we've talked about, there've been spectrum auctions in almost every country that we have assets in now. And that's up to five countries in Latin America, Mexico, Brazil, especially since we have large portfolios there with established customer contract relationships. Again, I think if you compare this year to next year, they should be at higher run rate, the new business, than the standard U.S. rate over the years. And that's growing from a little bit weaker the last year or two as the spectrum auctions were happening. India is in the midst of I think some pent-up demand. It's going to be released in 2011. Again, spectrum auctions occurred. Funding is needed to come in behind it for the network build. That's starting and has happened. And there's also been some equipment security issues that are being cleared, as our understanding, and there'll be some pent-up demand released from those issues in 2011 as well. And in South Africa, I think one of the questions earlier mentioned, really high-growth market. South Africa is pretty developed, which we see as a good thing. But there's lots of upside on data deployments in South Africa, a new entrant coming in. And one of the things that we're striving to do in all of these places that we've been talking about today, these new countries for us, is really drive and introduce the co-location business model to places where it really hasn't been used before. And so, South Africa offers us some upside there. And if we can demonstrate success there, there'll probably be a couple of other countries that, that model will fit as well."

I guess first, Tom, kind of looking at last quarter's 2010 outlook revenue bridge and this quarter's updated 2010 outlook revenue bridge, we lowered the high end of the new business revenue opportunity, but we've added presumably incremental revenue opportunity from this mystery customer and the new contract there. I was wondering if you can kind of square that. Should we be expecting it to be an incremental contributor as soon as the fourth quarter? And if so, what opportunities went away relative to what could have been there? And then the second question is on the REIT conversion topic. Obviously, it's important to I think a lot of investors. It seems like you guys have been moving towards it, and people, each step of the way, are concerned that whether it's a tax law change or some other thing that it's going to get pushed out and deferred and kicked down the road. Could you kind of walk us through what are the actual things that would change between here and say, your course and speed running out of NOLs in 2012, that would really impact your thought process about the timetable for REIT conversion?"

I think on the new business, we just kind of honed it in a little bit. We have more clearly visibility in terms of looking at the fourth quarter given that now we're at the end of the third quarter, and halfway even through the fourth quarter. So we just kind of honed in and tightened, if you will, the range on new business. No, don't take from that any indication in terms of how we're looking at new business or growth from the year. We still think it's a terrific year. We had commenced revenue in the third quarter of over 40% greater and signed up 15% to 20% greater. So we're very optimistic in terms of 2010 and how we're going to finish strong for 2010 and what that means for 2011. With regards to the REIT, given the size of our business, there are very few tax law changes that are going to significantly impact how we're thinking about the overall timing of it. It can change a little bit on the edges, if you will, kind of the bonus depreciation, those types of things. But that's not going to change really significantly at all in terms of the timing. It's really a function of us being ready. It's a function of us getting all the approvals that we need. It's a function of us getting through all the evaluation that we have to do in terms of looking at our portfolio of products and services and how we're going to structure that and how we'll get comfort from that relative to discussions that we're having with the IRS. So I don't see any tax law changes candidly on the horizon that's going to significantly impact the way we're thinking about it, the timing. And again, I'm still looking in that 2012 time frame."

Please note that we've posted a brief presentation to accompany this morning's call on our website at www.americantower.com. If you haven't done so already, you may want to download the presentation as we will refer to it at various times throughout our prepared remarks.
The agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: I will provide a brief introduction and highlight certain key metrics from our third quarter financial results. Following this, Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss our financial results and provide an overview of our expectations for the remainder of 2010. And finally, Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, will give closing remarks, including his current thoughts on key industry trends. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions.
To maximize participation during the question-and-answer portion of the call, we kindly ask that you limit your questions to no more than two parts, and we we’ll do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the allotted time. Before I begin, I would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding our 2010 outlook, our stock repurchase program, our pending acquisitions and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.
Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's press release and those set forth in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2010, and in our other filings with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
And with that, I'd like to begin the call with some highlights from our third quarter results. Please turn to Slide 4 of the presentation, which provides a summary of our results compared against the prior-year period. We reported total revenues of approximately $513 million, reflecting growth of over 15% from the prior-year period. Tom will provide additional color on the core growth of our Rental and Management segment, which excludes the impact of foreign currency, straight-line lease accounting and a onetime gain from the prior-year period. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was approximately $350 million, which is an increase of over 15% from the prior year. Additionally, our operating income for the quarter increased over 19% to approximately $213 million.
Income from continuing operations, including income from noncontrolling interests, was approximately $94 million or $0.23 per basic and diluted common share. And now I would like to turn the call over to Tom, who will discuss our results in more detail."
24766,114976251,86007,"American Tower Corporation (REIT), Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2010",2010-11-05,"Earnings Calls","American Tower Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Leah, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that our third quarter 2010 results came in ahead of plan as we continue to execute and close out on our strategic priorities for the year. If you’ll please turn to Slide 5, I'd like to b",2777,"Thanks, Leah, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that our third quarter 2010 results came in ahead of plan as we continue to execute and close out on our strategic priorities for the year. 
If you’ll please turn to Slide 5, I'd like to begin with some highlights from our Rental and Management segment. Overall, we reported Rental and Management segment revenue growth of 16.1%. Core growth in Rental and Management segment revenue was 11.6% relative to the third quarter of 2009, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, which positively impacted our reported results by 0.8%, straight-line, which positively impacted our reported results by 5.7% and a onetime gain from the third quarter of 2009, which is related to a onetime termination fee, which we received from one of our broadcast customers.
Additionally and as I highlighted on our last call, three discrete items continue to impact our results during 2010. These items include the impact of broadcast analog churn, the completion of a customer take-or-pay agreement and a customer settlement, which combined, negatively impacted our reported revenue by approximately 1.7%. Excluding the impact of these items, our core growth would have been over 13%.
Excluding the impact of these discrete items, core Tower revenue growth in the United States was 10.3%, of which 7.8% was generated from sites owned during the full comparable period, and 2.5% was generated from new sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the third quarter of 2009. In addition, during the quarter, our U.S. division continued to experience a strong leasing environment with total signed new business up by approximately 18% relative to the same quarter of 2009. Furthermore, amendment activity continued to increase, accounting for approximately 45% of our signed new business in the quarter.
Our solid performance in the U.S. was complemented by core growth of 27% in revenues from our international markets, which reflects our acquisition of towers from Essar, which contributed nearly $15 million or approximately 3.5% to our total revenue growth for the quarter. And as a result of our international expansion, our pass-through revenue, which represents principally land and fuel expenses that we incur and are able to get reimbursed by our customers, has increased by approximately $9 million from the year-ago period, which is primarily attributable to our growth in India.
Finally, our results include a year-over-year increase of over $25 million in straight-line revenue, which is a result of our successful customer contract extensions in the United States. Nearly $21 million of the increase for the quarter was a result of a new master lease agreement with one of our U.S. customers, which was completed during the quarter. 
Before I move on to the rest of our financial results, I'd like to take a minute to walk you through some of the highlights of this new agreement and how it provides key strategic benefits for both parties. First, as our customers seek to add additional equipment to their existing tower sites to meet the rapidly growing demand for data services efficiently and with flexibility, our new agreement essentially provides our customer the ability to install additional equipment on their existing RAD centers in exchange for an incremental fixed annual increase in their run rate billing.
Therefore, the new agreement provides speed-to-market advantages for our customer, while providing us with a committed level of annual cash revenue growth above their recent historical levels. Finally, we've extended the remaining average current term of our leases with them to 10 years, which provides further stability to our cash flows. 
Turning to Slide 6. Our reported adjusted EBITDA growth relative to the third quarter of 2009 was 15.1%, with core growth for the quarter at 8.4% on a currency-neutral basis and excluding the impacts of straight-line lease accounting, as well as the onetime item, which I mentioned earlier.
Further adjusting for the 2010 discrete items, which negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA growth by 2.4%, our core growth would have been nearly 11%. During the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 68%, and our adjusted EBITDA conversion rate was approximately 66%, which was a direct result of the following: the $9 million increase in pass-through revenue and expense as I mentioned earlier, negatively impacted our conversion rate by approximately 10%. Additionally, since the beginning of the third quarter of 2009, we've added over 7,500 new sites to our portfolio, which currently have gross margins of approximately 57% due to their average tenancy of approximately 1.6%. 
As we continue to increase the utilization of these sites, we expect their margins will approach our legacy portfolio levels. Excluding the impact of both pass-through revenue and the new sites we have added over the past 12 months, our EBITDA conversion rate would have been over 90%. 
Furthermore, during the third quarter, we continued to make selective investments in our regional overhead, systems and corporate functions. In addition to our ongoing costs related to certain global business development initiatives, our main focus continues to be on our key projects for 2010, including our IT initiatives such as global implementations of common financial consolidation systems, as well as our ongoing due diligence with respect to a possible REIT conversion. We have made substantial progress in these initiatives year-to-date, and will continue this focus for the remainder of the year.
As outlined in Slide 7, during the third quarter, we continued our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Specifically, we spent approximately $96 million on total capital expenditures, including $54 million of spending on discretionary capital projects, primarily related to the construction of 196 new sites and $23 million on land purchases.
In addition, during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of 81 sites in the United States and launched operations in Peru and Colombia as a result of our acquisition of 356 sites from Telefónica. Further, we closed on our acquisitions of Essar, which increased our portfolio in India by over 4,600 sites for a cash consideration of approximately $430 million. Finally, consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we spent approximately $150 million to repurchase 3.2 million shares during the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 8. We delivered approximately 11% growth in recurring free cash flow and approximately 12% growth in recurring free cash flow per share relative to the third quarter of 2009. The growth was primarily driven by the following: our core growth in adjusted EBITDA and lower interest expense and higher interest income, which were primarily due to lower borrowing costs as a result of our recent refinancing activities and higher cash balances, respectively.
Our performance of recurring free cash flow year-to-date is on plan. And as a result, we continue to expect mid-teen annual growth in recurring free cash flow per share for the full year. These trends, along with our recent investments in attractive discretionary projects, including the acquisitions we've made over the past six quarters, have resulted in the consistent improvement in our return on invested capital, which has grown to 11.3%.
Turning to Slide 9. We've updated our prior outlook. We've increased the midpoint of our full year Rental and Management segment revenue outlook by $60 million and consequently our range to $1.92 billion to $1.93 billion, which now represents year-over-year growth of over 15% at the midpoint. 
This increase is primarily the result of the following key items: $18 million related to strong year-to-date core growth, which is progressing slightly ahead of plan as a result of slightly higher escalations and lower cancellations, plus the early close of our acquisition of towers from Essar and our recent and pending acquisitions in Latin America from Telefónica; and $42 million as a result of the impact of straight line and foreign currency, which is primarily related to our most recent customer contract extensions and master lease negotiations in the United States. Additionally, we've increased the midpoint of our full year adjusted EBITDA outlook by $48 million. And accordingly, our range to $1.34 billion to $1.35 billion, which now represents year-over-year growth of 13.7% at the midpoint. 
This increase is primarily the result of the following key items: increase in our Rental and Management segment revenue, offset by costs associated with the early close of our acquisition of towers from Essar and operating expenses and initial start-up costs associated with our new towers in our new Latin American markets, which brings their contribution for the purposes of our 2010 outlook to near zero.
Turning to Slide 10. We've provided an updated year-over-year bridge of our Rental and Management segment revenue growth based on our new outlook. Looking forward to 2011, while we will provide detailed guidance when we release our full year 2010 results, we wanted to provide you now with some expected trends related to our Rental and Management segment revenue core growth. Our contract escalators should continue to contribute approximately 3.5%. We currently expect that the leasing environment will be at or above comparable levels with 2010 based on trends such as our U.S. customers seeking to deploy initial 4G networks while continuing to aggressively invest to improve the quality of their 3G networks. 
This demand will be complemented by investments by our customers in our international markets who are seeking to roll out new spectrum. And we expect that our annual churn rate will attenuate and return to normalized levels between 1 ½% to 2%. Finally, we expect that our organic growth will be complemented by new tower builds. We also intend to pursue further acquisition opportunities in both the U.S. and select international markets.
Turning to Slide 11. And as I mentioned previously, we have increased our 2010 outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $48 million at the midpoint. 2010 has been a year of significant investment for American Tower as we've sought to further our global presence and uniquely position ourselves to capture a portion of the growing global demand for wireless services. As we have successfully entered new geographies, we have spurred revenue growth, while also incurring initial start-up costs. 
In addition, we have ramped our spending, particularly in new regions such as Africa where we currently have no operations. We believe that the current levels of development spending will position us well for future growth, and we are pleased that despite this incremental spending, we've been able to maintain our adjusted EBITDA margins at 68%.
Turning to Slide 12. I'd like to highlight our current investment profile for 2010. Through the combination of our outlook for cash provided by operations and incremental borrowing required to end the year at about 3.5x net debt to last 12 months adjusted EBITDA, we would expect to have access to over $1.7 billion of capital to invest in 2010. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, our primary objective will be to invest this cash back into our current portfolio through our annual capital plan, which is currently expected to be between $300 million and $320 million. This includes the expected construction of between 1,000 and 1,200 new sites, and the purchase of approximately $60 million of land under our towers.
In addition to CapEx, we will continue to seek to add new assets to our portfolio by pursuing select acquisitions. We've spent $665 million year-to-date. Finally, we expect to continue returning our excess capital to shareholders via our stock repurchase program. Year-to-date, we have spent approximately $346 million on our share repurchase program.
With our target of about 3.5x net debt as of year end, we currently estimate that our remaining capacity for investment in 2010 is approximately $390 million, which we intend to utilize in line with our capital allocation strategy. 
Turning to Slide 13, I would like to take a moment to discuss our recent development activities in our international markets. During the quarter and continuing the momentum of our recent market launch in Chile, we further expanded our Latin American presence with the launch of operations in both Peru and Colombia. As of today, we have closed on a total of 231 towers in Peru and 610 towers in Colombia. In addition, we expect to acquire an additional 1,300 towers in our existing markets in Latin America by the end of 2010.
Combined, these acquisitions would bring our Latin American portfolio to a total of over 6,500 towers. I'd also like to take this opportunity to update you on our progress in Chile, where our team recently completed an agreement with the new market entrant VTR, a subsidiary of Liberty Global. Since our launch of operations in June, our team has worked with our new customer as they plan the deployment of their recently awarded 3G spectrum. We expect VTR will utilize our towers as they pursue their nationwide rollout, plus we have agreed to acquire approximately 140 of their existing towers, which we would expect to complete during 2011. Our local teams and our new markets are off to a fast start, and we're very pleased with their progress so far.
We believe that our development activities in Latin America have further illustrated our ability to be patient and disciplined as we seek to enter new markets. Our ability to leverage local teams to extend our existing relationships with our current customers and follow them into new markets provides us an unrivaled opportunity for growth in the region. 
Separately and as we've announced this morning, we've also launched operations in South Africa with the pending acquisition of up to approximately 1,400 towers from Cell C, the third-largest carrier in the country. Pursuant to this agreement, we may acquire up to 1,800 additional sites that are currently under construction or are slated for development over the next two-plus years. We are excited about the expansion of our operations into these new markets, and I'd like to take a moment to highlight some key reasons for investment in Peru, Colombia and South Africa. 
First, each of these markets represents a strong macroeconomic environment, providing us a solid foundation in which to invest. Second, the wireless markets in these geographies are competitive, with at least three main carriers operating competitively and a possibility of new entrants arising. Third, in both Peru and Colombia, there has been strong support from government entities to increase mobile broadband access throughout these nations. This support has been exhibited by recent 3G spectrum auctions in Colombia and possible auctions occurring in Peru in the near future. Both markets have been aggressively focused on increasing the quality of voice services provided to subscribers. As a more mature wireless market, South Africa has experienced strong demand for voice and advanced data services. As a result, we believe this market provides us a strong foundation to selectively grow from in sub-Sahara Africa. Overall, we believe that these new geographies will be a strong complement to our existing markets and will drive strong growth for us in the future.
Turning to Slide 14. And in conclusion, I'd like to summarize a few key takeaways for the quarter. Our third quarter results were solid with our performance supported by year-over-year improvements in commenced new business and our customer contract renegotiations. We remain disciplined and consistent with respect to our investments in capital allocation strategy. 
In the third quarter, we added approximately 5,300 new sites to our portfolio, primarily in India with the closing of our acquisition of towers from Essar. We continue to seek opportunities to expand our asset base, including in those markets which we currently operate. As we've previously mentioned, we expect to close on additional acquisitions in Latin America in the fourth quarter, which we anticipate will be accompanied by further growth in the U.S., as well as our markets in Asia and EMEA. We have development teams located in various geographies who continue to explore acquisition and build-to-suit opportunities that we believe will add significant value and growth opportunity to our current portfolio.
With respect to our balance sheet, we currently have approximately $1.2 billion of liquidity and expect we will continue to utilize a portion of our current financial capacity to manage the pacing of our share repurchase program, which may fluctuate based on our current acquisition pipeline as we work our way towards our year-end target of 3.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. 
Further during the quarter, we completed our offering of the 5.05% senior notes due 2020 with the principal amount of $700 million, which provided us the ability to repay a portion of our revolver and increase our total liquidity. Finally, we will continue to monitor the capital markets to seek opportunistic transactions that lower our cost of debt and ladder and extend our maturities. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim."

Our future plans and expectations are predicated on three major assumption sets: First, that advanced data deployments in the U.S. will drive demand for infrastructure at levels commensurate with what we have experienced over the past number of years; second, that key international markets are also poised for advancements in wireless communications that will also generate demand for additional infrastructure; and third, that American Tower will effectively apply our operational expertise and financial strength, both domestically and internationally for the continued benefit of our shareholders. 
So let's start with the phenomenon of wireless data in the U.S. market from where American Tower derived 80% of its Tower revenue in the third quarter. We hold three basic hypotheses about the U.S. mobile data phenomenon: First, that consumers want this product and that just as in the previous decade, nearly everyone in the U.S. subscribed to wireless voice service; and that over the course of the current decade, we believe that nearly everyone will subscribe to high-speed mobile data service too. As a result of this adoption curve that we expect, increasing data usage for subscriber and higher transmission speeds, we anticipate that mobile data consumption will double every year for at least the next four years.
Our second hypothesis is around the U.S. wireless data phenomenon that the leading U.S. wireless carriers are fully committed to launching robust 3G and 4G data services, and that these companies are growing both revenue and operating profit as a result. Thereby, that will further justify ongoing investment by them. For example, AT&T just announced wireless service revenue growth in the third quarter of over 10%, nearly 3/4 of which was driven by data. Moreover AT&T's wireless operating income increased by 15% and therefore, half again faster than revenue growth. Consequently, AT&T has shifted its investment priority meaningfully towards wireless. Its year-to-date wireless CapEx was up over 55%, and the company is on a pace to invest $8 billion in wireless capital expenditures this year.
The second example is Verizon whose wireless service revenue growth in Q3 was about 8%, all of which was attributable to data. Also at Verizon, wireless EBITDA grew at over 11%, half again above the revenue growth rate. Therefore, Verizon's also shifted its investment priority meaningfully to wireless. Its year-to-date wireless CapEx was up over 20%, and it's also on a pace to invest $8 billion in wireless capital expenditures this year.
Our third hypothesis regarding the U.S. is that the market is so large and competitive that all major wireless service providers must eventually offer their customers a robust data product in order to be successful. Each carrier will have to overcome whatever challenges it may be facing to deliver high-grade 3G and/or 4G services, while at the same time, carefully managing churn risk out of their existing customer base. And for both Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile USA, spectrum availability is a critical component to sustaining their current customer bases while preparing to deliver data services that will ultimately be able to compete with Verizon and AT&T's 4G service at 700 megahertz. 
Currently, two entities control the spectrum that could make these competitive services a reality. One is Clearwire, with over 100 megahertz of spectrum. The other is LightSquared with about 60 megahertz of spectrum. While there are a few possible combinations and permutations here, we believe that some or all of this 160 megahertz of spectrum will be utilized by Sprint Nextel and/or by T-Mobile for advanced wireless data services. 
While specific outcomes are not yet known, the possibilities include a sale of some portion of Clearwire spectrum, a further investment by Sprint or public investors in Clearwire or a joint venture or wholesale arrangement between one or more carriers in LightSquared. Therefore, we do believe that both Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile will ultimately get access to sufficient spectrum, and that they'll further invest in next-generation data services to remain competitive in the U.S. market. Any of the aforementioned outcomes here would then be a positive for the tower industry in the U.S. 
Moreover, MetroPCS, Leap, U.S. Cellular and other regional carriers will also need to garner access to spectrum or service for 4G and make the necessary investments in data to also stay competitive. So the synthesis of all of this in our planning process is that we expect solid new business opportunities for us in the U.S. going forward, and that churn rate should be manageable, especially with analog broadcast churn behind us. We see our company stepping up its ongoing CapEx investments somewhat in the U.S. We also plan to bump up our traditional pace of new tower and indoor DAS system builds. We'll also advance our investments in our newer product expansions such as outdoor DAS and shared generators, though these types of products will still be considered a niche in the broader scope of current network deployments.
We also maintain our interest in acquiring assets in the U.S. where we can find opportunities that meet our valuation standards. But when those are not available, we have other investment opportunities internationally as you've heard, as well as our share repurchase program that's already in place. 
Let's now turn from the vibrant U.S. market to our second major planning assumption, and that’s that key international markets are also poised for advancements in wireless communication. And as a result, we expect strong demand for communications infrastructure in these markets that will be faster in rate and/or longer in duration than even the U.S.
Through our multi-year investments in regionally deployed teams and business processes and systems development, we feel that American Tower is uniquely positioned to leverage our existing international assets and to make effective new investments in three target areas: Latin America, South Central Asia, primarily India; and select countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In each of these targeted areas, we intend to have one or two anchor stores and then to bolt on chosen adjacent markets to gain customer and operating synergies. Given our 10 years operating in the region, Latin America is the furthest advanced in respect to this approach. Our two anchor stores, Mexico and Brazil, have mature business systems, long-standing customer relationships and experienced and capable management teams.
In 2010, we achieved our objective of launching operations in all of our currently targeted bolt-on markets in the region: Chile, Peru and Colombia. In all three of these new markets, we have common customers from our anchor stores. We've ceded U.S. and regional management into key leadership positions, and we're utilizing common company systems and shared services from our anchor stores. 
With additional voice penetration to come in many of our Latin America markets, new spectrum and data services being deployed in all of them and a competitive wireless market of at least three carriers in each country, we see excellent prospects for leasing up the assets we own and that we have under contract, as well as strong potential for new asset acquisitions in the region going forward. 
2010 was also the year that we achieved our original strategic objective in India, reaching sufficient scale in the market to be a meaningful supplier to our customers and to reach our initial internal financial targets for EBITDA contribution and return on investment. We still view India as the fastest-growing major wireless market in the world. With just a bit over 50% voice penetration in India as of mid-2010, this market has plenty of upside at voice subscribers, which will take years to fulfill. Moreover, both 3G and fixed wireless spectrum auctions were held recently in India. And as a result, the development of both mobile and fixed wireless services will accelerate in a country that lacks an extensive existing cable or DSL wire data network. 
Not only does India promise substantial wireless, voice and data growth, but its wireless carrier market is also very competitive, with 12 to 14 service providers in each region of the country. We fully expect there will be carrier consolidation in India. However, we do anticipate that this will take some time to play out, and in the end, there is still likely to be at least six or seven players per region. And as a reference point today, approximately 90% of our revenue in India is from the seven largest carriers.
In 2011, our major goals for our India operation are to drive leasing activity on our base of approximately 8,000 towers including those recently acquired in the Essar transaction. Also, to pursue an active program for building additional towers and to seek and evaluate any additional complementary assets that would enhance our tower portfolio footprint.
We're also very pleased to announce the launch of our first market in the Europe, Middle East, Africa or as we call it, the EMEA region. Similar to Brazil in South America and India in South Asia, South Africa is the obvious anchor store market for sub-Saharan Africa. South Africa firmly meets our country-level qualification criteria for developing market investments and has a competitive wireless carrier environment with three established carriers today, and other entrants expected as well. We, therefore, view South Africa both as a highly attractive market in and of itself, and as a solid platform from which to closely evaluate our very short list of other specifically targeted markets and counterparties in that region. 
In summary, our international expansion initiative has always been designed to add diversified sources of growth to complement our foundational U.S. business from which we also expect strong growth. We're now succeeding in this endeavor on three dimensions: in Latin America, in India and now in Africa. So we're very excited about what this will mean in terms of total company growth in 2011 and beyond. 
Finally, our planning assumptions include our demonstrated ability to drive operational excellence in our existing and new markets, to maintain a strong balance sheet that provides access to capital for our expansion initiatives and to continually optimize our corporate structure. All these designed to maximize benefits to our shareholders. As to operational excellence, we've made advanced investments in people and financial resources over the past three years to pursue business development opportunities in new markets and for product expansions such as outdoor DAS. We believe that those investments are about to pay off in terms of future revenue and operating profit growth. 
In addition, during this period of time, we've improved or maintained our company's operating margins and simultaneously expanded our return on invested capital as Tom's pointed out. Our goals are to continue to deliver this type of performance on each of these key metrics as we integrate the many acquisitions and newly built towers from 2010, while perhaps adding even more assets as we go along.
We'll also plan to maintain a strong balance sheet with financial leverage within that 3x to 5x EBITDA range. We continue to believe that this range does provide us with the optimal mix of enhanced shareholder returns, maintaining our broad access to capital of relatively low cost by our investment grade credit rating too. So many of the transactions that we're signing and closing this year, in fact, resulted from discussions that were either initiated or sustained during the financial crisis. 
By credibly maintaining access to capital during that period, we preserved our ability to initiate or sustain new market entry and acquisition projects with counterparties. Also within our planning horizon is optimizing our corporate structure. As we've mentioned previously, the company is actively working to fully understand, evaluate and prepare for a potential conversion to a real estate investment trust or REIT. While there has not yet been a decision to take this step, we are taking actions that we believe are needed to keep this option available to us.
Before we move on to your questions, I would like to take a moment to recognize our dedicated employees throughout the company who work together to deliver the type of performance that Tom described in such detail, while also driving forward the many growth initiatives that I have outlined for you today. While we do celebrate our success, I can assure you that we're not at all complacent. We're all looking forward to a strong finish to this year, thereby generating strong momentum into 2011. 
So thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. And now, operator, we'll open it up for questions."

However, as we've talked about, the average with Verizon is in the $300 range. So whether it's a wider bell curve or a narrower bell curve around that, we don't think the average is going to be all that much different going forward. As far as the election goes, it doesn't, we think, really impact our business. We have two priorities in Washington which we hope will continue to make progress. One is to get co-location by right as we call it, meaning that have those zoning barriers to co-locations or augmentations on existing towers. That's something I think all tower companies can agree on and all carriers can agree on is a good thing. And then second initiative, which again we're hopeful that will come to fruition, is that the public safety network, the spectrum and the leadership that needs to come around that for it to get deployed. And I think the election doesn't necessarily adversely affect either of those, and hopefully it positively affects them."

We'll start with the U.S., and some of the robust sources of next year's new business that we're anticipating -- and again, we'll come up with the actual guidance for you on our next call. But AT&T is moving strong ahead with both 3G bolstering that network, which is again, 3G is the primary network for all the carriers today that the high-speed data that we're all using and experiencing is coming from. So that 3G network we think will remain an investment priority for AT&T and others. And they're going to start their initial LTE deployments too. There'll be some cell splitting we think by that company as it adds more and more heavy-use devices as well. Verizon, another national carrier, again has to keep developing, we think, its 3G network into next year. They're a little further advanced on the schedule of their LTE deployment and have a robust plan publicly stated for next year as well. So the two largest national carriers in terms of subscribers we think are going to do as well for us next year as they've done for us this year. And then T-Mobile, I think, will also be a major participant next year, hopefully, more so than this. And Sprint Nextel, same situation as they kind of move into high-speed data projects as well. When it comes to Clearwire, LightSquared, others, as I said in my prepared remarks, that spectrum that they control is highly valuable. And if it comes online a quarter plus or minus, or it's public or its private investors that help get it out there, or it's a JV or a wholesale agreement, it's going to happen and it's going to benefit the tower industry. So again, through the course of 2011, we think that those companies are, if not both, at least one, will be able to keep deploying. So the U.S. should be a good market for all the tower companies that participate in 2011. Moving into Latin America, as we've talked about, there've been spectrum auctions in almost every country that we have assets in now. And that's up to five countries in Latin America, Mexico, Brazil, especially since we have large portfolios there with established customer contract relationships. Again, I think if you compare this year to next year, they should be at higher run rate, the new business, than the standard U.S. rate over the years. And that's growing from a little bit weaker the last year or two as the spectrum auctions were happening. India is in the midst of I think some pent-up demand. It's going to be released in 2011. Again, spectrum auctions occurred. Funding is needed to come in behind it for the network build. That's starting and has happened. And there's also been some equipment security issues that are being cleared, is our understanding, and there'll be some pent-up demand released from those issues in 2011 as well. And in South Africa, I think one of the questions earlier mentioned, really high-growth market. South Africa is pretty developed, which we see as a good thing. But there's lots of upside on data deployments in South Africa, a new entrant coming in. And one of the things that we're striving to do in all of these places that we've been talking about today, these new countries for us, is really drive and introduce the co-location business model to places where it really hasn't been used before. And so South Africa offers us some upside there. And if we can demonstrate success there, there'll probably be a couple of other countries that, that model will fit as well."

I think on the new business, we just kind of honed it in a little bit. We have more clear visibility in terms of looking at the fourth quarter given that now we're at the end of the third quarter and halfway even through the fourth quarter. So we just kind of honed in and tightened, if you will, the range on new business. No, don't take from that any indication in terms of how we're looking at new business or growth from the year. We still think it's a terrific year. We had commenced revenue in the third quarter of over 40% greater and signed up 15% to 20% greater. So we're very optimistic in terms of 2010 and how we're going to finish strong for 2010 and what that means for 2011. With regards to the REIT, given the size of our business, there are very few tax law changes that are going to significantly impact how we're thinking about the overall timing of it. It can change a little bit on the edges, if you will, kind of the bonus depreciation, those types of things. But that's not going to change really significantly at all in terms of the timing. It's really a function of us being ready. It's a function of us getting all the approvals that we need.

Tom will provide additional color on the core growth of our Rental and Management segment, which excludes the impact of foreign currency, straight-line lease accounting and a onetime gain from the prior-year period. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was approximately $350 million, which is an increase of over 15% from the prior year. Additionally, our operating income for the quarter increased over 19% to approximately $213 million.
Income from continuing operations, including income from noncontrolling interests, was approximately $94 million or $0.23 per basic and diluted common share. And now I would like to turn the call over to Tom, who will discuss our results in more detail."

I'm pleased to report that our third quarter 2010 results came in ahead of plan as we continue to execute and close out on our strategic priorities for the year. If you’ll please turn to Slide 5, I'd like to b",2777,"Thanks, Leah, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that our third quarter 2010 results came in ahead of plan as we continue to execute and close out on our strategic priorities for the year. 
If you’ll please turn to Slide 5, I'd like to begin with some highlights from our Rental and Management segment. Overall, we reported Rental and Management segment revenue growth of 16.1%. Core growth in Rental and Management segment revenue was 11.6% relative to the third quarter of 2009, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, which positively impacted our reported results by 0.8%, straight-line, which positively impacted our reported results by 5.7% and a onetime gain from the third quarter of 2009, which is related to a onetime termination fee, which we received from one of our broadcast customers.
Additionally and as I highlighted on our last call, three discrete items continue to impact our results during 2010. These items include the impact of broadcast analog churn, the completion of a customer take-or-pay agreement and a customer settlement, which combined, negatively impacted our reported revenue by approximately 1.7%. Excluding the impact of these items, our core growth would have been over 13%.
Excluding the impact of these discrete items, core Tower revenue growth in the United States was 10.3%, of which 7.8% was generated from sites owned during the full comparable period, and 2.5% was generated from new sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the third quarter of 2009. In addition, during the quarter, our U.S. division continued to experience a strong leasing environment with total signed new business up by approximately 18% relative to the same quarter of 2009. Furthermore, amendment activity continued to increase, accounting for approximately 45% of our signed new business in the quarter.
Our solid performance in the U.S. was complemented by core growth of 27% in revenues from our international markets, which reflects our acquisition of towers from Essar, which contributed nearly $15 million or approximately 3.5% to our total revenue growth for the quarter. And as a result of our international expansion, our pass-through revenue, which represents principally land and fuel expenses that we incur and are able to get reimbursed by our customers, has increased by approximately $9 million from the year-ago period, which is primarily attributable to our growth in India.
Finally, our results include a year-over-year increase of over $25 million in straight-line revenue, which is a result of our successful customer contract extensions in the United States. Nearly $21 million of the increase for the quarter was a result of a new master lease agreement with one of our U.S. customers, which was completed during the quarter. 
Before I move on to the rest of our financial results, I'd like to take a minute to walk you through some of the highlights of this new agreement and how it provides key strategic benefits for both parties. First, as our customers seek to add additional equipment to their existing tower sites to meet the rapidly growing demand for data services efficiently and with flexibility, our new agreement essentially provides our customer the ability to install additional equipment on their existing RAD centers in exchange for an incremental fixed annual increase in their run rate billing.
Therefore, the new agreement provides speed-to-market advantages for our customer, while providing us with a committed level of annual cash revenue growth above their recent historical levels. Finally, we've extended the remaining average current term of our leases with them to 10 years, which provides further stability to our cash flows. 
Turning to Slide 6. Our reported adjusted EBITDA growth relative to the third quarter of 2009 was 15.1%, with core growth for the quarter at 8.4% on a currency-neutral basis and excluding the impacts of straight-line lease accounting, as well as the onetime item, which I mentioned earlier.
Further adjusting for the 2010 discrete items, which negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA growth by 2.4%, our core growth would have been nearly 11%. During the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 68%, and our adjusted EBITDA conversion rate was approximately 66%, which was a direct result of the following: the $9 million increase in pass-through revenue and expense as I mentioned earlier, negatively impacted our conversion rate by approximately 10%. Additionally, since the beginning of the third quarter of 2009, we've added over 7,500 new sites to our portfolio, which currently have gross margins of approximately 57% due to their average tenancy of approximately 1.6%. 
As we continue to increase the utilization of these sites, we expect their margins will approach our legacy portfolio levels. Excluding the impact of both pass-through revenue and the new sites we have added over the past 12 months, our EBITDA conversion rate would have been over 90%. 
Furthermore, during the third quarter, we continued to make selective investments in our regional overhead, systems and corporate functions. In addition to our ongoing costs related to certain global business development initiatives, our main focus continues to be on our key projects for 2010, including our IT initiatives such as global implementations of common financial consolidation systems, as well as our ongoing due diligence with respect to a possible REIT conversion. We have made substantial progress in these initiatives year-to-date, and will continue this focus for the remainder of the year.
As outlined in Slide 7, during the third quarter, we continued our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Specifically, we spent approximately $96 million on total capital expenditures, including $54 million of spending on discretionary capital projects, primarily related to the construction of 196 new sites and $23 million on land purchases.
In addition, during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of 81 sites in the United States and launched operations in Peru and Colombia as a result of our acquisition of 356 sites from Telefónica. Further, we closed on our acquisitions of Essar, which increased our portfolio in India by over 4,600 sites for a cash consideration of approximately $430 million. Finally, consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we spent approximately $150 million to repurchase 3.2 million shares during the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 8. We delivered approximately 11% growth in recurring free cash flow and approximately 12% growth in recurring free cash flow per share relative to the third quarter of 2009. The growth was primarily driven by the following: our core growth in adjusted EBITDA and lower interest expense and higher interest income, which were primarily due to lower borrowing costs as a result of our recent refinancing activities and higher cash balances, respectively.
Our performance of recurring free cash flow year-to-date is on plan. And as a result, we continue to expect mid-teen annual growth in recurring free cash flow per share for the full year. These trends, along with our recent investments in attractive discretionary projects, including the acquisitions we've made over the past six quarters, have resulted in the consistent improvement in our return on invested capital, which has grown to 11.3%.
Turning to Slide 9. We've updated our prior outlook. We've increased the midpoint of our full year Rental and Management segment revenue outlook by $60 million and consequently our range to $1.92 billion to $1.93 billion, which now represents year-over-year growth of over 15% at the midpoint. 
This increase is primarily the result of the following key items: $18 million related to strong year-to-date core growth, which is progressing slightly ahead of plan as a result of slightly higher escalations and lower cancellations, plus the early close of our acquisition of towers from Essar and our recent and pending acquisitions in Latin America from Telefónica; and $42 million as a result of the impact of straight line and foreign currency, which is primarily related to our most recent customer contract extensions and master lease negotiations in the United States. Additionally, we've increased the midpoint of our full year adjusted EBITDA outlook by $48 million. And accordingly, our range to $1.34 billion to $1.35 billion, which now represents year-over-year growth of 13.7% at the midpoint. 
This increase is primarily the result of the following key items: increase in our Rental and Management segment revenue, offset by costs associated with the early close of our acquisition of towers from Essar and operating expenses and initial start-up costs associated with our new towers in our new Latin American markets, which brings their contribution for the purposes of our 2010 outlook to near zero.
Turning to Slide 10. We've provided an updated year-over-year bridge of our Rental and Management segment revenue growth based on our new outlook. Looking forward to 2011, while we will provide detailed guidance when we release our full year 2010 results, we wanted to provide you now with some expected trends related to our Rental and Management segment revenue core growth. Our contract escalators should continue to contribute approximately 3.5%. We currently expect that the leasing environment will be at or above comparable levels with 2010 based on trends such as our U.S. customers seeking to deploy initial 4G networks while continuing to aggressively invest to improve the quality of their 3G networks. 
This demand will be complemented by investments by our customers in our international markets who are seeking to roll out new spectrum. And we expect that our annual churn rate will attenuate and return to normalized levels between 1 ½% to 2%. Finally, we expect that our organic growth will be complemented by new tower builds. We also intend to pursue further acquisition opportunities in both the U.S. and select international markets.
Turning to Slide 11. And as I mentioned previously, we have increased our 2010 outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $48 million at the midpoint. 2010 has been a year of significant investment for American Tower as we've sought to further our global presence and uniquely position ourselves to capture a portion of the growing global demand for wireless services. As we have successfully entered new geographies, we have spurred revenue growth, while also incurring initial start-up costs. 
In addition, we have ramped our spending, particularly in new regions such as Africa where we currently have no operations. We believe that the current levels of development spending will position us well for future growth, and we are pleased that despite this incremental spending, we've been able to maintain our adjusted EBITDA margins at 68%.
Turning to Slide 12. I'd like to highlight our current investment profile for 2010. Through the combination of our outlook for cash provided by operations and incremental borrowing required to end the year at about 3.5x net debt to last 12 months adjusted EBITDA, we would expect to have access to over $1.7 billion of capital to invest in 2010. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, our primary objective will be to invest this cash back into our current portfolio through our annual capital plan, which is currently expected to be between $300 million and $320 million. This includes the expected construction of between 1,000 and 1,200 new sites, and the purchase of approximately $60 million of land under our towers.
In addition to CapEx, we will continue to seek to add new assets to our portfolio by pursuing select acquisitions. We've spent $665 million year-to-date. Finally, we expect to continue returning our excess capital to shareholders via our stock repurchase program. Year-to-date, we have spent approximately $346 million on our share repurchase program.
With our target of about 3.5x net debt as of year end, we currently estimate that our remaining capacity for investment in 2010 is approximately $390 million, which we intend to utilize in line with our capital allocation strategy. 
Turning to Slide 13, I would like to take a moment to discuss our recent development activities in our international markets. During the quarter and continuing the momentum of our recent market launch in Chile, we further expanded our Latin American presence with the launch of operations in both Peru and Colombia. As of today, we have closed on a total of 231 towers in Peru and 610 towers in Colombia. In addition, we expect to acquire an additional 1,300 towers in our existing markets in Latin America by the end of 2010.
Combined, these acquisitions would bring our Latin American portfolio to a total of over 6,500 towers. I'd also like to take this opportunity to update you on our progress in Chile, where our team recently completed an agreement with the new market entrant VTR, a subsidiary of Liberty Global. Since our launch of operations in June, our team has worked with our new customer as they plan the deployment of their recently awarded 3G spectrum. We expect VTR will utilize our towers as they pursue their nationwide rollout, plus we have agreed to acquire approximately 140 of their existing towers, which we would expect to complete during 2011. Our local teams and our new markets are off to a fast start, and we're very pleased with their progress so far.
We believe that our development activities in Latin America have further illustrated our ability to be patient and disciplined as we seek to enter new markets. Our ability to leverage local teams to extend our existing relationships with our current customers and follow them into new markets provides us an unrivaled opportunity for growth in the region. 
Separately and as we've announced this morning, we've also launched operations in South Africa with the pending acquisition of up to approximately 1,400 towers from Cell C, the third-largest carrier in the country. Pursuant to this agreement, we may acquire up to 1,800 additional sites that are currently under construction or are slated for development over the next two-plus years. We are excited about the expansion of our operations into these new markets, and I'd like to take a moment to highlight some key reasons for investment in Peru, Colombia and South Africa. 
First, each of these markets represents a strong macroeconomic environment, providing us a solid foundation in which to invest. Second, the wireless markets in these geographies are competitive, with at least three main carriers operating competitively and a possibility of new entrants arising. Third, in both Peru and Colombia, there has been strong support from government entities to increase mobile broadband access throughout these nations. This support has been exhibited by recent 3G spectrum auctions in Colombia and possible auctions occurring in Peru in the near future. Both markets have been aggressively focused on increasing the quality of voice services provided to subscribers. As a more mature wireless market, South Africa has experienced strong demand for voice and advanced data services. As a result, we believe this market provides us a strong foundation to selectively grow from in sub-Sahara Africa. Overall, we believe that these new geographies will be a strong complement to our existing markets and will drive strong growth for us in the future.
Turning to Slide 14. And in conclusion, I'd like to summarize a few key takeaways for the quarter. Our third quarter results were solid with our performance supported by year-over-year improvements in commenced new business and our customer contract renegotiations. We remain disciplined and consistent with respect to our investments in capital allocation strategy. 
In the third quarter, we added approximately 5,300 new sites to our portfolio, primarily in India with the closing of our acquisition of towers from Essar. We continue to seek opportunities to expand our asset base, including in those markets which we currently operate. As we've previously mentioned, we expect to close on additional acquisitions in Latin America in the fourth quarter, which we anticipate will be accompanied by further growth in the U.S., as well as our markets in Asia and EMEA. We have development teams located in various geographies who continue to explore acquisition and build-to-suit opportunities that we believe will add significant value and growth opportunity to our current portfolio.
With respect to our balance sheet, we currently have approximately $1.2 billion of liquidity and expect we will continue to utilize a portion of our current financial capacity to manage the pacing of our share repurchase program, which may fluctuate based on our current acquisition pipeline as we work our way towards our year-end target of 3.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. 
Further during the quarter, we completed our offering of the 5.05% senior notes due 2020 with the principal amount of $700 million, which provided us the ability to repay a portion of our revolver and increase our total liquidity. Finally, we will continue to monitor the capital markets to seek opportunistic transactions that lower our cost of debt and ladder and extend our maturities. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim."
24766,114976251,86142,"American Tower Corporation (REIT), Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2010",2010-11-05,"Earnings Calls","American Tower Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Today, I'll focus my remarks on our strategic planning assumptions that will serve as the foundation for our 2011 guidance, which we'll lay out for you on our next quarterly call. Our future plans and expectations are predicated on three ma",2099,"Thanks, Tom. Today, I'll focus my remarks on our strategic planning assumptions that will serve as the foundation for our 2011 guidance, which we'll lay out for you on our next quarterly call. 
Our future plans and expectations are predicated on three major assumption sets: First, that advanced data deployments in the U.S. will drive demand for infrastructure at levels commensurate with what we have experienced over the past number of years; second, that key international markets are also poised for advancements in wireless communications that will also generate demand for additional infrastructure; and third, that American Tower will effectively apply our operational expertise and financial strength, both domestically and internationally for the continued benefit of our shareholders. 
So let's start with the phenomenon of wireless data in the U.S. market from where American Tower derived 80% of its Tower revenue in the third quarter. We hold three basic hypotheses about the U.S. mobile data phenomenon: First, that consumers want this product and that just as in the previous decade, nearly everyone in the U.S. subscribed to wireless voice service; and that over the course of the current decade, we believe that nearly everyone will subscribe to high-speed mobile data service too. As a result of this adoption curve that we expect, increasing data usage for subscriber and higher transmission speeds, we anticipate that mobile data consumption will double every year for at least the next four years.
Our second hypothesis is around the U.S. wireless data phenomenon that the leading U.S. wireless carriers are fully committed to launching robust 3G and 4G data services, and that these companies are growing both revenue and operating profit as a result. Thereby, that will further justify ongoing investment by them. For example, AT&T just announced wireless service revenue growth in the third quarter of over 10%, nearly 3/4 of which was driven by data. Moreover AT&T's wireless operating income increased by 15% and therefore, half again faster than revenue growth. Consequently, AT&T has shifted its investment priority meaningfully towards wireless. Its year-to-date wireless CapEx was up over 55%, and the company is on a pace to invest $8 billion in wireless capital expenditures this year.
The second example is Verizon whose wireless service revenue growth in Q3 was about 8%, all of which was attributable to data. Also at Verizon, wireless EBITDA grew at over 11%, half again above the revenue growth rate. Therefore, Verizon's also shifted its investment priority meaningfully to wireless. Its year-to-date wireless CapEx was up over 20%, and it's also on a pace to invest $8 billion in wireless capital expenditures this year.
Our third hypothesis regarding the U.S. is that the market is so large and competitive that all major wireless service providers must eventually offer their customers a robust data product in order to be successful. Each carrier will have to overcome whatever challenges it may be facing to deliver high-grade 3G and/or 4G services, while at the same time, carefully managing churn risk out of their existing customer base. And for both Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile USA, spectrum availability is a critical component to sustaining their current customer bases while preparing to deliver data services that will ultimately be able to compete with Verizon and AT&T's 4G service at 700 megahertz. 
Currently, two entities control the spectrum that could make these competitive services a reality. One is Clearwire, with over 100 megahertz of spectrum. The other is LightSquared with about 60 megahertz of spectrum. While there are a few possible combinations and permutations here, we believe that some or all of this 160 megahertz of spectrum will be utilized by Sprint Nextel and/or by T-Mobile for advanced wireless data services. 
While specific outcomes are not yet known, the possibilities include a sale of some portion of Clearwire spectrum, a further investment by Sprint or public investors in Clearwire or a joint venture or wholesale arrangement between one or more carriers in LightSquared. Therefore, we do believe that both Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile will ultimately get access to sufficient spectrum, and that they'll further invest in next-generation data services to remain competitive in the U.S. market. Any of the aforementioned outcomes here would then be a positive for the tower industry in the U.S. 
Moreover, MetroPCS, Leap, U.S. Cellular and other regional carriers will also need to garner access to spectrum or service for 4G and make the necessary investments in data to also stay competitive. So the synthesis of all of this in our planning process is that we expect solid new business opportunities for us in the U.S. going forward, and that churn rate should be manageable, especially with analog broadcast churn behind us. We see our company stepping up its ongoing CapEx investments somewhat in the U.S. We also plan to bump up our traditional pace of new tower and indoor DAS system builds. We'll also advance our investments in our newer product expansions such as outdoor DAS and shared generators, though these types of products will still be considered a niche in the broader scope of current network deployments.
We also maintain our interest in acquiring assets in the U.S. where we can find opportunities that meet our valuation standards. But when those are not available, we have other investment opportunities internationally as you've heard, as well as our share repurchase program that's already in place. 
Let's now turn from the vibrant U.S. market to our second major planning assumption, and that’s that key international markets are also poised for advancements in wireless communication. And as a result, we expect strong demand for communications infrastructure in these markets that will be faster in rate and/or longer in duration than even the U.S.
Through our multi-year investments in regionally deployed teams and business processes and systems development, we feel that American Tower is uniquely positioned to leverage our existing international assets and to make effective new investments in three target areas: Latin America, South Central Asia, primarily India; and select countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In each of these targeted areas, we intend to have one or two anchor stores and then to bolt on chosen adjacent markets to gain customer and operating synergies. Given our 10 years operating in the region, Latin America is the furthest advanced in respect to this approach. Our two anchor stores, Mexico and Brazil, have mature business systems, long-standing customer relationships and experienced and capable management teams.
In 2010, we achieved our objective of launching operations in all of our currently targeted bolt-on markets in the region: Chile, Peru and Colombia. In all three of these new markets, we have common customers from our anchor stores. We've ceded U.S. and regional management into key leadership positions, and we're utilizing common company systems and shared services from our anchor stores. 
With additional voice penetration to come in many of our Latin America markets, new spectrum and data services being deployed in all of them and a competitive wireless market of at least three carriers in each country, we see excellent prospects for leasing up the assets we own and that we have under contract, as well as strong potential for new asset acquisitions in the region going forward. 
2010 was also the year that we achieved our original strategic objective in India, reaching sufficient scale in the market to be a meaningful supplier to our customers and to reach our initial internal financial targets for EBITDA contribution and return on investment. We still view India as the fastest-growing major wireless market in the world. With just a bit over 50% voice penetration in India as of mid-2010, this market has plenty of upside at voice subscribers, which will take years to fulfill. Moreover, both 3G and fixed wireless spectrum auctions were held recently in India. And as a result, the development of both mobile and fixed wireless services will accelerate in a country that lacks an extensive existing cable or DSL wire data network. 
Not only does India promise substantial wireless, voice and data growth, but its wireless carrier market is also very competitive, with 12 to 14 service providers in each region of the country. We fully expect there will be carrier consolidation in India. However, we do anticipate that this will take some time to play out, and in the end, there is still likely to be at least six or seven players per region. And as a reference point today, approximately 90% of our revenue in India is from the seven largest carriers.
In 2011, our major goals for our India operation are to drive leasing activity on our base of approximately 8,000 towers including those recently acquired in the Essar transaction. Also, to pursue an active program for building additional towers and to seek and evaluate any additional complementary assets that would enhance our tower portfolio footprint.
We're also very pleased to announce the launch of our first market in the Europe, Middle East, Africa or as we call it, the EMEA region. Similar to Brazil in South America and India in South Asia, South Africa is the obvious anchor store market for sub-Saharan Africa. South Africa firmly meets our country-level qualification criteria for developing market investments and has a competitive wireless carrier environment with three established carriers today, and other entrants expected as well. We, therefore, view South Africa both as a highly attractive market in and of itself, and as a solid platform from which to closely evaluate our very short list of other specifically targeted markets and counterparties in that region. 
In summary, our international expansion initiative has always been designed to add diversified sources of growth to complement our foundational U.S. business from which we also expect strong growth. We're now succeeding in this endeavor on three dimensions: in Latin America, in India and now in Africa. So we're very excited about what this will mean in terms of total company growth in 2011 and beyond. 
Finally, our planning assumptions include our demonstrated ability to drive operational excellence in our existing and new markets, to maintain a strong balance sheet that provides access to capital for our expansion initiatives and to continually optimize our corporate structure. All these designed to maximize benefits to our shareholders. As to operational excellence, we've made advanced investments in people and financial resources over the past three years to pursue business development opportunities in new markets and for product expansions such as outdoor DAS. We believe that those investments are about to pay off in terms of future revenue and operating profit growth. 
In addition, during this period of time, we've improved or maintained our company's operating margins and simultaneously expanded our return on invested capital as Tom's pointed out. Our goals are to continue to deliver this type of performance on each of these key metrics as we integrate the many acquisitions and newly built towers from 2010, while perhaps adding even more assets as we go along.
We'll also plan to maintain a strong balance sheet with financial leverage within that 3x to 5x EBITDA range. We continue to believe that this range does provide us with the optimal mix of enhanced shareholder returns, maintaining our broad access to capital of relatively low cost by our investment grade credit rating too. So many of the transactions that we're signing and closing this year, in fact, resulted from discussions that were either initiated or sustained during the financial crisis. 
By credibly maintaining access to capital during that period, we preserved our ability to initiate or sustain new market entry and acquisition projects with counterparties. Also within our planning horizon is optimizing our corporate structure. As we've mentioned previously, the company is actively working to fully understand, evaluate and prepare for a potential conversion to a real estate investment trust or REIT. While there has not yet been a decision to take this step, we are taking actions that we believe are needed to keep this option available to us.
Before we move on to your questions, I would like to take a moment to recognize our dedicated employees throughout the company who work together to deliver the type of performance that Tom described in such detail, while also driving forward the many growth initiatives that I have outlined for you today. While we do celebrate our success, I can assure you that we're not at all complacent. We're all looking forward to a strong finish to this year, thereby generating strong momentum into 2011. 
So thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. And now, operator, we'll open it up for questions."

We'll start with the U.S., and some of the robust sources of next year's new business that we're anticipating -- and again, we'll come up with the actual guidance for you on our next call. But AT&T is moving strong ahead with both 3G bolstering that network, which is again, 3G is the primary network for all the carriers today that the high-speed data that we're all using and experiencing is coming from. So that 3G network we think will remain an investment priority for AT&T and others. And they're going to start their initial LTE deployments too. There'll be some cell splitting we think by that company as it adds more and more heavy-use devices as well. Verizon, another national carrier, again has to keep developing, we think, its 3G network into next year. They're a little further advanced on the schedule of their LTE deployment and have a robust plan publicly stated for next year as well. So the two largest national carriers in terms of subscribers we think are going to do as well for us next year as they've done for us this year. And then T-Mobile, I think, will also be a major participant next year, hopefully, more so than this. And Sprint Nextel, same situation as they kind of move into high-speed data projects as well. When it comes to Clearwire, LightSquared, others, as I said in my prepared remarks, that spectrum that they control is highly valuable. And if it comes online a quarter plus or minus, or it's public or its private investors that help get it out there, or it's a JV or a wholesale agreement, it's going to happen and it's going to benefit the tower industry. So again, through the course of 2011, we think that those companies are, if not both, at least one, will be able to keep deploying. So the U.S. should be a good market for all the tower companies that participate in 2011. Moving into Latin America, as we've talked about, there've been spectrum auctions in almost every country that we have assets in now. And that's up to five countries in Latin America, Mexico, Brazil, especially since we have large portfolios there with established customer contract relationships. Again, I think if you compare this year to next year, they should be at higher run rate, the new business, than the standard U.S. rate over the years. And that's growing from a little bit weaker the last year or two as the spectrum auctions were happening. India is in the midst of I think some pent-up demand. It's going to be released in 2011. Again, spectrum auctions occurred. Funding is needed to come in behind it for the network build. That's starting and has happened. And there's also been some equipment security issues that are being cleared, is our understanding, and there'll be some pent-up demand released from those issues in 2011 as well. And in South Africa, I think one of the questions earlier mentioned, really high-growth market. South Africa is pretty developed, which we see as a good thing. But there's lots of upside on data deployments in South Africa, a new entrant coming in. And one of the things that we're striving to do in all of these places that we've been talking about today, these new countries for us, is really drive and introduce the co-location business model to places where it really hasn't been used before. And so South Africa offers us some upside there. And if we can demonstrate success there, there'll probably be a couple of other countries that, that model will fit as well."

I was wondering if you could kind of square that. Should we be expecting it to be an incremental contributor as soon as the fourth quarter? And if so, what opportunities went away relative to what could have been there? And then the second question is on the REIT conversion topic. Obviously, it's important to I think a lot of investors. It seems like you guys have been moving towards it, and people, each step of the way, are concerned that whether it's a tax law change or some other thing that it's going to get pushed out and deferred and kicked down the road. Could you kind of walk us through what are the actual things that would change between here and say, your course and speed running out of NOLs in 2012, that would really impact your thought process about the timetable for REIT conversion?"

I think on the new business, we just kind of honed it in a little bit. We have more clear visibility in terms of looking at the fourth quarter given that now we're at the end of the third quarter and halfway even through the fourth quarter. So we just kind of honed in and tightened, if you will, the range on new business. No, don't take from that any indication in terms of how we're looking at new business or growth from the year. We still think it's a terrific year. We had commenced revenue in the third quarter of over 40% greater and signed up 15% to 20% greater. So we're very optimistic in terms of 2010 and how we're going to finish strong for 2010 and what that means for 2011. With regards to the REIT, given the size of our business, there are very few tax law changes that are going to significantly impact how we're thinking about the overall timing of it. It can change a little bit on the edges, if you will, kind of the bonus depreciation, those types of things. But that's not going to change really significantly at all in terms of the timing. It's really a function of us being ready. It's a function of us getting all the approvals that we need. It's a function of us getting through all the evaluations that we have to do in terms of looking at our portfolio of products and services and how we're going to structure that and how we'll get comfort from that relative to discussions that we're having with the IRS. So I don't see any tax law changes candidly on the horizon that's going to significantly impact the way we're thinking about the timing. And again, I'm still looking in that 2012 time frame."

 The agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: I will provide a brief introduction and highlight certain key metrics from our third quarter financial results. Following this, Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss our financial results and provide an overview of our expectation for the remainder of 2010. And finally, Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, will give closing remarks, including his current thoughts on key industry trends. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions.
 [Operator Instructions] Before I begin, I would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding our 2010 outlook, our stock repurchase program, our pending acquisitions and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.
 Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's press release and those set forth in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2010, and in our other fillings with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
 And with that, I'd like to begin the call with some highlights from our third quarter results. Please turn to Slide 4 of the presentation, which provides a summary of our results compared against the prior year period. We reported total revenues of approximately $513 million, reflecting growth of over 15% from the prior year period. Tom will provide additional color on the core growth of our Rental and Management segment, which excludes the impact of foreign currency, straight-line lease accounting and a onetime gain from the prior year period. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was approximately $350 million, which is, an increase of over 15% from the prior year. Additionally, our operating income for the quarter increased over 19% to approximately $213 million.
 Income from continuing operations, including income from noncontrolling interest, was approximately $94 million or $0.23 per basic and diluted common share. And now I would like to turn the call over to Tom, who will discuss our results in more detail.

I'm pleased to report that our third quarter 2010 results came in ahead of plan as we continue to execute and close out on our strategic priorities for the year. If you please turn to Slide 5, I'd like to begin",2774," Thanks, Leah, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that our third quarter 2010 results came in ahead of plan as we continue to execute and close out on our strategic priorities for the year.
 If you please turn to Slide 5, I'd like to begin with some highlights from our Rental and Management segment. Overall, we reported Rental and Management segment revenue growth of 16.1%. Core growth in Rental and Management segment revenue was 11.6% relative to the third quarter of 2009, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, which positively impacted our reported results by 0.8%, straight-line, which positively impacted our reported results by 5.7% and a onetime gain from the third quarter of 2009, which is related to a onetime termination fee, which we received from one of our broadcast customers.
 Additionally and as I highlighted on our last call, three discrete items continue to impact our results during 2010. These items include the impact of broadcast analog churn, the completion of a customer take-or-pay agreement and a customer settlement, which combined, negatively impacted our reported revenue by approximately 1.7%. Excluding the impact of these items, our core growth would have been over 13%.
 Excluding the impact of these discrete items, core Tower revenue growth in the United States was 10.3%, of which 7.8% was generated from sites owned during the full comparable period, and 2.5% was generated from new sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the third quarter of 2009. In addition, during the quarter, our U.S. division continue to experience a strong leasing environment with total signed new business up by approximately 18% relative to the same quarter of 2009. Furthermore, amendment activity continued to increase, accounting for approximately 45% of our signed new business in the quarter.
 Our solid performance in the U.S. was complemented by core growth of 27% in revenues from our international markets, which reflects our acquisition of towers from Essar, which contributed nearly $15 million or approximately 3.5% to our total revenue growth for the quarter. And as a result of our international expansion, our pass-through revenue, which represents principally land and fuel expenses that we incur and are able to get reimbursed by our customers, has increased by approximately $9 million from the year ago period, which is primarily attributable to our growth in India.
 Finally, our results include a year-over-year increase of over $25 million in straight-line revenue, which is a result of our successful customer contract extensions in the United States. Nearly $21 million of the increase for the quarter was a result of a new master lease agreement with one of our U.S. customers, which was completed during the quarter.
 Before I move on to the rest of our financial results, I'd like to take a minute to walk you through some of the highlights of this new agreement and how it provides key strategic benefits for both parties. First, as our customers seek to add additional equipment to their existing tower sites to meet the rapidly growing demand for data services efficiently and with flexibility, our new agreement essentially provides our customer the ability to install additional equipment on their existing RAD centers in exchange for an incremental fixed annual increase in their run rate billing.
 Therefore, the new agreement provides speed-to-market advantages for our customer, while providing us with a committed level of annual cash revenue growth above their recent historical levels. Finally, we've extended the remaining average current term of our leases with them to 10 years, which provides further stability to our cash flows.
 Turning to Slide 6. Our reported adjusted EBITDA growth relative to the third quarter of 2009 was 15.1%, with core growth for the quarter at 8.4% on a currency-neutral basis and excluding the impacts of straight-line lease accounting, as well as the onetime item, which I mentioned earlier.
 Further adjusting for the 2010 discrete items, which negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA growth by 2.4%, our core growth would have been nearly 11%. During the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 68%, and our adjusted EBITDA conversion rate was approximately 66%, which was a direct result of the following: the $9 million increase in pass-through revenue and expense as I mentioned earlier, negatively impacted our conversion rate by approximately 10%. Additionally, since the beginning of the third quarter of 2009, we've added over 7,500 new sites to our portfolio, which currently have gross margins of approximately 57% due to their average tenancy of approximately 1.6%.
 As we continue to increase the utilization of these sites, we expect their margins will approach our legacy portfolio levels. Excluding the impact of both pass-through revenue and the new sites, we have added over the past 12 months, our EBITDA conversion rate would have been over 90%.
 Furthermore, during the third quarter, we continue to make selective investments in our regional overhead, systems and corporate functions. In addition to our ongoing costs related to certain global business development initiatives, our main focus continues to be on our key projects for 2010, including our IT initiatives such as global implementations of common financial consolidation systems, as well as our ongoing due diligence with respect to a possible REIT conversion. We have made substantial progress in these initiatives year-to-date, and we'll continue this focus for the remainder of the year.
 As outlined in Slide 7, during the third quarter, we continued our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Specifically, we spent approximately $96 million on total capital expenditures, including $54 million of spending on discretionary capital projects, primarily related to the construction of 196 new sites and $23 million on land purchases.
 In addition, during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of 81 sites in the United States and launched operations in Peru and Colombia as a result of our acquisition of 356 sites from Telefónica. Further, we closed on our acquisitions of Essar, which increased our portfolio in India by over 4,600 sites for a cash consideration of approximately $430 million. Finally, consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we spent approximately $150 million to repurchase 3.2 million shares during the quarter.
 Turning to Slide 8. We delivered approximately 11% growth in recurring free cash flow and approximately 12% growth in recurring free cash flow per share relative to the third quarter of 2009. The growth was primarily driven by the following: our core growth in adjusted EBITDA and lower interest expense and higher interest income, which were primarily due to lower borrowing costs as a result of our recent refinancing activities and higher cash balances, respectively.
 Our performance of recurring free cash flow year-to-date is on plan. And as a result, we continue to expect mid-teen annual growth in recurring free cash flow per share for the full year. These trends, along with our recent investments in attractive discretionary projects, including the acquisitions we've made over the past six quarters have resulted in the consistent improvement in our return on invested capital, which is growing to 11.3%.
 Turning to Slide 9. We've updated our prior outlook. We've increased the midpoint of our full year Rental and Management segment revenue outlook by $60 million and consequently, our range to $1.92 billion to $1.93 billion, which now represents year-over-year growth of over 15% at the midpoint.
 This increase is primarily the result of the following key items: $18 million related to strong year-to-date core growth, which is progressing slightly ahead of plan as a result of slightly higher escalations and lower cancellations, plus the early close of our acquisition of towers from Essar and our recent and pending acquisitions in Latin America from Telefónica; and $42 million as a result of the impact of straight line and foreign currency, which is primarily related to our most recent customer contract extensions and master lease negotiations in the United States. Additionally, we've increased the midpoint of our full year adjusted EBITDA outlook by $48 million. And accordingly, our range to $1.34 billion to $1.35 billion, which now represents year-over-year growth of 13.7% at the midpoint.
 This increase is primarily the result of the following key items: increase in our Rental and Management segment revenue, offset by costs associated with the early close of our acquisition of towers from Essar and operating expenses and initial start-up costs associated with our new towers in our new Latin American markets, which brings their contribution for the purposes of our 2010 outlook to near zero.
 Turning to Slide 10. We've provided an updated year-over-year bridge of our Rental and Management segment revenue growth based on our new outlook. Looking forward to 2011, while we will provide detailed guidance when we release our full year 2010 results, we wanted to provide you now with some expected trends related to our Rental and Management segment revenue core growth. Our contract escalators should continue to contribute approximately 3.5%. We currently expect that the leasing environment will be at or above comparable levels with 2010 based on trends such as our U.S. customers seeking to deploy initial 4G networks while continuing to aggressively invest to improve the quality of their 3G networks.
 This demand will be complemented by investments by our customers in our international markets who are seeking to roll out new spectrum. And we expect that our annual churn rate will attenuate and return to normalized levels between 1.5% to 2%. Finally, we expect that our organic growth will be complemented by new tower builds. We also intend to pursue further acquisitions opportunities in both the U.S. and select international markets.
 Turning to Slide 11. And as I mentioned previously, we have increased our 2010 outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $48 million at the midpoint. 2010 has been a year of significant investment for American Tower as we've sought to further our global presence and uniquely position ourselves to capture a portion of the growing global demand for wireless services. As we have successfully entered new geographies, we have spurred revenue growth, while also incurring initial start-up costs.
 In addition, we have ramped our spending, particularly in new regions such as Africa where we currently have no operations. We believe that the current levels of development spending will position us well for future growth, and we are pleased that despite this incremental spending, we've been able to maintain our adjusted EBITDA margins at 68%.
 Turning to Slide 12. I'd like to highlight our current investment profile for 2010. Through the combination of our outlook for cash provided by operations and incremental borrowing required to end the year at about 3.5x net debt to last 12 months adjusted EBITDA, we would expect to have access to over $1.7 billion of capital to invest in 2010. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, our primary objective will be to invest this cash back into our current portfolio through our annual capital plan, which is currently expected to be between $300 million and $320 million. This includes the expected construction of between 1,000 and 1,200 new sites, and the purchase of approximately $60 million of land under our towers.
 In addition to CapEx, we will continue to seek new assets to our portfolio by pursuing select acquisitions. We've spent $665 million year-to-date. Finally, we expect to continue returning our excess capital to shareholders via our stock repurchase program. Year-to-date, we have spent approximately $346 million on our share repurchase program.
 With our target of about 3.5x net debt as of year end, we currently estimate that our remaining capacity for investment in 2010 is approximately $390 million, which we intend to utilize in line with our capital allocation strategy.
 Turning to Slide 13, I would like to take a moment to discuss our recent development activities in our international markets. During the quarter and continuing the momentum of our recent market launch in Chile, we further expanded our Latin American presence with the launch of operations in both Peru and Colombia. As of today, have closed on a total of 231 towers in Peru and 610 towers in Colombia. In addition, we expect to acquire an additional 1,300 towers in our existing markets in Latin America by the end of 2010.
 Combined, these acquisitions would bring our Latin American portfolio to a total of over 6,500 towers. I'd also like to take this opportunity to update you on our progress in Chile, where our team recently completed an agreement with the new market entrant VTR, a subsidiary of Liberty Global. Since our launch of operations in June, our team has worked with our new customer as they plan the deployment of their recently awarded 3G spectrum. We expect VTR will utilize our towers as they pursue their nationwide rollout, plus we have agreed to acquire approximately 140 of their existing towers, which we would expect to complete during 2011. Our local teams and our new markets are off to a fast start, and we're very pleased with their progress so far.
 We believe that our development activities in Latin America have further illustrated our ability to be patient and disciplined as we seek to enter new markets. Our ability to leverage local teams to extend our existing relationships with our current customers and follow them into new markets provides us an unrivaled opportunity for growth in the region.
 Separately and as we've announced this morning, we've also launched operations in South Africa with the pending acquisition of up to approximately 1,400 towers from Cell C, the third-largest carrier in the country. Pursuant to this agreement, we may acquire up to 1,800 additional sites that are currently under construction or are slated for development over the next two-plus years. We are excited about the expansion of our operations into these new markets, and I'd like to take a moment to highlight some key reasons for investment in Peru, Colombia and South Africa.
 First, each of these markets represents a strong macroeconomic environment, providing us a solid foundation in which to invest. Second, the wireless markets in these geographies are competitive, with at least three main carriers operating competitively and a possibility of new entrants arising. Third, in both Peru and Colombia, there has been strong support from government entities to increase mobile broadband access throughout these nations. This support has been exhibited by recent 3G spectrum auctions in Colombia and possible auctions occurring in Peru in the near future. Both markets have been aggressively focused on increasing the quality of voice services provided to subscribers. As a more mature wireless market, South Africa has experienced strong demand for voice and advanced data services. As a result, we believe this market provides us a strong foundation to selectively grow from in sub-Sahara Africa. Overall, we believe that these new geographies will be a strong complement to our existing markets and will drive strong growth for us in the future.
 Turning to Slide 14. And in conclusion, I'd like to summarize a few key takeaways for the quarter. Our third quarter results were solid with our performance supported by year-over-year improvements in commenced new business and our customer contract negotiations. We remain disciplined and consistent with respect to our investments in capital allocation strategy.
 In the third quarter, we added approximately 5,300 new sites to our portfolio, primarily in India with the closing of our acquisition of towers from Essar. We continue to seek opportunities to expand our asset base, including in those markets which we currently operate. As we've previously mentioned, we expect to close on additional acquisitions in Latin America in the fourth quarter, which we anticipate will be accompanied by further growth in the U.S., as well as our markets in Asia and EMEA. We have development teams located in various geographies who continue to explore acquisition and build-to-suit opportunities that we believe will add significant value and growth opportunity to our current portfolio.
 With respect to our balance sheet, we currently have approximately $1.2 billion of liquidity and expect we will continue to utilize a portion of our current financial capacity to manage the pacing of our share repurchase program, which may fluctuate based on our current acquisition pipeline as we work our way towards our year-end target of 3.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA.
 Further during the quarter, we completed our offering of the 5.05% senior notes due 2020 with the principal amount of $700 million, which provided us the ability to repay a portion of our revolver and increase our total liquidity. Finally, we will continue to monitor the capital markets to seek opportunistic transactions that lower our cost of debt in latter and extend our maturities.
 With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.

24766,114976251,86344,"American Tower Corporation (REIT), Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2010",2010-11-05,"Earnings Calls","American Tower Corporation","Executives"," Thanks, Tom. Today, I'll focus my remarks on our strategic planning assumptions that will serve as the foundation for our 2011 guidance, which we'll lay out for you on our next quarterly call. Our future plans and expectations are predicated on three m",2104," Thanks, Tom. Today, I'll focus my remarks on our strategic planning assumptions that will serve as the foundation for our 2011 guidance, which we'll lay out for you on our next quarterly call.
 Our future plans and expectations are predicated on three major assumption sets: First, that advanced data deployments in the U.S. will drive demand for infrastructure, that level's commensurate with what we have experienced over the past number of years; second, that key international markets are also poised for advancements in wireless communications that will also generate demand for additional infrastructure; and third, that American Tower will effectively apply our operational expertise and financial strength, both domestically and internationally for the continued benefit of our shareholders.
 So let's start with the phenomenon of wireless data in the U.S. market from where American Tower derived 80% of its Tower revenue in the third quarter. We hold three basic hypotheses about the U.S. mobile data phenomenon: First, that consumers want this product, and just as in the previous decades, nearly every one at the U.S. subscribed to wireless voice service; and that over the course of the current decade, we believe that nearly everyone will subscribe to high-speed mobile data service too. As a result of this adoption curve that we expect, increasing data usage for subscriber and higher transmission speeds, we anticipate that mobile data consumption will double every year for at least the next four years.
 Our second hypothesis is around the U.S. wireless data phenomenon that the leading U.S. wireless carriers are fully committed to launching robust 3G and 4G data services, and that these companies are growing both revenue and operating profit as a result. Thereby, that will further justify ongoing investment by them. For example, AT&T just announced wireless service revenue growth in the third quarter of over 10%, nearly 3/4 of which was driven by data. Moreover at AT&T's wireless operating income increased by 15% and therefore, half again faster than revenue growth. Consequently, AT&T has shifted its investment priority meaningfully towards wireless. Its year-to-date wireless CapEx was up over 55%, and the company is on a pace to invest $8 billion in wireless capital expenditures this year.
 Now second example is Verizon whose wireless service revenue growth in Q3 was about 8%, all of which was attributable to data. Also at Verizon, wireless EBITDA grew at over 11%, half again above the revenue growth rate. Therefore, Verizon's also shifted its investment priority meaningfully to wireless. Its year-to-date wireless CapEx was up over 20%, and it's also on a pace to invest $8 billion in wireless capital expenditures this year.
 Our third hypothesis regarding the U.S. is that the market is so large and competitive that all major wireless service providers must eventually offer their customers a robust data product in order to be successful. Each carrier will have to overcome whatever challenges that may be facing to deliver high-grade 3G and/or 4G services, while at the same time, carefully managing churn risk out their existing customer base. And for both Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile USA, spectrum availability is a critical component to sustaining their current customer bases while preparing to deliver data services that will ultimately be able to compete with Verizon and AT&T's 4G service at 700 megahertz.
 Currently, two entities control the spectrum that could make these competitive services a reality. One is Clearwire, with over 100 megahertz of spectrum. The other is LightSquared with about 60 megahertz of spectrum. While there are a few possible combinations and permutations here, we believe that some or all of these 160 megahertz of spectrum will be utilized by Sprint Nextel and/or by T-Mobile for advanced wireless data services.
 While specific outcomes are not yet known, the possibilities include a sale of some portion of Clearwire spectrum, a further investment by Sprint or public investors in Clearwire or a joint venture of wholesale arrangement between one or more carriers in LightSquared. Therefore, we do believe that both Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile will ultimately get access to sufficient spectrum, and that they'll further invest in next-generation data services to remain competitive in the U.S. market. Any of the aforementioned outcomes here would then be a positive for the tower industry in the U.S.
 Moreover, MetroPCS, Leap, U.S. Cellular and other regional carriers will also need to garner access to spectrum or service for 4G and make the necessary investments in data to also stay competitive. So the synthesis of all of this in our planning process is that we expect solid new business opportunities for us in the U.S. going forward, and that churn rate should be manageable, especially with analog broadcast churn behind us. We see our company stepping up its ongoing CapEx investments somewhat in the U.S. We also plan to bump up our traditional pace of new tower and indoor DAS system builds. We'll also advance our investments in our newer products expansions such as outdoor DAS and shared generators, so these types of products will still be considered a niche in the broader scope of current network deployments.
 We also maintain our interest in acquiring assets in the U.S. where we can find opportunities that meet our valuation standards. But when those are not available, we have other investment opportunities internationally as you've heard, as well as our share repurchase program that's already in place.
 Let's now turn from the vibrant U.S. market to our second major planning assumption, and as the key international markets are also poised for advancements in wireless communication. And as a result, we expect strong demand for communications infrastructure in these markets that will be faster in rate and/or longer in duration than even in the U.S.
 Through our multi-year investments in regionally deployed teams and business processes in systems development, we feel that American Tower is uniquely positioned to leverage our existing international assets and to make effective new investments in three target areas: Latin America, South Central Asia, primarily India; and select countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In each of these targeted areas, we intend to have one or two anchor stores and then to bolt on, choose an adjacent markets to gain customer and operating synergies. Given our 10 years operating in the region, Latin America is the furthest advanced in respect to this approach. Our two anchor stores, Mexico and Brazil, have mature business systems, long-standing customer relationships and experienced and capable management teams.
 In 2010, we achieved our objective of launching operations in all of our currently targeted bolt-on markets in the region: Chile, Peru and Colombia. In all three of these new markets, we have common customers from our anchor stores. We've ceded U.S. and regional management into key leadership positions, and we're utilizing common companies systems and shared services from our anchor stores.
 With additional voice penetration to come in many of our Latin America markets, new spectrum and data services being deployed in all of them and a competitive wireless market of at least three carriers in each country, we see excellent prospects for leasing up the assets we own and that we have under contract, as well as strong potential for new asset acquisitions in the region going forward.
 2010 was also the year that we achieved our original strategic objective in India, reaching sufficient scale of the market to be a meaningful supplier to our customers and to reach our initial internal financial targets for EBITDA contribution and return on investment. We still view India as the fastest-growing major wireless market in the world. With just a bit over 50% voice penetration in India as of mid-2010, this market has plenty of upside at voice subscribers, which will take years to fulfill. Moreover, both 3G and fixed wireless spectrum auctions were held recently in India. And as a result, the development of both mobile and fixed wireless services will accelerate in a country that lacks an extensive existing cable or DSL wire data network.
 Not only has India found a substantial wireless, voice and data growth, but it's wireless carrier market is also very competitive, with 12 to 14 service providers in each region of the country. We fully expect that there will be carrier consolidation in India. However, we do anticipate that this will take some time to play out, and in the end, there is still likely to be at least six or seven players per region. And as a reference point today, approximately 90% of our revenue in India is from the seven largest carriers.
 In 2011, our major goals for our India operation are to drive leasing activity on our base of approximately 8,000 towers including those recently acquired in the Essar transaction, also, to pursue an active program for building additional towers and to seek and evaluate any additional complementary assets that would enhance our tower portfolio footprint.
 We're also very pleased to announce the launch of our first market in the Europe, Middle East, Africa or as we call it, the EMEA region. Similar to Brazil in South America and India in South Asia, South Africa is the obvious anchor store market for sub-Saharan Africa. South Africa firmly meets our country-level qualification criteria for developing market investments and has a competitive wireless carrier environment with three established carriers today, and other entrants expected as well. We, therefore, view South Africa both as a highly attractive market in and of itself, and as a solid platform from which to closely evaluate our very short list of other specifically targeted markets and counterparties in that region.
 In summary, our international expansion initiative has always been designed to add diversified sources of growth to complement our foundational U.S. business from which we also expect strong growth. We're now succeeding in this endeavor on three dimensions: in Latin America, in India and now in Africa. So we're very excited about what this will mean in terms of total company growth in 2011 and beyond.
 Finally, our planning assumptions include our demonstrated ability to drive operational excellence in our existing and new markets, to maintain a strong balance sheet that provides access to capital for our expansion initiatives and to continually optimize our corporate structure. All these designed to maximize benefits to our shareholders. As to operational excellence, we've made advanced investment in people and financial resources over the past three years to pursue business development opportunities in new markets and for product expansions such as outdoor DAS. We believe that those investments are about to pay off in terms of future revenue and operating profit growth.
 In addition, during this period of time, we've improved or maintained our company's operating margins and simultaneously expanded our return on invested capital as Tom's pointed out. Our goals are to continue to deliver this type of performance on each of these key metrics as we integrate the many acquisitions and newly built towers from 2010, while perhaps adding even more assets as we go along.
 We'll also plan to maintain a strong balance sheet with financial leverage within that 3x to 5x EBITDA range. We continue to believe that this range does provide us with the optimal mix of enhanced shareholder returns, maintaining our broad access to capital of relatively low cost by our investment grade credit rating too. So many of the transactions that we're signing and closing this year, in fact, resulted from discussions that were either initiated or sustained during the financial crisis.
 By credibly maintaining access to capital during that period, we preserved our ability to initiate or sustain new market entry and acquisition projects with counterparties. Also within our planning horizon is optimizing our corporate structure. As we've mentioned previously, the company is actively working to fully understand, evaluate and prepare for a potential conversion to a real estate investment trust or REIT. While there has not yet been a decision to take this step, we are taking actions that we believe are needed to keep this option available to us.
 Before we move on to your questions, I would like to take a moment to recognize our dedicated employees throughout the company who work together to deliver the type of performance that Tom described in such detail, while also driving forward the many growth initiatives that I have outlined for you today. While we do celebrate our success, I can assure you that we're not all at all complacent. We're all looking forward to a strong finish to this year, thereby generating strong momentum into 2011.
 So thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. And now, operator, we'll open it up for questions.

Turning to South Africa, it's brand new. You'll hear more about the SG&A cost and other costs in Africa based on 2011 guidance when we do that in a few months. We're going to pick up probably 50 to 60 employees early on as we get these Towers ready to market and purchased. But then we'll have more clarity to the final numbers early next year.

We have about 20% of Verizon Wireless's network on our towers. That's many, many thousands of RAD centers. Each one has a configuration that may differ from others, and there's no just sort of point in time where the zero amendments will disappear. However, as we've talked about, the average with Verizon is in the $300 range. So whether it's a wider belt curve or a narrower belt curve around that, we don't think the average is going to be all that much different going forward. As far as the election goes, it doesn't, we think, really impact our business. We have two priorities in Washington which we hope will continue to make progress. One is to get co-location by right as we call it, meaning that have those zoning barriers to co-locations or augmentations on existing towers. That's something I think all tower companies can agree on and all carriers can agree on as a good thing. And then second initiative, which again we're hopeful that we'll come to fruition, is that the public safety network, the spectrum and the leadership that needs to come around the for it to get deployed. And I think the election doesn't necessarily adversely affect either of those, and hopefully it possibly won't affect some.

We'll start with the U.S., and some of the robust sources of next year's new business that we're anticipating -- and again, we'll come up with the actual guidance for you on the our next call. But AT&T is moving strong ahead with both 3G bolstering that network, which is again, 3G is the primary network for all the carriers today that the high-speed data that we're all using and experiencing is coming from. So that 3G network we think will remain an investment priority for AT&T and others. And they're going to start their initial LTE deployments too. There'll be some cell splitting we think by that company as it adds more and more heavy-use devices well. Verizon and other national carrier, again, has to keep developing. We think it's 3G network into next year. They're all further advanced on the schedule of their LTE deployment and have a robust plan publicly stated for next year as well. So the two largest national carriers in terms of subscribers we think are going to do as well for us next year as they've done for us this year. And then T-Mobile, I think, will also be a major participant next year, probably, hopefully, more so than this. And Sprint Nextel, same situation as they kind of move into high-speed data projects as well. When it comes to Clearwire, LightSquared and others, as I said in my prepared remarks, that spectrum that they control is highly valuable. And if it comes online a quarter plus or minus, or it's public or its private investors that help get it out there, or it's a JV or a wholesale agreement, it's going to happen and it's going to benefit the tower industry. So again, through the course of 2011, we think that those companies are, if not both at least one, will be able to keep that form. So the U.S. should be a good market for all the tower companies that participate in 2011. Moving into Latin America, as we've talked about, there've been spectrum auctions in almost every country that we have assets in now. And that's up to five countries in Latin America, Mexico, Brazil, especially since we have large portfolios there with established customer contract relationships. Again, I think if you compare this year to next year, they should be at higher run rate, the new business, than the standard U.S. rate over the years. And that's growing from a little bit weaker the last year or two as the spectrum auctions were happening. India is in the midst of I think some pent-up demand. It's going to be released in 2011. Again, spectrum auctions occurred. Funding is needed to come in behind it for the network build. That's starting and has happened. And there's also been some equipment security issues that are being cleared, as our understanding, and there'll be some pent-up demand released from those issues in 2011 as well. And in South Africa, I think one of the questions earlier mentioned, really high-growth market. South Africa is pretty developed, which we see as a good thing. But there's lots of upside on data deployments in South Africa, a new entrant coming in. And one of the things that we're striving to do in all of these places that we've been talking about today, these new countries for us, is really drive and introduce the co-location business model to places where it really hasn't been used before. And so, South Africa offers us some upside there. And if we can demonstrate success there, there'll probably be a couple of other countries that, that model will fit as well.
