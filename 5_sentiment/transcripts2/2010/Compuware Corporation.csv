Compuware's strong results this quarter showed continued momentum and greater consistency in the company's performance. The strategy and operational discipline that we announced over 18 months ago has led to a much simpler and healthier business with strong, differentiated opportunities for continued growth. All of our core growth driver showed sequential and year-on-year growth in Q3. And as of the last three quarters, we continue to see consistent improvement in our operational metrics. To provide apples-to-apples view on the progress of our business, we have excluded divested products from these Q3 compares. Overall, Compuware posted a nearly 30% year-over-year increase in total product commitments. Total products revenue increased 5% compared to the same quarter last year. Additionally, professional services revenue, excluding Covisint, is up sequentially to $49.4 million along with improved margins. The great news is that these positive results were not based on one-time events but on the successful execution of a longer-term strategy. In particular, our unique capability to optimize application performance in the data center, in the cloud, or on the mobile device is gaining momentum in the application performance marketplace. In this space, only Compuware can deliver a unified view with immediate deep-dive resolution across the entire application delivery chain. This is a new disruptive change to the market made possible through the Gomez acquisition. Right out of the gate in the third quarter, we released a joint solution that has already been sold and implemented to a number of new customers. More importantly, we are seeing very strong interest in this joint solution. We have scheduled subsequent releases that will further integrate and differentiate our capabilities. Operationally, we have kept the Gomez division intact so that they can continue to drive market share growth in the web performance area and operate with extreme agility. In fact, I want to congratulate the Gomez team in achieving their best quarter ever. To put it simply, they are on fire. Gomez total bookings from October through December were $21.8 million, which represents an increase of 46% sequentially and a 35% year-over-year. This includes 133 net new customers through direct sales and an additional 21 through channels. Keep in mind that these customers represent immediate upsell opportunities for Vantage. Our expectation going into Q4 and fiscal year '11 is that we will continue to support Gomez so they can continue to do what they do best. We'll invest in further product integration, grow their benchmarking ecosystem and support a rigorous lead sharing process to drive joint market share. Starting in February, we expect to introduce some very exciting solutions addressing private, public and hybrid cloud performance. We are also rapidly extending our penetration of vertical industries including retail, media and publishing and SaaS users and providers.On the Vantage side, we posted nearly 10% year-over-year growth in license fees and a 95% sequential increase in license bookings. Vantage license bookings for the quarter were up nearly 20% year-over-year. Total Vantage revenues for the quarter increased 7.8% to $36 million. So we remained very excited about our outlook for our distributed products and expect the individual and combined momentum for the Gomez and Vantage, in particular, to lead to strong future growth.Covisint also delivered excellent results this quarter and we continue to see strong macro drivers for this business. In Q3, Covisint added 71 new customers including global brands like Shale, OnStar and AT&T. Revenues increased more than 22% year-over-year to $10.8 million. The most exciting news, however, is a guaranteed revenue that we see coming in future quarters from backlog of $75.1 million. Changes in manufacturing vertical are driving organizations to Covisint's cloud-based solutions for their speed, innovation and value. We capitalize on this dynamic to achieve 11% growth year-over-year in Covisint's manufacturing vertical this year. Covisint's Healthcare business is accelerating even faster, with 52% year-over-year revenue increase. The federal stimulus program for Healthcare IT is generating a wave of opportunities and RFPs, and we expect many large health information exchange initiatives will make purchasing decisions over the next 12 months. With great customer reference stories already in place, including the states of Tennessee, Minnesota and Michigan, we are very well-positioned for explosive growth in this marketplace.Additionally, our relationship with the American Medical Association continues to grow. We expect, at least, an additional 19,000 providers to be on the Covisint platform by late summer. Between Covisint and Gomez, we have two of the fastest growing SaaS solutions in the industry. Chasepoint licensees increased to $3 million this quarter, up more than 80% sequentially and up slightly year-on-year. This is due to our refocused strategy in subsegments within the IT Portfolio Management marketplace. We are also seeing our pipelines build in this area. Our ability to provide strong references in a market that has struggled with failed implementations remains the key differentiator in the ITPM and IT government space. Our Mainframe business also remains very healthy. We saw a 0.4% year-over-year growth in overall Mainframe revenue and 2.6% year-over-year growth in the Mainframe maintenance. Our investment in client managers who work directly with our customers to achieve greater ROI is paying off. This is also a great testament to the work of our Mainframe professionals. Professional services revenue, excluding Covisint, is also up sequentially, $49.4 million. And more importantly, so are the margins. Excluding Covisint, the Services business achieved 12.1% margin. We have stabilized the Services business which is substantially healthier than it has been in years. We expect to see slight revenue growth based upon improved product related services numbers and building on specialized differentiated competencies. In addition, we're capitalizing on greater interest for more and more strategic partners, which is helping to drive our revenue growth and expand our market presence. I'm very pleased with the work of the channels group which has rebuilt this program from scratch. You should expect to continue to see additional announcements on global alliances in the near future.So we streamlined our product portfolio and investment in strategic growth areas, all while improving profitability, expanding market leadership and positioning the company for sustainable growth and improving the consistency of the results. As such, we remained comfortable with the lower end of our prior guidance. Obviously, we are very pleased with the momentum, but I believe that Compuware can do much more. In talking with our field teams and our customers, I can feel the immense momentum building behind our business. I am hopeful that in your research, you are hearing and seeing the same thing. As you can tell, I'm optimistic that next year, Compuware will harness and build on these business drivers. Excluding the effect of this year's divestitures, we are now consistently growing revenues with increasing earnings and I know we haven't been able to say that for quite a while. Laura?"
26883,83751098,49819,"Compuware Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jan-28-2010",2010-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Compuware Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Compuware's performance in Q3 is yet another example in a growing list of successes that clearly indicates the soundness of our strategic directions and the effectiveness of our efforts. Q3 also represents a very positive trend. Not only was",1106,"Thanks, Bob. Compuware's performance in Q3 is yet another example in a growing list of successes that clearly indicates the soundness of our strategic directions and the effectiveness of our efforts. Q3 also represents a very positive trend. Not only was it was another solid quarter, but for the second consecutive period, we beat street license, maintenance, total revenue and EPS expectation. We have made significant progress on our plan to focus the business on end-to-end application performance, including the divestiture of our QA products and the acquisition of Gomez. Because of these changes, we believe additional insight into our GAAP income statement numbers is necessary to communicate the true health of our business. For instance, by looking at the GAAP numbers, one would conclude that license revenue for the quarter is down, year-over-year. However, if you conduct that apples-to-apples comparison by eliminating QA license revenue from last year's Q3 license number, you'll see that license revenue for the quarter is essentially flat, year-over-year. But more importantly, by diving deeper, you will note that Vantage revenue for the quarter was up approximately 10%, year-over-year and nearly 66%, sequentially.Now those are compelling numbers. I don't have to remind you that our Distributed Systems business is a primary growth driver and these numbers clearly indicate that our efforts to grow this business are working. In terms of maintenance revenue, it is also important to look beyond the GAAP income statement to gain a more accurate understanding of the performance of this business. When you examine the factors impacting maintenance revenue during the third quarter, what you find is that on an apples-to-apples basis, maintenance revenue grew 3.1% year-over-year. Again, this excludes the divested QA maintenance from Q3 of last year, as well as the addition of Gomez this quarter, which is now being recognized within the maintenance line items. We think this 3.1% improvement is very solid and we are very pleased with the growth.But even more impressive than this overall 3.1% increase is the fact that Vantage maintenance revenue was up nearly 6%, year-over-year, and approximately 5%, sequentially. This is an important metric in that it both validates the business growth as well as the value being delivered. Like we've said many times before, people don't pay maintenance for solutions that don't deliver value. That has never been more true than it is today in this challenging economic environment.Let's spend the next moment on Gomez. As I just mentioned, we have included Gomez's revenue in the maintenance line because Gomez's SaaS model is more closely aligned with maintenance attributes, ratable recognition, repeatable, renewable, et cetera. For the quarter, Gomez GAAP revenue was $5.8 million. However, GAAP requires that we take a write-down of any deferred revenue acquired as part of an acquisition. We have to restate it at fair value. Without this mandated write-down, this revenue would have come in at $8.5 million for the two months in Q3 that Gomez was actually a part of Compuware. This write-down will have an impact on Gomez revenue for the next several quarters on a declining basis. But keep in mind that SaaS revenue is recognized ratably and as Bob mentioned, Gomez bookings grew at a record pace during the quarter. And these new bookings are not subject to a GAAP haircut. Another indicator of the effectiveness of our strategy and execution is the performance of our Professional Services business. For the first time in nearly two years, we experienced revenue growth in this business as services revenue, excluding Covisint, grew nearly 2% over the second quarter. And I want to point out that an increase in product related services played a key role in these results. But this growth only tells half of the story as the quality of our services revenue continues to increase as well. For the quarter, the services contribution margin, again excluding Covisint, was 12.1%, up from 5.6% last Q3 and up from 11.7% in Q2. Here's another way to look at it. While professional services revenue was down 40% year-over-year, the contribution margin percentage is up 116% year-over-year. Our strategy to turn our services units into a profitable, strategically important and long-term business is working. Now I would like to spend a few minutes discussing operating expenses and provide some insight into the sequential increase in total operating expenses. In looking at these numbers, you have to factor in the Gomez effect, as Gomez accounted for approximately $8 million of direct operating expenses this quarter. Additionally, there's approximately $1.6 million of acquisition costs included in G&A that we are required to expect. Prior to this fiscal year, these expenses would have been capitalized as part of the cost of the acquisition. So in doing an apples-to-apples comparison, by eliminating the Gomez-related expense items, the sequential increase in operating expenses for the quarter was $7.7 million or 4.4%. The majority of this increase is concentrated in sales and marketing expense related to annual bonuses, as well as marketing investments intended to drive demand in support of our growth objectives.I would also like to point out that from a year-over-year perspective, operating expenses, net of Gomez, are down 16.1%. So you can clearly see our operating efficiency programs are working. Going into Q4, the run rate for total operating expenses is expected to be approximately $200 million once a full quarter of the Gomez expenses are factored in. In terms of cash, given the $33.4 million of Q3 operating cash flow, we continue to expect operating cash for the year to come in at $200 million. This month, the $35 million borrowed under our line of credit to partially finance the Gomez acquisition was repaid and once again, we are debt-free.With regard to the stock buyback, in Q3, we repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares for about $25.4 million. That brings our total for the year to approximately 15.1 million shares for nearly $111.2 million. As always, we will continue to evaluate business and economic conditions and buy back stocks when it's fiscally prudent to do so.Overall, we are energized by this drive we have made, both in terms of our performance as well as the foundational changes we have made to our operating structure. And we believe that progress will continue. Because of this continued success in the measures we have put and are putting in place to promote continued growth, we believe the company has truly entered a period of renaissance, the next leg of our journey that will lead to the type of sustained success that is defined Compuware for the greater part of 40 years. Of this, I have no doubt. Lisa?"

So you've got -- you do have some -- you've got a couple of nameplate accounts, sort of big-named accounts, that are using the measurements substantially and globally. But there's a wide variety of customers across all major industry segments, particularly those that are using the Web, obviously, to grow market share, brand recognition and top line revenue growth. And even now, what we're starting to see is, not just leading-edge Web-based retail companies, but almost any company right now is investing to leverage the Internet to change the way in which they're delivering their business value. It could be a car company, an appliance company, a software company, what have you, as you can imagine. So the market really is wide open, so that's driving the demand. And obviously, the second one is the promise of the cloud environments, moving forward. We will not see mainstream adoption of cloud computing until performance is resolved and until security issues are resolved, and we have some great opportunities to own those spaces [ph]."

But I believe, at this point, there isn't that many cost savings that we will achieve as we integrate the Gomez folks because we are, for all intents and purposes, leaving their operating structure intact. The only -- we'll have some slight increases with respect to some of the finance and HR administrative-type groups, but nothing significant. So going into the next, I think, for the next couple of quarters, you are going to see that operating expense line around $200 million, and it will be mostly towards the sales and marketing category. G&A is still going to be stable, right around the same numbers we're seeing, $42 million or so, $40 million a quarter. And keep in mind, one thing, too, from this quarter, as you look back, is we have all of our annual bonus accruals are reflected in these numbers. And last year, when you look at those numbers, we had reversed most of those. So that's one of the reasons you're seeing a little bit of an uptick. But I think the $200 million is a good number for right now. You need to look at it, but I would use it for right now."

But we will look to expand their sales and marketing capabilities in those geographies because  we truly believe, and we're seeing in the marketplace and the analysts are agreeing, we have a differentiated capability that we believe is going to change the way in which companies are looking at solving their application performance problems.

Professional services margins reached 14.7% excluding Covisint.  Services revenue increased sequentially.  Currently FY ’11 guidance assumes revenue growth, strong EPS and cash flow.  Compuware Corporation today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2010.  During the fiscal year revenues were $892.2 million compared to $1.09 billion in the previous fiscal year.  Net income was $140.8 million compared to $139.6 million in fiscal 2009.  
Earnings per share were $0.60, an increase of 9% from $0.55 in fiscal 2009 based upon 234.6 million and 252.4 million shares outstanding respectively.  During fiscal 2010, software license fees were $194.5 million and maintenance and subscription fees were $456.4 million.  Professional services fees for fiscal 2010 were $241.3 million.  During the fourth quarter revenues were $230 million compared to $253.4 million in the fourth quarter last year.  Net income was $37.4 million compared to $48.4 million in Q4 last year.  
Earnings per share were $0.16 compared to $0.20 last year based upon 228.7 million and 246 million shares outstanding respectively.  During the company’s fourth quarter software license fees were $51.8 million compared to $50.3 million excluding divested products and $55.5 million as reported in the fourth quarter last year.  Maintenance and subscription fees were $117.9 million in the fourth quarter compared to $104 million excluding divested products and $111.6 million as recorded in the fourth quarter last year.  Revenue from professional services in the fourth quarter was $60.3 million compared to $86.3 million in the same quarter last year.  
I would now like to turn the call over to Bob.

We increased revenue in our key growth drivers and generated more than $200 million in cash flow from operations.  At the same time, we’ve sharpened the fundamental structure of the company, we divested solutions where we were not best in class and invested in our growth businesses.  We’ve also increased our competitive advantage and profitability in our mature lines of business.  Bottom line, Compuware is positioned for success and to deliver consistent long term earnings and revenue growth.
Among our growth drivers Gomez and Vantage performed well in the fiscal year 2010 and also showed major promise in the year ahead.  Everyday applications on the web and the complex applications delivery chain behind them become more critical to our customers’ brand awareness, revenue growth and overall market share.  The markets for solutions to ensure the optimal performance of these applications is large and its growing rapidly.  Compuware has an unmatched solution for optimizing the performance of these applications across the enterprise, the Internet and the cloud.  We know and the industry analysts agree that none of our competitors can match these capabilities.  
This quarter alone we closed 15 agreements with enterprise Internet customers, some in the seven figure range.  Given that we’ve just recently acquired Gomez we’re just scratching the potential of this joint offering driven by the increasingly complex and multisource nature of delivering mission critical applications.  Cloud computing in particular remains one of the top issues for CIOs today.  The two greatest concerns regarding cloud are security and performance. 
Compuware as you can see from our recent launch of www.CloudSleuth.net has the best cloud performance management story in the industry.  CloudSleuth.net dynamically displays the performance of all major public clouds across the global while providing a complete ecosystem for thought leadership.  This platform was built on Covisint, driven by Gomez analytics and allows companies to put in their own URL to measure the performance of their cloud applications.
To maximize the revenue and market penetration opportunity for both solutions, we will largely continue to operate the Vantage and Gomez sales teams independently.  However, both teams have financial incentives to gross and co-sell eliminating the possibility of channel conflict.  We will establish targeted and integrated teams around specific verticals and value propositions to quickly take advantage of opportunities where a combined sales effort makes the most sense.  
We saw the benefits of this operating model already in Q4. Vantage increased license fees more than 22% compared to the same quarter last year.  The Compuware Gomez team also continues to post outstanding results with139 new product orders and for the first time ever multiple seven figure deals with Fortune 1,000 companies.  Gomez delivered nearly $21 million in commitments in the quarter and launched a major platform wide upgrade featuring a number of industry first including multi browser performance testing as well as unified web and mobile testing.  
In the year ahead we will accelerate our investment in both solutions to maximize their growth potential.  For Vantage our focus remains on ease of use, simplified pricing and rapid return on investment.  For Gomez we’re expanding the geographic reach of the sales team as well as delivering continued production innovation.  Propelled by the increasing number and business importance of web applications, for fiscal year ’11 we expect a greater than 20% increase in Vantage license fees and Gomez subscription revenue of $65 to $75 million.
Another of Compuware’s key growth drivers Covisint had a great quarter with a 15% year-over-year increase in revenue to $10.4 million.  More importantly Q4 billings grew 39.5% year-over-year to $16.9 million.  Backlog, the signed agreements that are being delivered over the next five years grew 13% sequentially to $85.2 million.  These billings and backlog numbers will drive incremental revenue in the quarters ahead as large implementations roll out.  
For the coming year, we expect 30% to 35% increase in total Covisint revenue as we continue to establish ourselves as a category leader in secure healthcare collaboration.  Healthcare is the fastest expanding part of the Covisint business at 42% year-over-year growth.  
We expect this growth trend will continue driven by the federal stimulus program for healthcare IT as large health information exchange purchasing decisions are made over the next 12 months. We are well positioned to win a number of these HIEs, health information exchanges, and continue to focus on many statewide initiatives along with key partners such as AT&T and the American Medical Association.  This quarter Covisint surpassed 15,000 healthcare professionals using IDs to collaborate on this platform.  In June we will boost this number when we launch to an additional 15,000 AMA users in the state of Michigan.  
Covisint is also growing in the manufacturing sector and we see opportunities to extend our solutions in to new verticals.  With growth like this we will continue to evaluate the right timing for a carve out IPO of Covisint.  Our partners’ organization continues to increase momentum also and delivered meaningful revenue gains to the company.  This year we successfully launched three CISCO enabled service offerings.  Additionally, Compuware technology is embedded in the CISCO network analysis module, an initiative that has sparked great customer interest and notable revenue.  
Our partnership also Accenture is increasing in velocity.  Working with a performance engineering practice we continue to generate customer wins and the pipeline is building.  We’ve initiated relationships with Accenture’s staff and performance engineering business units that will pay additional dividends in the year ahead.  We also plan to launch some specific offerings around our mainframe solutions with Accenture this year.  
Changepoint’s more focused market strategy of health and technology companies drive improved revenues for their services offerings is bearing fruit.  Changepoint is capitalizing on the growth opportunity by leveraging its capabilities for product planning, product development and services delivery have ensured reliable release delivery and successful services engagements.  With these compelling capabilities Changepoint produced almost 7% growth in license fees compared to the same quarter last year.  For the year ahead we expect Changepoint to produce a greater than 30% increase in license revenues.
Compuware’s mainframe business continues to deliver strong profits and cash flow.  In a very competitive market we will maintain our market leadership and deliver roughly flat total mainframe revenues in fiscal 2011.  We will continue to provide our customers with unique capabilities for our industry leading solutions and focus on the specific compelling value propositions.  We have not factored in any pent up demand due to new mainframe cycles coming later this year.  
IT organizations today face every increasing pressure to reduce costs and do more with existing resources.  Our mainframe campaigns around operational cost savings and MIPs management are achieving excellent results because they solve exactly these problems.  Additionally our test data privacy offering is showing great traction in the marketplace particularly in the financial services area as tighter regulations cause more and more customers to address this risk.
The Compuware professional services business had an excellent quarter also with margins at 14.7%.  The focus on repeatable methodologies and profitability is paying dividends.  Our discipline around selling the value of the solution delivery group has also increased dramatically.  For fiscal year 2011 the overall services business will continue to expand upon this profitability.  Compuware is structured for financial success.  We have the solutions, the people and the strategy to dominate in our categories now, it’s simply a matter of executing effectively.  
In fiscal year ’10 Compuware’s total revenue excluding divested products was $877.6 million.  In fiscal year 2011 I expect that we will deliver revenues between $950 and $1 billion which is the increase in revenue excluding divested products between 8% and 14%.   On this revenue figure I expect we will earn between $0.48 and $0.56 per share.  In Q1 we expect to earn $0.05 to $0.07 per share as our business experiences it normal seasonality.  The third and fourth quarters will produce the lion’s share of our EPS for the fiscal year as our growth drivers gain momentum and market penetration.
Fiscal year ’10 was a unique year for Compuware with the culmination of the IBM settlement and the QA divestiture in particular.  As Laura will detail more fully, remove any affects like the settlement of IBM and the QA sale from fiscal ’10 results, Compuware’s performing EPS this year was $0.38.  Building on this foundation we expect to grow EPS at least 25% in the year.  Removing the onetime items from fiscal 2010 you can see that Compuware is growing business with differentiated offerings in hot markets.  We’re increasing revenues and our margins are up.
This company is experiencing a remarkable reinvigoration.   We recently completed our second annual worldwide sales kick off.  The optimism and competitive determination that I saw at this event tells me that our operational teams are energized, armed and prepared to execute on our fiscal year 2011 and long term goals.  I look forward to reporting to you on these results in the coming year.

As Bob pointed out, this shift has already had numerous positive effects on our top and bottom line and we are positioned for growth in the quarters to come.  In fact, with the QA divestiture behind us now and the Gomez integration fundamentally complete, we are convinced that we have the focus and the differentiated best in class solutions necessary to win big in the marketplace in fiscal 2011 and beyond.
To reach our potential we will continue to invest in our key growth drivers while working diligently to hold the line on our overall expense structure.  The approximately 4.2% sequential increase in operating expenses during the fourth quarter is reflective of this philosophy.  This increase basically reflects a full quarter of the direct operating expenses of Gomez, definitely one of our key growth drivers.  For the year, total operating expenses net of Gomez and the gain associated with the divestiture, our expenses were down over 18%.  
As we move forward in fiscal 2011 we do not anticipate any material changes in our quarterly operating expenses from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.  We expect quarterly expenses will be approximately $195 to $200 million in the first and second quarters and closer to $210 million towards the third and fourth quarters.  The old maxim is true, you can’t cut your way to growth and we are absolutely committed to growth.  Therefore we will continue to invest wisely in those areas of our business that provide the greatest upside while thoughtfully rightsizing investments in other areas without compromising the value we deliver to our customers.
This commitment to customer success is directly reflected in our continued solid maintenance results, particularly Vantage one of our strongest performers in Q4 with the 12% increase in maintenance revenue.  This metric remains a primary indicator of the quantifiable value our customers receive from our preeminent application performance solutions.  In fiscal year ’11 we expect to see additional growth in our distributed maintenance while mainframe maintenance will be flat or experience a modest decline.  
Currency can have a significant influence on our international results and if the US dollar continues to strengthen we could see a decline in our maintenance revenue.  But, at this time we believe total maintenance revenue for fiscal 2011 will be between $425 and $430 million.  As I mentioned last quarter, the subscription component of the maintenance line is Gomez revenue.  We have included the subscription revenue with maintenance because the Gomez SAS model is more closely aligned with maintenance attributes ratable, repeatable and renewable.  
For the quarter Gomez revenue came in at $11.1 million which reflects a deferred revenue write down of $2.8 million.  If you recall, last quarter I explained that GAAP requires that we take a write down of any deferred revenue acquired as part of an acquisition.  Without this write down, Gomez revenues for the quarter would have come in at $13.9 million.  This write down effect will continue to slightly impact Gomez revenues for the next several quarters on a continually declining basis.  For fiscal 2011, we expect Gomez subscription revenue to be approximately $65 to $75 million for the year.  
As for professional services, we continue to be very encouraged by the performance of this business unit.  We have nearly a 15% services margin excluding Covisint for the quarter.  I did want to point out that this quarter’s margin was positively impacted by certain onetime items.  Excluding these adjustments, the services margin for the quarter would have been approximately 11%.  But, regardless of the onetime items, this quarter’s professional service margin shows that our strategy is working and that our goal of obtaining an annual 15% services margin is more than achievable.  
As we look at the first two quarters of fiscal 2011, we expect the services margin to be between 11% and 13% ramping up to 15% by the fourth quarter as we continue to gain greater efficiencies in this business.  In terms of cash, operating cash flow for the quarter came in at a very strong $122.9 million and we finished the year with $226.3 million.  For fiscal ’11 we expect operating cash flow to be approximately the same as fiscal 2010, around $225 million.
With regard to the stock buyback, in Q4 we repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares for about $21.8 million and that brings our total repurchases for fiscal year ’10 to approximately 18 million shares for nearly $133 million.  As is our often stated policy we will continue to evaluate business and economic conditions and buy that stock when it is fiscally prudent to do so.  But, I’m sure we’ll be in the market on Monday.
Lastly, our effective tax rate for fiscal year ’10 was approximately 33% while the effective tax rate for Q4 was approximately 25%.  This artificially low rate in Q4 was primarily the result of certain adjustments associated with the Michigan business tax.  For the coming year we expect the effective tax rate to normalize at approximately 36%.  
We have given you a considerable amount of detail related to our expectations for next year all of which cumulate in our current guidance of revenue in an expected range of $950 million to $1 billion and an expected EPS range of $0.48 to $0.56.  Given the many changes over the past year I would like to take a minute to remind you of the items that impacted fiscal year 2010 EPS and how to think about them in fiscal year 2011.  
First, the Gomez acquisition impacted operating results for the last five months of fiscal ’10.  For this time period Gomez results were basically breakeven as their profitability was impacted by acquisition costs, deferred revenue write downs and amortization of intangibles acquired.  As we move forward in fiscal year ’11, Gomez operations will continue at a breakeven to slightly profitable contribution margin as we continue to invest in this business for growth.
Secondly, we sold our QA operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.  QA had a significant impact on the first quarter operating results as the $52 million gain on the sale was included in operating income.  Third, the fourth quarter results for the past five fiscal years have been positively impacted by the settlement with IBM in March of 2005.  As reflected in other income on the income statement the 2010 settlement amount was $20.7 million.  The terms of the agreement are complete and there will be no settlement income in 2011.
These are the major issues when comparing fiscal 2010 to the EPS projection for fiscal 2011 and if we subtract the effects of QA and IBM from the fiscal 2010 results, remember Gomez was breakeven, the fiscal 2010 EPS on this pro forma basis is $0.38.  The low end of the fiscal 2011 guidance compared to 2010 on this basis reflects a 25% increase year-over-year.  Clearly, you can see we are expecting growth. 
Fiscal ’10 was a successful year of change for Compuware.  We are emboldened by our ability to implement the foundational changes and withstand the global recession.  This bodes well for our future as we capitalize on the changes we’ve made and on the investments we are making.

What we’re seeing in the marketplace Kirk is most new IT spend discretionary and other are going towards the development of web based apps and how that impacts market share, increased revenue, brand awareness and things like that.  
We also know that the complexity in that web environment, in the entire applications delivery chain beyond the firewall and then back to the datacenter is becoming much more complex.  You add the cloud complexity on top of that and companies are absolutely have to know how they’re applications are performing at the end user level and what’s causing performance issues if there are any.  So that’s driving a great increase in market share.  We actually expect that to even improve upon those numbers as we invest in expanding their reach globally and as we also start to get the synergies from the Vantage Compuware sales folks with the Gomez folks.  It’s all good.

The second thing is there are an accelerated catalyst from the federal stimulus funds coming in to the healthcare world which is going to drive some pretty great deals over the next fiscal year for Covisint.  Then finally, we established a brand new referenceable account in a new industry vertical and that existing customer is going to drive more revenues, more bookings but not only that, the bell weather for that industry it doesn’t have anything like it to date and we’re expecting to be able to announce sort of more formally entrance in to that industry sector moving forward.

There are some accelerants in there that the federal government has put in place for state based initiatives and the first largest tranche of that will happen over the next 12 months.  The implementation time frame, I mean we got the state of Minnesota up and running in about three to four weeks with their first case.

If I’ve had a network problem I buy a network",645,"I don’t want to get in to too much of the strategy for obvious reasons, competitive reasons primarily but I will say this.  The traditional buying behavior in APM has been around point specific solutions.  If I’ve had a network problem I buy a networking monitoring tool, server problem, mainframe problem, client problem, web problem, end user problem, you can just go on and that is because that has been the extent of the tools available.
When you walk in to an organization and you’re able to say, “Listen, you have a business issue where an application has to perform and that application delivers value at the end user.  Wouldn’t it be great if you had a single dashboard that gave you full visibility across the entire spectrum of the application delivery chain?”  So what’s going to happen first in the next six to 12 months is that we’re going to build up enough referenceability in enough industry sectors, in enough geographies so the leading bell weather account across the world are going to accomplish things that are going to give them a competitive advantage in the marketplace.
Once those reference accounts are in place we then 12 to 18 months out believe that we’ll be in a position to drive the rest of the world, the pragmatists out there a low risk solution that gives them that capability.  While all that’s going on we’re investing heavily in the ability to take the time and some of the science work that goes in to making this solution happen so it’s as we say frictionless as possible.
So to get to the point where you get to that inflection point you need enough critical mass of references which is a absolute critical goal this year.  Then, you need to have the ability to scale very, very quickly which if we’re doing everything right the competition will not be able to go.  So how do I get the solution in the market quickly as soon as the contract is signed deliver immediate value and go, go, go.  
With that expect the overall category of APM, I don’t have the exact numbers, I should have because we go to conferences and talk about this all the time, but it is substantial growth expected because of cloud drivers, web drivers and the complexity going in to the marketplace.  More complexity means more risk, you’ve got to solve the problem somehow.  Number two, if you have a differentiated solution that you can scale very quickly with low risk that’s a perfect [inaudible] which we think are great companies that can plug in to our backbone and then you’re not going to move to far without Perot have some initiatives, Dell Perot have some initiatives and certainly IBM markets some specific projects that they have going on.
So over the next year what will happen, and actually it’s more like the next two to three years, what will happen is as you’re seeing in the cloud market, these categories will get much better definition so you will have backbone capabilities, you’ll have specific use case solutions, all being partially funded by federal initiatives and then sustainable projects from major health systems, state governments and major physician groups and also the administrators.
As that occurs, as the categories get better defined, the buying will then pick up.  So the big projects will start early because of the federal stimulus funding, those will get going, categories and the players will be much better defined in the next 12 to 24 months and then once various constituents in the healthcare continuum understand those categories they can then pick and choose from the available contenders and that’s when you’ll see the real ramp in IT spend in the healthcare marketplace.  I’m not sure if that answered your question but that’s basically what’s going on.

I’m actually fairly pleased with the mainframe performance because more and more there are not a lot, if any, sort of the capacity deals that use to come in.  The work that has been going on over the last two years has really helped to stave off competitive pressures because of the requirement to build ROI use cases, value proposition studies with our customers.  
So as operating budgets were basically locked down during the recession, the mainframe numbers that you’re seeing have really been driven from I think better salesmanship from our group overall, not just sales but the supporting mechanism in place.  That really means competitors coming in, are we providing value, how we differentiate it and making sure that we have a strong relationship and a seat at the table.  Those things have gone well and obviously could have gone a lot worse if we hadn’t done those things over the last 24 months.  
Having said that, the recession did occur and as we saw I think there was a 19% decline in MIPs shipments this last quarter from IBM, there has been a cooling off a little bit of the mainframe marketplace.  I don’t know enough to predict whether the new mainframe series coming out we think in September time frame is going to release some of this pent up demand.  Because we’re being somewhat conservative we didn’t build that in to our model, that would all be very positive news for us.  
Then, also potential upside of some of these new partner relationships that we’ve established in the mainframe business that we have not traditionally had, those kinds of things will make us I think a little higher presence in the marketplace.  So basically flat is the guidance.  If there is new demand coming through these new mainframe series that’s going to be a positive trend for us.

This quarter gives us a great opportunity to numerically look at the transition that Compuware has gone through. A simple way to look at the Compuware business is in three segments; our Non-Mainframe Solutions,",1365,"Thanks, Lisa, and good afternoon, everybody. This quarter gives us a great opportunity to numerically look at the transition that Compuware has gone through. A simple way to look at the Compuware business is in three segments; our Non-Mainframe Solutions, Mainframe Solutions and Professional Services.
Compared to last year, our Non-Mainframe Solutions revenue has improved 12.5% and that’s including the quality and testing that we divested this time last year. If you exclude the divested quality and testing business, it has grown 44%.
Much more importantly than the numbers, the portfolio is dramatically healthier as we’re now delivering compelling and disruptive solutions in relevant and high growth categories.
Doing fewer things better has distanced Compuware from our competitors and allowed us to provide thought leadership where we can be best-in-class. Our Mainframe business continues to deliver great stability. Although across the industry mainframe capacity is down, which reduces some capability to deliver new license billings with renewal transactions.
Our customer retention, however, the percentage remains very high with mainframe maintenance renewals in the mid-to-low 90s. We were basically one deal away from making our mainframe revenue numbers this quarter.
Finally, the Compuware Professional Services contribution margin doubled over last year. To hit these targets, we purposefully reduced revenues $7.9 million year-on-year by getting out of low margin and no margin contracts. The services business is today much healthier as it can now deliver both revenue and margin growth.
Here is some details on Compuware’s performance improvement. Vantage grew more than 50% in license fees. Gomez, the web performance division had revenues of $13.3 million and bookings of $19.4 million.
Demand for these solutions has been driven by major industry trends like the proliferation of web devices and browsers, cloud computing, software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service solutions, global collaboration and their dramatic increase in business web apps that drive brand awareness, market share and top line revenue growth.
This means that there will be a high demand on making sure these apps work all the way to the end user in much more complex IT environments. Compuware is the only company that can deliver a single, unified view of the apps performance all the way through the enterprise and all the elements of the Internet.
Performance matters. Application performance matters, because performance means money and these apps are more than ever mission-critical. Already we are finding that these unified capabilities elevate our discussions in prospect organization to more senior levels, we’re also finding increased increase from line of business executive outside of IT.
Our increased presence in thought leadership of the marketplace is starting to translate into shorter sales cycles and larger deals. Gomez alone drove 112 net new customers this quarter.
One of our goals this year is to achieve new references in the unified value proposition in leading companies in every industry sector and every geography, so far so good.
As wins include the world’s largest theme park and entertainment company, one of the world’s largest home building supply companies, one of the world’s premier wealth management institutions, two of the world’s largest insurance companies outside North America, one of the leading Asian Internet companies, and the world’s largest retailer, which included tripling the expansion of their existing usage.
Just as important, we saw increased usage from existing companies or customers, including the world’s largest U.S. retail bank, one of the largest satellite communications companies, one of North America’s leading capital market firms, and the world’s largest network systems provider. Also, of note was a large performance deal with the Australian government with a shortest sales cycle yet with that customer.
Moving forward we’ll continue to invest on our APM solutions to offer even more rapid return on investment. In Q1 we invested in Gomez infrastructure, expanded its network globally by 50%, with additional backbone nodes and last mile locations to offer more comprehensive worldwide data to our customers.
We will also continue improving ease-of-use and reducing time to value for our customers as more Compuware APM components become available as a hosted service.
Please take a look at the free service at www.cloudsleuth.net, where we have seeded all major cloud providers and deliver location specific global performance metrics within a full APM ecosystem. Over the coming quarters you will see many additional partners participate in this CloudSleuth service. We’re also looking forward to announcing a game changing solution in Q3 that shoots at a new high level water mark in the APM space.
Also in the coming quarters we will see continued improvement in cross selling between the Vantage and Gomez sales teams as tremendous opportunity exists to leverage our customer bases.
Covisint also had a strong quarter with a 16% year-over-year increased in revenues. Both the healthcare and manufacturing business are showing growth and strong pipelines. Momentum in healthcare is particularly growing due to state and federal interest in deploying health information exchanges. Our efforts to win state gees [ph] are progress well. And I expect we will begin to see wins late this year.
Our strong partnership with the AT&T, AMA also brings competitive advantage to our efforts. Furthermore the emerging markets groups within Covisint is starting to generate meaningful revenue in the oil and gas industry. I continue to be very bullish on the Covisint team meeting and exceeding the revenue growth target this year.
As a market leader in mainframe productivity solutions we continue to invest wisely in our product functionality, with the launch of our all new mainframe work bench we’re arming our customers to deal with the retiring workforce by making our products easier than ever to use for a point and click generation.
For more details on this, please visit mainframeinnovations.com. Obviously, we’re watching the macro conditions in mainframe market very closely as we have not built any substantial capacity increases into the plan due to the new zSeries. This could create some upside potential.
Alternatively, we are protective from any erosion in the mainframe space by the substantial growth in the distributed solutions. Also, as part of our commitment to our mainframe customers, we’ve already completed nearly 80 cost savings assessments. These assessments quantify how our products deliver value, provide our customers with actionable insights and position us for both strong renewals and new sales.
Changepoint has also had an outstanding quarter with nearly 80% year-over-year increase in license fees. Our focus on helping technology companies with services operations drive increase revenue has achieved traction in the marketplace. As you are going to see from our recent win with Steria, one of Europe’s leading technology companies.
Uniface also enjoyed a 38% improvement in license revenues as our ability to generate multi-tenant applications for our hosted environments becoming more important in the cloud world.
The Professional Services business continues to make progress on margins by now delivering on a consistent set of high demand practices were more effectively and profitably scaling our project business.
On the partnership front, we continue to bring strong results to the top and bottom line. We are well on our way to having partners drive 25% of our revenue, which is our stated goal by the end of fiscal year ‘012 and 40% by the end of fiscal year ‘013. Both Accenture and Cisco are bringing notable ATMs opportunities to our door, many with global 500 organizations that have significant future up-sell potential.
This quarter we’re also seeing increased momentum with Dell Perot Systems, where we’re developing a joint hospital focus from optimizing the availability and performance of electronic medical records.
Finally, we continue to execute a comprehensive practice around managed service providers, working with organizations like Cable &Wireless, Atos Origin, Dell Perot, and Tata, to name a few. Compuware is assuring that MSP hosted applications perform at peak level.
Given Compuware’s positive start to the fiscal year, we are reaffirming our guidance for earnings per share in the range of $0.48 to $0.56 and all revenue guidances for fiscal year ‘11.
We believe Q2 will produce roughly $0.08 to $0.10 of this total. Our leadership team feels great optimism about our growth potential and we have clear line of sight on how we’ll achieve our financial goals for years to come. Laura?

Fiscal year ‘11 definitely got off to a solid start as the strategic initiatives we put in place in fiscal year ‘10 continue to take (inaudible). This was evident in the momentum across our growth drivers, including Vantage, Gomez, Covisint, and Changepoint, which as Bob mentioned, saw significant growth year-over-year.
While we continue to make investments in support of our growth initiatives, we also remain diligently committed to expense management. As an organization, we understand the need to keep expenses in tow in order to meet our operating margin goals. We continually seek ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations, resulting in cost savings.
Fiscal year ‘11 got off to a good start as total expenses for Q1 came in at approximately $184 million, which was below our initial forecast of $195 million to $200 million, but just as a note going forward for Q2, I am still forecasting $195 million to $200 million for total operating expenses.
As we suggested last quarter might be the case, mainframe maintenance showed a slight year-over-year decline in Q1. Still, it is important to note that our mainframe maintenance renewal rate remained strong in the low-to-mid 90% range and maintenance revenue continues to be a source of strength for our company.
Our distributed maintenance continues to grow with Vantage and Changepoint, posting Q1 year-over-year maintenance growth of approximately 5% and 8% respectively. The subscription component of the maintenance line, our Gomez revenue was approximately $13.3 million for the quarter, which included a deferred revenue write-down of approximately $1.8 million.
For the quarter, operating cash flow came in at approximately $16.1 million, and we are maintaining our operating cash flow guidance for the year of approximately $225 million.
In terms of the stock buyback, in Q1 we repurchased approximately two million shares for about $15.9 million. We plan to purchase approximately $30 million of Compuware stock per quarter throughout the remainder of this fiscal year.
Finally, the guidance in the state of Michigan revenue tax bulletin published in May 2010 affected our calculation of a previously recorded deferred tax asset on our balance sheet. This adjustment resulted in a $2 million reduction of value of that deferred tax asset, which was expensed in the first quarter.
As a result, our effective tax rate for this quarter was approximately 46%. Without this adjustment, our effective tax rate would have been at 36%. At this time, we expect that our effective tax rate for the remainder of fiscal 2011 to normalize around 36%.
Again, Q1 was a good start to fiscal year ‘11. Our key growth drivers continue to perform. Expenses were below our expectations, our critically important maintenance space remained stable and our professional services business continues to show good margins. We will look to capitalize on this momentum throughout the rest of the fiscal year. Lisa?

On top of that, we’re just getting not just growth but accelerated growth from what we’re seeing in the tracks that we’re making in the APM space in particular, and then we also have a very healthy pipeline and commit in the Covisint business. What’s going on there is there are two big components to that distributed portfolio that are pure SaaS environments.
And so as you start to see growth in those SaaS environments, you basically start the quarter where you left off last quarter, and it just, as you know, continues to grow, grow, and grow. So those are the primary drivers, and then obviously, we’re just looking for continued stability in the mainframe space.

They tend to have a medium to low sort of Q1, medium to low Q2 and then Q3 and Q4 they accelerate. So that’s first. So we’re actually very happy with the numbers that they have showed in Q1 and beat internal plans.
The second thing is we’ve been doing a fairly good job of leveraging the joint sales force, but not good enough. We’ve put all the internal disciplines in place, processes, guidelines, comp plans to allow some leverage points between the two sales organization, but it’s going to become a management focus here to enforce and make sure that we’re doing the things that we need to, to leverage the joint customer base and opportunities.
Actually, two more things. The other thing is the demand. The demand for performance and some of the industry trends that I talked about are accelerating as new budget goes to web app development for growing mission critical operations in not just retail web companies, but brick and mortar companies as we’re starting to see more and more of those pop up. So that’s also going to accelerate growth.
And then the final thing is, we’re doing some really, really I think innovative things, as I intimated towards my comments, sort of, game changing things in this space that we think as we start to get traction with beta releases in Q3 and then, more streamline production releases towards the end of Q3, Q4, that will also further accelerate the opportunities in the APM space.

I’ll take a shot first and then Laura probably has a lot to add. First off is the lower revenue from a year ago is $7 million to $8 million and that happens to be also the number in which were down in Professional Services. So, some of that was managed that way because we wanted to get out of those bad contracts.
And when we did slightly miss our mainframe SLB [ph] number and that’s simply because we believe and we’ve heard from other companies out there in their earnings call that basically the capacity, which drives renewals and the opportunity to get new software license billings in the mainframe it’s just not as robust as it has been.
It will be interesting to see if it’s because of any pent-up demand in the new zSeries. So, those are the two primary reasons. One, for the lighter is Professional Services which was managed in that way and somewhat predictable and the other one is, the macro conditions around the mainframe marketplace.

So, what we believe is an opportunity is to take a very complex environment, as we talked about the trends in IT, and really make it a lot easier to achieve value and unlock value from a very complex environment in a shortest time as possible. So, typically you see weeks if not months worth of implementations going on.
We’re looking, beginning with a beta release in Q3, to turn that time to value into hours, and make it easier across the whole, not just sales cycle implementation on delivery cycle. And we think we can do that with some work on the existing technology components that we have and you would be sharing a lot more about that as we get into the end of Q2 and Q3.
We’ll be talking about the successes with some of the joint customers and partners that will bring into the table on it, and it will take a couple of months to make sure that everything is working as expected and that will go from there. I don’t want to sort of understate this, the ability for somebody or companies to eliminate or reduce risk in a substantial IT investment and get value immediately is a big deal and it’s not something that’s been around at all in the performance management space today.

Number one is, I could tell you, although I won’t, I could tell you to the date of right now when every single state is issuing RFPs, releasing funds, making decisions, obviously, they have the ability to change those dates, exactly where we’re at the sales cycle, and our percentage of chances of winning.
I would tell you that our position in these sales cycles has improved over the last several months, and so we’re greatly encouraged in that. Some of it just through direct relationships due to some of the people involved on the state side, some from existing footprints that we have in the states, and some through great relationships and credibility with the partnerships that I have mentioned earlier on. So we’re feeling good about our fair share of the pie, if you will. Now, as it relates to meaningful use, obviously, there was definitive clarity that came out, I think, it was last week.
Two things happened there. Number one is some of the guidelines were relaxed, which would say, okay, well, maybe that’s not so good because it gives some of the states and the major health systems some leeway.
The really good news is that the ones that were tightened and when we get into the exact specifics around meaningful use, don’t just adjacently play with our value proposition solution, they directly land square into the capabilities that Covisint has brought to market and will continue to bring to market, which also leads us to believe that we’re going to continue to strength our positions in some of these state bids. So, feeling pretty good, overall, about how this year will play out. Obviously, the big story there will be revenues as we get into Q4 and beyond into fiscal year ‘12.

So the mainframe, a lot of new software license billings are the catalyst for those changes in capacity gives us another chance to and obviously maintenance renewals, as they come up. Typically, we are doing maintenance renewal as well in advance of the maintenance renewal date, the traditional maintenance renewal date.
At the beginning of the year, our maintenance renewal opportunity was actually expected to be higher this year, about 10% higher than it was last year. So, the opportunity just on maintenance renewals and the number of conversations that we are having will lead to an increase in software license billings, should create some positive effect.
The challenge is and you hit at is that, what’s stopping or slowing down some of these decisions is either, A; the economy, which and I think both of these are true. A; of the economy and B; waiting, because the tech analysts are advising to wait until the new z11 series comes out, because it’s in theory more efficient. Now, there should be some interim play here because IBM also announced that I think the z9 wouldn’t be supported and in a certain period of time, you at least have to get to the z10, which are going to create some decisions along the way.
So, all that being said, you’ve got a bunch of things going on in the mainframe market. I know that our peers have got built in their guidance an uptick in mainframe numbers as a result of the new zSeries coming out.
I just can’t get comfortable with the fact that the economy is still very flat, the medium, small size companies that are on mainframes, they are making some movement toward distributed, which obviously helps us, the larger industry sector like global banks, obviously, they are increasing capacity, but they are just not willing to pay purely on increased software license, purely on capacity, as they have in the past. I mean there are some heavy, heavy negotiations and conversations going on.
So, overall, we guided flat on mainframe, and obviously, we’re watching it very, very closely. As soon as we get a feeling one way or another as to exactly which way it’s going to go, we’ll come out with updated guidance.

Thanks, Lisa. Last quarter, the evolution of Compuware’s business into a next generation software and services provider started to become numerically clear. This quarter provides additional clarity around the business as we increase year-over-year total revenues as our growth engines delivered outstanding results and as we exceeded Wall Street consensus for EPS.
As one of our analyst noted this quarter, signs of the dust has settled will be a victory and we believe that dust has settled. The rapid growth our application performance management and secure collaboration businesses diversify the company’s revenue mix adding recurrent revenue and additional visibility while protecting Compuware from market fluctuations in our more mature businesses. This revenue shift to more distributed and subscription base revenue will continue for the foreseeable future.
Total APM revenues, which consist of our Vantage and Gomez solutions, are up 25.8% on a pro forma basis, from the year ago period to $51.4 million. Vantage license fees are up 48.1% and Gomez subscription fees up 29.6% on a pro forma basis year-over-year. This clearly places Gomez as the largest and fastest web performance management solution on the world.
This growth is simply based on a differentiated and disruptive solution and a rapidly growing that analyst have predicted will be worth over $18 billion annually by 2013. Here’s why - virtually, every strategic application being written today in the world is web-based. These applications deliver revenue growth, improve market share and increase brand awareness.
The C [ph] Suite simply can’t fly blind with applications of this importance and Compuware is the only company that can offer an integrated view of applications performance across the entire applications delivery chain from the enterprise to the internet and through the cloud.
Whether a CEO of a large health system is delivering mission critical apps to physicians to become an accountable care organization or a CEO at a global bank needs to protect transaction revenue and improve regional market share by making sure their online banking systems are working well in every city, executives know that poorly performing applications create crisis. So, effectively, all companies is starting to leverage cloud strategies and there are many, are in the dark without our solutions.
Just recently we extended our competitive lead with the introduction of a new or new APM releases. According to tech analyst, our recent first mile solution offering as the most significant solution launched in the APM space in the decade. This solution includes integrated components of Vantage and Gomez and installs easily in a single appliance and is remotely configured. It measures application performance anywhere in the web, all the way through to the data center on a single dashboard.
Not only is this value proposition more substantial than anything in the market, the solution delivers value in minutes compared to weeks or months, which believe is game changing.
In advance to the First Mile release, Gomez out of a 127 new customers in Q2, we also completed 211 customer growth orders for a total 338 net new booking orders. That is both of those members are best ever results for Gomez in the quarter.
Specific highlights include entirely new orders from the larger association in the world for people over 50, as well as one of the world’s largest automobile OEMs, expansion orders came from two of North America’s leading financial institutions to the world’s largest conglomerates and two of the largest internet players in world.
In Q3, we have lofty goals to build on this success and are already in the process of delivering many household named accounts as references for the Gomez First Mile solution. We’re also very pleased with the Vantage license members especially in North America, where we saw 117% increase in the Vantage license revenues.
With these differentiated APM solutions, we’re attacking a big market with a compelling problem where we have a competitive advantage. As you can see it in the results, total APM bookings for the quarter reached $47.8 million, up 22% on a pro forma basis from $39.4 million in the same quarter last year.
Another one of rapid growth business is Covisint delivered an excellent quarter with a 27% increase in revenues and a 43% increase in contribution margin. You can see the financial leverage of the SAS model is beginning to add significant velocity to the business.
In the healthcare space, Covisint recently made a strategic acquisition of a company called DocSite. DocSite adds significant competitive advantage in all of Covisint’s target healthcare markets. These are health systems, state governments and physician’s organizations. DocSite gives Covisint an advantage by positioning our users to improve healthcare outcomes meaning quality of care, which is a specific requirement to receive the $18 billion in federal high tech funding and many more billions in federally funded Medicaid reimbursement programs.
We aim to win four state health information exchanges this year and DocSite is already running two statewide initiatives around quality reporting. We’re well positioned in these states as well as a number of others, but very few final selections have been made so far this year.
The energy and manufacturing verticals also show strength this quarter for Covisint. In energy, we currently have a multimillion dollar collaboration of system in place for one of the seven oil super majors. We will shortly be announcing the second and we are in sales cycles with three others of the super majors. There is an immediate compliance needs here and only one with clear cut player in the space.
Covisint has also been selected as a platform for connective vehicle initiatives at one of the largest global automotive manufacturers. This initiative allows users to view diagnostics, vehicle status and send remote commands via smartphone or traditional browsers.
Covisint was also selected this quarter to be the platform of choice for the world’s second largest business travel company. This program will add 8 million users, spanning over 3,000 companies to the Covisint platform as a part of a multimillion dollar deal starting to earn revenue in Q3.
Building around growth business is Compuware continues to create an ecosystem of powerful partners and influences. We don’t over heightened [ph] potential partnerships, but have just gotten on with it. With real customers and revenue already helping with our growth.
Of particular note, Cisco has recently named Compuware the APM solution to UCS platform, Cisco’s next generation computing platform. Compuware continues to see uptick on the UCS platform in combination with our APM solution across our customers and especially with our managed service provider partners.
Our partnerships with Accenture, BT, Cable & Wireless and many others are growing rapidly and showing increasing pipeline, whether through performance practices, cloud initiatives or managed service providers, our differentiator operating in the APM space is being [inaudible] around the world as an integral part of a partners go-to-market offerings.
We also increased our partnerships in brick countries. We expect significant improvements in quarter on quarter in these geographies.
Finally, on the partnership front, last quarter, we completed joint offering with one of the world’s largest SAP consultancies that will roll out in Q3.
Our growth initiatives continue benefit from stability, of profitability and cash flow of our more mature lines of business. Our Mainframe solutions in particular continue to enjoy over 90% customer renewal rates in Q2 supported by a market leadership position based upon more in the 35 years of development and field installations.
This quarter was a difficult revenue compare from the mainframe business. As Q2 last year had a large purchase from a government agency. The increase in IBM shipped capacity last quarter, however, is a very positive sign for us. This for trench of the new Z Series went to the largest companies and there is usually a time lag between ship and when those MIPS come online as our customers have described to us.
About 70% of our mainframe contracts whereby we receive the benefit at the time of the contract renewal. As our typical contracts or three or five year terms, the impact to our financials will be seen over that timeframe, but we’ll start in Q3. As we progress to the next two quarters, we’ll be in a position to model more specifically the positive effect of the spastic [ph]. For this reason, we remain conservative for mainframe business.
The professional services business has performed well and in lying with our expectations with total revenue as increasing slightly and margins 1% of this point year-over-year. We’re very confident in the ability of this business to contribute to both of our competitive advantage and our bottom line. As revenues increase, our discipline around more consistent and differentiated offerings and adherence to our margin requirements puts this business in the sound position to succeed moving forward.
Finally, this quarter, Uniface and Changepoint, both showed year-over-year license growth around 35%. This rapid growth is further evidence that the right strategies are in place for each of these solutions in their respective markets. We expect continued expansion in both of these areas.
For the next quarter, we expect $0.14 to 0.16 in earnings per share on $240 to 260 million in total revenue for the year. We are reiterating our guidance of $0.48 to 0.56 per share in earnings and revenues of approximately $950 million. We’re very comfortable with these ranges and our ability to deliver on them.
Overall, obviously, I’m very pleased with the hard work of our employees to put us in this position. There’s been a lot of change over the last several years and we believe that we have everything we need today to continue accelerating our growth. Obviously, we still look forward to targeted opportunities in the M&A market that could provide tuck in solutions in accord areas.
What is important now is marrying now is marrying our revenue growth with margin expansion and that will be our exclusive focus moving forward. Laura?

Highlighted by nearly 4% year-over-year top line growth, the second quarter was a positive follow-up to a strong Q1. We continue to build on our solid, quarterly performance and are pleased with our results, so far this fiscal year. We remain focus on our growth initiatives and our building momentum as we move in our traditionally strong third and fourth quarter periods.
As we focus on growth, we also continue to hold the line on expenses. If you recall, during our Q1 conference call, we say that we believe quarterly operating expenses would come in between a $195 to 200 million for each of the first two quarters.
Our actual for expenses for both Q1 and Q2 remain well below our plan at approximately $185 million. We had also previously given guidance that expenses for Q3 and Q4, but come in at about $210 million per quarter. We now believe Q3 and Q4 expenses will be approximately $195 to 200 million for each quarter.
Overall, our performances this quarter is a testament to managing expenses without sacrificing the investment needed to properly support our growth objectives. Enabling those investments in growth, we continue to retain an enviable, stable total maintenance phase. Increases in distributed maintenance are helping us set decreases in mainframe maintenance revenue. The decrease we see in the mainframe maintenance is primarily the byproduct of a soft market for new mainframe software sales.
As has been the case for some time now, our mainframe maintenance renewal rates though remain strong in the 90 plus percentage rate. This is the clearest indicator of the ongoing value customers received from our solutions.
The subscription component of the maintenance line, Gomez revenue was approximately $17.7 million representing and impressive 30 percent increase over the first quarter on a pro forma basis.
Our professional services business continues to make progress with revenue and margins trending higher. In Q2, our combined services contribution margins, which includes our Legacy services business, our product related services and Covisint was up over the first quarter increasing from 10.1% to 11.9%.
Operating cash flow for the first half of the year was approximately $13.4 million. Our goal of $225 million in operating cash flow for fiscal ‘11 remains obtainable if mainframe revenues regain some momentum. If mainframe revenue remains soft, it could put a strain on this goal, and push it closer to $200 million.
And regarding stock buyback, we repurchase approximately 5.5 million share or about $42.9 million. We now have approximately 218 million shares outstanding and we’ll continue to purchase shares as market and business conditions allow.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.7% and we now believe that Q3 and Q4 will be approximately 37% as well.
We are pleased with our results this quarter. Our performance in Q2 a period that has proven challenging in the past is yet another indicator that the company is on the right track. Our strategy is working and it’s being proven out each and every quarter. Our growth business has continued to perform roughly, our maintenance business remains stable and our services businesses have turned the corner and is now in the upswing.
Compuware truly is the technology performance company and organizations around the world are quickly coming to understand the unparalleled value we provide in insuring that their most important technologies, the ones that drive their businesses perform at their best.
The future is incredibly bright for Compuware and all its constituents, including employees, shareholders and of course, customers who are the true beneficiaries of our hard work and our groundbreaking innovation.

What’s of interest however is not only we’re seeing the average size of the deals in Gomez go up, but also a fairly nice uptick in the average size of the Vantage license deals and these are a traditional Vantage contracts. But because of the - just the buzz and the knowledge that the Gomez solution can be sort of we can get benefit from the Gomez solution as a next phase of implementation, it’s leading to a much more substantial initial footprint with the Vantage license software.
So, on both sides, the Gomez side and the Vantage side, we’re seeing the average size deal improve.

But nonetheless, we’re still seeing a - we’re a part of all the important selections going on.

So, the first quarter here, we’re really focused on making sure that we have a whole bunch of references coming out of the gate and if there are any sort of things that we need to learn as a result to the initial larger implementations, we’ll learn them now and make sure that we’re getting those all fix and in place before we do a broad base offering to our channels and partner program.
So, this quarter, we’ll see direct sales almost exclusively of the First Mile, so we can control the referenceability. Once we have major, major references across multiple geographies, which we’re hoping to get completed this quarter, then we do a much larger offering to our channels program and it’s going to take us that long and to get them trained and ready to go anyway.
