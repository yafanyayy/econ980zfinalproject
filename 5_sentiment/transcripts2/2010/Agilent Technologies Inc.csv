In a few moments, Adrian will provide you a detailed analysis of our Q1 financial results. I would like to provide you with a summary of results and overview of our market perspective and our outlook for the year. Agil",936,"Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. In a few moments, Adrian will provide you a detailed analysis of our Q1 financial results. I would like to provide you with a summary of results and overview of our market perspective and our outlook for the year. Agilent's Q1 revenues of $1.2 billion were up 4% year-over-year, while orders of $1.2 billion were up 9% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings were $135 million or $0.38 per share. Agilent's first quarter earnings, combined with solid asset management, enabled us to generate $30 million of operating cash flow. Q1 operating cash flow is usually negative or flat. However, we ended the quarter with a net cash of $1.2 billion. Agilent's Q1 performance exceeded our own expectations in a very solid start for fiscal year 2010. Several things have emerged from this quarter that I would like to highlight. First, all signs point to recovery in most of our key markets. Second, Agilent has significant upside potential as a result of the recovery.Assuming a continued market recovery, Agilent will deliver 10% revenue growth and an earnings per share of $1.65 to $1.70 for the full fiscal year 2010. In Q1, we are already reporting mid-cycle operating margins of 15% and a 21% return on invested capital. The global recovery is being led by Asia and by China in particular. Excluding Japan, Asia's revenues are up 20% and China's revenues were up about 30%. Agilent's continued ability to participate in a rapid Asian recovery bodes well as we progress into 2010. Q1 orders and non-Japan Asia grew more than 25% year-over-year. This level of orders equaled more than 30% of Agilent's Q1 orders. The Americas and Europe has stabilized and were relatively flat over last year on a currency-adjusted basis. Our business in Europe is benefiting from a favorable currency exchange. Due to stabilization in America and Europe and strong growth in Asia, we believe Agilent's annual revenue growth will be in the range of 10% for fiscal year 2010, excluding the recently-announced divestiture of our Network Solutions business and the future acquisition of Varian.From a market perspective, we saw year-over-year revenue growth in almost every key market. Our Chemical Analysis business had an outstanding quarter. Revenues were up 13% year-over-year, with all key end markets up in double digits: Food, plus 17%; petrochemical, plus 12%; and environmental forensics, up 9%. The team has executed very well and experienced excellent growth in GC/MS and ICP-MS instrument platforms. In addition, we had solid double-digit growth in our Consumables business, as well as excellent growth in our Service business. Our Life Science business also had an excellent quarter, with revenue up 10% over last year. Driven by solid performance in Pharma, plus 8%, and continued growth in academic and government, up 15%. The market acceptance of our new 1290 LC has been outstanding. Likewise, we saw a double-digit revenue growth in our Microarray, Radiant [ph] PCR and  Informatic businesses.Electronic Measurement revenue was down 2% over last quarter, but a dramatic improvement over the last four quarters. Industrial, Computer and Semiconductor markets were up 13%, Aerospace and Defense was up 12%. However, this strong growth was offset by a 23% decline in our Communication business due to the lack of demand for handset test capacity and again, we believe this may continue for the next quarter.  We have fundamentally reset -- even more encouraging was the order growth of 8% year-over-year. Given our order growth in quarterly comparisons with a very weak 2009, we are still expecting a double-digit growth for the remainder of 2010. We have fundamentally reset the operating model in Electronic Measurement. Electronic Measurement will deliver double-digit profit at a $2.4 billion annual run rate of revenue. This year, Electronic Measurement will deliver over 100% incremental profit. While the restructuring of Electronic Measurement has been painful, we continue to focus resources on major market opportunities and product solutions. We have entered 2010 in a very strong market position, with a leadership position in network analyzers, spectrum analyzers and a very strong product portfolio of oscilloscopes. Yesterday, we announced the divestiture of our Network Solutions business. This is the third divestiture we have made in Electronic Measurement group over the last year. We continue to make decisions to focus on our core Electronic Measurement capability, consistent with the new Electronic Measurement group operating model. Adrian will provide more details about the change in our Electronic Measurement group model during his presentation and the corresponding impact on Agilent's financial performance.In summary, we believe we're in an excellent position as we enter Q2. As a result of maintaining our investments in R&D during the downturn, our focus in differential technologies and new product introductions and executing on our $525 million restructuring plan, we will be able to drive significant incremental profit as the markets recover. For the second quarter of 2010, we expect revenues to grow on the range of 12% to 15% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.42 per share compared to last year's $0.13 per share. One final note regarding the status of Varian acquisition. We continue to work with Varian, U.S. and EU regulators and potential buyers of the product lines to be divested. We have announced one of the divestitures and hope to reach definitive agreements for the other product lines as soon as possible. We continue to be extremely excited about the potential of the combination of two of the founding companies in Silicon Valley. Thank you for being on the call. Now I'll turn it over to Adrian."

I;m going to offer a few overall perspectives on the quarter for Agilent, review the performance of our three business segments and conclude with some thoughts about the outlook for Agilent's second quarter and full-year 2010, then we'll turn it back to Alicia for the Q&A.Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter operating results. The growth in orders and revenues suggest that the economic recovery that we first glimpsed at the end of Q4 has gained momentum over the past three months and that it should both broaden and deepen as the year progresses. Our earnings performance demonstrates the power of Agilent's operating model as our markets recover, as well as the clear benefits of our $525 million restructuring program. Orders of $1.22 billion were up 9% from a year ago and all three of our business segments were up from last year. Revenues of $1.21 billion were up 4% from one year ago, with both Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis up double digits, and Electronic Measurement down only 2%. Geographically, the star was non-Japan Asia, which was up 20% while Europe was up 6% in dollars and flat in euros, and the Americas were off 2% from last year. What is perhaps most remarkable about this quarter's performance is that we hit our mid-cycle operating metrics at the beginning of a new economic cycle. Operating profits of $181 million in the quarter equate to a 15% operating margin and our return on invested capital in the quarter was 21%.We were also encouraged by our balance sheet performance. Inventory days on hand at 93 days was 19 days better than one year ago. Receivable day sales outstanding at 47 were to days better than last year. During the seasonally-weak Q1, we generated $30 million of cash from operations and ended the quarter with net cash of $1.2 billion. In short, we're pleased with the performance of the company this quarter and excited to demonstrate what Agilent can achieve for both customers and shareholders in the years ahead.Okay, turning to the numbers. We had orders of $1.22 billion, up 9% from one year ago. Electronic Measurement was up 8%. Life Sciences was up 9% and Chemical Analysis was up 12% from one year ago. First quarter revenues of $1.21 billion were up 4% from last year and up 1%, excluding currency impacts. Electronic Measurement, down 2%; Life Sciences, up 10%; and Chemical Analysis group, up 13% from one year ago. It is worth noting that as of the first quarter, Asia had 36% of revenues is as large as the Americas for Agilent. In fact, excluding Japan, Asia represents about 26% of Agilent's revenues and with first quarter growth rates of 20%, non-Japan Asia is clearly driving the company's overall growth trajectory. First quarter gross margins at 56.1% or nearly two points higher than last year, with Electronic Measurement up three points despite lower volumes, and both Chemical Analysis and Life Sciences gross margins essentially flat with last year. We have also maintained aggressive control over operating expenses. Compared to last year, total first quarter expenses were down $39 million or 7%. Excluding currency, the drop in spending was $55 million or 10%. And that includes $11 million higher variable pay than one year ago, reflecting our better ROIC performance. As reported, R&D spending at $146 million was down 11% from last year and at 12% of revenues was down two points from one year ago. SG&A at $353 million was down 6%, and at 29.1% of revenues, was three points lower than last year at this time.Operating profits of $181 million were up 91% from last year. The company's first quarter operating margin was 14.9%, up nearly seven points from one year ago, and as mentioned earlier, essentially at our mid-cycle targets.Other income and expense was down $8 million from last year, including an $11 million reduction in net interest income. Our tax rate during the quarter was 20%. Pro forma net income of $135 million or $0.38 per share compares to $0.20 per share one year ago.Okay. Going from non-GAAP to GAAP, Page 4 of our press release financial tables provides a detailed reconciliation from non-GAAP to GAAP income. Summarizing, we had non-GAAP income of $135 million. We had restructuring and impairment charges of $48 million, non-cash amortization of $10 million and $2 million income in taxes and other, resulting in GAAP income during the quarter of $79 million or $0.22 per share compared to about $0.18 per share one year ago.Turning to cash, as I mentioned earlier, DSOs at 47 were two days better than a year ago and on a dollar basis, were essentially equal to a year ago. Inventories on the other hand improved dramatically at 93 days, down 19 days from last year, $107 million lower inventories today than one year ago. Total cash generated from operations was plus $30 million. During the quarter, we had $25 million of CapEx. Included in that cash is $40 million of depreciation and amortization, and we spent $12 million during the quarter on acquisitions. During the quarter, we had $103 million of share issuances related to options exercises and our employees stock purchase plan were about 4.9 million shares. During the quarter, we also repurchased about $100 million of shares or about 2.9 million shares. We also had about $1.4 million of share dilution from the increase in our share price during the quarter from $26.30 to $29.34. We ended the quarter with $354 million fully diluted shares outstanding which, ignoring the 1.4 million additional shares from the higher share price, is about 2.6 million more than we intended. There were more options exercises than we anticipated, and for much of the quarter, we were under 10b5 constraints and so weren't able to respond to the higher level of options exercises. This quarter, we will try to get the share count back down to 350 million, again ignoring the impact of the varying share price on the diluted share count. As mentioned earlier, we finished the quarter with net cash and short-term investments of $1.2 billion, up $350 million from one year ago.Okay, turning to segment information. As most of you know, we redefined our business segments at the beginning of this year, and Alicia's team has provided historical financial data for the new segments. As a reminder, we now have a revised Electronic Measurement segment, which incorporates the prior Semiconductor & Board Test segment and is run by Ron Nersesian. We have also split the old Bio-Analytical segment in reflection of its increasing importance to the company into Life Sciences, headed by Nick Roelofs and Chemical Analysis, run by Mike McMullen. The press release provides a good amount of detail on the segment results. And Bill, earlier, detailed overall market trends and so I will try not to be redundant in my remarks. We also have the three segment Presidents year and available for any detailed questions, should you have them. But I will try to do is focus on the financial results by segment and give you a sense for our expectations for operating performance during the remainder of the year.Turning first to Life Sciences, this segment had first quarter orders of $336 million, 9% above last year and up 4% on a currency-adjusted basis. Life Sciences revenues of $340 million were up 10% or 5% in local currency terms. Geographically, the Americas were up 3% and Europe was up 9% in dollars or about 3% in local currency terms. Japan was up 16%, while other Asia, led by China, rose fully 28% from one year ago. First quarter Life Sciences segment income was $55 million, up $11 million on a $31 million increase in revenues or at 36% incremental. Gross margins were about flat at 54%, while operating margin at 16% was up two points from one year ago. Segment ROIC improved five points to 21%. Looking ahead to the rest of 2010, we expect the first quarter momentum we saw to continue through the remainder of the year, with full-year revenues up 10% to 12% from fiscal 2009. From an operating model perspective, we anticipate a mid-30s incremental operating margin contribution, similar to Q1's performance.Turning next to Chemical Analysis, we also saw a robust performance from this segment. Orders of $242 million were up 12% from one year ago and up 7% in local currency terms. Revenues of $244 million were 13% above last year and up 9% in constant dollars. Geographically, the Americas lagged, down 3% from last year. Europe and Japan were up nearly 20%, while other Asia jumped 23% from one year ago. By the way, it is probably worth noting that for Chemical Analysis, other Asia revenue at 29% is now larger than the Americas, at 27%. First quarter segment income of $67 million was $10 million above last year on a $28 million increase in revenues or a very attractive 38% incremental performance. Gross margins were stable at 55%, while operating margins improved one and a half points to 27.5%. Segment ROIC jumped 15 points to 60%. Looking ahead, we expect the recovery of Chemical Analysis markets to continue and to broaden across geographies. At this point, we expect full year 2010 revenue growth of roughly 15%, and consistent with Agilent's operating model, a 35% to 40% operating profit incremental on that additional volume.Finally, looking at Electronic Measurement markets, we are seeing clear signs of a market turnaround that is beginning to gain momentum. First quarter orders of $642 million were 8% above one year ago, or up 6% in local currency terms, the first increase in orders since early 2008. Revenues, lagging orders, were down 2% from last year. Market trends were sharply bifurcated, with Industrial, Computer and Semiconductor markets up double digits, but Communications revenues still down 23% from one year ago. Geographically, revenues were down 3% in the Americas and Europe. Japan was very weak, off 26%, while other Asia was up 16% from last year, led by a 29% increase in China. Electronic Measurement's first quarter operating profit of $58 million was $64 million above one year ago despite $12 million lower revenues, clearly showing the cumulative benefits of the resizing of this business. Gross margins rose by three points to 57%, while segment operating margins improved by 10 points to 9%. Segment ROIC rose 13 points to 13%. Looking ahead, Electronic Measurement's $325 million restructuring program will be completed at fiscal midyear when we expect to hit a 12% operating margin at an annual revenue run rate of $2.4 billion. We also expect the market recovery to continue as we continue to track the trend of semiconductor shipments with a one quarter lag. Overall, we expect revenue to be up roughly 10% this year on an apples-to-apples basis, excluding the divestiture of the Network Systems division that we announced yesterday. Given the successful restructuring of this business, we expect the incremental operating margin this year will be above 100%. Longer term, as a result of the actions we've taken, including shutting or divesting product lines that couldn't achieve Agilent's operating model, we expect this segment to generate a consistent 40% incremental operating margin.Finally, turning to the outlook for our second quarter of fiscal 2010, Bill mentioned that on a stand-alone basis, we expect revenues to be about 12% to 15% above last year and non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.42 per share. For the full year, we now expect Agilent's standalone revenues to be up roughly 10%, and non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $1.65 to $1.70 per share. These forecasts obviously do not include the impact of the Varian acquisition, they also ignore the impact of the Network Systems division divestiture that we announced yesterday. Assuming that the NSD transaction closes at our fiscal midyear, the impact would be to reduce our revenue growth this year by two points to roughly 8% year-over-year growth. The divestiture is expected to have no material impact on this year's earnings per share. More generally, whatever the economic outlook for 2010 and beyond, our commitment is to deliver performance consistent with Agilent's operating model, characterized by businesses that, one, achieve an average 20% ROIC over the economic cycle; two, achieve 30% to 40% operating profit incrementals throughout the cycle; and three, are cash flow positive from operations at every point in the economic cycle. With that, I'll turn it back to Alicia for the Q&A."

You're right that at the split of Hewlett-Packard, this segment of the market became more visible through the work that have been done under Hewlett-Packard even before the separation. But our core confidence is in physical science. This core confidence also what we're using to leverage into our Life Science and Chemical Analysis market. I firmly believe that the company should continue to focus on its core competence, and so making this divestiture, teeming it with a company such as JDSU, that is really focused in that area, is better for our customers, as well as for our employees. And so I think it is absolutely the right decision for the company going, particularly given the direction the company is headed."

In a few moments, Adrian will provide you a detailed analysis of our Q1 financial results. I would like to provide you with a summary of results and overview of our market perspective and our outlook for the year. Agilent's Q1 revenues of $1.2 billion were up 4% year-over-year, while orders of $1.2 billion were up 9% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings were $135 million or $0.38 per share. Agilent's first quarter earnings, combined with solid asset management, enabled us to generate $30 million of operating cash flow. Q1 operating cash flow is usually negative or flat. However, we ended the quarter with a net cash of $1.2 billion. Agilent's Q1 performance exceeded our own expectations in a very solid start for fiscal year 2010. Several things have emerged from this quarter that I would like to highlight. First, all signs point to recovery in most of our key markets. Second, Agilent has significant upside potential as a result of the recovery.Assuming a continued market recovery, Agilent will deliver 10% revenue growth and an earnings per share of $1.65 to $1.70 for the full fiscal year 2010. In Q1, we are already reporting mid-cycle operating margins of 15% and a 21% return on invested capital. The global recovery is being led by Asia and by China in particular. Excluding Japan, Asia's revenues are up 20% and China's revenues were up about 30%. Agilent's continued ability to participate in a rapid Asian recovery bodes well as we progress into 2010. Q1 orders and non-Japan Asia grew more than 25% year-over-year. This level of orders equaled more than 30% of Agilent's Q1 orders. The Americas and Europe has stabilized and were relatively flat over last year on a currency-adjusted basis. Our business in Europe is benefiting from a favorable currency exchange. Due to stabilization in America and Europe and strong growth in Asia, we believe Agilent's annual revenue growth will be in the range of 10% for fiscal year 2010, excluding the recently-announced divestiture of our Network Solutions business and the future acquisition of Varian.From a market perspective, we saw year-over-year revenue growth in almost every key market. Our Chemical Analysis business had an outstanding quarter. Revenues were up 13% year-over-year, with all key end markets up in double digits: Food, plus 17%; petrochemical, plus 12%; and environmental forensics, up 9%. The team has executed very well and experienced excellent growth in GC/MS and ICP-MS instrument platforms. In addition, we had solid double-digit growth in our Consumables business, as well as excellent growth in our Service business. Our Life Science business also had an excellent quarter, with revenue up 10% over last year. Driven by solid performance in Pharma, plus 8%, and continued growth in academic and government, up 15%. The market acceptance of our new 1290 LC has been outstanding. Likewise, we saw a double-digit revenue growth in our Microarray, Reagent PCR and  Informatic businesses.Electronic Measurement revenue was down 2% over last quarter, but a dramatic improvement over the last four quarters. Industrial, Computer and Semiconductor markets were up 13%, Aerospace and Defense was up 12%. However, this strong growth was offset by a 23% decline in our Communication business due to the lack of demand for handset test capacity and again, we believe this may continue for the next quarter.  We have fundamentally reset -- even more encouraging was the order growth of 8% year-over-year. Given our order growth in quarterly comparisons with a very weak 2009, we are still expecting a double-digit growth for the remainder of 2010. We have fundamentally reset the operating model in Electronic Measurement. Electronic Measurement will deliver double-digit profit at a $2.4 billion annual run rate of revenue. This year, Electronic Measurement will deliver over 100% incremental profit. While the restructuring of Electronic Measurement has been painful, we continue to focus resources on major market opportunities and product solutions. We have entered 2010 in a very strong market position, with a leadership position in network analyzers, spectrum analyzers and a very strong product portfolio of oscilloscopes. Yesterday, we announced the divestiture of our Network Solutions business. This is the third divestiture we have made in Electronic Measurement Group over the last year. We continue to make decisions to focus on our core Electronic Measurement capability, consistent with the new Electronic Measurement Group operating model. Adrian will provide more details about the change in our Electronic Measurement Group model during his presentation and the corresponding impact on Agilent's financial performance.In summary, we believe we're in an excellent position as we enter Q2. As a result of maintaining our investments in R&D during the downturn, our focus in differential technologies and new product introductions and executing on our $525 million restructuring plan, we will be able to drive significant incremental profit as the markets recover. For the second quarter of 2010, we expect revenues to grow in the range of 12% to 15% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.42 per share compared to last year's $0.13 per share. One final note regarding the status of Varian acquisition. We continue to work with Varian, U.S. and EU regulators and potential buyers of the product lines to be divested. We have announced one of the divestitures, and hope to reach definitive agreements for the other product lines as soon as possible. We continue to be extremely excited about the potential of the combination of two of the founding companies in Silicon Valley. Thank you for being on the call. Now I'll turn it over to Adrian."

I;m going to offer a few overall perspectives on the quarter for Agilent, review the performance of our three business segments and conclude with some thoughts about the outlook for Agilent's second quarter and full-year 2010. Then we'll turn it back to Alicia for the Q&A.Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter operating results. The growth in orders and revenues suggest that the economic recovery that we first glimpsed at the end of Q4 has gained momentum over the past three months and that it should both broaden and deepen as the year progresses. Our earnings performance demonstrates the power of Agilent's operating model as our markets recover, as well as the clear benefits of our $525 million restructuring program. Orders of $1.22 billion were up 9% from a year ago and all three of our business segments were up from last year. Revenues of $1.21 billion were up 4% from one year ago, with both Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis up double digits, and Electronic Measurement down only 2%. Geographically, the star was non-Japan Asia, which was up 20% while Europe was up 6% in dollars and flat in euros, and the Americas were off 2% from last year. What is perhaps most remarkable about this quarter's performance is that we hit our mid-cycle operating metrics at the beginning of a new economic cycle. Operating profits of $181 million in the quarter equate to a 15% operating margin and our return on invested capital in the quarter was 21%.We were also encouraged by our balance sheet performance. Inventory days on hand at 93 days was 19 days better than one year ago. Receivable day sales outstanding at 47 were to days better than last year. During the seasonally-weak Q1, we generated $30 million of cash from operations and ended the quarter with net cash of $1.2 billion. In short, we're pleased with the performance of the company this quarter and excited to demonstrate what Agilent can achieve for both customers and shareholders in the years ahead.Okay, turning to the numbers. We had orders of $1.22 billion, up 9% from one year ago. Electronic Measurement was up 8%. Life Sciences was up 9% and Chemical Analysis was up 12% from one year ago. First quarter revenues of $1.21 billion were up 4% from last year and up 1%, excluding currency impacts. Electronic Measurement, down 2%; Life Sciences, up 10%; and Chemical Analysis Group, up 13% from one year ago. It is worth noting that as of the first quarter, Asia had 36% of revenues is as large as the Americas for Agilent. In fact, excluding Japan, Asia represents about 26% of Agilent's revenues and with first quarter growth rates of 20%, non-Japan Asia is clearly driving the company's overall growth trajectory. First quarter gross margins at 56.1% or nearly two points higher than last year, with Electronic Measurement up three points despite lower volumes, and both Chemical Analysis and Life Sciences gross margins essentially flat with last year. We have also maintained aggressive control over operating expenses. Compared to last year, total first quarter expenses were down $39 million or 7%. Excluding currency, the drop in spending was $55 million or 10%. And that includes $11 million higher variable pay than one year ago, reflecting our better ROIC performance. As reported, R&D spending at $146 million was down 11% from last year, and at 12% of revenues was down two points from one year ago. SG&A at $353 million was down 6%, and at 29.1% of revenues, was three points lower than last year at this time.Operating profits of $181 million were up 91% from last year. The company's first quarter operating margin was 14.9%, up nearly seven points from one year ago and as mentioned earlier, essentially at our mid-cycle targets.Other income and expense was down $8 million from last year, including an $11 million reduction in net interest income. Our tax rate during the quarter was 20%. Pro forma net income of $135 million or $0.38 per share compares to $0.20 per share one year ago.Okay. Going from non-GAAP to GAAP, Page 4 of our press release financial tables provides a detailed reconciliation from non-GAAP to GAAP income. Summarizing, we had non-GAAP income of $135 million. We had restructuring and impairment charges of $48 million, non-cash amortization of $10 million and $2 million income in taxes and other, resulting in GAAP income during the quarter of $79 million or $0.22 per share compared to about $0.18 per share one year ago.Turning to cash, as I mentioned earlier, DSOs at 47 were two days better than a year ago and on a dollar basis, were essentially equal to a year ago. Inventories on the other hand improved dramatically at 93 days, down 19 days from last year, $107 million lower inventories today than one year ago. Total cash generated from operations was plus $30 million. During the quarter, we had $25 million of CapEx. Included in that cash is $40 million of depreciation and amortization, and we spent $12 million during the quarter on acquisitions. During the quarter, we had $103 million of share issuances related to options exercises, and our employees stock purchase plan were about 4.9 million shares. During the quarter, we also repurchased about $100 million of shares or about 2.9 million shares. We also had about $1.4 million of share dilution from the increase in our share price during the quarter from $26.30 to $29.34. We ended the quarter with $354 million fully diluted shares outstanding which, ignoring the 1.4 million additional shares from the higher share price, is about 2.6 million more than we intended. There were more options exercises than we anticipated, and for much of the quarter, we were under 10b5 constraints and so weren't able to respond to the higher level of options exercises. This quarter, we will try to get the share count back down to 350 million, again ignoring the impact of the varying share price on the diluted share count. As mentioned earlier, we finished the quarter with net cash and short-term investments of $1.2 billion, up $350 million from one year ago.Okay, turning to segment information. As most of you know, we redefined our business segments at the beginning of this year. And Alicia's team has provided historical financial data for the new segments. As a reminder, we now have a revised Electronic Measurement segment, which incorporates the prior Semiconductor & Board Test segment and is run by Ron Nersesian. We have also split the old Bio-Analytical segment in reflection of its increasing importance to the company into Life Sciences, headed by Nick Roelofs and Chemical Analysis, run by Mike McMullen. Press release provides a good amount of detail on the segment results and Bill, earlier, detailed overall market trends, and so I will try not to be redundant in my remarks. We also have the three segment Presidents here and available for any detailed questions, should you have them. What I will try to do is focus on the financial results by segment, and give you a sense for our expectations for operating performance during the remainder of the year.Turning first to Life Sciences, this segment had first quarter orders of $336 million, 9% above last year and up 4% on a currency-adjusted basis. Life Sciences revenues of $340 million were up 10% or 5% in local currency terms. Geographically, the Americas were up 3% and Europe was up 9% in dollars or about 3% in local currency terms. Japan was up 16%, while other Asia, led by China, rose fully 28% from one year ago. First quarter Life Sciences segment income was $55 million, up $11 million on a $31 million increase in revenues or at 36% incremental. Gross margins were about flat at 54%, while operating margin at 16% was up two points from one year ago. Segment ROIC improved five points to 21%. Looking ahead to the rest of 2010, we expect the first quarter momentum we saw to continue through the remainder of the year, with full year revenues up 10% to 12% from fiscal 2009. From an operating model perspective, we anticipate a mid-30s incremental operating margin contribution, similar to Q1's performance.Turning next to Chemical Analysis, we also saw a robust performance from this segment. Orders of $242 million were up 12% from one year ago and up 7% in local currency terms. Revenues of $244 million were 13% above last year and up 9% in constant dollars. Geographically, the Americas lagged, down 3% from last year. Europe and Japan were up nearly 20%, while other Asia jumped to 23% from one year ago. By the way, it is probably worth noting that for Chemical Analysis, other Asia revenue at 29% is now larger than the Americas, at 27%. First quarter segment income of $67 million was $10 million above last year on a $28 million increase in revenues or a very attractive 38% incremental performance. Gross margins were stable at 55%, while operating margins improved one and a half points to 27.5%. Segment ROIC jumped 15 points to 60%. Looking ahead, we expect the recovery of Chemical Analysis markets to continue and to broaden across geographies. At this point, we expect full year 2010 revenue growth of roughly 15%, and consistent with Agilent's operating model, a 35% to 40% operating profit incremental on that additional volume.Finally, looking at Electronic Measurement markets, we are seeing clear signs of a market turnaround that is beginning to gain momentum. First quarter orders of $642 million were 8% above one year ago, or up 6% in local currency terms, the first increase in orders since early 2008. Revenues, lagging orders, were down 2% from last year. Market trends were sharply bifurcated, with industrial, computer and semiconductor markets up double digits, but communications revenues still down 23% from one year ago. Geographically, revenues were down 3% in the Americas and Europe. Japan was very weak, off 26%, while other Asia was up 16% from last year, led by a 29% increase in China. Electronic Measurement's first quarter operating profit of $58 million was $64 million above one year ago despite $12 million lower revenues, clearly showing the cumulative benefits of the resizing of this business. Gross margins rose by three points to 57%, while segment operating margins improved by 10 points to 9%. Segment ROIC rose 13 points to 13%. Looking ahead, Electronic Measurement's $325 million restructuring program will be completed at fiscal mid-year when we expect to hit a 12% operating margin at an annual revenue run rate of $2.4 billion. We also expect the market recovery to continue as we continue to track the trend of semiconductor shipments with a one quarter lag. Overall, we expect revenue to be up roughly 10% this year on an apples-to-apples basis, excluding the divestiture of the Network Systems division that we announced yesterday. Given the successful restructuring of this business, we expect the incremental operating margin this year will be above 100%. Longer term, as a result of the actions we've taken, including shutting or divesting product lines that couldn't achieve Agilent's operating model, we expect this segment to generate a consistent 40% incremental operating margin.Finally, turning to the outlook for our second quarter of fiscal 2010, Bill mentioned that on a stand-alone basis, we expect revenues to be about 12% to 15% above last year and non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.42 per share. For the full year, we now expect Agilent's standalone revenues to be up roughly 10%, and non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $1.65 to $1.70 per share. These forecasts obviously do not include the impact of the Varian acquisition, they also ignore the impact of the Network Systems division divestiture that we announced yesterday. Assuming that the NSD transaction closes at our fiscal midyear, the impact would be to reduce our revenue growth this year by two points to roughly 8% year-over-year growth. The divestiture is expected to have no material impact on this year's earnings per share. More generally, whatever the economic outlook for 2010 and beyond, our commitment is to deliver performance consistent with Agilent's operating model, characterized by businesses that, one, achieve an average 20% ROIC over the economic cycle; two, achieve 30% to 40% operating profit incrementals throughout the cycle; and three, are cash flow positive from operations at every point in the economic cycle. With that, I'll turn it back to Alicia for the Q&A."

But our core confidence is in physical science. This core confidence also what we're using to leverage into our Life Science and Chemical Analysis market. I firmly believe that the company should continue to focus on its core competence, and so making this divestiture, teeming it with a company such as JDSU, that is really focused in that area, is better for our customers, as well as for our employees. And so I think it is absolutely the right decision for the company going, particularly given the direction the company is headed."

In a few moments, Didier will provide you with an overview of our Q2 financial results. I will provide you with a summary of results, our market perspective and our outlook for the second half of the fiscal year. 
Agilent continues to capitalize on the global economic recovery. Q2 orders of $1.35 billion were up 31% year-over-year, while revenues of $1.27 billion were up 16% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings were $152 million or $0.43 per share.
Agilent's second quarter earnings combined with solid asset management enabled us to generate $224 million of operating cash flow. We ended the quarter with net cash of $1.4 billion. 
All regions grew by double digits year-over-year, led by a 24% increase in Asia Pacific. Growth rates in China have moderated from their record highs but remain in double digits. Overall, Agilent's large and established presence in Asia will continue to serve as a strong competitive differentiator. 41% of Agilent's business resides in Asia, a record high percent. 
Europe grew 10% year-over-year while the Americas were up 13% from a year ago. From a market perspective, we saw year-over-year revenue growth in most of our key markets that we serve. 
Our Chemical Analysis business had an excellent quarter. Q2 revenues were up 19% year-over-year as demand continued to improve in industrial and applied markets. All key end markets were up double digits year-over-year; petrochemical, plus 30%; food, plus 15%; and environment forensics, plus 27%. Operating margin was 24%. 
From a product perspective, our GC/MS, ICP-MS and mid-range GC platforms each grew in double digits. We also had solid double-digit growth in our Consumables and Services, up 21% and 11%, respectively. We expect future growth to be driven by continued focus on food safety, opportunities in emerging markets and expanding Consumables and Mass Spec portfolios.
Our Life Science business had a solid quarter with revenue up 12% over last year, up 15% if we exclude the High Court divestiture from last year's base. Operating margin was 14%. Excluding the High Court divestiture, we experienced modest growth in Pharma and Biotech at 4% year-over-year, academic and government revenues grew 11%, sales of LSG products and services into applied markets were up 25% from a year ago. 
From a product perspective, LCs were up 28% year-over-year with strong worldwide demand. 1290 LCs continued to exceed expectations. LC/MS was also strong, with increasing demand for Triple Quad and in Q-TOF instrumentation. We also saw a double-digit growth in Consumables in our new SureSelect sample product offerings. 
The biggest story this quarter was our Electronic Measurement business. As you recall from our March investor meeting in New York, Electronic Measurement was the wild card in the recovery with upside potential from our forecast. EMG's Q2 revenues including Network Services rebounded to almost $700 million, 18% growth year-over-year. General Purpose is up 31%, while Communications revenues were down 3% from a year ago. Q2 orders grew a spectacular 44%, operating margin was 14%. 
Our General Purpose markets continue to strengthen. Industrial Computer and Semiconductors posted their strongest results in recent history with revenues up 56% over last year. Performance is being led by an overall improved economy with strength in Electronics and Semiconductor businesses. Aerospace and Defense was down slightly, driven by softness in the U.S. market but we didn't note any significant change in trends or customer demand. We expect seasonal improvement in Q3.
The Communications market was mixed. We saw some sequential growth in Wireless R&D, although it’s down year-over-year. Wireless manufacture is improving with low double-digit growth over the last year and high double-digit growth over last quarter. Demand in Q2 is mainly driven by one-box testers and Smart phones. 
On May 1, we completed the divestiture of our Network Service businesses. From a product perspective, our core platforms continue to do well. Our PNA-X network analyzers and PXA signal analyzers continue to be well received by the market. High-performance oscilloscopes were strong in the Computer and Semiconductor market. We recently introduced an industry-leading 32GHz Infinium Scope. 
Moving forward, Agilent’s in excellent position to grow during the recovery. Our continued investment in R&D and our strong global presence are foundations for capturing market opportunities. You may have seen by a recent press release announcing the successful close of the Varian acquisition. Teams from both Varian and Agilent have been developing detailed integration plans for the past several months. We have already launched our initial customer communication. We have also developed a detailed operating handbook for our field in sales operations for conducting businesses post close. We continue to strongly believe we will be able to capture revenue synergies through the addition of the Varian product portfolio. 
Regarding the integration of infrastructure, our intent is to minimize disruptions over next several months to ensure both Agilent and Varian to focus on operations and customer commitments. Our strategy is to integrate Varian’s core systems and processes into Agilent's operating model. By the end of the calendar year, our plan is to integrate our legal entities, core quote to cash processes, services and support processes, sales and marketing processes, Web environment and begin the conversion of the factories to our ERP system. 
In addition, we have already established intercompany conductivity and began upgrading network bandwidth to ensure rapid communication and sharing of information. We remain very confident in achieving $75 million of cost synergy over the next 4 to 5 years. In addition, we will reach Agilent's effective tax rate by the end of 2011.
Agilent on a standalone in the third quarter of 2010, we expect revenues to grow in the range of 16% to 19% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.45 per share compared to last year's $0.15 per share. 
We're also raising our guidance for the full year. For FY 2010, we expect non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $1.70 to $1.75 per share, compared to last year's $0.80 per share. These numbers are exclusive of Varian acquisition. 
We expect Varian to add close to $370 million of additional revenue in the second half of fiscal 2010 starting from May 15. As we have discussed at the analyst meeting, Varian will add approximately $0.08 to earnings per share in the second half. 
Thank you for being on the call. And now I'll turn it over to Didier."

I will now provide some additional color on the second quarter results. First, Agilent overall, then the three segments, and will end my prepared remarks with a review of the third quarter and full year outlook. Please note that my explanations will be focused on the year-over-year variances and I will report the year-over-year top line growth percentages with and without the recent divestitures of Hycor and Network Systems. Also, I will provide guidance on the second half Varian incrementals.
Starting at the enterprise level. As Bill stated, we had a strong second quarter. Orders of $1.35 billion were up 31% from one year ago, 28% on a currency-adjusted basis. Regionally, Asia Pacific led all other regions with 35% growth, 30% on a currency-adjusted, followed by the Americas at 33% and Europe which was up 23%, 18% currency-adjusted. 
Revenues of $1.27 billion were up 16% from one year ago, 13% on a currency-adjusted basis, with all three segments up double digits. Excluding Hycor and Network Systems, revenues were 19%. 
On a geographic basis, Asia Pacific excluding Japan once again led the way with 26% growth, 24% currency-adjusted, while the Americas were up 13%, 11% currency-adjusted and Europe was up 10%, 6% currency-adjusted.
Moving on to the income statement. Second quarter operating profit of $201 million was $134 million above one year ago, $179 million increase in revenues, resulting in a 75% operating profit incremental. The key factors driving this performance were volume-related gross margin incrementals and restructuring savings, which were partly offset by the impact of the restoration of full pay and higher variable pay. Currency had minimal impact on the bottom line but did impact the various lines of the income statement.
Turning to the individual income statement line items. Second quarter gross margin at 56.9% were five points higher than last year and improved two point on the volume adjusted basis. And to note, 56.9% is a record high gross margin in Agilent's nearly 11 years’ history. 
Second quarter operating expenses increased $22 million. Excluding currency, year-over-year spending increased $7 million or 1%, the result of higher sales commissions and higher variable pay.
Operating profits of $201 million were up nearly 200% from last year. The company's second quarter operating margin was 15.8%, up nearly 10 points from one year ago and already higher than our mid-cycle target of 14%. 
Other income and expense was flat from last year. Our non-GAAP tax rate during the quarter was 20% compared to 21% one year ago. And pro forma net income of $152 million or $0.43 per share compares to $0.13 per share one year ago.
Turning to the cash flow and the balance sheet. We continue to demonstrate strong discipline in asset management. Inventory days on hand at 91 days were 16 days better than one year ago on $62 million lower inventories. Receivables days sales outstanding were unchanged from last year at 47 days. 
Given our high profits and strong asset management, total cash from operations for the quarter was $224 million, which represents an increase of $87 million from one year ago. During the quarter, we issued around 5 million shares for $121 million in relation to options exercises. We repurchased about 5.3 million shares or $165 million worth of shares. As you know, our board has approved last November an ongoing anti-dilutive share buyback program to maintain the outstanding share count at about 350 million shares. 
With regard to our net cash position, we finished the quarter with net cash of $1.4 billion, up $455 million from one year ago. 
Let me say a word on the $1.5 billion world trade debt, which matures in January. We have an option to extend the current deal in its entirety, but are considering several options to reduce the amount outstanding, or possibly pay it off entirely as early as January of 2011 but no later than January of 2012.
Finally, you will have noted that Moody's recently upgraded our credit rating to BAA 3. Now we have an investment grade rating at all three rating agencies, and we are committed to maintaining solid investment grade ratings in the future. 
Now turning to the segment financial results. Life Sciences' second quarter orders of $331 million were 15% above last year and up 11% on a currency-adjusted basis. Excluding the Hycor divestiture, segment orders improved 18% from last year. Life Sciences’ revenues of $334 million were up 12% or 8% in local currency terms and up 15% excluding Hycor. Geographically, the Americas were up 9%, Europe was up 4%, Japan was up 27% while the rest of Asia Pacific rose 25%. 
Second quarter operating income was $48 million, up 9% from one year ago. Gross margins held steady at 65% and operating margin at 14% was also flat from one year ago. Segment ROIC was 18%. 
Looking ahead to the rest of 2010, we expect that second half revenues for Life Sciences will be up roughly 14% to 16% from the second half of fiscal 2009 or 17% to 19% adjusting for divestitures.
Turning next to Chemical Analysis, orders of $231 million were up 19% from one year ago and up 14% in local currency terms. Revenues of $238 million were also 19% above last year and up 14% in constant dollars. 
Geographically, the Americas were up 10% from last year and Europe was up 8%. Japan jumped 46%, while the rest of Asia Pacific was up 28% from one year ago. 
Second quarter operating income of $57 million was $11 million above last year on a $38 million increase in revenues or 30% incremental operating profits. Gross margins improved one point at 54.5%, while operating margins improved one point to 24%. Segment ROIC increased eight points to 48%. Looking ahead, we expect Chemical Analysis' year-over-year revenue growth of 13% to 15% for the second half of our fiscal year.
Finally, turning to Electronic Measurement. Second quarter orders of $784 million were up 44% or up 42% in local currency terms. Excluding the Network Systems divestiture, segment orders increased 52% from last year. Revenues were up 18% from last year or 15% in local currency, and up 22% excluding the aforementioned divestitures. 
Geographically, revenues were up 16% in the Americas and 17% in Europe; Japan was up 9%, as the second quarter marked a return to growth after several down quarters. The rest of Asia Pacific was up 26% from last year, with broad-based growth across all countries. 
Electronic Measurements’ second quarter operating profit of $100 million was $122 million above one year ago on $105 million increase in revenues, clearly showing the cumulative benefits of the resizing of this business, with a year-over-year operating profit therefore incremental of 115%. 
Gross margin rose eight points to 59%. 59% is the highest quarterly gross margin achieved by EMG since the separation from HP more than 10 years ago. Operating margins improved by 18 points to 14%, segment ROIC rose 24 points to 20%. Looking ahead, we expect the market recovery in Electronic Measurement to continue and second half revenue to be up roughly 23% to 25% on an apples-to-apples basis, i.e. excluding the divestiture of the Network Systems business. On an unadjusted basis, the growth for the second half is expected to be in the range of 12% to 14%. 
Now turning to the outlook for Agilent overall. I will first give you the outlook for Agilent without Varian and then the forecast for the Varian incrementals. For Agilent standalone, we expect Q3 revenues to be about 16% to 19% above last year, or 22% to 25% adjusted for the Network Systems and Hycor divestitures. And we expect Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.45, about triple last year’s $0.15 Q3 earnings per share.
For the full year, for the full fiscal year, we are raising our guidance on both revenues and EPS. We now expect Agilent's standalone revenues to be up roughly 12%, or 15% adjusted for the Hycor and Network Systems divestitures. We project non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.70 to $1.75, which is up $0.05 from our previous guidance. 
Now to Varian. Even after the delayed close and the required divestitures, we still project that Varian will add approximately $0.08 to Agilent second half EPS on about $370 million of additional revenues, with roughly 70% of the revenues going to CAG and 30% to LSG. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Alicia for the Q&A."

The oscilloscopes that we introduced a couple of weeks ago are the world's highest performance oscilloscopes that deliver the world's highest bandwidth, the world's lowest noise, the world's lowest jitter. All these things that are very critical to the overall market and to end customers. Not only did we introduce those products, we have started shipment on those products to customers and that helps. The third piece is in cost reductions and we continue to have a focus on making sure we streamline our operations. So one, our discounts remain to be managed very well.

That is priority #1, is to leverage what is now going to be close to, if not the broadest product portfolio in the industry. In terms of the cost side, however, though, we are going to aggressively pursue the cost synergies we have. By far, the bulk of that is leveraging the purchasing power that we have as a combined entity. Moving forward, just a 5% cost leveraging on direct materials is $40 million. The teams have identified areas where we can share components across various product lines. We have plans in place to reduce or combine sales offices around the world, that’ll be another $15 million. So we have really done a very good job just today figuring out exactly what we need to do to be able to quickly get costs out of the system without disrupting the system.

In a few moments, Didier will provide you with an overview of our Q2 financial results. I will provide you with a summary of results, a market perspective and our outlook for the second half of the fiscal year. 
Agilent continues to capitalize on the global economic recovery. Q2 orders of $1.35 billion were up 31% year-over-year, while revenues of $1.27 billion were up 16% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings were $152 million or $0.43 per share.
Agilent's second quarter earnings combined with solid asset management enabled us to generate $224 million of operating cash flow. We ended the quarter with net cash of $1.4 billion. 
All regions grew by double digits year-over-year, led by a 24% increase in Asia-Pacific. Growth rates in China have moderated from their record highs but remain in double digits. Overall, Agilent's large and established presence in Asia will continue to serve as a strong competitive differentiator. 41% of Agilent's business resides in Asia, a record high percent. 
Europe grew 10% year-over-year while the Americas were up 13% from year ago. From a market perspective, we saw year-over-year revenue growth in most of our key markets that we serve. 
Our Chemical Analysis business had an excellent quarter. Q2 revenues were up 19% year-over-year as demand continued to improve in industrial and applied markets. All key end markets were up double digits year-over-year: petrochemical, plus 30%; food, plus 15%; and environment forensics, plus 27%. Operating margin was 24%. 
From a product perspective, our GC/MS, ICP-MS and mid-range GC platforms each grew in double digits. We also had solid double-digit growth in our Consumables and Services, up 21% and 11%, respectively. We expect future growth to be driven by continued focus on food safety, opportunities in emerging markets and expanding Consumables and Mass Spec portfolios.
Our Life Science business had a solid quarter with revenue up 12% over last year, up 15% if we exclude the High Court divestiture from last year's base. Operating margin was 14%. Excluding the High Court divestiture, we experienced modest growth in Pharma and Biotech of 4% year-over-year, academic and government revenues grew 11%, sales of LSG products and services into applied markets were up 25% from a year ago. 
From a product perspective, LCs were up 28% year-over-year with strong worldwide demand. 1290 LCs continued to exceed expectations. LC/MS was also strong, with increasing demand for Triple Quad and in Q-TOF instrumentation. We also saw a double-digit growth in Consumables in our new SureSelect sample product offerings. 
The biggest story this quarter was in our Electronic Measurement business. As you recall from our March investor meeting in New York, Electronic Measurement was the wild card in the recovery with upside potential from our forecast. EMG's Q2 revenues including Network Services rebounded to almost $700 million, 18% growth year-over-year. General Purpose is up 31%, while Communications revenues were down 3% from year ago. Q2 orders grew a spectacular 44%. Operating margin was 14%. 
Our General Purpose markets continue to strengthen. Industrial, Computer and Semiconductors posted their strongest results in recent history with revenues up 56% over last year. Performance is being led by an overall improving economy with strength in Electronics and Semiconductor businesses. Aerospace and Defense was down slightly, driven by softness in the U.S. markets, but we didn't note any significant change in trends or customer demand. We expect seasonal improvement in Q3.
The Communications market was mixed. We saw some sequential growth in Wireless R&D, although it was down year-over-year. Wireless manufacturing is improving with low-double-digit growth over the last year and high-double-digit growth over last quarter. Demand in Q2 was mainly driven by one-box testers and Smart phones. 
On May 1, we completed the divestiture of our Network Service businesses. From a product perspective, our core platforms continue to do well. Our PNA-X network analyzers and PXA signal analyzers continue to be well received by the market. High-performance oscilloscopes were strong in the Computer and Semiconductor markets. We recently introduced an industry-leading 32GHz Infinium scope. 
Moving forward, Agilent is in excellent position to grow during the recovery. Our continued investment in R&D and our strong global presence are foundations for capturing market opportunities. You may have seen by a recent press release announcing the successful close of the Varian acquisition. Teams from both Varian and Agilent have been developing detailed integration plans for the past several months. We have already launched our initial customer communication. We have also developed a detailed operating handbook for our field in sales operations for conducting businesses post close. We continue to strongly believe we will be able to capture revenue synergies through the addition of the Varian product portfolio. 
Regarding the integration of infrastructure, our intent is to minimize disruptions over next several months to ensure both Agilent and Varian to focus on operations and customer commitments. Our strategy is to integrate Varian’s core systems and processes into Agilent's operating model. By the end of the calendar year, our plan is to integrate our legal entities, core quote to cash processes, services and support processes, sales and marketing processes, Web environment and begin the conversion of the factories to our ERP system. 
In addition, we have already established intercompany conductivity and began upgrading network bandwidth to ensure rapid communication and sharing of information. We remain very confident in achieving $75 million of cost synergy over the next 4 to 5 years. In addition, we will reach Agilent's effective tax rate by the end of 2011.
Agilent on a standalone in the third quarter of 2010, we expect revenues to grow in the range of 16% to 19% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.45 per share compared to last year's $0.15 per share. 
We're also raising our guidance for the full year. For FY 2010, we expect non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $1.70 to $1.75 per share, compared to last year's $0.80 per share. These numbers are exclusive of Varian acquisition. 
We expect Varian to add close to $370 million of additional revenue in the second half of fiscal 2010 starting from May 15. As we have discussed at the analyst meeting, Varian will add approximately $0.08 to earnings per share in the second half. 
Thank you for being on the call. And now I'll turn it over to Didier."
154924,104775673,64167,"Agilent Technologies Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, May 17, 2010",2010-05-17,"Earnings Calls","Agilent Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. I will now provide some additional color on the second quarter results.

I will now provide some additional color on the second quarter results. First, Agilent overall, then the three segments, and will end my prepared remarks with a review of the third quarter and full year outlook. Please note that my explanations will be focused on the year-over-year variances and I will report the year-over-year top line growth percentages with and without the recent divestitures of Hycor and Network Systems. Also, I will provide guidance on the second half Varian incrementals.
Starting at the enterprise level. As Bill stated, we had a strong second quarter. Orders of $1.35 billion were up 31% from one year ago, 28% on a currency-adjusted basis. Regionally, Asia-Pacific led all other regions with 35% growth, 30% on a currency-adjusted, followed by the Americas at 33% and Europe which was up 23%, 18% currency-adjusted. 
Revenues of $1.27 billion were up 16% from one year ago, 13% on a currency-adjusted basis, with all three segments up double digits. Excluding Hycor and Network Systems, revenues were 19%. 
On a geographic basis, Asia-Pacific excluding Japan once again led the way with 26% growth, 24% currency-adjusted, while the Americas were up 13%, 11% currency-adjusted and Europe was up 10%, 6% currency-adjusted.
Moving on to the income statement. Second quarter operating profit of $201 million was $134 million above one year ago, $179 million increase in revenues, resulting in a 75% operating profit incremental. The key factors driving this performance were volume-related gross margin incrementals and restructuring savings, which were partly offset by the impact of the restoration of full pay and higher variable pay. Currency had minimal impact on the bottom line but did impact the various lines of the income statement.
Turning to the individual income statement line items. Second quarter gross margin at 56.9% were five points higher than last year and improved two point on the volume adjusted basis. And to note, 56.9% is a record high gross margin in Agilent's nearly 11 years’ history. 
Second quarter operating expenses increased $22 million. Excluding currency, year-over-year spending increased $7 million or 1%, the result of higher sales commissions and higher variable pay.
Operating profits of $201 million were up nearly 200% from last year. The company's second quarter operating margin was 15.8%, up nearly 10 points from one year ago and already higher than our mid-cycle target of 14%. 
Other income and expense was flat from last year. Our non-GAAP tax rate during the quarter was 20% compared to 21% one year ago. And pro forma net income of $152 million or $0.43 per share compares to $0.13 per share one year ago.
Turning to the cash flow and the balance sheet. We continue to demonstrate strong discipline in asset management. Inventory days on hand at 91 days were 16 days better than one year ago on $62 million lower inventories. Receivables days sales outstanding were unchanged from last year at 47 days. 
Given our high profits and strong asset management, total cash from operations for the quarter was $224 million, which represents an increase of $87 million from one year ago. During the quarter, we issued around 5 million shares for $121 million in relation to options exercises. We repurchased about 5.3 million shares or $165 million worth of shares. As you know, our board has approved last November an ongoing anti-dilutive share buyback program to maintain the outstanding share count at about 350 million shares. 
With regard to our net cash position, we finished the quarter with net cash of $1.4 billion, up $455 million from one year ago. 
Let me say a word on the $1.5 billion world trade debt, which matures in January. We have an option to extend the current deal in its entirety, but are considering several options to reduce the amount outstanding, or possibly pay it off entirely as early as January of 2011 but no later than January of 2012.
Finally, you will have noted that Moody's recently upgraded our credit rating to BAA 3. Now we have an investment grade rating at all three rating agencies, and we are committed to maintaining solid investment grade ratings in the future. 
Now turning to the segment financial results. Life Sciences' second quarter orders of $331 million were 15% above last year and up 11% on a currency-adjusted basis. Excluding the Hycor divestiture, segment orders improved 18% from last year. Life Sciences’ revenues of $334 million were up 12% or 8% in local currency terms and up 15% excluding Hycor. Geographically, the Americas were up 9%, Europe was up 4%, Japan was up 27% while the rest of Asia-Pacific rose 25%. 
Second quarter operating income was $48 million, up 9% from one year ago. Gross margins held steady at 65% and operating margin at 14% was also flat from one year ago. Segment ROIC was 18%. 
Looking ahead to the rest of 2010, we expect that second half revenues for Life Sciences will be up roughly 14% to 16% from the second half of fiscal 2009 or 17% to 19% adjusting for divestitures.
Turning next to Chemical Analysis, orders of $231 million were up 19% from one year ago and up 14% in local currency terms. Revenues of $238 million were also 19% above last year and up 14% in constant dollars. 
Geographically, the Americas were up 10% from last year and Europe was up 8%. Japan jumped 46%, while the rest of Asia-Pacific was up 28% from one year ago. 
Second quarter operating income of $57 million was $11 million above last year on a $38 million increase in revenues or 30% incremental operating profits. Gross margins improved one point at 54.5%, while operating margins improved one point to 24%. Segment ROIC increased eight points to 48%. Looking ahead, we expect Chemical Analysis year-over-year revenue growth of 13% to 15% for the second half of our fiscal year.
Finally, turning to Electronic Measurement. Second quarter orders of $784 million were up 44% or up 42% in local currency terms. Excluding the Network Systems divestiture, segment orders increased 52% from last year. Revenues were up 18% from last year or 15% in local currency and up 22% excluding the aforementioned divestitures. 
Geographically, revenues were up 16% in the Americas and 17% in Europe. Japan was up 9%, as the second quarter marked a return to growth after several down quarters. The rest of Asia-Pacific was up 26% from last year, with broad-based growth across all countries. 
Electronic Measurements second quarter operating profit of $100 million was $122 million above one year ago on $105 million increase in revenues, clearly showing the cumulative benefits of the resizing of this business, with a year-over-year operating profit, therefore, incremental of 115%.
Gross margins rose eight points to 59%. 59% is the highest quarterly gross margin achieved by EMG since the separation from HP more than 10 years ago. Operating margins improved by 18 points to 14%. Segment ROIC rose 24 points to 20%. Looking ahead, we expect the market recovery in Electronic Measurement to continue and second half revenue to be up roughly 23% to 25% on an apples-to-apples basis, i.e., excluding the divestiture of the Network Systems business. On an unadjusted basis, the growth for the second half is expected to be in the range of 12% to 14%. 
Now turning to the outlook for Agilent overall. I will first give you the outlook for Agilent without Varian and then the forecast for the Varian incrementals. For Agilent standalone, we expect Q3 revenues to be about 16% to 19% above last year or 22% to 25% adjusted for the Network Systems and Hycor divestitures. And we expect Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.45, about triple last year’s $0.15 Q3 earnings per share.
For the full year, for the full fiscal year, we are raising our guidance on both revenues and EPS. We now expect Agilent's standalone revenues to be up roughly 12% or 15% adjusted for the Hycor and Network Systems divestitures. We project non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.70 to $1.75, which is up $0.05 from our previous guidance. 
Now to Varian. Even after the delayed close and the required divestitures, we still project that Varian will add approximately $0.08 to Agilent's second half EPS on about $370 million of additional revenues, with roughly 70% of the revenues going to CAG and 30% to LSG. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Alicia for the Q&A."

The oscilloscopes that we introduced a couple of weeks ago are the world's highest performance oscilloscopes that deliver the world's highest bandwidth, the world's lowest noise, the world's lowest jitter. All these things that are very critical to the overall market and to end customers. Not only did we introduce those products, we have started shipment on those products to customers and that helps. The third piece is in cost reductions and we continue to have a focus on making sure we streamline our operations. So one, our discounts remain to be managed very well.

In terms of the cost side, however, though, we are going to aggressively pursue the cost synergies we have. By far, the bulk of that is leveraging the purchasing power that we have as a combined entity. Moving forward, just a 5% cost leveraging on direct materials is $40 million. The teams have identified areas where we can share components across various product lines. We have plans in place to reduce or combine sales offices around the world, that’ll be another $15 million. So we have really done a very good job just today figuring out exactly what we need to do to be able to quickly get costs out of the system without disrupting the system.

A lot of the story particularly in the products that are moving, research products that are moving, in the Life Sciences Group is one of coverage. The Varian team has done a great job in the academic markets, in some of the niches, but they have not been as strong in some of the pharma markets. That's an area where we understand the customers, perhaps not the technology. So blending those two cultures and those two teams will be a great coverage opportunity. And I've been working quite a bit with the Varian people, we’re trying to communicate very clearly to the market that we have confidence in this Research Products group. Imaging is an area that we think we can bring leadership to, and we're trying to communicate with the customer base that any hesitation they’ve had on orders in regard to our performance should go away, that we intend to invest to bring these technologies to product leadership. And that I think will drive the orders line and subsequently the revenue. We all know that there's a long manufacturing lead in these product categories. We will work on that as well. But the first place you'll see it is orders and we'll try to give you visibility there."

As we go through recovery, we have fully restored pay and we did that on November 1. And secondly, as Didier had outlined, the variable pay that we saved is going to come back rapidly. It is all self-consistent with the Agilent variable pay system, which is targeted at 10% at a 21% return on invested capital. It will be the pay for the results for the management team as the recovery happens. And also, with the order rate coming in so much higher than revenue, our sales compensation is higher than what you would expect. One thing that we have done though that will moderate the second half variable spending is that we have reset the results for the management team in the second half of the year. Obviously, the pay in the first half of the year is well over target. It's always hard to predict the future when you're going through a downturn. And so as a result of that we are resetting the bar for the leadership team starting with myself in the second half, which will take away some of the upward pressure that we're seeing in the variable spending as the recovery comes about."

Q3 orders of $1.5 billion were up 39% year-over-year, while revenues of $1.4 billion were up 32% from a year ago. Note that these numbers include the results of the Varian acquisition. Without the Varian acquisition and our divestitures, orders and revenue were up 30% and 24% respectively.
In addition to the top line growth, we continued to improve gross margins, and our expenses were well controlled. Q3 non-GAAP earnings were $191 million or $0.54 per share. Agilent’s third quarter revenue growth was strong across all regions. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, the Americas were up 25% year-over-year, Europe 18%, and Asia Pacific up 28%.
The Varian integration continues to go very well. We have successfully integrated Varian’s field service and support functions into the existing Agilent structure. We have established three new product divisions dedicated to spectroscopy, research products and backing technologies, and we have consolidated Varian’s consumables with our own consumable business.
Varian’s businesses were solidly profitable in Q3. Moving forward, we are highly confident we will achieve our goal of $75 million in net savings. This is inclusive of $10 million of additional R&D that we are investing in Varian’s technologies as well as our increased investment in service and support.
From a market perspective, our third quarter results saw continued strength in most of our key markets that we serve. In our Chemical Analysis business, the applied market recovery continues. Q3 revenues of $329 million were up 62% over last year, up 30% excluding Varian. Operating margin was 21%. Excluding the Varian acquisition, we saw double-digit year-over-year growth in petrochemical, environmental and forensic markets.
From a product perspective, all product lines posted double-digit order growth over a year ago. Our high end mass spec business was especially strong with the ICP-MS, GC/MS, and Agilent’s new GC Triple Quad driving growth in food and environmental applications. And our new vacuum products are performing well in response to the improving global economy. We expect future growth to be driven by continued focus on food safety, expanding consumables and mass spec portfolios, and a continued successful integration of Varian.
In Life Science businesses, revenues of $374 million were up 28% over last year. Adjusting for Varian and the Hycor divestiture, Life Science revenues were up 15%. Operating margin was 15%. Strength from emerging markets was offset by softness in big pharma consolidation. Excluding divestitures and the Varian acquisition, academic and government revenues grew 21% over last year. We saw a more modest 6% increase in pharma, biotech, CRO and CMO. Sales of LSG products and services into applied markets were up 20% from a year ago.
From a product perspective, sales of Life Science platforms into food, environmental and other applied markets remain very strong, particularly for the LC and LCMS instruments. LC sales were up 25% year-over-year. The 1290 LC continues to exceed expectations and we introduce the new 1220 and mid-range 1260 LCs. Our SureSelect sample prep product offerings also continued to beat expectations.
Electronic Measurement revenues of $692 million were up 24% from a year ago. Excluding the Network Solutions divestiture, revenues grew 34%. Operating margin of 18% is at the highest level since the early 2000s. We saw strength across all markets and regions. Asia Pacific revenue is up 32%, Europe was up 18%, and the Americas were up 18% year-over-year.
In industrial markets, we saw broad and consistent growth across multiple industries, driven by the economic recovery and growth in China. Aerospace and defense improved with spending in the United States and Asia fueling a 24% growth year-over-year. Communication demand improved with increased spending for new technologies, including LTE and smartphones and for 3G expansion in Asia.
From a market perspective, our network analyzers and oscilloscopes, especially high end scopes, were strong in all markets. Network analyzer revenue grew 58% from a year ago, while scopes were up 45%. Moving forward, while the economy remains uncertain, we continue to see numerous market opportunities. And we believe Agilent is at a strong position to capitalize on them. There are four major areas where we differentiate ourselves.
The first is our market reach and customer trust. We are number one in customer loyalty in every major product category in our industries, as measured by external benchmarks. With our field team now consisting of more than 6,000 sales and marketing people, we will continue to invest in customer service and support.
Second is our technology leadership. We currently have the leading technology in every one of our core platforms; oscilloscopes, signal and spectrum analyzers, network analyzers, gas and liquid chromatography, and mass specs. We are committed to drive to the number one position in spectroscopy in NMR. And as we’ve noted, we are increasing our R&D investment in these areas. We also continue to invest in Life Science workflow solutions and adjacent market opportunities, including nanotechnology and surveillance.
Third is our scale and scope. Agilent’s ability to scale and leverage its manufacturing capability has resulted in the leadership position in the industry. We have 6,100 manufacturing employees in every major con, and with a proven track record, delivering new products to the market and dramatically driving down manufacturing costs. As a result, Agilent today has the lowest instrument cost of sales in the industry while maintaining a reputation of high quality and reliability.
Fourth is our team. We have completed our transformation and we have managed successfully through the recession. Agilent’s leaders and employees are able to focus externally on our customers and our market opportunity. As a result, we are in a strong position moving into Q4 and FY ’11. We are raising our fourth quarter and full year guidance.
For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect revenues of $1.52 billion, inclusive of Varian. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.58 to $0.59 per share. For the full fiscal year 2010, we expect revenues of $5.4 billion and a non-GAAP earnings of $1.94 to $1.95 per share.
Thank you for being on the call. Now I’ll turn it over to Didier.

And good afternoon, everyone. I will start by providing additional color on the third quarter results and the fourth quarter outlook.

I will start by providing additional color on the third quarter results and the fourth quarter outlook. And I’ll give an update on the Varian integration and a perspective on potential scenarios in fiscal year ’11. My comments on the results will focus on the year-over-year comparisons, and I will report year-over-year top-line growth percentages, both with and without the Hycor and Network Solutions divestitures and the Varian acquisition. Or in other words, the organic and inorganic view of order and revenue growth.
Starting with Q3 results, as Bill stated, Agilent delivered strong third quarter results. Those results show that we are delivering on our commitment to exit the recession in a much stronger position than when the downturn began. During the downturn, we maintained our large investment in R&D and expanded our channel and reach. We also restructured EMG. We believe we have strengthened an operating model that is a significant competitive advantage in the short and long-term.
Orders of $1.5 billion were up 39% from one year ago, both in the dollars and local currency. On an organic basis, orders grew 30%, with Asia Pacific up 51%, the Americas up 20%, and Europe up 14%. Revenues of $1.4 billion were up 32% in dollars and local currency from one year ago, or 24% on an organic basis. All three business segments generated double-digit revenue growth, both in total and organically.
Geographic revenues on an organic basis were up 28% in Asia Pacific, up 25% in the Americas, and grew 18% in Europe. Organic revenue growth in China and India were very solid at 24% and 43% respectively.
Now moving to the income statement, third quarter non-GAAP operating profit of $251 million was $170 million above one year ago on the $338 million increase in revenue, yielding a 50% operating incremental. Excluding Varian, our year-over-year operating margin incremental was 83%, with all three segments delivering excellent incremental.
The key factors driving this outstanding year-over-year performance were volume-related gross margin incrementals and restructuring savings. These were partly offset by the impact of the restoration of full pay and higher variable and incentives. Currency had minimal impact on any of the income statement line item.
Now turning to the individual income statement line items, third quarter gross margin of 56% were 2.8 points higher than last year. Excluding Varian, gross margins reached an all-time high and improved by 4.2 points over last year or about 2 points on a volume adjusted basis. Third quarter operating expenses increased $49 million, mostly due to the impact of the Varian acquisition. Wage restoration and higher variable and incentive pay were offset by restructuring savings.
Operating profits of $251 million were up more than 200% from last year. The company's third quarter operating margin was 18%, and increase of 10 points from one year ago and well above our mid-cycle target of 14%. Net other income and expense declined $5 million from last year, mostly due to higher interest expenses.
Moving to taxes, we are reducing our fiscal year 2010 non-GAAP tax rate from 20% to 19%, which results in a 17.5% tax rate for Q3 and additional $0.01 per share. Non-GAAP net income of $191 million or $0.54 per share compares to $53 million or $0.15 per share one year ago.
Turning to the cash flow and the balance sheet, we continued to show outstanding discipline in asset management. Inventory days on hand of 97 days were nine days better than one year ago on $117 million in higher inventories, an increase largely due to the Varian acquisition. Receivables days sales outstanding increased four days from one year ago to 50, again primarily due to the Varian acquisition.
Total cash from operations was $90million, an increase of $49 million from one year ago. During the quarter, we raised $40 million from employee stock programs and repurchased $94 million worth of shares. Year-to-date we’ve raised $264 million and repurchased $359 million. As you know, we intend to maintain our basic outstanding share count at about 346 million shares, while the diluted share count will remain north of 350 million shares depending on the stock price. With regard to net cash, we finished the quarter with net cash of $267 million.
Now let me say a word on the $1.5 billion world trade debt maturing in January. As you know, we had a very successful debt offering on July 13 and raised $750 million. We intend to pay off the world trade debt in its entirety when it matures in January 2011 using the proceeds of the debt offering and cash from our balance sheet. We would incur an additional $5 million in interest expense in Q4 2010 and Q1 2011, but starting in Q2 2011, we will save $7 million per quarter after we delever.
Now, onto the Varian integration, as Bill stated, we are making excellent progress in integrating Varian and capitalizing on the revenue and cost synergies that we expected. With our expanded portfolio and capabilities, we have started capturing market opportunities. We also remain committed to the $75 million in cost synergies that we previously committed, even net of incremental investments in R&D, service and support. On November 1, we will combine all the Varian and Agilent legal entities. In short, we are pleased to confirm that our integration, revenue and cost synergy plans are on track.
Now turning to the 2010 outlook, we expect Agilent Q4 revenues to be about $1.52 billion, 30% above last year or a 21% growth on an organic basis. Q4 revenues of $1.52 billion would represent an approximate increase of $120 million over Q3 revenues. On an earnings per share basis, we expect the sequential increase of $0.04 to $0.05 above Q3 level of $0.54, leading to an expected Q4 EPS of $0.58 to $0.59.
Now, this would represent a somewhat lower sequential incremental than normal for the following four reasons. First, about $35 million of the sequential revenue increases from Varian products and services has legal incremental as the corresponding increase in gross margin is offset by increased Varian expenses, which in Q4 reflect an additional two weeks of expenses over Q3.
Second, Q4 earnings per share do not have the $0.01 benefit of the tax true-up that we saw in Q2. Third, Q4 earnings per share reflect the negative carry of the new $750 million debt was about $0.01. And fourth, Q4 earnings per share include end-of-semester variable and incentive pay increases of about $0.02 on the back of the semester’s projected outstanding results. You would also note that we have added the 3,100-plus ex-Varian employees to the program.
On a full year basis, we now expect revenues of roughly $5.4 billion in fiscal year ’10, an increase of 20% over last year or 18% growth on an organic basis; and EPS of $1.94 to $1.95. The new EPS guidance represents an increase of $0.14 over the midpoint of the previous guidance of $1.78 to $1.83 and reflects our commitment to strong incrementals, as we continue to deliver on our operating model.
Now moving to fiscal year ’11 scenarios, we are currently finalizing our three-year strategic plans for review with the Board, as we do every year in September. As part of this exercise, we model various economic scenarios and identify triggers and actions that would need to take under different conditions as we have productively done in the past.
As Alicia mentioned, an investor presentation is posted on our website. It includes two scenarios that it compares the current range of First Call analyst estimates of fiscal year 2011. Under one scenario, our fiscal year ’11 revenues of $6.2 billion, a 15% year-over-year increase or 9% organic growth, which in turn would drive an EPS of $2.50. Under the second scenario, fiscal year ’11 revenues would reach $5.9 billion. This is a 10% year-over-year increase or 4% growth on an organic basis, which yields an EPS of $2.15. As Bill stated, we will provide guidance for fiscal year ’11 in November.
With that, I’ll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A.

Offsetting that, we continue to see the investment in LTE. We continue to do exceedingly well in LTE. R&D, we continue to do well. With the expansion in smartphones, we continue to do very, very well in aerospace and defense. And we do very well across a very broad industrial base.

And that’s why you see great growth in product lines such as oscilloscope. So oscilloscope order growth restated the revenue growth of 45%, but oscilloscope order growth was over 50%. And that’s because of the great high performance products that were introduced in April, but also because of the lower end scopes that are sold through distribution. So the distribution strategy is working exceptionally well. We have doubled the percentage of business - of our business that goes through distribution, and we plan to continue to go much, much further with that, as we continue to execute our strategy.

Note that these numbers inclu",1049,"Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Agilent's latest results are a strong indicator of our continued momentum. Q3 orders of $1.5 billion were up 39% year-over-year, while revenues of $1.4 billion were up 32% from a year ago. Note that these numbers include the results of the Varian acquisition. Without the Varian acquisition, our divestitures, orders and revenue were up 30% and 24%, respectively. 
In addition to the top line growth, we continue to improve gross margins, and our expenses were well controlled. Q3 non-GAAP earnings were $191 million or $0.54 per share. Agilent's third quarter revenue growth was strong across all regions. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, the Americas were up 25% year-over-year, Europe 18% and Asia Pacific, up 28%. 
The Varian integration continues to go very well. We have successfully integrated Varian's field service and support functions into the existing Agilent structure. We have established three new product divisions dedicated to spectroscopy, Research Products and vacuum technologies, and we have consolidated Varian's consumables with our own Consumable business. Varian's businesses were solidly profitable in Q3. 
Moving forward, we are highly confident we will achieve our goal of a $75 million in net savings. This is inclusive of $10 million of additional R&D that we're investing in Varian's technologies as well as our increased investments in service and support. From a market perspective, our third quarter results saw a continued strength in most of our key markets that we serve. 
In our Chemical Analysis business, the applied market recovery continues. Q3 revenues of $329 million were up 62% over last year, up 13% excluding Varian. Operating margin was 21%. Excluding the Varian acquisition, we saw a double-digit, year-over-year growth in petrochemical, environmental and forensic markets. 
From a product perspective, all product lines posted double-digit order growth over a year ago. Our high-end Mass Spec business was especially strong with ICP-MS [inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry], GC/MS [Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry] and Agilent's new GC-QQQ, driving growth in food and environmental applications. And our new vacuum products are performing well in response to the improving global economy. We expect future growth to be driven by continued focus on food safety, expanding consumables and Mass Spec portfolios and the continued successful integration of Varian. 
In our Life Science businesses, revenues of $374 million were up 28% over last year. Adjusting for Varian in the high core divestiture, Life Science revenues were up 15%. Operating margin was 15%. Strength from emerging markets was offset by softness in big Pharma consolidation. 
Excluding divestitures in the Varian acquisition, academic and government revenues grew 21% over last year. We saw a more modest 6% increase in Pharma/Biotech, CRO [contract research organization] and CMO [contract manufacturing organization]. Sales of LSG [Life Sciences Group] products and services into applied markets were up 20% from a year ago. 
From a product perspective, sales of Life Science platforms into food, environmental and other applied markets remain very strong, particularly for the L/C [Liquid Chromatography] and LC/MS [Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry] instruments. L/C sales were up 25% year-over-year. The 1290 L/C continues to exceed expectations, and we introduced the new 1220 and mid-range 1260 L/Cs. Our sure-select sample prep product offerings also continue to beat expectations. 
Electronic Measurement. Revenues of $692 million were up 24% from a year ago. Excluding the network solutions divestitures, revenues grew 34%. Operating margin of 18% is at the highest level since the early 2000s. We saw strength across all markets and regions. Asia Pacific revenue is up 32%, Europe was up 18% and the Americas were up 18% year-over-year. 
In industrial markets, we saw a broad and consistent growth across multiple industries, driven by the economic recovery and growth in China. Aerospace and defense improved with spending in the United States and Asia fueling its 24% growth year-over-year. Communications demand improved with increased spending for new technologies, including LTE [Long Term Evolution] and smartphones and for 3G expansion in Asia. 
From a market perspective, our network analyzers and oscilloscopes, especially high-end scopes, were strong in all markets. Network analyzer revenue grew 58% from year ago, while scopes were up 45%. 
Moving forward, while the economy remains uncertain, we continue to see numerous market opportunities, and we believe Agilent is in a strong position to capitalize on them. There are four major areas where we differentiate ourselves. 
The first is our market reach and customer trust. We are #1 in customer loyalty in every major product category in our industry as measured by external benchmarks. With our field team now consisting of more than 6,000 sales and marketing people, we will continue to invest in customer service and support. 
Second is our technology leadership. We currently have the leading technology in every one of our core platforms: oscilloscopes, signal and spectrum analyzers, network analyzers, gas and liquid chromatography and Mass Spec. We are committed to drive to the #1 position in spectroscopy and NMR [nuclear magnetic resonance]. And as we've noted, we are increasing our R&D investment in these areas. We also continue to invest in Life Science workflow solutions and adjacent market opportunities, including nanotechnology and surveillance. 
Third is our scale and scope. Agilent's ability to scale and leverage its manufacturing capability has resulted in the leadership position in the industry. We have 6,100 manufacturing employees in every major continent with a proven track record of delivering new products to the market and dramatically driving down manufacturing cost. As a result, Agilent today has the lowest instrument cost of sales in the industry, while maintaining a reputation of high quality and reliability. 
Fourth is our team. We have completed our transformation, and we have managed successfully through the recession. Agilent's leaders and employees are able to focus externally on our customers and our market opportunity. As a result, we are in a strong position moving into Q4 and FY '11. 
We are raising our fourth quarter and full year guidance. For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect revenues of $1.52 billion, inclusive of Varian. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.58 to $0.59 per share. For the full fiscal year 2010, we expect revenues of $5.4 billion and a non-GAAP earnings of $1.94 to $1.95 per share. 
Thank you for being on the call. And now, I'll turn it over to Didier."

I will start by providing additional color on the third quarter results and the fourth quarter outlook. Then, I will give an update on the Varian integration and a perspective on potential scenarios in fiscal year '11. 
My comments on the results will focus on the year-over-year comparisons, and I will report year-over-year top line growth percentages, both with and without the high core network solution divestitures and the Varian acquisition, in other words, the organic and inorganic view of order and revenue growth.
Starting with Q3 results, as Bill stated, Agilent delivered strong third quarter results. Those results show that we're delivering on our commitment to exit the recession in a much stronger position than when the downturn began. 
During the downturn, we maintained our large investment in R&D and expanded our channel and reach. We also restructured EMG [Electronics Measurement Group]. We believe we have strengthened an operating model that is a significant competitive advantage in the short and long term. 
Orders of $1.5 billion were up 39% from one year ago, both in dollars and local currency. On an organic basis, orders grew 30%, with Asia Pacific up 51%, the Americas up 20% and Europe up 14%. 
Revenue was up $1.4 billion or up 32% in dollars and local currency from one year ago or 24% in an organic basis. Both three business segments generated double-digit revenue growth, both in total and organically. 
Domestic revenues on an organic basis were up 28% in Asia Pacific, up 25% in the Americas and grew 18% in Europe. Organic revenue growth in China and India were very solid at 24% and 43%, respectively. 
Now moving to the income statement. Third quarter non-GAAP operating profit of $251 million was $170 million above one year ago on a $338 million increase in revenue, yielding a 50% operating margin incremental. Excluding Varian, our year-over-year operating margin incremental was 83%, with all three segments delivering excellent incrementals. 
The key factors driving these outstanding year-over-year performance were volume-related gross margin incrementals and restructuring savings. These were partly offset by the impact of the restoration of full pay and higher variable and incentives. Currency had minimal impact on any of the income statement line item.
Now turning to the individual income statement line items. Third quarter gross margins of 56% were 2.8 points higher than last year. Excluding Varian, gross margins reached an all-time high and improved by 4.2 points over last year or about two points on a volume-adjusted basis. 
Third quarter operating expenses increased $49 million mostly due to the impact of the Varian acquisition. Wage restoration and higher variable and incentive pay were offset by restructuring pay. 
Operating profits of $251 million were up more than 200% from last year. The company's third quarter operating margin was 18%, an increase of 10 points from one year ago and well above our mid-cycle target of 14%. Net other income and expense declined $5 million from last year, mostly due to higher interest expenses. 
Moving to taxes, we are reducing our fiscal year 2010 non-GAAP tax rate from 20% to 19%, which results in a 17.5% tax rate for Q3 and one additional cent per share. Non-GAAP net income of $191 million or $0.54 per share compares to $53 million or $0.15 per share one year ago.
Turning to the cash flow and the balance sheet, we continue to show outstanding discipline in asset management. Inventory days on hand of 97 days were nine days better than one year ago on $117 million in higher inventories and increased largely due to the Varian acquisition. Receivables days sales outstanding increased four days from one year ago to 50, again primarily due to the Varian acquisition. Total cash from operations was $90 million, an increase of $49 million from one year ago. 
During the quarter, we raised $40 million from employee stock programs and repurchased $94 million worth of shares. Year-to-date, we've raised $264 million and repurchased $359 million. As you know, we intend to maintain our basic outstanding share count at about 346 million shares, while the diluted share count will remain north of 350 million shares depending on the stock volume. With regard to net cash, we finished the quarter with net cash of $267 million. 
Now let me say a word on the $1.5 billion World Trade debt maturing in January. As you know, we had a very successful debt offering on July 13 and raised $750 million. We intend to pay off the World Trade debt in its entirety when it matures in January 2011, using the proceeds of the debt offering and cash from our balance sheet. We will incur an additional $5 million in interest expense in Q4 2010 and Q1 2011. But starting in Q2 2011, we will save $7 million per quarter after we delever.
Now onto the Varian integration. As Bill stated, we are making excellent progress in integrating Varian and capitalizing on the revenue and cost synergies that we expected. With our expanded portfolio and capabilities, we have started capturing market opportunities. 
We also remain committed to the $75 million in first synergies that we previously communicated even net of incremental investments in R&D, service and support. On November 1, we will combine all the Varian and Agilent legal entities. In short, we are pleased to confirm that our integration, revenue and cost synergy plans are on track. 
Now turning to the fiscal year '10 outlook, we expect Agilent Q4 revenues to be about $1.52 billion, 30% above last year or a 21% growth on an organic basis. Q4 revenues of $1.52 billion would represent an approximate increase of $120 million over Q3 revenue. 
On an earnings-per-share basis, we expect a sequential increase of $0.04 to $0.05 above Q3 level of $0.54, leading to an expected Q4 EPS of $0.58 to $0.59. Now these would represent a somewhat lower sequential in incremental than normal for the following four reasons. 
First, about $35 million of the sequential revenue increases for Varian products and services as legal incremental as the corresponding increase in gross margin is offset by increased Varian expenses, which in Q4, reflect an additional two weeks of expenses over Q3. Second, Q4 earnings per share do not have the $0.01 benefit of the tax true-up that we saw in Q3. Third, Q4 earnings per share reflect the negative carry of the new $750 million debt worth about $0.01. And fourth, Q4 earnings per share include end-of-semester variable and incentive pay increases of about $0.02 on the back of the semester's projected outstanding result. You will also note that we have added the 3,100 plus ex-Varian employees to the program. 
On a full-year basis, we now expect revenues of roughly $5.4 billion in fiscal year '10, an increase of 20% over last year or 18% growth on an organic basis, an EPS of $1.94 to $1.95. The new EPS guidance represent an increase of $0.14 over the midpoint of the previous guidance of $1.78 to $1.83 and reflects our commitment to strong incrementals as we continue to deliver on our operating model.
Now moving to fiscal year '11 scenarios, we're currently finalizing our three-year strategic plans for review with the board as we do every year in September. As part of this exercise, we model various economic scenarios and identify triggers and actions that we'll need to take under different conditions as we have proactively done in the past. 
As Alicia mentioned, an investor presentation is posted on our website. It includes two scenarios that encompass the current branch of fiscal call analyst estimates for fiscal year 2011. Under one scenario, our fiscal year '11 revenues of $6.2 billion, a 15% year-over-year increase or 9% organic growth, which in turn would drive an EPS of $2.50. 
Under the second scenario, fiscal year '11 revenues would reach $5.9 billion. This is a 10% year-over-year increase or 4% growth on an organic basis, which yields an EPS of $2.15. As Bill stated, we'll provide guidance for fiscal year '11 in November. With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A."

Agilent’s latest results are a strong indicator of our continued momentum. Q3 orders of $1.5 billion were up 39% year-over-year, while revenues of $1.4 billion were up 32% from a year ago. Note that these numbers inc",1025,"Thanks, Alicia. And hello, everyone. Agilent’s latest results are a strong indicator of our continued momentum. Q3 orders of $1.5 billion were up 39% year-over-year, while revenues of $1.4 billion were up 32% from a year ago. Note that these numbers include the results of the Varian acquisition. Without the Varian acquisition and our divestitures, orders and revenue were up 30% and 24% respectively.
In addition to the top line growth, we continued to improve gross margins, and our expenses were well controlled. Q3 non-GAAP earnings were $191 million or $0.54 per share. Agilent’s third quarter revenue growth was strong across all regions. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, the Americas were up 25% year-over-year, Europe 18%, and Asia Pacific up 28%.
The Varian integration continues to go very well. We have successfully integrated Varian’s field service and support functions into the existing Agilent structure. We have established three new product divisions dedicated to spectroscopy, research products and backing technologies, and we have consolidated Varian’s consumables with our own consumable business.
Varian’s businesses were solidly profitable in Q3. Moving forward, we are highly confident we will achieve our goal of $75 million in net savings. This is inclusive of $10 million of additional R&D that we are investing in Varian’s technologies as well as our increased investment in service and support.
From a market perspective, our third quarter results saw continued strength in most of our key markets that we serve. In our Chemical Analysis business, the applied market recovery continues. Q3 revenues of $329 million were up 62% over last year, up 30% excluding Varian. Operating margin was 21%. Excluding the Varian acquisition, we saw double-digit year-over-year growth in petrochemical, environmental and forensic markets.
From a product perspective, all product lines posted double-digit order growth over a year ago. Our high end mass spec business was especially strong with the ICP-MS, GC/MS, and Agilent’s new GC Triple Quad driving growth in food and environmental applications. And our new vacuum products are performing well in response to the improving global economy. We expect future growth to be driven by continued focus on food safety, expanding consumables and mass spec portfolios, and a continued successful integration of Varian.
In Life Science businesses, revenues of $374 million were up 28% over last year. Adjusting for Varian and the Hycor divestiture, Life Science revenues were up 15%. Operating margin was 15%. Strength from emerging markets was offset by softness in big pharma consolidation. Excluding divestitures and the Varian acquisition, academic and government revenues grew 21% over last year. We saw a more modest 6% increase in pharma, biotech, CRO and CMO. Sales of LSG products and services into applied markets were up 20% from a year ago.
From a product perspective, sales of Life Science platforms into food, environmental and other applied markets remain very strong, particularly for the LC and LCMS instruments. LC sales were up 25% year-over-year. The 1290 LC continues to exceed expectations and we introduce the new 1220 and mid-range 1260 LCs. Our SureSelect sample prep product offerings also continued to beat expectations.
Electronic Measurement revenues of $692 million were up 24% from a year ago. Excluding the Network Solutions divestiture, revenues grew 34%. Operating margin of 18% is at the highest level since the early 2000s. We saw strength across all markets and regions. Asia Pacific revenue is up 32%, Europe was up 18%, and the Americas were up 18% year-over-year.
In industrial markets, we saw broad and consistent growth across multiple industries, driven by the economic recovery and growth in China. Aerospace and defense improved with spending in the United States and Asia fueling a 24% growth year-over-year. Communication demand improved with increased spending for new technologies, including LTE and smartphones and for 3G expansion in Asia.
From a market perspective, our network analyzers and oscilloscopes, especially high end scopes, were strong in all markets. Network analyzer revenue grew 58% from a year ago, while scopes were up 45%. Moving forward, while the economy remains uncertain, we continue to see numerous market opportunities. And we believe Agilent is at a strong position to capitalize on them. There are four major areas where we differentiate ourselves.
The first is our market reach and customer trust. We are number one in customer loyalty in every major product category in our industries, as measured by external benchmarks. With our field team now consisting of more than 6,000 sales and marketing people, we will continue to invest in customer service and support.
Second is our technology leadership. We currently have the leading technology in every one of our core platforms; oscilloscopes, signal and spectrum analyzers, network analyzers, gas and liquid chromatography, and mass specs. We are committed to drive to the number one position in spectroscopy in NMR. And as we’ve noted, we are increasing our R&D investment in these areas. We also continue to invest in Life Science workflow solutions and adjacent market opportunities, including nanotechnology and surveillance.
Third is our scale and scope. Agilent’s ability to scale and leverage its manufacturing capability has resulted in the leadership position in the industry. We have 6,100 manufacturing employees in every major con, and with a proven track record, delivering new products to the market and dramatically driving down manufacturing costs. As a result, Agilent today has the lowest instrument cost of sales in the industry while maintaining a reputation of high quality and reliability.
Fourth is our team. We have completed our transformation and we have managed successfully through the recession. Agilent’s leaders and employees are able to focus externally on our customers and our market opportunity. As a result, we are in a strong position moving into Q4 and FY ’11. We are raising our fourth quarter and full year guidance.
For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect revenues of $1.52 billion, inclusive of Varian. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.58 to $0.59 per share. For the full fiscal year 2010, we expect revenues of $5.4 billion and a non-GAAP earnings of $1.94 to $1.95 per share.
Thank you for being on the call. Now I’ll turn it over to Didier.

I will start by providing additional color on the third quarter results and the fourth quarter outlook. And I’ll give an update on the Varian integration and a perspective on potential scenarios in fiscal year ’11. My comments on the results will focus on the year-over-year comparisons, and I will report year-over-year top-line growth percentages, both with and without the Hycor and Network Solutions divestitures and the Varian acquisition. Or in other words, the organic and inorganic view of order and revenue growth.
Starting with Q3 results, as Bill stated, Agilent delivered strong third quarter results. Those results show that we are delivering on our commitment to exit the recession in a much stronger position than when the downturn began. During the downturn, we maintained our large investment in R&D and expanded our channel and reach. We also restructured EMG. We believe we have strengthened an operating model that is a significant competitive advantage in the short and long-term.
Orders of $1.5 billion were up 39% from one year ago, both in the dollars and local currency. On an organic basis, orders grew 30%, with Asia Pacific up 51%, the Americas up 20%, and Europe up 14%. Revenues of $1.4 billion were up 32% in dollars and local currency from one year ago, or 24% on an organic basis. All three business segments generated double-digit revenue growth, both in total and organically.
Geographic revenues on an organic basis were up 28% in Asia Pacific, up 25% in the Americas, and grew 18% in Europe. Organic revenue growth in China and India were very solid at 24% and 43% respectively.
Now moving to the income statement, third quarter non-GAAP operating profit of $251 million was $170 million above one year ago on the $338 million increase in revenue, yielding a 50% operating incremental. Excluding Varian, our year-over-year operating margin incremental was 83%, with all three segments delivering excellent incremental.
The key factors driving this outstanding year-over-year performance were volume-related gross margin incrementals and restructuring savings. These were partly offset by the impact of the restoration of full pay and higher variable and incentives. Currency had minimal impact on any of the income statement line item.
Now turning to the individual income statement line items, third quarter gross margin of 56% were 2.8 points higher than last year. Excluding Varian, gross margins reached an all-time high and improved by 4.2 points over last year or about 2 points on a volume adjusted basis. Third quarter operating expenses increased $49 million, mostly due to the impact of the Varian acquisition. Wage restoration and higher variable and incentive pay were offset by restructuring savings.
Operating profits of $251 million were up more than 200% from last year. The company's third quarter operating margin was 18%, and increase of 10 points from one year ago and well above our mid-cycle target of 14%. Net other income and expense declined $5 million from last year, mostly due to higher interest expenses.
Moving to taxes, we are reducing our fiscal year 2010 non-GAAP tax rate from 20% to 19%, which results in a 17.5% tax rate for Q3 and additional $0.01 per share. Non-GAAP net income of $191 million or $0.54 per share compares to $53 million or $0.15 per share one year ago.
Turning to the cash flow and the balance sheet, we continued to show outstanding discipline in asset management. Inventory days on hand of 97 days were nine days better than one year ago on $117 million in higher inventories, an increase largely due to the Varian acquisition. Receivables days sales outstanding increased four days from one year ago to 50, again primarily due to the Varian acquisition.
Total cash from operations was $90million, an increase of $49 million from one year ago. During the quarter, we raised $40 million from employee stock programs and repurchased $94 million worth of shares. Year-to-date we’ve raised $264 million and repurchased $359 million. As you know, we intend to maintain our basic outstanding share count at about 346 million shares, while the diluted share count will remain north of 350 million shares depending on the stock price. With regard to net cash, we finished the quarter with net cash of $267 million.
Now let me say a word on the $1.5 billion world trade debt maturing in January. As you know, we had a very successful debt offering on July 13 and raised $750 million. We intend to pay off the world trade debt in its entirety when it matures in January 2011 using the proceeds of the debt offering and cash from our balance sheet. We would incur an additional $5 million in interest expense in Q4 2010 and Q1 2011, but starting in Q2 2011, we will save $7 million per quarter after we delever.
Now, onto the Varian integration, as Bill stated, we are making excellent progress in integrating Varian and capitalizing on the revenue and cost synergies that we expected. With our expanded portfolio and capabilities, we have started capturing market opportunities. We also remain committed to the $75 million in cost synergies that we previously committed, even net of incremental investments in R&D, service and support. On November 1, we will combine all the Varian and Agilent legal entities. In short, we are pleased to confirm that our integration, revenue and cost synergy plans are on track.
Now turning to the 2010 outlook, we expect Agilent Q4 revenues to be about $1.52 billion, 30% above last year or a 21% growth on an organic basis. Q4 revenues of $1.52 billion would represent an approximate increase of $120 million over Q3 revenues. On an earnings per share basis, we expect the sequential increase of $0.04 to $0.05 above Q3 level of $0.54, leading to an expected Q4 EPS of $0.58 to $0.59.
Now, this would represent a somewhat lower sequential incremental than normal for the following four reasons. First, about $35 million of the sequential revenue increases from Varian products and services has legal incremental as the corresponding increase in gross margin is offset by increased Varian expenses, which in Q4 reflect an additional two weeks of expenses over Q3.
Second, Q4 earnings per share do not have the $0.01 benefit of the tax true-up that we saw in Q2. Third, Q4 earnings per share reflect the negative carry of the new $750 million debt was about $0.01. And fourth, Q4 earnings per share include end-of-semester variable and incentive pay increases of about $0.02 on the back of the semester’s projected outstanding results. You would also note that we have added the 3,100-plus ex-Varian employees to the program.
On a full year basis, we now expect revenues of roughly $5.4 billion in fiscal year ’10, an increase of 20% over last year or 18% growth on an organic basis; and EPS of $1.94 to $1.95. The new EPS guidance represents an increase of $0.14 over the midpoint of the previous guidance of $1.78 to $1.83 and reflects our commitment to strong incrementals, as we continue to deliver on our operating model.
Now moving to fiscal year ’11 scenarios, we are currently finalizing our three-year strategic plans for review with the Board, as we do every year in September. As part of this exercise, we model various economic scenarios and identify triggers and actions that would need to take under different conditions as we have productively done in the past.
As Alicia mentioned, an investor presentation is posted on our website. It includes two scenarios that it compares the current range of First Call analyst estimates of fiscal year 2011. Under one scenario, our fiscal year ’11 revenues of $6.2 billion, a 15% year-over-year increase or 9% organic growth, which in turn would drive an EPS of $2.50. Under the second scenario, fiscal year ’11 revenues would reach $5.9 billion. This is a 10% year-over-year increase or 4% growth on an organic basis, which yields an EPS of $2.15. As Bill stated, we will provide guidance for fiscal year ’11 in November.
With that, I’ll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A.

Offsetting that, we continue to see the investment in LTE. We continue to do exceedingly well in LTE. R&D, we continue to do well. With the expansion in smartphones, we continue to do very, very well in aerospace and defense. And we do very well across a very broad industrial base. EMG is a much different organization than it was before the last downturn. And so outside of a pause in semiconductor investment, which is a very small part of our business, everything as it stands today looks quite positive. Ron, any additional comments?

But clearly, with our direct sales, we cannot go ahead and get all of the reach that we want. So we’re working very effectively with many partners. And accordingly in the last year, we’ve taken the percentage of our sales and distribution from roughly 9% to about 18%. So twice as much of our business on a percentage basis is going through distribution. If you look at it on a dollar basis, our indirect sales were up 89% this last quarter. And that’s why you see great growth in product lines such as oscilloscope. So oscilloscope order growth restated the revenue growth of 45%, but oscilloscope order growth was over 50%. And that’s because of the great high performance products that were introduced in April, but also because of the lower end scopes that are sold through distribution. So the distribution strategy is working exceptionally well. We have doubled the percentage of business - of our business that goes through distribution, and we plan to continue to go much, much further with that, as we continue to execute our strategy.

I think it’s fair, Ron, that in terms of stuff that is tied, we still have a small business tied directly IC cap and that’s probably in the $100 million that you’re talking about. So it’s not very large. So if you assume an organic growth rate, let’s say, normally of 7, you get to 9 with a stronger EMG, little bit below that with a weaker EMG. That’s how I would characterize it. And as simple as that, and obviously we will nail this down next month and report it in our guidance moving forward. But that’s how I look at it 7 plus or minus a couple, borrowing a major downturn.

I think that overall we believe aerospace and defense business will continue to grow next year. Our business outside the US continues to be robust. The efforts that we have made in operational surveillance continue to do very, very well. And as we made recent public statements, we’ve done very good job of winning very large tender offers in the US military. So - and if you look at the DOD budget, there is no evidence of any severe cutback in 2011. Yes, we focus the priorities, but the fundamental investment we believe will not be a material change. Communication, as we talked about, it’s all about the growth in the wireless and the continued investment in LTE. And the industrial and computers, all going to be driven by the macroeconomic environment. Yes, we have a great product portfolio in there, but the major drive is continued investment in capital investment. So the only areas we had noted is that in the semiconductor business, will there be an isotope as the capacity catches up with demand moving forward. But as I said to a previous question, roughly about $100 million that’s kind of caught in what would be your typical semiconductor cap business. So again, not supermaterial to the outcome of the company.

They still have the capability to do it again. I have Nick comment on the stimulus money in the US. Every country does it a little bit differently. And so it really is hard to track.

Note that these numbers inclu",1049,"Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Agilent's latest results are a strong indicator of our continued momentum. Q3 orders of $1.5 billion were up 39% year-over-year, while revenues of $1.4 billion were up 32% from a year ago. Note that these numbers include the results of the Varian acquisition. Without the Varian acquisition, our divestitures, orders and revenue were up 30% and 24%, respectively. 
In addition to the top line growth, we continue to improve gross margins, and our expenses were well controlled. Q3 non-GAAP earnings were $191 million or $0.54 per share. Agilent's third quarter revenue growth was strong across all regions. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, the Americas were up 25% year-over-year, Europe 18% and Asia Pacific, up 28%. 
The Varian integration continues to go very well. We have successfully integrated Varian's field service and support functions into the existing Agilent structure. We have established three new product divisions dedicated to spectroscopy, Research Products and vacuum technologies, and we have consolidated Varian's consumables with our own Consumable business. Varian's businesses were solidly profitable in Q3. 
Moving forward, we are highly confident we will achieve our goal of a $75 million in net savings. This is inclusive of $10 million of additional R&D that we're investing in Varian's technologies as well as our increased investments in service and support. From a market perspective, our third quarter results saw a continued strength in most of our key markets that we serve. 
In our Chemical Analysis business, the applied market recovery continues. Q3 revenues of $329 million were up 62% over last year, up 13% excluding Varian. Operating margin was 21%. Excluding the Varian acquisition, we saw a double-digit, year-over-year growth in petrochemical, environmental and forensic markets. 
From a product perspective, all product lines posted double-digit order growth over a year ago. Our high-end Mass Spec business was especially strong with ICP-MS [inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry], GC/MS [Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry] and Agilent's new GC-QQQ, driving growth in food and environmental applications. And our new vacuum products are performing well in response to the improving global economy. We expect future growth to be driven by continued focus on food safety, expanding consumables and Mass Spec portfolios and the continued successful integration of Varian. 
In our Life Science businesses, revenues of $374 million were up 28% over last year. Adjusting for Varian in the high core divestiture, Life Science revenues were up 15%. Operating margin was 15%. Strength from emerging markets was offset by softness in big Pharma consolidation. 
Excluding divestitures in the Varian acquisition, academic and government revenues grew 21% over last year. We saw a more modest 6% increase in Pharma/Biotech, CRO [contract research organization] and CMO [contract manufacturing organization]. Sales of LSG [Life Sciences Group] products and services into applied markets were up 20% from a year ago. 
From a product perspective, sales of Life Science platforms into food, environmental and other applied markets remain very strong, particularly for the L/C [Liquid Chromatography] and LC/MS [Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry] instruments. L/C sales were up 25% year-over-year. The 1290 L/C continues to exceed expectations, and we introduced the new 1220 and mid-range 1260 L/Cs. Our sure-select sample prep product offerings also continue to beat expectations. 
Electronic Measurement. Revenues of $692 million were up 24% from a year ago. Excluding the network solutions divestitures, revenues grew 34%. Operating margin of 18% is at the highest level since the early 2000s. We saw strength across all markets and regions. Asia Pacific revenue is up 32%, Europe was up 18% and the Americas were up 18% year-over-year. 
In industrial markets, we saw a broad and consistent growth across multiple industries, driven by the economic recovery and growth in China. Aerospace and defense improved with spending in the United States and Asia fueling its 24% growth year-over-year. Communications demand improved with increased spending for new technologies, including LTE [Long Term Evolution] and smartphones and for 3G expansion in Asia. 
From a market perspective, our network analyzers and oscilloscopes, especially high-end scopes, were strong in all markets. Network analyzer revenue grew 58% from year ago, while scopes were up 45%. 
Moving forward, while the economy remains uncertain, we continue to see numerous market opportunities, and we believe Agilent is in a strong position to capitalize on them. There are four major areas where we differentiate ourselves. 
The first is our market reach and customer trust. We are #1 in customer loyalty in every major product category in our industry as measured by external benchmarks. With our field team now consisting of more than 6,000 sales and marketing people, we will continue to invest in customer service and support. 
Second is our technology leadership. We currently have the leading technology in every one of our core platforms: oscilloscopes, signal and spectrum analyzers, network analyzers, gas and liquid chromatography and Mass Spec. We are committed to drive to the #1 position in spectroscopy and NMR [nuclear magnetic resonance]. And as we've noted, we are increasing our R&D investment in these areas. We also continue to invest in Life Science workflow solutions and adjacent market opportunities, including nanotechnology and surveillance. 
Third is our scale and scope. Agilent's ability to scale and leverage its manufacturing capability has resulted in the leadership position in the industry. We have 6,100 manufacturing employees in every major continent with a proven track record of delivering new products to the market and dramatically driving down manufacturing cost. As a result, Agilent today has the lowest instrument cost of sales in the industry, while maintaining a reputation of high quality and reliability. 
Fourth is our team. We have completed our transformation, and we have managed successfully through the recession. Agilent's leaders and employees are able to focus externally on our customers and our market opportunity. As a result, we are in a strong position moving into Q4 and FY '11. 
We are raising our fourth quarter and full year guidance. For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect revenues of $1.52 billion, inclusive of Varian. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.58 to $0.59 per share. For the full fiscal year 2010, we expect revenues of $5.4 billion and a non-GAAP earnings of $1.94 to $1.95 per share.

I will start by providing additional color on the third quarter results and the fourth quarter outlook. Then, I will give an update on the Varian integration and a perspective on potential scenarios in fiscal year '11. 
My comments on the results will focus on the year-over-year comparisons, and I will report year-over-year top line growth percentages, both with and without the high core Network Solutions divestitures and the Varian acquisition, in other words, the organic and inorganic view of order and revenue growth.
Starting with Q3 results. As Bill stated, Agilent delivered strong third quarter results. Those results show that we're delivering on our commitment to exit the recession in a much stronger position than when the downturn began. 
During the downturn, we maintained our large investment in R&D and expanded our channel and reach. We also restructured EMG [Electronics Measurement Group]. We believe we have strengthened an operating model that is a significant competitive advantage in the short and long term. 
Orders of $1.5 billion were up 39% from one year ago, both in dollars and local currency. On an organic basis, orders grew 30%, with Asia Pacific up 51%, the Americas up 20% and Europe up 14%. 
Revenue was up $1.4 billion or up 32% in dollars and local currency from one year ago or 24% in an organic basis. Both three business segments generated double-digit revenue growth, both in total and organically. 
Geographic revenues. On an organic basis, we're up 28% in Asia Pacific, up 25% in the Americas and grew 18% in Europe. Organic revenue growth in China and India were very solid at 24% and 43%, respectively. 
Now moving to the income statement. Third quarter non-GAAP operating profit of $251 million was $170 million above one year ago on a $338 million increase in revenue, yielding a 50% operating margin incremental. Excluding Varian, our year-over-year operating margin incremental was 83%, with all three segments delivering excellent incrementals. 
The key factors driving this outstanding year-over-year performance were volume-related gross margin incrementals and restructuring savings. These were partly offset by the impact of the restoration of full pay and higher variable and incentives. Currency had minimal impact on any of the income statement line item.
Now turning to the individual income statement line items. Third quarter gross margins of 56% were 2.8 points higher than last year. Excluding Varian, gross margins reached an all-time high and improved by 4.2 points over last year or about 2 points on a volume-adjusted basis. 
Third quarter operating expenses increased $49 million, mostly due to the impact of the Varian acquisition. Wage restoration and higher variable and incentive pay were offset by restructuring pay. 
Operating profits of $251 million were up more than 200% from last year. The company's third quarter operating margin was 18%, an increase of 10 points from one year ago and well above our mid-cycle target of 14%. Net other income and expense declined $5 million from last year, mostly due to higher interest expenses. 
Moving to taxes. We are reducing our fiscal year 2010 non-GAAP tax rate from 20% to 19%, which results in a 17.5% tax rate for Q3 and one additional cent per share. Non-GAAP net income of $191 million or $0.54 per share compares to $53 million or $0.15 per share one year ago.
Turning to the cash flow and the balance sheet. We continue to show outstanding discipline in asset management. Inventory days on hand of 97 days were nine days better than one year ago on $117 million in higher inventories, an increase largely due to the Varian acquisition. Receivables days sales outstanding increased four days from one year ago to 50, again primarily due to the Varian acquisition. Total cash from operations was $90 million, an increase of $49 million from one year ago. 
During the quarter, we raised $40 million from employee stock programs and repurchased $94 million worth of shares. Year-to-date, we've raised $264 million and repurchased $359 million. As you know, we intend to maintain our basic outstanding share count at about 346 million shares, while the diluted share count will remain north of 350 million shares depending on the stock price. With regard to net cash, we finished the quarter with net cash of $267 million. 
Now let me say a word on the $1.5 billion World Trade debt maturing in January. As you know, we had a very successful debt offering on July 13 and raised $750 million. We intend to pay off the World Trade debt in its entirety when it matures in January 2011, using the proceeds of the debt offering and cash from our balance sheet. We will incur an additional $5 million in interest expense in Q4 2010 and Q1 2011. But starting in Q2 2011, we will save $7 million per quarter after we delever.
Now onto the Varian integration. As Bill stated, we are making excellent progress in integrating Varian and capitalizing on the revenue and cost synergies that we expected. With our expanded portfolio and capabilities, we have started capturing market opportunities. 
We also remain committed to the $75 million in cost synergies that we previously communicated even net of incremental investments in R&D, service and support. On November 1, we will combine all the Varian and Agilent legal entities. In short, we are pleased to confirm that our integration, revenue and cost synergy plans are on track. 
Now turning to the fiscal year '10 outlook. We expect Agilent Q4 revenues to be about $1.52 billion, 30% above last year or a 21% growth on an organic basis. Q4 revenues of $1.52 billion would represent an approximate increase of $120 million over Q3 revenue. 
On an earnings-per-share basis, we expect a sequential increase of $0.04 to $0.05 above Q3 level of $0.54, leading to an expected Q4 EPS of $0.58 to $0.59. Now these would represent a somewhat lower sequential incremental than normal for the following four reasons. 
First, about $35 million of the sequential revenue increases for Varian products and services, as legal incremental as the corresponding increase in gross margin is offset by increased Varian expenses, which in Q4 reflect an additional two weeks of expenses over Q3. Second, Q4 earnings per share do not have the $0.01 benefit of the tax true-up that we saw in Q3. Third, Q4 earnings per share reflect the negative carry of the new $750 million debt worth about $0.01. And fourth, Q4 earnings per share include end-of-semester variable and incentive pay increases of about $0.02 on the back of the semester's projected outstanding results. You will also note that we have added the 3,100 plus ex-Varian employees to the program. 
On a full year basis, we now expect revenues of roughly $5.4 billion in fiscal year '10, an increase of 20% over last year or 18% growth on an organic basis, an EPS of $1.94 to $1.95. The new EPS guidance represents an increase of $0.14 over the midpoint of the previous guidance of $1.78 to $1.83 and reflects our commitment to strong incrementals as we continue to deliver on our operating model.
Now moving to fiscal year '11 scenarios. We're currently finalizing our three-year strategic plans for review with the board as we do every year in September. As part of this exercise, we model various economic scenarios and identify triggers and actions that we'll need to take under different conditions as we have proactively done in the past. 
As Alicia mentioned, an investor presentation is posted on our website. It includes two scenarios that encompass the current range of fiscal analyst estimates for fiscal year 2011. Under one scenario, our fiscal year '11 revenues of $6.2 billion, a 15% year-over-year increase or 9% organic growth, which in turn would drive an EPS of $2.50. 
Under the second scenario, fiscal year '11 revenues would reach $5.9 billion. This is a 10% year-over-year increase or 4% growth on an organic basis, which yields an EPS of $2.15. As Bill stated, we'll provide guidance for fiscal year '11 in November. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A."

And that right now, there's just no evidence of a slowdown. In terms of EMG, and again, Ron can add any additional color commentary, the biggest downside potential is for the semiconductor industry, which is a small part of our business but real, could in fact ask them to help out going in next year. Offsetting that, we continue to see the investment in LTE. We continue to do exceedingly well in LTE R&D. We continue to do well with the expansion in smartphones. We continue to do very, very well in aerospace and defense, and we do very well across a very broad industrial base. EMG is a much different organization than it was before the last downturn. And so, outside of a pause in semiconductor investment, which is a very small part of our business, everything as it stands today, looks quite positive. Ron, any additional comments?"

And that is a more stable business, and that really aligns with the LTE cycle that we're beginning to see. For instance, in China, our Wireless R&D business was up 85% this quarter.

Agilent’s latest results continue to build on the strong momentum that we have seen throughout fiscal 2010. There are three major themes that have emerged. One, we have successfully completed the transformation of Agilent. Two, the Varian integration is going exceedingly well. Three, we are benefiting from strong organic growth as a result of the regional sales support expansion and technology investments we have made.
Fourth quarter orders of $1.7 billion were up 32% year-over-year, while revenues of $1.6 billion were up 36% from a year ago. Note that these numbers include the results of the Varian acquisition. Without the Varian acquisition and recent divestitures, orders and revenues were up 23% and 26% respectively.
In addition to the top line growth, our Q4 non-GAAP earnings were more than double to $228 million or $0.65 per share from a year ago. Agilent’s fourth quarter revenue growth was strong across all regions. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, the Americas were up 23% year-over-year, Europe was up 13% and Asia Pacific was up 38%.
On November 1, we successfully reached a major milestone in the integration of the Varian acquisition. This includes combining all Agilent and Varian legal entities and moving Varian employees to Agilent’s pay and benefits. Agilent and Varian now appears as one single company to our customers.
We now have one Web site, unified call centers, a combined field organization and a single service and support process for our customers. Quotations, orders and invoices are all common for Agilent and Varian products.
Moving forward, our priority is to continue to drive revenue and cost synergies, as well as to drive technology sharing between the divisions and business groups. We now believe that we will achieve $100 million in net savings. This is inclusive of $10 million of additional R&D we’re investing in Varian’s technologies as well as our increased investment in service and support. From a market perspective, our fourth quarter results saw continued strength in our key markets and geographies.
In our Chemical Analysis business, we saw sustained growth across all market segments. Q4 revenues of $389 million were up 73% over last year, up 17% excluding Varian. Operating margin, including Varian, was 22%. The energy and petrochemical markets continue to recover, while food and environmental markets remained strong around the world.
From a product perspective, our new product introduction of GC/MS, ICP-MS and GC Triple Quad continue to drive strong interest in growth in food and environmental applications and the 5975 Transportable MSD which was introduced to Pittcon is getting significant interest from government sector.
In our Life Science business, revenues of $431 million were up 35% over last year. Not including Varian in a high core divestiture, Life Science revenues hit an all-time high growing 17% compared to Q4 2009. Operating margin, including Varian, was 14%.
Academic and government revenues grew 31% over last year on an organic basis. The academic market remains solid particularly in light of U.S. stimulus and growth in China.
We saw 14% year-over-year organic growth in pharma and biotech. The market continues to face a paradigm shift as companies continue to restructure, outsource and move to low-cost locations. We are well positioned to take advantage of the pharma’s shift to developing countries.
From a product perspective, platform growth was strong across the board with Life Science platforms all growing by double-digits year-over-year. LC revenues, led by our 1290 and 1260 products, were up 21% year-over-year. LC/MS and Genomics, including our SureSelect products, continue to perform very well.
In Electronic Measurement, revenue of $764 million, were up 24% from a year ago. Excluding the Network Solutions divestitures, revenues grew 35%. Operating margin was 20%. Aerospace and defense was up 16%, while revenues from industrial, computer and semiconductor customers grew 43% from a year ago. Electronic industry growth continues to be strong and outpace general economic growth.
Key drivers continue to be business investment and emerging economic expansion. Excluding the Network Solutions divestitures, communication revenues were up 41% over last year. 3G technologies continue to dominate expanding in both wireless manufacturing and wireless R&D. Our key investment is focused on R&D and continues to grow.
Geographically, all regions saw a year-over-year increase led by Asia, which contributed half electronic measurements dollar growth. From our platform perspective, we have our strongest product lineup in years. Our PNA-X network analyzer, PXA signal analyzers and PSG Signal Generators, all continue to drive growth and outperform our competitors.
Our scope business was up 39% year-over-year. We’re continuing to gaining share with our high-performance of solar scopes led by the success of our Infiniium X-Series and we introduced 48 new module instrument products in Q4. Moving forward, we continue to see numerous market opportunities and we believe Agilent is in strong position to capitalize on them.
There are four major areas where we differentiate ourselves. First is our market reach and customer trust, where we continue to invest in customer service and support. We are paying special attentions to supporting our continued growth in Asia.
Second, is our technology leadership while we are currently have the leading technology in every one of our core platforms, we will maintain R&D investment 11% of revenue in fiscal year ‘11.
We continue to believe that our above industry average R&D investment will maintain our technology leadership across all major products. In addition, it will fund strategic initiatives as Life Sciences, Operational surveillance in Nano technology. We plan to release many exciting new products in 2011.
Third is our scale and scope, we currently have among the lowest instrument cost of sales in the industry. At the same time, we maintain our stellar reputation for quality and reliability. Our global manufacturing capability is second to none.
As we move into 2011, we plan to drive substantial improvements in cost of sales across all variant portfolios, as well as improve cost of sales across the balance of our Analytical product portfolio.
For example, we have recently opened our new LC/MS factory in Singapore. We plan to transfer RF console manufacturing for NMR to Penang. We will shut down our Walnut Creek facility in consolidated with other Agilent facilities. We will move machine tooling out of our Australia facility and will continue to leverage the scale of our procurement and logistics operations.
The fourth way we differentiate ourselves is our team. Our 18,500 employees remain focused externally on our customers and our market opportunities. We are in a strong position moving into the new fiscal year.
For the first quarter of 2011, we expect revenues in the range of $1.53 billion to $1.55 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.57 per share. For the full fiscal year 2011, we expect revenue to range from $1.6 billion to $6.3 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $2.30 to $2.50 per share.
Thank you for being on the call, and now, I’ll turn it over to Didier.

I’ll start by providing additional color on our fourth quarter results and then comment on our outlook for Q1 and the new fiscal year. All my comments will refer to non-GAAP figures, so, starting with Q4 results.
As Bill mentioned, Agilent delivered a very solid fourth quarter performance. Orders of $1.7 billion were up 32% from one year ago both in dollars and local currency, with Asia-Pacific up 40%, the Americas up 27% and Europe up 31%. Orders grew 23% on an organic basis. Revenues of $1.6 billion were up 36% in dollars and local currency from one year ago or 26% on an organic basis.
All three business segments generated strong double-digit revenue growth, both in total and organically. Geographic revenue was on an organic basis increased 38% in Asia-Pacific and grew 23% in the Americas and 13% in Europe. Organic revenue growth in China was 37%, while India revenue grew 31%.
Now moving to the income statement, fourth quarter non-GAAP operating profit of $303 million improved a $153 million from one year ago, on a $470 million increase in revenues, a 37% operating margin incremental. Excluding Varian, the year-over-year operating margin incremental was 63%, with all three segments delivering very sound operating margin incremental on an organic basis.
The story of this outstanding year-over-year performance remains the same as last quarter, as we saw strong top line revenue growth, coupled with markedly lower cost structure that was created through our restructuring programs completed earlier in the year. Currency had minimal impact on any of the income statement line items.
Now turning to the individual income statement line items, fourth quarter gross margins of 55.3% were essentially flat from last year. Excluding Varian, gross margins of 57.1% improved by 1.5 points over last year. We did recognize a few non-recurring cost in Q4 that reduced gross margins by about 0.5 points.
Fourth quarter operating expenses increased $73 million year-over-year, primarily due to the Varian acquisition. Wage restoration and higher variable incentive pay were offset by restructuring savings.
Operating profit of $303 million more than doubled from the same period last year. Agilent’s fourth quarter operating margin was 19%, an increase of six points from one year ago and our highest operating margin performance ever. Net other income and other expense declined $12 million from last year due to higher interest expenses.
However, we plan to retire the $1.5 billion World Trade debt on December 1, two months earlier than planned, which will reduce our interest expense by over $2 million per month starting in December.
Moving to taxes, note that our non-GAAP tax rate will remain at 19% in fiscal year 2011. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to further decline to 18% in fiscal year ‘12 in conjunction with the completion of the Varian integration.
Non-GAAP net income of $228 million or $0.65 per share compares to $111 million and $0.32 per share one year ago. Both quarterly earnings per share and full year EPS of $2 are a record high for Agilent.
Now, turning to the cash flow and the balance sheet, we continue to demonstrate discipline in asset management. Inventory days on hand of 92 days were five days better than one year ago. Receivables days sales outstanding increased three days from one year ago to 49 days due to Varian higher days sales outstanding.
Total cash from operations was $367 million, an increase of $164 million from one year ago. During the quarter, we received $37 million from employee stock programs and repurchased $51 million worth of shares. Year-to-date, we have received $301 million and repurchased $410 million.
We will continue the present buyback program intended to keep the basic outstanding share count at 346 million shares. This anti-dilutive share buyback program will utilize about $120 million in cash in fiscal year ‘11. Based on the present stock price, you should assume 356 million diluted shares throughout fiscal year ‘11.
With regards to net cash, we finished the quarter with net cash of $598 million. Now, turning to the fiscal year 2011 outlook, you’ll recall that last quarter, we provided two scenarios that bracketed the range of analyst estimates, with a revenue range of $5.9 billion on the low end and $6.2 billion on the high-end and EPS of $2.15 to $2.50, which was based on 352 million diluted shares.
We’re now increasing our fiscal year ‘11 revenue guidance range to $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion and EPS of $2.30 to $2.50 based on 356 million diluted shares.
With this new guidance, we’re raising the low end of the revenue range by $200 million and $0.15 for EPS and the high end of the revenue range by $100 million with no change in EPS.
We’re holding to the high end of the EPS range, as more than half of the projected revenue increase is due to currency changes that provide minimal incremental operating profit. In addition, we are selectively investing about $20 million on revenue generating projects and activities.
Finally, the 4 million share increase in diluted shares reduces EPS by $0.03. You will note that the mid-point of our revenue guidance, $6.2 billion, translates into 13% year-over-year growth or 8% growth on an organic basis. The mid-point of our EPS guidance, $2.40 translates into 20% growth over our fiscal year ‘10 EPS of $2.
Here are few other items to keep in mind as you update your models for fiscal year ‘11. Annual salary increases will be effective December 1, 2010. Stock-based compensation will be about $73 million compared to $66 million in fiscal year ‘10 and as we frontload the recognition of stock-based compensation, the Q1 expense will be about $26 million.
Third, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $950 million and capital expenditures of about $150 million, which yield free cash flow of approximately $800 million.
Fourth, we distribute our variable pay and incentive pay in Q1 and Q3. Hence, Q2 and Q4 are seasonally higher cash flow quarters. Depreciation and amortization are projected to be $150 million for the fiscal year.
Finally, moving to the guidance for first quarter, we expect Q1 revenues of $1.530 billion to $1.550 billion and EPS of $0.55 to $0.57. On the mid-point, year-over-year revenue growth will be 27% or 16% on an organic basis. The mid-point of our EPS guidance corresponds to year-over-year EPS growth of 47%.
As you consider the projected decline in EPS from Q4 to Q1, you will want to keep in mind the impact of the December salary increase, frontloading of stock-based compensation and the increase in payroll taxes due to the disbursement of our second half fiscal year ‘10 variable and incentive pay.
With that, I’ll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A.

So, the big wildcard is the second half of 2011. We have assumed in this plan that growth in the U.S. and Europe and Japan would be at best at 2%, it could be lower than that aggregately. We still believe that there is opportunity in emerging markets obviously, China and India.
We also see opportunity in Latin America, driven by Brazil and a continued growth through some of the other countries in Southeast Asia. So, we think we have a very balanced portfolio coupled with that, we say, we’re going to maintain our position as a technology leader.

So, after a slow start in Q3, we obviously made a big recovery in Q4, and so we’re quite pleased with the momentum that we have going into 2011, so that’s good news. The opportunity continues to be the cost of sales. I did outline in the call that we have a taken various steps. I announced the closure of the Walnut Creek facility and consolidating it to other Agilent locations.
We’ve announced the transfer of the RF consoles to Penang and gained to leverage our EMG capability there. We continue to look at opportunities to leverage our procurement and operations and this last weekend we went live with essentially quote to cash process, so that we have an invoice process that’s one with Agilent and that is going exceedingly well. All 3,000 employees essentially have been transferred over to the Agilent pay and benefits. So again, from my perspective, the integration is going spectacularly well.
The big long-term issue and again I’ll have Mike make a comment and then Nick is to really take the additional R&D spending that we’re making to be able to expand and to upgrade the Varian platform in conjunction with our effort to reduce the cost of sales. This, of course, takes time, it’s not going to be done overnight, but we have very, very solid plans to drive the Varian cost of sales to Agilent standards.
And in fact, in my opening comments said that we’re raising the $75 million of cost synergies to $100 million. So we’re just getting a lot better handle on that, and I’m very pleased with the revenue growth that we’ve got Q3 to Q4 sequentially in Varian. So, Mike, do you want to make a comment about Varian.

So there is a lot of talk about the next replacement generation, which is LTE or fourth quarter generation that is happening, but as Bill mentioned, that’s mostly in R&D, and we’re seeing some infrastructure growth, although you won’t see a lot of infrastructure growth till 2011, and more particularly, 2012 and 2013.

Just to give you an idea, if you look at our core platforms, which include our oscilloscopes or network analyzers, spectrum analyzers and signal sources, they are used in both areas with a little bit more bias of high performance products in the Communications segment.

And we have spent a lot of time over the last three plus years, refreshing those platforms, in particular, when we look at our network analyzers, we introduced the highest performance network analyzers this last quarter, the quarter before, the highest performance real-time oscilloscopes and in the past couple of years, spectrum analyzers and signal sources. So, we see that the refreshing of our portfolio is something that will drive both segments.
Communications, clearly LTE and R&D, as Bill and I had mentioned earlier, will drive things, but there still is very substantial growth in 3G technologies, even particularly in China, where we were one of the first ones to jump on the bandwagon of TD-SCDMA, which is the China standard version for 3G.

The teams are formed and it’s all about executing moving forward.

Some of it of course, we’ve already seen just as a result of the combination of the company and the executive team on Varian, essentially leaving the company. From there, the first order is to split it by revenue, but the bias would be on the LSG, the NMR is where we have the biggest cost of sales opportunity and as we have said, we will implement this over the next few years and it’s all about our ability to execute transfer products and get new products into the system, and it’s all about time.
But I’m very, very pleased with the progress that both Mike and Nick have made in terms of addressing that, and again, the alignment with all our 3,000 new employees.

The general China market comment you made, you’re right, we’re rolling to a new five-year plan and you’re right there was some extraordinary stimulus at the end of this five-year plan, which is ending this year. But what we’re seeing so far is that at least in the Life Science and healthcare markets, I think Michael echo comments and so when I ask to him, he can.

Agilent's latest results continue to build on the strong momentum that we have seen throughout fiscal 2010. There are three major things that have emerged. One, we have successfully completed the transformation of Agilent. Two, the Varian integration is going exceedingly well. Three, we are benefiting from strong organic growth as a result of the regional sales support expansion and technology investments we have made.
Fourth quarter orders of $1.7 billion were up 32% year-over-year, while revenues of $1.6 billion were up 36% from a year ago. Note that these numbers include the results of the Varian acquisition. Without the Varian acquisition and recent divestitures, orders and revenues were up 23% and 26%, respectively.
In addition to the top line growth, our Q4 non-GAAP earnings were more than doubled to $228 million or $0.65 per share from a year ago. Agilent's fourth quarter revenue growth was strong across all regions. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, the Americas were up 23% year-over-year, Europe was up 13% and Asia-Pacific was up 38%. 
On November 1, we successfully reached a major milestone in the integration of the Varian acquisition. This includes combining all Agilent and Varian legal entities and moving Varian employees to Agilent's pay and benefits. Agilent and Varian now appears as one single company to our customers. We now have one website, unified call centers, a combined field organization and a single service and support process for our customers. Quotations, orders and invoices are all common for Agilent and Varian products. 
Moving forward, our priorities to continue to drive revenue and cost synergies, as well as to drive technology sharing between the divisions and business groups. We now believe that we will achieve $100 million in net savings. This is inclusive of $10 million of additional R&D we are investing in Varian technologies, as well as our increased investments in service and support.
From a market perspective, our fourth quarter results saw continued strength in our key markets and geographies. In our Chemical Analysis business, we saw sustained growth across all market segments. Q4 revenues of $389 million were up 73% over last year, up 17% excluding Varian. Operating margin, including Varian, was 22%. The energy and petrochemical markets continue to recover, while food and environmental markets remained strong around the world. 
From a product perspective, our new product introductions of GC/MS, ICP-MS and GC Triple-Quad continue to drive strong interest in growth in food and environmental applications. In the 5975 transportable MSD [Mass Spectometry Detector], which was introduced to PCOM is getting significant interest from government sector. 
In our Life Science business, revenues of $431 million were up 35% over last year. Not including Varian and the high core divestiture, Life Science revenue is in an all-time high, growing 17% compared to Q4 2009. Operating margin including Varian was 14%.
Academic and government revenues grew 31% over the last year on an organic basis. The academic market remains solid, particularly in light of U.S. stimulus and growth in China. We saw 14% year-over-year organic growth in Pharma and Biotech. The market continues to face a paradigm shift as companies continue to restructure, outsource and move to low-cost locations. We are well positioned to take advantage of the Pharma shift to developing countries.
From a product perspective, platform growth was strong across the board, with Life Sciences platforms all growing by double digits year-over-year. LC revenues led by our 1290 and 1260 products were up 21% year-over-year. LC/MS and Genomics, including our SureSelect products, continue to perform very well. 
In Electronic Measurement, revenues of $764 million were up 23% from year ago. Excluding the Network Solutions divestitures, revenues grew 35%. Operating margin was 20%. Aerospace and defense was up 60%, while revenues from industrial, computer and semiconductor customers grew 43% from a year ago. Electronic industry growth continues to be strong and outpaced general economic growth. Key drivers continue to be business investment and emerging economy expansion.
Excluding the Network Solutions divestitures, communication revenues were up 41% over last year. 3G technologies continue to dominate spending in both wireless manufacturing and wireless R&D. LTE investment is focused on R&D and continues to grow. Geographically, all regions saw a year-over-year increase led by Asia, which contributed half of Electronic Measurements dollar growth. 
From a platform perspective, we have our strongest product line up in years. Our PNA-X Network Analyzers, PXA Signal Analyzers and PSG Signal Generators, all continue to drive growth and outperform our competitors. 
Our scope business was up 39% year-over-year. We are continuing to gaining share with our high-performance oscilloscopes, led by the success of our Infineon X series . And we introduced 48 new module instrument products in Q4. 
Moving forward, we continue to see numerous market opportunities, and we believe Agilent is in a strong position to capitalize on them. There are four major areas where we differentiate ourselves. First is our market reach and customer trust, where we continue to vest in customer service and support. We are paying special attention to supporting our continued growth in Asia. 
Second is our technology leadership. While we currently have the leading technology in every one of our core platforms, we will maintain R&D investment 11% of revenue in fiscal year '11. We continue to believe that our above-industry average R&D investment will maintain our technology leadership across all major products. In addition, it will fund such strategic initiatives such as Life Science operational surveillance and nanotechnology. We plan to release many exciting new products in 2011.
Third is our scale and scope. We currently have among the lowest instrument cost of sales in the industry. At the same time, we maintain our stellar reputation for quality and reliability. Our global manufacturing capability is second to none. As we move into 2011, we plan to drive substantial improvements in cost of sales across all Varian portfolio, as well as improve cost of sales across the balance of our analytical product portfolio. 
For example, we have recently opened our new LC/MS factory in Singapore. We plan to transfer RF console manufacturing for NMR to Penang [Penang, Malaysia]. We will shut down our Walnut Creek facility and consolidate it with other Agilent facilities. We will move machine tooling out of our Australia facility. And we will continue to leverage the scale of our procurement of logistics operations.
The fourth way we differentiate ourselves is our team. Our 18,500 employees remain focused externally on our customers and our market opportunities. We're in a strong position moving into the new fiscal year. 
For the first quarter of 2011, we expect revenues in the range of $1.53 billion to $1.55 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.57 per share. For the full fiscal year 2011, we expect revenue to range from $1.6 billion to $6.3 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $2.30 to $2.50 per share.

Orders grew 23% on an organic basis. Revenues of $1.6 billion were up 36% in dollars and local currency from one year ago or 26% on an organic basis. All three business segments generated strong double-digit revenue growth, both in total and organically.
Geographic revenues on an organic basis increased 38% in Asia Pacific and grew 23% in the Americas and 30% in Europe. Organic revenue growth in China was 37%, while India revenue grew 31%. 
Now moving to the income statement. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating profit of $303 million improved $153 million from one year ago on a $417 million increase in revenues at 37% operating margin incremental. Excluding Varian, the year-over-year operating margin incremental was 63%, with all three segments delivering very sound operating margin incrementals on an organic basis. 
The story of this outstanding year-over-year performance remains the same as last quarter, as we saw strong top line revenue growth coupled with a market-lowered cost structure that was created through our restructuring programs completed earlier in the year. Currency had minimal impact on any of the income statement line items.
Now turning to the individual income statement line item. Fourth quarter gross margins of the 55.3% were essentially flat from last year. Excluding Varian, gross margins of 57.1% improved by 1.5 points over last year. We did recognize a few nonrecurring costs in Q4 that reduced gross margin by about 0.5 points.
Fourth quarter operating expense increased $73 million year-over-year, primarily due to the Varian acquisition. Weight restoration and higher variable and incentive pay were offset by restructuring savings. Operating profit of $303 million more than doubled from the same period last year. Agilent's fourth quarter operating margin was 19%, an increase of six points from one year ago and our highest operating margin performance ever.
Net other income and expense declined $12 million from last year due to higher interest expenses. However, we plan to retire the $1.5 billion World Trade debt on December 1, 2 months earlier than planned, which will reduce our interest expense by over $2 million per month starting in December.
Moving to taxes. Note that our non-GAAP tax rate will remain at 19% in fiscal year 2011. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to further decline to 18% in fiscal year '12 in conjunction with the completion of the Varian integration. Non-GAAP net income of $228 million or $0.65 per share compares to $111 million and $0.32 per share one year ago. Both quarterly earnings per share and full-year EPS of $2 are record high for Agilent.
Now turning to the cash flow and the balance sheet. We continue to demonstrate discipline in asset management. Inventory days on hand of 92 days were five days better than one year ago. Receivables days sales outstanding increased three days from one year ago to 49 days due to Varian higher days sales outstanding.
Total cash from operations was $367 million, an increase of $164 million from one year ago. During the quarter, we received $37 million from employees stock programs and repurchased $51 million worth of shares. Year-to-date, we have received $301 million and repurchased $410 million. We will continue the present buyback program intended to keep the basic outstanding share count at 346 million shares. This anti-diluted share buyback program will utilize about $120 million in cash in fiscal year '11. 
Based on the present stock price, you should assume $356 million diluted shares throughout fiscal year '11. With regards to net cash, we finished the quarter with net cash of $598 million. 
Now turning to the fiscal year 2011 outlook. You will recall that last quarter, we provided two scenarios that bracketed the range of Agilent estimate with the revenue range of $5.9 billion on the low end and $6.2 billion on the high end and EPS of $2.15 to $2.50, which was based on 352 million diluted shares. 
We are now increasing our fiscal year '11 revenue guidance range to $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion and EPS of $2.30 to $2.50 based on 356 million diluted shares. With this new guidance, we are raising the low end of the revenue range by $200 million and $0.15 for EPS and the high end of the revenue range by $100 million with no charge in EPS. 
We are holding to the high-end of the EPS range as more than half of the projected revenue increases due to currency changes that provide minimal incremental operating profit. In addition, we're selectively investing about $20 million on revenue-generating projects and activities. Finally, the $4 million share increase in diluted shares reduces EPS by $0.03.
You will note that the midpoint of our revenue guidance, $6.2 billion, translate into 13% year-over-year growth or 8% growth in an organic basis. The midpoint of our EPS guidance, $2.40, translate into 20% growth over our fiscal year '10 EPS of $2. There are few other items to keep in mind, as you update your models for fiscal year '11. 
Annual salary increases will be effective December 1, 2010. Stock-based compensation will be about $73 million compared to $66 million in fiscal year '10. And as we front-load the recognition of stock-based compensation, the Q1 expense would be about $26 million. 
Third, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $950 million and capital expenditures of about $150 million, which yields free cash flow of approximately $800 million. Fourth, we distribute our variable pay and incentive pay in Q1 and Q3. Hence, Q2 and Q4 are seasonally higher cash flow quarters. And fifth, depreciation and amortization are projected to be $150 million for the fiscal year. 
Finally, moving to the guidance for our first quarter. We expect Q1 revenues of $1,530,000,000 to $1,550,000,000 million, an EPS of $0.55 to $0.57. At the midpoint, year-over-year revenue growth will be 27% or 16% on an organic basis. The midpoint of our EPS guidance corresponds to a year-over-year EPS growth of 47%. 
As you consider the projected decline in EPS on Q4 to Q1, you will want to keep in mind the impact of the December salary increase, front-loading of stock-based compensation and the increase in payroll taxes due to the disbursement of our second half fiscal year '10 variable and incentive pay. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A."

We have assumed in this plan that growth in the U.S., in Europe, in Japan would be at best 2%, could be lower than that aggregately. We still believe that there is opportunity in emerging markets, obviously, China and India.

And so we're quite pleased with the momentum that we have going into 2011. So that's the good news. The opportunity continues to be the cost of sales. I did outline in the call that we have taken various steps. I announced the closure of the Wallnut Creek facility, consolidating it into other Agilent's locations. We've announced the transfer of the RF consoles to Penang and again, to leverage our EMG capability there. We continue to look at opportunities to leverage our procurement in operations. And this last weekend, we went live with essentially a quote to cash process so that we have an invoice process that's one with Agilent. And that is going exceedingly well. All 3,000 employees essentially have been transferred over to the Agilent pay and benefits. And so again, from my perspective, the integration is growing spectacularly well. The big long-term issue, and again I'll have Mike make a comment and then Nick, is to really take the additional R&D spending that we are making to be able to expand and to upgrade the Varian platform in conjunction with our effort to reduce the cost of sales. This, of course, takes time. It's not going to be an overnight. But we have a very, very solid plans to drive the Varian cost of sales to Agilent standards. And in fact, in my opening comments, I said that we are raising the $75 million of cost synergies to $100 million. We're just getting a lot better handle on that.

We are very, very close back to the original run rate. And then as you can see from the comments that Nick just made regarding NMR and Mike, we're quite excited to see if we can in fact drive that. We have not made a statement on what additional opportunities above the $800 million. But as you can tell, Q4 was just a really solid quarter for those product lines and we're quite excited as we move into 2011."

Agilent's latest results continue to build on the strong momentum that we have seen throughout fiscal 2010. There are three major themes that have emerged. One, we have successfully completed the transformation of Agilent. Two, the Varian integration is going exceedingly well. Three, we are benefiting from strong organic growth as a result of the regional sales support expansion and technology investments we have made.
Fourth quarter orders of $1.7 billion were up 32% year-over-year, while revenues of $1.6 billion were up 36% from a year ago. Note that these numbers include the results of the Varian acquisition. Without the Varian acquisition and recent divestitures, orders and revenues were up 23% and 26%, respectively.
In addition to the top line growth, our Q4 non-GAAP earnings were more than doubled to $228 million or $0.65 per share from a year ago. Agilent's fourth quarter revenue growth was strong across all regions. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, the Americas were up 23% year-over-year, Europe was up 13% and Asia-Pacific was up 38%. 
On November 1, we successfully reached a major milestone in the integration of the Varian acquisition. This includes combining all Agilent and Varian legal entities and moving Varian employees to Agilent's pay and benefits. Agilent and Varian now appears as one single company to our customers. We now have one website, unified call centers, a combined field organization and a single service and support process for our customers. Quotations, orders and invoices are all common for Agilent and Varian products. 
Moving forward, our priority is to continue to drive revenue and cost synergies, as well as to drive technology sharing between the divisions and business groups. We now believe that we will achieve $100 million in net savings. This is inclusive of $10 million of additional R&D we are investing in Varian technologies, as well as our increased investments in service and support.
From a market perspective, our fourth quarter results saw continued strength in our key markets and geographies. In our Chemical Analysis business, we saw sustained growth across all market segments. Q4 revenues of $389 million were up 73% over last year, up 17% excluding Varian. Operating margin, including Varian, was 22%. The energy and petrochemical markets continue to recover, while food and environmental markets remained strong around the world. 
From a product perspective, our new product introductions of GC/MS, ICP-MS and GC Triple-Quad continue to drive strong interest in growth in food and environmental applications. In the 5975 transportable MSD [Mass Spectometry Detector], which was introduced to PCOM, is getting significant interest from government sector. 
In our Life Science business, revenues of $431 million were up 35% over last year. Not including Varian and the high core divestiture, Life Science revenues hit an all-time high, growing 17% compared to Q4 2009. Operating margin including Varian was 14%.
Academic and government revenues grew 31% over the last year on an organic basis. The academic market remains solid, particularly in light of U.S. stimulus and growth in China. We saw 14% year-over-year organic growth in Pharma and Biotech. The market continues to face a paradigm shift as companies continue to restructure, outsource and move to low-cost locations. We are well positioned to take advantage of the Pharma shift to developing countries.
From a product perspective, platform growth was strong across the board, with Life Sciences platforms all growing by double digits year-over-year. LC revenues led by our 1290 and 1260 products were up 21% year-over-year. LC/MS and Genomics, including our SureSelect products, continue to perform very well. 
In Electronic Measurement, revenues of $764 million were up 23% from year ago. Excluding the Network Solutions divestitures, revenues grew 35%. Operating margin was 20%. Aerospace and defense was up 60%, while revenues from industrial, computer and semiconductor customers grew 43% from a year ago. Electronic industry growth continues to be strong and outpaced general economic growth. Key drivers continue to be business investment and emerging economy expansion.
Excluding the Network Solutions divestitures, communication revenues were up 41% over last year. 3G technologies continue to dominate spending in both wireless manufacturing and wireless R&D. LTE investment is focused on R&D and continues to grow. Geographically, all regions saw a year-over-year increase led by Asia, which contributed half of Electronic Measurements dollar growth. 
From a platform perspective, we have our strongest product line up in years. Our PNA-X Network Analyzers, PXA Signal Analyzers and PSG Signal Generators, all continue to drive growth and outperform our competitors. 
Our scope business was up 39% year-over-year. We are continuing to gaining share with our high-performance oscilloscopes, led by the success of our Infineon X series . And we introduced 48 new module instrument products in Q4. 
Moving forward, we continue to see numerous market opportunities, and we believe Agilent is in a strong position to capitalize on them. There are four major areas where we differentiate ourselves. First is our market reach and customer trust, where we continue to vest in customer service and support. We are paying special attention to supporting our continued growth in Asia. 
Second is our technology leadership. While we currently have the leading technology in every one of our core platforms, we will maintain R&D investment 11% of revenue in fiscal year '11. We continue to believe that our above-industry average R&D investment will maintain our technology leadership across all major products. In addition, it will fund such strategic initiatives such as Life Science, operational surveillance and nanotechnology. We plan to release many exciting new products in 2011.
Third is our scale and scope. We currently have among the lowest instrument cost of sales in the industry. At the same time, we maintain our stellar reputation for quality and reliability. Our global manufacturing capability is second to none. As we move into 2011, we plan to drive substantial improvements in cost of sales across all Varian’s portfolio, as well as improve cost of sales across the balance of our analytical product portfolio. 
For example, we have recently opened our new LC/MS factory in Singapore. We plan to transfer RF console manufacturing for NMR to Penang [Penang, Malaysia]. We will shut down our Walnut Creek facility and consolidate it with other Agilent facilities. We will move machine tooling out of our Australia facility. And we will continue to leverage the scale of our procurement of logistics operations.
The fourth way we differentiate ourselves is our team. Our 18,500 employees remain focused externally on our customers and our market opportunities. We're in a strong position moving into the new fiscal year. 
For the first quarter of 2011, we expect revenues in the range of $1.53 billion to $1.55 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.57 per share. For the full fiscal year 2011, we expect revenue to range from $1.6 billion to $6.3 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $2.30 to $2.50 per share. 
Thank you for being on the call. And now I'll turn it over to Didier."

Geographic revenues on an organic basis increased 38% in Asia Pacific and grew 23% in the Americas and 30% in Europe. Organic revenue growth in China was 37%, while India revenue grew 31%. 
Now moving to the income statement. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating profit of $303 million improved $153 million from one year ago on a $417 million increase in revenues at 37% operating margin incremental. Excluding Varian, the year-over-year operating margin incremental was 63%, with all three segments delivering very sound operating margin incrementals on an organic basis. 
The story of this outstanding year-over-year performance remains the same as last quarter, as we saw strong top line revenue growth coupled with a markedly lower cost structure that was created through our restructuring programs completed earlier in the year. Currency had minimal impact on any of the income statement line items.
Now turning to the individual income statement line item. Fourth quarter gross margins of the 55.3% were essentially flat from last year. Excluding Varian, gross margins of 57.1% improved by 1.5 points over last year. We did recognize a few nonrecurring costs in Q4 that reduced gross margin by about 0.5 points.
Fourth quarter operating expense increased $73 million year-over-year, primarily due to the Varian acquisition. Weight restoration and higher variable and incentive pay were offset by restructuring savings. Operating profit of $303 million more than doubled from the same period last year. Agilent's fourth quarter operating margin was 19%, an increase of six points from one year ago, and our highest operating margin performance ever.
Net other income and expense declined $12 million from last year due to higher interest expenses. However, we plan to retire the $1.5 billion World Trade debt on December 1, 2 months earlier than planned, which will reduce our interest expense by over $2 million per month starting in December.
Moving to taxes. Note that our non-GAAP tax rate will remain at 19% in fiscal year 2011. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to further decline to 18% in fiscal year '12 in conjunction with the completion of the Varian integration. Non-GAAP net income of $228 million or $0.65 per share compares to $111 million and $0.32 per share one year ago. Both quarterly earnings per share and full-year EPS of $2 are record high for Agilent.
Now turning to the cash flow and the balance sheet. We continue to demonstrate discipline in asset management. Inventory days on hand of 92 days were five days better than one year ago. Receivables days sales outstanding increased three days from one year ago to 49 days due to Varian higher days sales outstanding.
Total cash from operations was $367 million, an increase of $164 million from one year ago. During the quarter, we received $37 million from employees stock programs and repurchased $51 million worth of shares. Year-to-date, we have received $301 million and repurchased $410 million. We will continue the present buyback program intended to keep the basic outstanding share count at 346 million shares. This anti-diluted share buyback program will utilize about $120 million in cash in fiscal year '11. 
Based on the present stock price, you should assume $356 million diluted shares throughout fiscal year '11. With regards to net cash, we finished the quarter with net cash of $598 million. 
Now turning to the fiscal year 2011 outlook. You will recall that last quarter, we provided two scenarios that bracketed the range of Agilent estimate with the revenue range of $5.9 billion on the low end and $6.2 billion on the high end and EPS of $2.15 to $2.50, which was based on 352 million diluted shares. 
We are now increasing our fiscal year '11 revenue guidance range to $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion and EPS of $2.30 to $2.50 based on 356 million diluted shares. With this new guidance, we are raising the low end of the revenue range by $200 million and $0.15 for EPS and the high end of the revenue range by $100 million with no charge in EPS. 
We are holding to the high-end of the EPS range as more than half of the projected revenue increases due to currency changes that provide minimal incremental operating profit. In addition, we're selectively investing about $20 million on revenue-generating projects and activities. Finally, the $4 million share increase in diluted shares reduces EPS by $0.03.
You will note that the midpoint of our revenue guidance, $6.2 billion, translate into 13% year-over-year growth or 8% growth in an organic basis. The midpoint of our EPS guidance, $2.40, translate into 20% growth over our fiscal year '10 EPS of $2. There are a few other items to keep in mind, as you update your models for fiscal year '11. 
Annual salary increases will be effective December 1, 2010. Stock-based compensation will be about $73 million compared to $66 million in fiscal year '10. And as we front-load the recognition of stock-based compensation, the Q1 expense would be about $26 million. 
Third, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $950 million and capital expenditures of about $150 million, which yields free cash flow of approximately $800 million. Fourth, we distribute our variable pay and incentive pay in Q1 and Q3. Hence, Q2 and Q4 are seasonally higher cash flow quarters. And fifth, depreciation and amortization are projected to be $150 million for the fiscal year. 
Finally, moving to the guidance for our first quarter. We expect Q1 revenues of $1,530,000,000 to $1,550,000,000 million, an EPS of $0.55 to $0.57. At the midpoint, year-over-year revenue growth will be 27% or 16% on an organic basis. The midpoint of our EPS guidance corresponds to a year-over-year EPS growth of 47%. 
As you consider the projected decline in EPS on Q4 to Q1, you will want to keep in mind the impact of the December salary increase, front-loading of stock-based compensation and the increase in payroll taxes due to the disbursement of our second half fiscal year '10 variable and incentive pay. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A."

We have assumed in this plan that growth in the U.S., in Europe, in Japan would be at best 2%, could be lower than that aggregately. We still believe that there is opportunity in emerging markets, obviously, China and India.

And so we're quite pleased with the momentum that we have going into 2011. So that's the good news. The opportunity continues to be the cost of sales. I did outline in the call that we have taken various steps. I announced the closure of the Wallnut Creek facility, consolidating it into other Agilent's locations. We've announced the transfer of the RF consoles to Penang and again, to leverage our EMG capability there. We continue to look at opportunities to leverage our procurement in operations. And this last weekend, we went live with essentially a quote to cash process so that we have an invoice process that's one with Agilent. And that is going exceedingly well. All 3,000 employees essentially have been transferred over to the Agilent pay and benefits. And so again, from my perspective, the integration is growing spectacularly well. The big long-term issue, and again I'll have Mike make a comment and then Nick, is to really take the additional R&D spending that we are making to be able to expand and to upgrade the Varian platform in conjunction with our effort to reduce the cost of sales. This, of course, takes time. It's not going to be an overnight. But we have a very, very solid plans to drive the Varian cost of sales to Agilent standards.

And while it's not quite the dominant sector, it is one that would have dominance probably this quarter. The addition of Varian actually is a great opportunity. They were not heavily penetrated in life science in terms of the China mix, and so we have an opportunity to accelerate that penetration. The general China market comment you made, you're right, we’re rolling to a new five-year plan. And you're right, there was an extraordinary stimulus at the end of this five-year plan, which is ending this year. But what we’re seeing so far is that, at least in the life science and healthcare markets -- I think Michael echoed comments and so when I pass to him, he can -- but in the life science and healthcare markets, we’re seeing strong sentiment coming in the five-year plan that's rolling out now to continue strong investment there.
