Well, 2009 is in the books and behind us. And despite what was undoubtedly the worst economic environment I have ever seen, I think that 2009 really was the year that Federal Realty business plan was validated as a great long-term approach to owning real estate in a public structure. It's a plan built on three simple premises: Restricting investment to only top quality real estate; fiscal conservatism, both from a balance sheet and operating perspective; and balance as it relates to reliance on acquisitions, development and joint venture complexity.From a cash flow perspective, we generated more cash from operating activities in recession-plagued 2009, than ever before in our history, 13% more than 2008, which itself was 7% more than 2007. I'm talking about 2009 results and what they may foreshadow about 2010 in just a minute, but first, like to introduce the investor and analyst community to a partner of mine here at Federal for the last dozen years, and its new Chief Operating Officer, Dawn Becker. There hasn't been COO per se at Federal since I carried that title in 2001, and I couldn't be happier than to officially promote Dawn to that role, effective immediately, a role she's effectively been doing for the last 18 months. Our senior team has been together now for about 10 years, and 2009 certainly tested its strength and its resolve. Each of our team members wanted Dawn recognized with this promotion, I'm really proud of that. Some of you may know her or know of her, but Dawn will be coming to the Citigroup conference in Florida next month, and for the NAREIT Investor Conference in Chicago in June. So there'll certainly be opportunity to get to know her better in the months and the years ahead.Okay. let's talk about results and then our challenges and opportunities. FFO per share, excluding as we have all year, the litigation provision related to 350 Winchester Blvd. in San Jose, was $0.90 in the fourth quarter and $3.78 for the year, both down a bit from the comparable period last year when reported numbers were $0.99 and $3.85, respectively. The entire year-over-year decline in both the quarter and the year is directly attributable to proactive financing and liquidity management of the balance sheet in an uncertain environment. We basically borrowed and raised equity in excess of our needs earlier last year, just in case. And as the capital markets became more stable, we repaid some of it. Mildly earnings dilutive in the short term, conservative and balanced for the long term.On the leasing front, we continue to do just fine in terms deal volumes. You'll notice in the 8-K that we did 309 comparable deals for 1.2 million square feet in 2009, versus 300 deals for 1.2 million square feet in 2008, but with significantly tougher economics. Rollover rent growth was a strong 10% in 2009, but pales in comparison to the 21% rollover rent growth in 2008. That's a trend that we very much expect to continue in 2010. This playing out just as we thought it would, and have been talking about for some time now. At the macro level, there's simply too much retail space for the demand today and in the near future. And so both existing and new prospective tenants really value being in the best locations, but given the plethora of choices they have, the economic leverage is all theirs in most situations.The exceptions remain, where a particular tenant or group of tenants wants or needs a location really badly, and is willing to underwrite strong sales and profitability. In those cases, our rent growth will be strong as it will be in cases where an old expiring lease that was significantly under market can be re-leased in a much higher rent. In the fourth quarter, Priscilla of Boston will be opening a new store at Santana Row is one example, as are a couple of bank rents renewal in great locations in the Washington suburbs. But overall, on a portfolio-wide basis, it's clear that we're running into a headwind of conservatively underwritten tenant sales that's making them unwilling to stretch on rent.Now obviously, these dynamics are industry-wide and it follows that the better quality real estate to Federal loans will fair better. That has been the case and I see no reason as to why it won't continue to be. It's why we've not had significant challenges keeping occupancy at relatively strong levels even though rent growth has tailed off. Our portfolio was 94.5% leased and 93.2% occupied at the end of '09. Both numbers slightly better than they were at the end of the third quarter, which in turn were about the same as they were at the end of the second quarter. Occupancy is stable. So as I said on last quarter's call, I wouldn't rule out modest reductions stocking [ph] fee in 2010. But suffice it to say, we feel confident of our ability to manage occupancy to a reasonable level.I really believe, however, that one of the toughest challenges facing all retail real estate companies these days involves the balance inherent in the difficult day-to-day leasing decisions. There are plenty of deals to do out there, that's not the issue. But while executing long-term leases with poor economic terms that create a short-term pop in earnings may feel good now, but destruction in value to the entire shopping center that last for the next 10 or 20 years of the lease term, surely won't feel very good when times are better. I know we've had to make some of those decisions and it's no fun. The trick is coming up with the appropriate balance between the short-term pick up and the long-term pain. Those 2009 leasing dynamics led to modest same center growth 1% and 1.6% in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2009, respectively, and all indications that we're in for a similar year in 2010. That's pretty high expectations, I know, in terms of these market conditions but that's who we are. So given these results in this backdrop, it's fair to add both what we're worried about and where our opportunities lie. I suspect that compared with our competitors, our worries are less significant and more manageable because of the quality of our real estate locations and the balance of our business plan as it relates to acquisitions of the past five years in new development. But we do have some level of exposure to the same type of issue as others, we still have an empty 60,000 square-foot office building over retail at Santana Row. That -- while activity has picked up greatly end of late, will be leased at far lower rents than pro forma and accordingly probably won't add a lot of value in the near term. We still have a potential great development project at Assembly Square in Boston, which everything is moving slower than planned, including IT as a construction start, resulting in more carrying costs that should lead into future profitability. And we still have the leasing headwind I discussed earlier, limiting increased core portfolio profitability.While we also have an extremely well-positioned balance sheet and presumably across the capital advantage over many other firms, both public and private on which to acquire from. At this point, we are clearly seeing more activity in terms of owners getting their heads around selling some very good and well-positioned retail real estate. We're working lots of leads and will continue to do so. The pricing remains high and sometimes unrealistically so. And as of yet, no deals that we really want are imminent. We'll remain patient, continue to focus on the blocking and tackling necessary in the core and stand ready to invest incremental capital on the right stuff for the right IRR. That's all I have for my prepared remarks right now, and I'll turn it over to Andy."

My comments are going to be brief this quarter, really focusing on the capital position and the assumptions of our guidance. Our long-term [indiscernible] balance sheet management including the capital raising we did in '09 has positioned Trust well to run our core business and pursue additional growth opportunities through acquisitions and redevelopment. At the end of 2009, we're holding $135 million of cash. At the full $300 million of capacity available on our revolving credit facility, which is short-term funding, price of LIBOR plus 42.5, no debt maturities for a year and no need to delever the balance sheet. With respect to acquisitions, I certainly expected that we would have been able to use some of that dry powder by now. But as Don has discussed, good opportunities for high-quality properties have just not materialized yet.Given that capital market conditions have remained strong over the past six months and high-quality REITs like ourselves have been able to readily access capital, don't be surprised that we utilize some available cash and lock in longer-term debt to retire all or a portion of our $250 million prepayable term loan, if an attractive opportunity presents itself. If we were to do this, please don't see it as a change in our acquisition expectations as we still have the untapped $300 million credit facility available until July 2011. With a deal like this could allow us to improve our already strong balance sheet by further limiting our upcoming debt maturities locking in longer-term debt to historically attractive levels, all while balancing the impact to earnings.With respect to guidance, much of my surprise, we were one of the few companies which established guidance at the end of the third quarter. And we're in an even smaller minority of companies which established guidance at a range above consensus expectations for the years [ph]. We are confident that the guidance we provided in November and are just as confident today as we affirm our FFO per share guidance of $3.80 to $3.88 for 2010. The assumptions in these expectations remain pretty much unchange from last quarter and include: Same-center property operating income, that's flat to modestly positive say, 1.5% including redevelopment. This includes the impact of our latest phase of Bethesda Row development, Hampden Lane, coming on late in the year. And continual progress with Linden Square and the Balsly [ph] as the former Roche Brothers' side of the project continues to stabilize.With limited redevelopment coming online in 2010, we'd expect the gap between our including and excluding redevelopment numbers to be narrower than they have been in the past. We're continuing to run the company very leanly, since we reduced our headcount by about 20% late in 2008. Although, you may see a little fluctuation between quarters, a run rate of about $5 million per quarter is good, as we continue our focus on managing costs to the organization. We'd expect lower interest costs in '10 versus 2009, reflecting lower levels of cash balances and lower associated debt balances as the capital markets have stabilized.And just to reminder, consistent with previous quarters, we have not included the impact of any acquisitions, including the impact of expensing acquisition-related costs, prior to accounting change, it became effective on January of 2009. These costs used to be capitalized in [Audio Gap] property. Our entire team is proud of our 2009 accomplishments, and we're geared up to provide a very solid 2010. We continue to run a very balance business strategy operating on the strength of our best-in-class portfolio. Before we turn the call over to your questions, I want to echo Don's sentiments, regarding Dawn's promotion to Chief Operating Officer. Dawn and I have worked side-by-side for almost 10 years and she's been a great business partner. Even [ph] I, look forward to introducing many of you to her at future investor events. I'm confident that you'll be just as impressed as our entire team is in her ability to elevate the role. With that, Anne, I'll turn the call over to question."

And I know I've been saying that for a while, but I'm more confident in saying that now because we have identified additional projects that have come up because retailers are consolidating and they're consolidating to the better locations. So I don't think we've announced yet where we are. For example, at Governor, have we? Have we put Governor on it? You'll see Governor Plaza being added to this, where there is about to be a pretty good deal being done. That wasn't there before. Laurel is a real. And we've got some and, that was again because of tendencies that wants to come into the marketplace and be in a more dominant place. That we're starting to see more and more. So I would expect that redevelopment pipeline to grow throughout 2010, certainly into 2011, and be one of the key sources of our growth over the next five or seven years."

Sellers have not really decided whether -- they show more interest, they're putting properties, non-fully marketed properties, they're talking to us and talking to others about selling, but they haven't made the formal decision to sell. And part of that is because they're trying to figure out in the marketplace, obviously what the right costs or what the right sales prices should be. When they go and fully market for good properties, there is a feeding frenzy. There is a lot of money on the side that's chasing it. And I think supply and demand still lurks in our business. And when there is a low supply of great stuff out there. And there's a lot of money sitting on the sidelines. I think that it is not the best situation on a buyers perspective to get a great value. That is kind of what we're starting to see, what we are seeing right now. So you look at publicly marketed deals, you can be pretty sure if it's good real estate, it came down to price and it came down to a pretty good price that people we're paying maybe more than they're ultimately going to earn from an IRR perspective."

First of all, there have been an awful lot of positive conversation from both our competitors and generally the Street about deals being done and isn't this a good thing. That there are tenants out there doing deals. That is absolutely true and it is in contrast to where we were in the beginning part of the year when you just couldn't get anybody to commit to doing anything. But when you get past that, Paul, and say, well, okay, I know I can fill this space. The decision gets a lot tougher, right? The decision gets down to, well, okay, am I going to fill the space with a very low-paying tenant, who is smart and here she is going to want to lock in for the longest possible term. Or do you want to balance that decision, maybe keep the vacancy out there a little a bit longer or even risk additional vacancy. Obviously, the better the portfolio you have, the more flexibility you have in those decisions. And that is really, Paul, what I'm trying to differentiate here. In other words, I know that if our objective was to get this portfolio back to 95% leased and occupied, that I believe we could do that. I believe we could do that in relatively short order 12, 15 months. I also believe that we would be locking in deals that would hurt the value of the shopping center for a very long time. And look at me, I have no choice, you do it. We've been hearing tons about HH Gregg, everybody brings up HH Gregg as a tenant that's expanding. Well, they are. These are smart guys and they're taking advantage of the market out there. It is a lower-end product, if you will, or choice that relies of lower rents. Now if you've got no choice, you want to do an HH Gregg deal, as we did, we did one that we started earlier in the year. That is one of the biggest things in our fourth quarter number. That's bringing down our roll over growth. I'm really glad we're not talking about doing seven, eight, 10 HH Gregg deals. And that's kind of an example of what I'm referring to. I would prefer to not cut those deals so quickly, but look at the alternatives that we have there and balance them. And that's why whether we're at 93 or 92 or somewhere in that kind of range, I think it's smarter for the long-term value of the portfolio. That's the balance, I'm trying to talk about."

And therefore, they're out now doing deals and we all feel good that there's deals out there being done. Well, once you kind of work through that a little bit, it becomes a little more normal.

I mean there's been precious few transactions in the markets where we do business. And I think it's very difficult to draw a lot of conclusions from the transactions that have happened. We're talking to a seller on- and off-market basis, I think we're doing that primarily because we have a better chance of getting the asset in a one-on-one conversation, as opposed to spending a bunch of time chasing deals at our broker where there's a feeding frenzy in multiple bids, which is clearly occurring right now for the more certain institutional quality shopping centers in the markets where we do business that are easy to underwrite, but that's just where we rather spend our time. Do we think we would ultimately get better pricing out of that? Maybe. I think it's just more certain in getting a deal done, and it focuses us on stuff that we want to own because we think over the long term, we'll be able to add value to that real estate, not simply because the asset happens to be on the market and list it for sale at the time.

The last comment I want to make on this is, I think it is the majority of shopping center real estate that is out there today that is more likely to have an NOI stream lower than the in-place NOI stream rather than higher than the NOI stream for the next five, seven, 10 years. And getting that is not real easy to do. And it does come down to us trying to figure out, us trying to only spend the time on those things, where we believe there is value to add over that timeframe as opposed to just 7.5%, grab a 7.5% current return.

Neiman Marcus is looking at putting, rolling out the last call concept in more of their core market as opposed to outlet centers. Saks outfit is talking about the same thing. Of course, Bloomingdale has made the same kind of announcement on the outlet concept. And I've even heard rumor about Lord & Taylor thinking about it.

And some of those conversations are very productive. And we're actually busy underwriting a lot of assets right now. And like Don mentioned in his comments, in his prepared remarks, some of those discussions are completely unproductive because people just have stuck in their mind this whole 5.5, 6.5 cap rate value for their assets and there hasn't been a enough transaction activity yet or they haven't thought through that enough to think that that pricing is probably not going to be achievable for a long, long time and forever. So it depends on the seller, depends on what their motivations are and where they are in their life, if you will. And it depends on whether they're private or whether they're an institution. I think the continued transaction activity will ultimately help the institutions that have been kind of sitting around on the sidelines waiting for values to stabilize, if you will, to make a sale decision.

My own personal opinion on that is it's going to increase to probably what we saw on the 2002, 2003, early 2004 time frame, if you look at the transaction volumes nationally.

There's no question that we have seen that sales fall off more in California than on the East Coast. That applies both to Street retail kind of stuff and the necessity-based stuff. So it's broader in terms of markets. When you get down to that other cut between traditional, necessity-based, grocery-anchored shopping centers and our other stuff, not nearly that level of difference. Certainly, somewhat worse in the lifestyle sector. But the lifestyle stuff that we own is largely established stuff that's been there. And to me, that really is the difference. If the retail -- no matter what the retail is, it has been up and operating for seven years, 10 years, longer that. They're established. They are doing better than the folks that are a year or two years or three years into their lives. That to me is the better cut more than anything else even above geography."

Well, 2009 is in the books and behind us. And despite what was undoubtedly the worst economic environment I've ever seen, I think that 2009 really was the year that Federal Realty business plan was validated as a great long-term approach to owning real estate in a public structure. It's a plan built on three simple premises: Restricting investment to only top-quality real estate; fiscal conservatism, both from a balance sheet and operating perspective; and balance, as it relates to reliance on acquisitions, development and joint venture complexity.From a cash flow perspective, we generated more cash from operating activities in recession-plagued 2009 than ever before in our history, 13% more than 2008, which itself was 7% more than 2007. I'll talk about 2009 results and what they may foreshadow about 2010 in just a minute, but first, I'd like to introduce the investor and analyst community to a partner of mine here at Federal for the last dozen years and its new Chief Operating Officer, Dawn Becker. There hasn't been COO per se at Federal since I carried that title in 2001, and I couldn't be happier than to officially promote Dawn to that role, effective immediately, a role she's effectively been doing for the last 18 months. Our senior team has been together now for about 10 years, and 2009 certainly tested its strength and its resolve. Each of our team members wanted Dawn recognized with this promotion. I'm really proud of that. Some of you may know her or know of her, but Dawn will be coming to the Citigroup conference in Florida next month and to the NAREIT Investor Conference in Chicago in June. So there'll certainly be opportunity to get to know her better in the months and the years ahead.Okay, let's talk about results and then our challenges and opportunities. FFO per share, excluding as we have all year, the litigation provision related to 350 Winchester Blvd. in San Jose, was $0.90 in the fourth quarter and $3.78 for the year, both down a bit from the comparable period last year, when reported numbers were $0.99 and $3.85, respectively. The entire year-over-year decline in both the quarter and the year is directly attributable to proactive financing and liquidity management of the balance sheet in an uncertain environment. We basically borrowed and raised equity in excess of our needs earlier last year, just in case. And as the capital markets became more stable, we repaid some of it, mildly earnings dilutive in the short term, conservative and balanced for the long term.On the leasing front, we continue to do just fine in terms of deal volume. You'll notice in the 8-K that we did 309 comparable deals for 1.2 million square feet in 2009 versus 300 deals for 1.2 million square feet in 2008, but with significantly-tougher economics. Rollover rent growth was a strong 10% in 2009, but pales in comparison to the 21% rollover rent growth in 2008. That's a trend that we very much expect to continue in 2010. This playing out just as we thought it would, and have been talking about for some time now. At the macro level, there's simply too much retail space for the demand today and in the near future. And so both existing and new prospective tenants really value being in the best locations, but given the plethora of choices they have, the economic leverage is all theirs in most situations.The exceptions remain, where a particular tenant or group of tenants wants or needs a location really badly, and is willing to underwrite strong sales and profitability. In those cases, our rent growth will be strong as it will be in cases where an old expiring lease that was significantly under market can be re-leased in a much higher rent. In the fourth quarter, Priscilla of Boston will be opening a new store at Santana Row is one example, as are a couple of bank rents renewal in great locations in the Washington suburbs. But overall, on a portfolio-wide basis, it's clear that we're running into a headwind of conservatively underwritten tenant sales that's making them unwilling to stretch on rent.Now obviously, these dynamics are industry-wide and it follows that the better quality real estate to Federal loans will fair better. That has been the case and I see no reason as to why it won't continue to be. It's why we've not had significant challenges keeping occupancy at relatively strong levels even though rent growth has tailed off. Our portfolio was 94.5% leased and 93.2% occupied at the end of '09. Both numbers slightly better than they were at the end of the third quarter, which in turn were about the same as they were at the end of the second quarter. Occupancy is stable. So as I said on last quarter's call, I wouldn't rule out modest reductions stocking [ph] fee in 2010. But suffice it to say, we feel confident of our ability to manage occupancy to a reasonable level.I really believe, however, that one of the toughest challenges facing all retail real estate companies these days involves the balance inherent in the difficult day-to-day leasing decisions. There are plenty of deals to do out there, that's not the issue. But while executing long-term leases with poor economic terms that create a short-term pop in earnings may feel good now, but destruction in value to the entire shopping center that last for the next 10 or 20 years of the lease term, surely won't feel very good when times are better. I know we've had to make some of those decisions and it's no fun. The trick is coming up with the appropriate balance between the short-term pick up and the long-term pain. Those 2009 leasing dynamics led to modest same center growth 1% and 1.6% in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2009, respectively, and all indications that we're in for a similar year in 2010. That's pretty high expectations, I know, in terms of these market conditions but that's who we are. So given these results in this backdrop, it's fair to add both what we're worried about and where our opportunities lie. I suspect that compared with our competitors, our worries are less significant and more manageable because of the quality of our real estate locations and the balance of our business plan as it relates to acquisitions of the past five years in new development. But we do have some level of exposure to the same type of issue as others, we still have an empty 60,000 square-foot office building over retail at Santana Row. That -- while activity has picked up greatly end of late, will be leased at far lower rents than pro forma and accordingly probably won't add a lot of value in the near term. We still have a potential great development project at Assembly Square in Boston, which everything is moving slower than planned, including IT as a construction start, resulting in more carrying costs that should lead into future profitability. And we still have the leasing headwind I discussed earlier, limiting increased core portfolio profitability.While we also have an extremely well-positioned balance sheet and presumably across the capital advantage over many other firms, both public and private on which to acquire from. At this point, we are clearly seeing more activity in terms of owners getting their heads around selling some very good and well-positioned retail real estate. We're working lots of leads and will continue to do so. The pricing remains high and sometimes unrealistically so. And as of yet, no deals that we really want are imminent. We'll remain patient, continue to focus on the blocking and tackling necessary in the core and stand ready to invest incremental capital on the right stuff for the right IRR. That's all I have for my prepared remarks right now, and I'll turn it over to Andy."

My comments are going to be brief this quarter, really focusing on our capital position and the assumptions of our guidance. Our long-term prudent balance sheet management, including the capital raising we did in '09, has positioned Trust well to run our core business and pursue additional growth opportunities through acquisitions and redevelopment. At the end of 2009, we're holding $135 million of cash. At the full $300 million of capacity available on our revolving credit facility, which is short-term funding, priced at LIBOR plus 42.5, no debt maturities for a year and no need to delever the balance sheet. With respect to acquisitions, I certainly expected that we would have been able to use some of that dry powder by now. But as Don has discussed, good opportunities for high-quality properties have just not materialized yet.Given that capital market conditions have remained strong over the past six months and high-quality REITs like ourselves have been able to readily access capital, don't be surprised that we utilize some available cash and lock in longer-term debt to retire all or a portion of our $250 million prepayable term loan, if an attractive opportunity presents itself. If we were to do this, please don't see it as a change in our acquisition expectations, as we still have the untapped $300 million credit facility available until July 2011. But a deal like this could allow us to improve our already-strong balance sheet by further limiting our upcoming debt maturities, locking in longer-term debt to historically-attractive levels, all while balancing the impact to earnings.With respect to guidance, much to my surprise, we were one of the few companies which established guidance at the end of the third quarter. And we're in an even smaller minority of companies which established guidance at a range above consensus expectations for the years [ph]. We are confident with the guidance we provided in November and are just as confident today, as we affirm our FFO per share guidance of $3.80 to $3.88 for 2010. The assumptions in these expectations remain pretty much unchanged from last quarter and include same-center property operating income that's flat to modestly positive, say 1.5%, including redevelopment. This includes the impact of our latest phase of Bethesda Row development, Hampden Lane, coming on late in the year and continual progress at Linden Square in Wellesley, as the former Roche Bros' side of the project continues to stabilize.With limited redevelopment coming online in 2010, we'd expect the gap between our including and excluding redevelopment numbers to be narrower than they have been in the past. We're continuing to run the company very leanly, since we reduced our headcount by about 20% late in 2008. Although you may see a little fluctuation between quarters, a run rate of about $5 million per quarter is good, as we continue our focus on managing costs to the organization. We'd expect lower interest costs in '10 versus 2009, reflecting lower levels of cash balances and lower associated debt balances, as the capital markets have stabilized.And just a reminder, consistent with previous quarters, we have not included the impact of any acquisitions, including the impact of expensing acquisition-related costs. Prior to accounting change that became effective on January of 2009, these costs used to be capitalized in [Audio Gap] property. Our entire team is proud of our 2009 accomplishments, and we're geared up to provide a very solid 2010. We continue to run a very balance business strategy, operating on the strength of our best-in-class portfolio. Before we turn the call over to your questions, I want to echo Don's sentiments regarding Dawn's promotion to Chief Operating Officer. Dawn and I have worked side-by-side for almost 10 years and she's been a great business partner. Gina and I look forward to introducing many of you to her at future investor events. I'm confident that you'll be just as impressed as our entire team is in her ability to elevate the role.  With that, Anne, I'll turn the call over to question."

You'll see Governor Plaza being added to this, where there is about to be a pretty good deal being done. That wasn't there before. Laurel is a real. And we've got some and, that was again because of tendencies that wants to come into the marketplace and be in a more dominant place. That we're starting to see more and more.

Sellers have not really decided whether -- they show more interest, they're putting properties, non-fully marketed properties, they're talking to us and talking to others about selling, but they haven't made the formal decision to sell. And part of that is because they're trying to figure out in the marketplace, obviously what the right costs or what the right sales prices should be. When they go and fully market for good properties, there is a feeding frenzy. There is a lot of money on the side that's chasing it. And I think supply and demand still lurks in our business. And when there is a low supply of great stuff out there. And there's a lot of money sitting on the sidelines. I think that it is not the best situation on a buyers perspective to get a great value. That is kind of what we're starting to see, what we are seeing right now. So you look at publicly marketed deals, you can be pretty sure if it's good real estate, it came down to price and it came down to a pretty good price that people we're paying maybe more than they're ultimately going to earn from an IRR perspective."

And what I do think is happening, Ross, is that sellers are getting their heads around a little bit what they're able to get.

First of all, there have been an awful lot of positive conversation from both our competitors and generally the Street about deals being done and isn't this a good thing. That there are tenants out there doing deals. That is absolutely true and it is in contrast to where we were in the beginning part of the year when you just couldn't get anybody to commit to doing anything. But when you get past that, Paul, and say, well, okay, I know I can fill this space. The decision gets a lot tougher, right? The decision gets down to, well, okay, am I going to fill the space with a very low-paying tenant, who is smart and here she is going to want to lock in for the longest possible term. Or do you want to balance that decision, maybe keep the vacancy out there a little a bit longer or even risk additional vacancy. Obviously, the better the portfolio you have, the more flexibility you have in those decisions. And that is really, Paul, what I'm trying to differentiate here. In other words, I know that if our objective was to get this portfolio back to 95% leased and occupied, that I believe we could do that. I believe we could do that in relatively short order 12, 15 months. I also believe that we would be locking in deals that would hurt the value of the shopping center for a very long time. And look at me, I have no choice, you do it. We've been hearing tons about HH Gregg, everybody brings up HH Gregg as a tenant that's expanding. Well, they are. These are smart guys and they're taking advantage of the market out there. It is a lower-end product, if you will, or choice that relies of lower rents. Now if you've got no choice, you want to do an HH Gregg deal, as we did, we did one that we started earlier in the year. That is one of the biggest things in our fourth quarter number. That's bringing down our roll over growth. I'm really glad we're not talking about doing seven, eight, 10 HH Gregg deals. And that's kind of an example of what I'm referring to. I would prefer to not cut those deals so quickly, but look at the alternatives that we have there and balance them. And that's why whether we're at 93 or 92 or somewhere in that kind of range, I think it's smarter for the long-term value of the portfolio. That's the balance, I'm trying to talk about."

Do we think we would ultimately get better pricing out of that? Maybe. I think it's just more certain in getting a deal done, and it focuses us on stuff that we want to own because we think over the long term, we'll be able to add value to that real estate, not simply because the asset happens to be on the market and list it for sale at the time.

The last comment I want to make on this is, I think it is the majority of shopping center real estate that is out there today that is more likely to have an NOI stream lower than the in-place NOI stream rather than higher than the NOI stream for the next five, seven, 10 years. And getting that is not real easy to do. And it does come down to us trying to figure out, us trying to only spend the time on those things, where we believe there is value to add over that timeframe as opposed to just 7.5%, grab a 7.5% current return.

Of course, Bloomingdale has made the same kind of announcement on the outlet concept. And I've even heard rumor about Lord & Taylor thinking about it.

I think if you turn the clock back 18 months or so or maybe a little bit longer when we were really in the thick of things. A lot of people just didn't want to talk at all, right, because nobody really knew where we were headed. And I think, clearly, the economy has kind of progressed past that point. I think the real estate capital markets have progressed past that point. And there have been a few transactions which help people to bracket values so people are more willing to engage in a discussion today than they were in, say, December of '08, right? And some of those conversations are very productive. And we're actually busy underwriting a lot of assets right now. And like Don mentioned in his comments, in his prepared remarks, some of those discussions are completely unproductive because people just have stuck in their mind this whole 5.5, 6.5 cap rate value for their assets and there hasn't been a enough transaction activity yet or they haven't thought through that enough to think that that pricing is probably not going to be achievable for a long, long time and forever. So it depends on the seller, depends on what their motivations are and where they are in their life, if you will. And it depends on whether they're private or whether they're an institution. I think the continued transaction activity will ultimately help the institutions that have been kind of sitting around on the sidelines waiting for values to stabilize, if you will, to make a sale decision. So we expect to see more institutional sellers going forward. And the private sellers, it's kind of more based on what's going on in their life with their property and maybe with the debt on their property. That's an individual discussion that's different every time you talk to a private owner."

My own personal opinion on that is it's going to increase to probably what we saw on the 2002, 2003, early 2004 time frame, if you look at the transaction volumes nationally.

There's no question that we have seen that sales fall off more in California than on the East Coast. That applies both to Street retail kind of stuff and the necessity-based stuff. So it's broader in terms of markets. When you get down to that other cut between traditional, necessity-based, grocery-anchored shopping centers and our other stuff, not nearly that level of difference. Certainly, somewhat worse in the lifestyle sector. But the lifestyle stuff that we own is largely established stuff that's been there. And to me, that really is the difference. If the retail -- no matter what the retail is, it has been up and operating for seven years, 10 years, longer that. They're established. They are doing better than the folks that are a year or two years or three years into their lives. That to me is the better cut more than anything else even above geography."

Well, 2009 is in the books and behind us. And despite what was undoubtedly the worst economic environment I've ever seen, I think that 2009 really was the year that Federal Realty business plan was validated as a great long-term approach to owning real estate in a public structure. It's a plan built on three simple premises: Restricting investment to only top-quality real estate; fiscal conservatism, both from a balance sheet and operating perspective; and balance, as it relates to reliance on acquisitions, development and joint venture complexity.From a cash flow perspective, we generated more cash from operating activities in recession-plagued 2009 than ever before in our history, 13% more than 2008, which itself was 7% more than 2007. I'll talk about 2009 results and what they may foreshadow about 2010 in just a minute, but first, I'd like to introduce the investor and analyst community to a partner of mine here at Federal for the last dozen years and its new Chief Operating Officer, Dawn Becker. There hasn't been COO per se at Federal since I carried that title in 2001, and I couldn't be happier than to officially promote Dawn to that role, effective immediately, a role she's effectively been doing for the last 18 months. Our senior team has been together now for about 10 years, and 2009 certainly tested its strength and its resolve. Each of our team members wanted Dawn recognized with this promotion. I'm really proud of that. Some of you may know her or know of her, but Dawn will be coming to the Citigroup conference in Florida next month and to the NAREIT Investor Conference in Chicago in June. So there'll certainly be opportunity to get to know her better in the months and the years ahead.Okay, let's talk about results and then our challenges and opportunities. FFO per share, excluding as we have all year, the litigation provision related to 350 Winchester Blvd. in San Jose, was $0.90 in the fourth quarter and $3.78 for the year, both down a bit from the comparable period last year, when reported numbers were $0.99 and $3.85, respectively. The entire year-over-year decline in both the quarter and the year is directly attributable to proactive financing and liquidity management of the balance sheet in an uncertain environment. We basically borrowed and raised equity in excess of our needs earlier last year, just in case. And as the capital markets became more stable, we repaid some of it, mildly earnings-dilutive in the short term, conservative and balanced for the long term.On the leasing front, we continue to do just fine in terms of deal volume. You'll notice in the 8-K that we did 309 comparable deals for 1.2 million square feet in 2009 versus 300 deals for 1.2 million square feet in 2008, but with significantly tougher economics. Rollover rent growth was a strong 10% in 2009, but pales in comparison to the 21% rollover rent growth in 2008. That's a trend that we very much expect to continue in 2010. This is playing out just as we thought it would and have been talking about for some time now. At the macro level, there's simply too much retail space for the demand today and in the near future. And so both existing and new prospective tenants really value being in the best locations, but given the plethora of choices they have, the economic leverage is all theirs in most situations.The exceptions remain, where a particular tenant or group of tenants wants or need a location really badly and is willing to underwrite strong sales and profitability. In those cases, our rent growth will be strong as it will be in cases where an old expiring lease that was significantly under market can be re-leased in a much higher rent. In the fourth quarter, Priscilla of Boston will be opening a new store at Santana Row is one example, as are a couple of bank branch renewals in great locations in the Washington suburbs. But overall, on a portfolio-wide basis, it's clear that we're running into a headwind of conservatively underwritten tenant sales that's making them unwilling to stretch on rent.Now obviously, these dynamics are industry-wide and it follows that the better quality real estate to Federal loans will fare better. That has been the case and I see no reason as to why it won't continue to be. It's why we've not had significant challenges keeping occupancy at relatively strong levels even though rent growth has tailed off. Our portfolio was 94.5% leased and 93.2% occupied at the end of '09. Both numbers are slightly better than they were at the end of the third quarter, which in turn were about the same as they were at the end of the second quarter. Occupancy is stable. But as I said on last quarter's call, I wouldn't rule out modest reductions to occupancy in 2010. But suffice it to say, we feel confident on our ability to manage occupancy to a reasonable level.I really believe, however, that one of the toughest challenges facing all retail real estate companies these days involves the balance inherent in the difficult day-to-day leasing decisions. There are plenty of deals to do out there, that's not the issue. But while executing long-term leases with poor economic terms that create a short-term pop in earnings may feel good now, the destruction in value to the entire shopping center that last for the next 10 or 20 years of the lease term surely won't feel very good when times are better. I know we've had to make some of those decisions, and it's no fun. The trick is coming up with the appropriate balance between the short-term pick up and the long-term pain. Those 2009 leasing dynamic led to modest same-center growth of 1% and 1.6% in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2009, respectively, and all indications that we're in for a similar year in 2010. That's pretty high expectations, I know, in terms of these market conditions but that's who we are. So given these results in this backdrop, it's fair to add both what we're worried about and where our opportunities lie. I suspect that compared with our competitors, our worries are less significant and more manageable because of the quality of our real estate locations and the balance of our business plan as it relates to acquisitions of the past five years in new development. But we do have some level of exposure to the same type of issue as others. We still have an empty 60,000 square-foot office building over retail at Santana Row. That, while activity has picked up greatly end of late, will be leased at far lower rents than pro forma and accordingly probably won't add a lot of value in the near term. We still have a potential great development projects at Assembly Square in Boston, which everything is moving slower than planned, including IT as a construction start, resulting in more carrying costs that should yield [ph] into future profitability. And we still have the leasing headwind I discussed earlier, limiting increased core portfolio profitability.Well, we also have an extremely well-positioned balance sheet and presumably a cost of capital advantage over many other firms, both public and private, on which to acquire from. To this point, we are clearly seeing more activity in terms of owners getting their heads around selling some very good and well-positioned retail real estate. We're working lots of leads and will continue to do so. The pricing remains high and sometimes unrealistically so. And as of yet, no deals that we really want are imminent. We'll remain patient, continue to focus on the blocking and tackling necessary in the core and stand ready to invest incremental capital on the right stuff for the right IRR. That's all I have for my prepared remarks right now, and I'll turn it over to Andy."

My comments are going to be brief this quarter, really focusing on our capital position and the assumptions of our guidance. Our long-term prudent balance sheet management, including the capital raising we did in '09, has positioned Trust well to run our core business and pursue additional growth opportunities through acquisitions and redevelopment. At the end of 2009, we're holding $135 million of cash. At the full $300 million of capacity available on our revolving credit facility, which is short-term funding, priced at LIBOR plus 42.5, no debt maturities for a year and no need to delever the balance sheet. With respect to acquisitions, I certainly expected that we would have been able to use some of that dry powder by now. But as Don has discussed, good opportunities for high-quality properties have just not materialized yet.Given that capital market conditions have remained strong over the past six months and high-quality REITs like ourselves have been able to readily access capital, don't be surprised that we utilize some available cash and lock in longer-term debt to retire all or a portion of our $250 million prepayable term loan, if an attractive opportunity presents itself. If we were to do this, please don't see it as a change in our acquisition expectations, as we still have the untapped $300 million credit facility available until July 2011. But a deal like this could allow us to improve our already-strong balance sheet by further limiting our upcoming debt maturities, locking in longer-term debt to historically-attractive levels, all while balancing the impact to earnings.With respect to guidance, much to my surprise, we were one of the few companies which established guidance at the end of the third quarter. And we're in an even smaller minority of companies which established guidance at a range above consensus expectations for the years [ph]. We are confident with the guidance we provided in November and are just as confident today, as we affirm our FFO per share guidance of $3.80 to $3.88 for 2010. The assumptions in these expectations remain pretty much unchanged from last quarter and include same-center property operating income that's flat to modestly positive, say 1.5%, including redevelopment. This includes the impact of our latest phase of Bethesda Row development, Hampden Lane, coming on late in the year and continual progress at Linden Square in Wellesley, as the former Roche Bros' side of the project continues to stabilize.With limited redevelopment coming online in 2010, we'd expect the gap between our including and excluding redevelopment numbers to be narrower than they have been in the past. We're continuing to run the company very leanly, since we reduced our headcount by about 20% late in 2008. Although you may see a little fluctuation between quarters, a run rate of about $5 million per quarter is good, as we continue our focus on managing costs to the organization. We'd expect lower interest costs in '10 versus 2009, reflecting lower levels of cash balances and lower associated debt balances, as the capital markets have stabilized.And just a reminder, consistent with previous quarters, we have not included the impact of any acquisitions, including the impact of expensing acquisition-related costs. Prior to accounting change that became effective on January of 2009, these costs used to be capitalized in [Audio Gap] property. Our entire team is proud of our 2009 accomplishments, and we're geared up to provide a very solid 2010. We continue to run a very balance business strategy, operating on the strength of our best-in-class portfolio. Before we turn the call over to your questions, I want to echo Don's sentiments regarding Dawn's promotion to Chief Operating Officer. Dawn and I have worked side-by-side for almost 10 years and she's been a great business partner. Gina and I look forward to introducing many of you to her at future investor events. I'm confident that you'll be just as impressed as our entire team is in her ability to elevate the role.  With that, Anne, I'll turn the call over to question."

And I know I've been saying that for a while, but I'm more confident in saying that now because we have identified additional projects that have come up because retailers are consolidating, and they're consolidating to the better locations. So I don't think we've announced yet where we are. For example, at Governor -- have we? Have we put Governor on it? You'll see Governor Plaza being added to this, where there is about to be a pretty good deal being done that wasn't there before. Laurel is a real, and we've got some -- and that was again because of tenants that wants to come in the marketplace and be in a more dominant place. That we're starting to see more and more.

Sellers have not really decided whether -- they've shown more interest, they're putting properties, non-fully marketed properties, they're talking to us and talking to others about selling, but they haven't made a formal decision to sell. And part of that is because they're trying to figure out in the marketplace, obviously, what the right costs or what the right sales prices should be. When they go and fully market for good properties, there is a feeding frenzy. There is a lot of money on the side that's chasing it. And I think supply and demand still lurks in our business. And when there is a low supply of great stuff out there and there's a lot of money sitting on the sidelines, I think that it is not the best situation from a buyer's perspective to get a great value. That is kind of what we're starting to see and what we are seeing right now.

First of all, there had been an awful lot of positive conversation from both our competitors and generally in the street about deals being done and isn't this a good thing, that there are tenants out there doing deals. That is absolutely true and it is in contrast to where we were in the beginning part of the year when you just couldn't get anybody to commit to doing anything. But when you get past that, Paul, and say, well, okay, I know I can fill the space. The decision gets a lot tougher, right? The decision gets down to, well, okay, am I going to fill the space with a very low-paying tenant, who is smart and here she is going to want to lock in for the longest possible term? Or do you want to balance that decision, maybe keep the vacancy out there a little a bit longer or even risk additional vacancy? Obviously, the better the portfolio you have, the more flexibility you have in those decisions. And that is really, Paul, what I'm trying to differentiate here. In other words, I know that if our objective was to get this portfolio back to 95% leased and occupied, that I believe we could do that. I believe we could do that in relatively short order 12, 15 months. I also believe that we would be locking in deals that would hurt the value of the shopping center for a very long time. And look at me, I have no choice, you do it. We've been hearing tons about hhgregg, everybody brings up hhgregg as a tenant that's expanding. Well, they are. These are smart guys, and they're taking advantage of the market out there. It is a lower-end product, if you will, or choice that relies of lower rents. Now if you've got no choice, you want to do an hhgregg deal, as we did, we did one that we started earlier in the year. That is one of the biggest things in our fourth quarter number that's bringing down our rollover growth. I'm really glad we're not talking about doing seven, eight, 10 hhgregg deals. And that's kind of an example of what I'm referring to. I would prefer to not cut those deals so quickly, but look at the alternatives that we have there and balance them. And that's why whether we're at 93 or 92 or somewhere in that kind of range, I think it's smarter for the long-term value of the portfolio. That's the balance I'm trying to talk about."

Do we think we would ultimately get better pricing out of that? Maybe. I think it's just more certain in getting a deal done and it focuses us on stuff that we want to own because we think over the long term, we'll be able to add value to that real estate, not simply because the asset happens to be on the market and listed for sale at the time.

But that is the range that we are talking about trying to create value from. And I think that puts in an appropriate level of cushion, if you will, to make sure that we're making the right decision."

And I think it is very possibly an overall mix. I do think on small shops, you've got tenants who are sitting there trying their best to work through a tough time. I think, as I said in the last two years, I think small shop tenants tend to hold on longer than most people think. I think they've got more flexibility in their businesses to not take pay themselves, et cetera and things like that, and so they do tend to hold on. I do think to the extent we don't see increased sales and increased consumer shopping habits consistently this year, that some of them aren't going to be able to make it. And so I think there's risk there. On the big stuff, there's always risk. I mean how long have we've been talking about borders. I don't know, right?

It was certainly a much busier event than I think most people anticipated, especially with the weather we just recently had here in the Mid-Atlantic region. And so I think overall, it was a positive perception about what was going on. Clearly, the one trend that I walk away from that's amazing to me is the focus on the department stores and how they're trying to figure out how they're going to move forward and do business in trying to steal feather from Nordstrom or the Nordstrom company in that concept. Neiman Marcus is looking at putting, rolling out the last call concept in more of their core market as opposed to outlet centers. Saks outfit is talking about the same thing. Of course, Bloomingdale's has made the same kind of announcement on the outlet concept. And I've even heard rumor about Lord & Taylor is thinking about it. So the one takeaway I have is just that interesting, I think they're all going to start looking at more traditional shopping centers that might align very well with Federal Realty and our ability to add something more unique to our portfolio that we haven't been able to do in the past."

A lot of people just didn't want to talk at all, right, because nobody really knew where we were headed. And I think, clearly, the economy has kind of progressed past that point. I think the real estate capital markets have progressed past that point. And there have been a few transactions, which help people to bracket values. So people are more willing to engage in a discussion today than they were in, say, in December of '08, right? And some of those conversations are very productive, and we're actually busy underwriting a lot of assets right now. And like Don mentioned in his comments, in his prepared remarks, some of those discussions are completely unproductive because people just have stuck in their mind this whole 5 1/2, 6 1/2 cap rate value for their asset and there hasn't been enough transaction activity yet or they haven't thought through that enough to think that that pricing is probably not going to be achievable for a long, long time and forever. So it depends on the seller, depends on what their motivations are and where they are in their life, if you will, and it depends on whether they're private or whether they're an institution. I think the continued transaction activity will ultimately help the institutions that have been kind of sitting around on the sidelines waiting for values to stabilize, if you will, to make a sale decision. So we expect to see more institutional sellers going forward. And the private sellers, it's kind of more based on what's going on in their kind of life with their property and maybe with the debt on their property.

My own personal opinion on that is it's going to increase to probably what we saw on the 2002, 2003, early 2004 time frame, if you look at the transaction volumes kind of nationally, not at the levels that we saw 2005 to early 2007, which were way in excess of any sort of transaction volume that the markets have ever witnessed before.

When you get down to that other cut between kind of traditional necessity-based grocery-anchored shopping centers and our other stuff, not nearly that level of difference. Certainly, somewhat worse in the lifestyle sector. But the lifestyle stuff that we own is largely established stuff that's been there. And to me, that really is the difference.

We got a call couple of weeks ago from IKEA that said, ""You know what? We're not going to start building a big blue and yellow building right now because the economy stinks."" I guess I shouldn't be surprised by that. But delays in development are terrible things. And so the idea of having them delay a year or two or whatever they're going to delay, we don't really have any key to that, add more carry to the project. I do think from a valuation perspective, I kind of said this historically. I really want to make sure -- don't count on Assembly Square being a big value add for the future. I hope it will be, and we'll try like crazy to get it there. But delays are not good. That's kind of where we are.

These and other members of our management team are available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. Our first quarter 2010 supplemental disclosure package provides a significant amount of valuable information with respect to the Trusts' operating and financial performance. The document is currently available on our website.
Certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information, as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results. Although Federal Realty believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty's future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from the information contained in our forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that these expectations will be attained. Risks inherent in these assumptions include, but are not limited to, future economic conditions, including interest rates, real estate conditions and the risks and costs of construction. The earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued yesterday, our annual report filed on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. I'll now turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our first quarter results. Don?"

Good morning, everyone. We had a very solid first quarter and it just couldn't be any clearer that better-located, higher-quality retail properties are the grouping of choice these days for most retailers, even if it costs some more to get there. Every retailer that we talked to and nearly every non-real estate business in the country is more focused than ever on finding new ways to be profitable, and that newfound openness is allowing Federal to build relationships with tenants that historically wouldn't consider our various property types. Too early to tell whether we'd be able to meaningfully create demand from retailers new to us, but we're hopeful, based on initial discussions. 
This is an important point, because as we've been talking about for many quarters now, there's just too much retail supply and not enough demand nationally, and that's certainly manifesting itself in the form of lower rents and more downtime. Increasing demand by expanding the playing field is critical in more profitable deals, not just more deals. One of the reasons that I'm more bullish about the rest of the year and next year that I had been, despite the fact that many obstacles still exist in our fundamental business, and that acquisitions so far generally remain too expensive to make any money from.
Let's dissect the quarter a bit. The appropriate operational comparison for FFO was $0.94 in the first quarter of 2010, compared with $0.99 for the first quarter of 2009. And as another point of reference, $0.93 in the first quarter of '08. The $0.05 reduction from last year is more than completely due to higher interest rate caused by rate, not volume, as we work to extend the maturity of our entire debt portfolio. It couldn't move, I think, you would agree, given the likely rise in interest rates to come over time. Andy will go into more of that later. 
The bigger point that I'm trying to make though, is that this portfolio continue to generate higher operating earnings from our properties throughout this unprecedented recession of the last two years, despite lower occupancy, higher bad debt expense and unexpected rent relief. No larger impaired asset charges, no one unintended consequences from various joint venture agreements, no large severance or  restructuring charges. If we were ever tempted to move down the quality spectrum to pick up short-term yield, these results should serve as an important wake-up call that such a strategy is a short-term one. I remain convinced that acquiring a property could great exactly zero value. It's what happens to it over time that determines whether you created or destroyed value.
On the leasing front, the first quarter was a good one. We did 66 comparable deals at an average rent of $29.19, 16% more than the $25.08 that the previous tenant in that space is paying. As has been the case over the past few quarters, a few renewals of old expiring leases, both anchor and small shop offset much more pedestrian results elsewhere. A couple of market-rate options for banks at our Florida properties were renewed at big increases, as was Toys ""R"" Us and an old lease at Huntington Shopping Center on Long Island. Those renewals were among the largest drivers of the strong lease rollover rate. 
In addition, we signed a new deal with Dick's Sporting Goods in Glen Burnie, Maryland, as they relocated from a weaker location to act as the centerpiece of our redevelopment of Governor Plaza. Lots of tenant improvement dollars are part of that deal, which are included in our estimated returns and on the lease rollover summary. This a great deal though for both Federal and Dick's.
In terms of same set of property income growth, we reported a strong 2.9%, excluding the impact of redevelopment and 5.7% including redevelopment. Before you get excited about the 5.7%, you shouldn't, since it's impacted by the acceleration of the unamortized piece of termination fee from Home Depot at Flourtown Shopping Center that has been expected to be recorded throughout the year. It's really just timing. Even so, 3.1% growth without that impact is still very strong and benefits from easy comparisons over last year when bad debt expense was extremely high. 
Our earlier guidance of minus same store growth, I think Andy has 1% to 1½% in his model, remains unchanged for the full year. The year-over-year comparisons get much tougher for the balance of the year. 
Physical occupancy rose a bit during the quarter from 93.2% at the end of last year to 93.5% at March 31, even though the percentage leased dropped a bit to 94.1%. Owing from large bankruptcies that we don't see happening at this point, both the percentage leased and the percentage occupied, should remain fairly stable for the balance of the year. Before I turn it over to Andy, let me just touch on some development progress we're making at Santana Row. 
First, we signed our first 10-year deal for a full-floor user at 300 Santana Row, the office of retail building that we built at the corner of Stevens Creek Boulevard and the Row. We signed at least at strong economics relative to the market, but we're pretty close to a deal with a strong well-known national restaurant chain for the ground floor. We still got three floors of office to lease, but we're encouraged by both the deals and by the positive momentum that we're starting to see in the Silicon Valley office market. 
Secondly, we've just broken ground on a stand-alone 109-unit residential building at the property for $35 million, which we intend to lease as real units for a number of years and then likely sell as condominiums as dictated by the housing market. We hope to replicate the performance of the 200-loft apartment at Santana Row that we condo-ed several years back and expect an IRR well into the double digits if and when the sales are completed. 
Here in Maryland, we turned over the newly constructed building on Woodmont Avenue in Bethesda to Equinox, for opening later this year. That building is nearly 100% leased and was built on time and on budget. Jeff Berkes will be available to talk more about acquisition prospects when we open up the lines to your questions, but the bottom line remains, no deals are imminent, but the acquisition group is busier than they've been in quite some time. 
And finally, we got some great news from the judge in Arlington County, Virginia, who ruled in our favor in a lawsuit, in which we and our residential partner Post Properties sued Vornado for failing to honor our right of first offer on the land on the Pentagon Row. The judge found in our favor and ordered Vornado to sell us that land at the price they allocated to the parcel in two transactions in 2005 and 2007. We expect Vornado to appeal, but we also expect to prevail. And we impose we'll hopefully own this fee on Pentagon Row within a year, at a value that will be extremely accretive to earnings. 
I'll now turn it over to Andy, and look forward to seeing you all, at either ICSB in Las Vegas later this month, or in at maybe Chicago in early June. Andy?"

Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'm going to review our financing activity for the first quarter.

This morning, I'm going to review our financing activity for the first quarter. I'll discuss our current financial position and then go over our guidance assumptions, which are pretty much unchanged from last quarter, before turning the call over to your questions. 
On our last call in February, I stated, we may take advantage of the improving capital markets at that time, and utilized $135 million of cash at year end to lock in longer-term debt and retire our term loan. In early March, we did exactly that, as we issued $150 million of unsecured 5.9% 10-year notes, and utilized related the proceeds, along with cash on hand to fully retire the $250 million outstanding balance on our term loan, which is set to mature in July 2011. While we did not have a prepayment penalty associated with the pay-off of our term loan, we did have to write off $2.8 million of unamortized debt fees. This expense was partially offset by the $2.3 million of income recognized in the quarter from the acceleration of The Home Depot lease termination fee at Flourtown that Don spoke about in his remarks. 
As a result of our capital market transactions throughout 2009 and into 2010 and our long-term disciplined approach to capital, our balance sheet is really in great shape, highlighted by: No debt maturities in 2010 and only $112 million of maturities in 2011; an extension of our weighted average remaining debt term by one full year to 5.7 years at March 31, 2010, compared to 4.7 years at March 31, 2009; leverage of approximately 40% as measured by debt to our low historical undepreciated asset bases; net-to-total-market capitalization of around 25%; a debt to EBITDA ratio of around 5x and a fixed charge coverage ratio in the neighborhood of 3x. 
A strong balance sheet, untapped $300 million revolving credit facility and the advantage of having a lower cost of capital within both our public and private peers will serve us well as we seek to acquire high-quality assets in our core markets. As Don said, Jeff's available to give you a little more color on the transactions environment during Q&A.
Finally, with the first three months of the year behind us and a bit more clarity on the rest of the year, we've increased our 2010 FFO per share guidance to a range of $3.82 to $3.89. The assumptions in this guidance are largely unchanged from last quarter, but include full year same center property income growth of around 1½%, including redevelopment, unchanged from last quarter. Yes, the full year growth rate is lower than our same center growth reported in the first quarter are resulting from tougher comps for the remainder of 2010. 
Lower interest costs for the full year of 2010 versus 2009 totaling around $7 million to $8 million in interest savings, including the fees and costs associated with the early pay-off of our term loan in March, largely resulting from eliminating the excess cash that we were holding over the past nine months, reflected in the dramatic improvement in capital market conditions. 
Finally, as always, we've not included the impact of any acquisitions in our guidance. We feel confident going to the second quarter of the year that 2010 will be another solid year for Federal Realty. We continue to run a very balanced business strategy, operating on the strength of our best-in-class property portfolio, while prudently evaluating opportunities for growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to your questions. Ahmed, if we can start polling for questions."

And sellers are a lot more willing to engage in discussions about parting with their property today than they were two, three, four, five months ago. And I think, I attribute that to a couple of things. One is some transactions have happened, and as we've talked about on past calls, I think, that's very good for the market. That gives sellers another's confidence with respect to bringing their property to the market, and more transactions that happen, the better, and that momentum kind of builds on it. So we're starting to see that now. Clearly, the fact that there's some clarity in an economic recovery or some early signs of an economic recovery, I think, are making it easier for people to make a sell decision. And then finally, the availability of mortgage debt capital is much greater than it was three, six, nine, certainly 12 months ago, and that's making a lot easier for sellers to get their heads around bringing their property to market now. So the momentum is really favorable on the activities picked up significantly. And we're busy underwriting a lot of stuff right now, most of which were in direct conversations with sellers on as opposed to poorly marketed properties. But the trend is good."

The one other question, I think, we're talking about with respect to box rents, one of the issues with sellers who were selling shopping centers with boxes in them is that what we're finding is that many sellers have really not come to grips with the notion that the $22, $24, $26 a foot in-place rents from existing boxes are not able to replicate it, to the extent those boxes go away. And so those kind of box centers, particularly, which have great income stream today and would be bought at terrific cap rates today, the problem is we could never underwrite those at growing and aligning streams because those box change, there's no question. The box rents are significantly below many of the in-place rents that are there. So that's another complicating factor when you talk about cap rates."

Now before you run out and put $75 million in every model for the next five years that way, that is a key part of being able to add value in shopping center, so it's always going to be a key part of our business plan. Acquisitions are far more opportunistic and you may see a year where we're doing $400 million or $500 million and in other year where we do none, and that will continue there.

And the people that own those kinds of properties know they're good properties and there's always work to do to close that gap. And as Don mentioned, I mean one of the impediments that's maybe new to where we are in the cycle right now is, I think the box leasing environment was impacted maybe indefinitely by the recession. And there are still a lot of owners that don't understand the new dynamics of box leasing today. So when those centers when we have a box that maybe is not doing or a box tenant, that maybe is not doing the kind of sales that we'd like to see or has a near-term lease expiration, or some other opportunity to come back and take a whack at the rent that they're currently paying, that's creating a lot of the gap between what we'd like to pay for an asset right now and what the seller thinks it's worth."

Good morning, everyone. We had a very solid first quarter and it just couldn't be any clearer that better-located, higher-quality retail properties are the grouping of choice these days for most retailers, even if it costs some more to get there. Every retailer that we talked to and nearly every non-real estate business in the country is more focused than ever on finding new ways to be profitable, and that newfound openness is allowing Federal to build relationships with tenants that historically wouldn't consider our various property types. Too early to tell whether we'd be able to meaningfully create demand from retailers new to us, but we're hopeful, based on initial discussions. 
This is an important point, because as we've been talking about for many quarters now, there's just too much retail supply and not enough demand nationally, and that's certainly manifesting itself in the form of lower rents and more downtime. Increasing demand by expanding the playing field is critical in more profitable deals, not just more deals. One of the reasons that I'm more bullish about the rest of the year and next year that I had been, despite the fact that many obstacles still exist in our fundamental business, and that acquisitions so far generally remain too expensive to make any money from.
Let's dissect the quarter a bit. The appropriate operational comparison for FFO was $0.94 in the first quarter of 2010, compared with $0.99 for the first quarter of 2009. And as another point of reference, $0.93 in the first quarter of '08. The $0.05 reduction from last year is more than completely due to higher interest rate caused by rate, not volume, as we work to extend the maturity of our entire debt portfolio. It couldn't move, I think, you would agree, given the likely rise in interest rates to come over time. Andy will go into more of that later. 
The bigger point that I'm trying to make though, is that this portfolio continue to generate higher operating earnings from our properties throughout this unprecedented recession of the last two years, despite lower occupancy, higher bad debt expense and unexpected rent relief. No larger impaired asset charges, no one unintended consequences from various joint venture agreements, no large severance or  restructuring charges. If we were ever tempted to move down the quality spectrum to pick up short-term yield, these results should serve as an important wake-up call that such a strategy is a short-term one. I remain convinced that acquiring a property could great exactly zero value. It's what happens to it over time that determines whether you created or destroyed value.
On the leasing front, the first quarter was a good one. We did 66 comparable deals at an average rent of $29.19, 16% more than the $25.08 that the previous tenant in that space is paying. As has been the case over the past few quarters, a few renewals of old expiring leases, both anchor and small shop offset much more pedestrian results elsewhere. A couple of market-rate options for banks at our Florida properties were renewed at big increases, as was Toys ""R"" Us and an old lease at Huntington Shopping Center on Long Island. Those renewals were among the largest drivers of the strong lease rollover rate. 
In addition, we signed a new deal with Dick's Sporting Goods in Glen Burnie, Maryland, as they relocated from a weaker location to act as the centerpiece of our redevelopment of Governor Plaza. Lots of tenant improvement dollars are part of that deal, which are included in our estimated returns and on the lease rollover summary. This a great deal though for both Federal and Dick's.
In terms of same set of property income growth, we reported a strong 2.9%, excluding the impact of redevelopment and 5.7% including redevelopment. Before you get excited about the 5.7%, you shouldn't, since it's impacted by the acceleration of the unamortized piece of termination fee from Home Depot at Flourtown Shopping Center that has been expected to be recorded throughout the year. It's really just timing. Even so, 3.1% growth without that impact is still very strong and benefits from easy comparisons over last year when bad debt expense was extremely high. 
Our earlier guidance of minus same store growth, I think Andy has 1% to 1½% in his model, remains unchanged for the full year. The year-over-year comparisons get much tougher for the balance of the year. 
Physical occupancy rose a bit during the quarter from 93.2% at the end of last year to 93.5% at March 31, even though the percentage leased dropped a bit to 94.1%. Owing from large bankruptcies that we don't see happening at this point, both the percentage leased and the percentage occupied, should remain fairly stable for the balance of the year. Before I turn it over to Andy, let me just touch on some development progress we're making at Santana Row. 
First, we signed our first 10-year deal for a full-floor user at 300 Santana Row, the office of retail building that we built at the corner of Stevens Creek Boulevard and the Row. We signed at least at strong economics relative to the market, but we're pretty close to a deal with a strong well-known national restaurant chain for the ground floor. We still got three floors of office to lease, but we're encouraged by both the deals and by the positive momentum that we're starting to see in the Silicon Valley office market. 
Secondly, we've just broken ground on a stand-alone 109-unit residential building at the property for $35 million, which we intend to lease as real units for a number of years and then likely sell as condominiums as dictated by the housing market. We hope to replicate the performance of the 200-loft apartment at Santana Row that we condo-ed several years back and expect an IRR well into the double digits if and when the sales are completed. 
Here in Maryland, we turned over the newly constructed building on Woodmont Avenue in Bethesda to Equinox, for opening later this year. That building is nearly 100% leased and was built on time and on budget. Jeff Berkes will be available to talk more about acquisition prospects when we open up the lines to your questions, but the bottom line remains, no deals are imminent, but the acquisition group is busier than they've been in quite some time. 
And finally, we got some great news from the judge in Arlington County, Virginia, who ruled in our favor in a lawsuit, in which we and our residential partner Post Properties sued Vornado for failing to honor our right of first offer on the land on the Pentagon Row. The judge found in our favor and ordered Vornado to sell us that land at the price they allocated to the parcel in two transactions in 2005 and 2007. We expect Vornado to appeal, but we also expect to prevail. And we impose we'll hopefully own this fee on Pentagon Row within a year, at a value that will be extremely accretive to earnings. 
I'll now turn it over to Andy, and look forward to seeing you all, at either ICSB in Las Vegas later this month, or in at maybe Chicago in early June. Andy?"

Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'm going to review our financing activity for the first quarter.

This morning, I'm going to review our financing activity for the first quarter. I'll discuss our current financial position and then go over our guidance assumptions, which are pretty much unchanged from last quarter, before turning the call over to your questions. 
On our last call in February, I stated, we may take advantage of the improving capital markets at that time, and utilized $135 million of cash at year end to lock in longer-term debt and retire our term loan. In early March, we did exactly that, as we issued $150 million of unsecured 5.9% 10-year notes, and utilized related the proceeds, along with cash on hand to fully retire the $250 million outstanding balance on our term loan, which is set to mature in July 2011. While we did not have a prepayment penalty associated with the pay-off of our term loan, we did have to write off $2.8 million of unamortized debt fees. This expense was partially offset by the $2.3 million of income recognized in the quarter from the acceleration of The Home Depot lease termination fee at Flourtown that Don spoke about in his remarks. 
As a result of our capital market transactions throughout 2009 and into 2010 and our long-term disciplined approach to capital, our balance sheet is really in great shape, highlighted by: No debt maturities in 2010 and only $112 million of maturities in 2011; an extension of our weighted average remaining debt term by one full year to 5.7 years at March 31, 2010, compared to 4.7 years at March 31, 2009; leverage of approximately 40% as measured by debt to our low historical undepreciated asset bases; net-to-total-market capitalization of around 25%; a debt to EBITDA ratio of around 5x and a fixed charge coverage ratio in the neighborhood of 3x. 
A strong balance sheet, untapped $300 million revolving credit facility and the advantage of having a lower cost of capital within both our public and private peers will serve us well as we seek to acquire high-quality assets in our core markets. As Don said, Jeff's available to give you a little more color on the transactions environment during Q&A.
Finally, with the first three months of the year behind us and a bit more clarity on the rest of the year, we've increased our 2010 FFO per share guidance to a range of $3.82 to $3.89. The assumptions in this guidance are largely unchanged from last quarter, but include full year same center property income growth of around 1½%, including redevelopment, unchanged from last quarter. Yes, the full year growth rate is lower than our same center growth reported in the first quarter are resulting from tougher comps for the remainder of 2010. 
Lower interest costs for the full year of 2010 versus 2009 totaling around $7 million to $8 million in interest savings, including the fees and costs associated with the early pay-off of our term loan in March, largely resulting from eliminating the excess cash that we were holding over the past nine months, reflected in the dramatic improvement in capital market conditions. 
Finally, as always, we've not included the impact of any acquisitions in our guidance. We feel confident going to the second quarter of the year that 2010 will be another solid year for Federal Realty. We continue to run a very balanced business strategy, operating on the strength of our best-in-class property portfolio, while prudently evaluating opportunities for growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to your questions. Ahmed, if we can start polling for questions."

But I do think, there's a big change happening in terms of sellers putting properties out there, really considering selling, and I do think we'll be able to accomplish it. I think, you should expect to see an acquisition or two this year and then more next. And then maybe I'll just turn it over to Jeff at this point.

And I think, there's been a clear sentiment shift in the last two, three, four, five months. And sellers are a lot more willing to engage in discussions about parting with their property today than they were two, three, four, five months ago. And I think, I attribute that to a couple of things. One is some transactions have happened, and as we've talked about on past calls, I think, that's very good for the market. That gives sellers another's confidence with respect to bringing their property to the market, and more transactions that happen, the better, and that momentum kind of builds on it. So we're starting to see that now. Clearly, the fact that there's some clarity in an economic recovery or some early signs of an economic recovery, I think, are making it easier for people to make a sell decision. And then finally, the availability of mortgage debt capital is much greater than it was three, six, nine, certainly 12 months ago, and that's making a lot easier for sellers to get their heads around bringing their property to market now. So the momentum is really favorable on the activities picked up significantly. And we're busy underwriting a lot of stuff right now, most of which were in direct conversations with sellers on as opposed to poorly marketed properties. But the trend is good."

Remember that since the last period of time, when there were significant amount of acquisitions out there, the accounting rules have changed. And so virtually, all your costs associated with going after that acquisition are now going to be expensed but not capitalized in some projects. So I think, there'll very few high-quality properties that are purchased that are accretive in the first year, for two reasons. Not only because of the higher volumes, values which hammer down cap rates, but also because of the expensing of the initial cost of getting the acquisition. But we look at this stuff. We have and will continue to look at this stuff on an IRR basis. Since coming out of this recession, we'd love to be able to increase the size of the platform of great quality real estate."

And so those kind of box centers, particularly, which have great income stream today and would be bought at terrific cap rates today, the problem is we could never underwrite those at growing and aligning streams because those box change, there's no question. The box rents are significantly below many of the in-place rents that are there. So that's another complicating factor when you talk about cap rates."

I just looked at the first quarter sales stuff for a small shop and they're not going down anymore. Now the comparisons are not all that hard from first quarter of '09 versus first quarter of '10. But still, there has been a bottoming and the most important psychological thing of that bottoming is even those mom and pops now, who have now gotten comfortable or used to a lower sales level are in larger and larger numbers, not thinking about giving up the shift, but rather how they can start improving and growing again.

Good morning, everyone. We had a very solid first quarter and it just couldn't be any clearer that better-located, higher-quality retail properties are the grouping of choice these days for most retailers, even if it costs them more to get there. Every retailer that we talked to and nearly every non-real estate business in the country is more focused than ever on finding new ways to be profitable, and that newfound openness is allowing Federal to build relationships with tenants that historically wouldn't consider our various property types. Too early to tell whether we'd be able to meaningfully create demand from retailers new to us, but we're hopeful, based on initial discussions. 
This is an important point, because as we've been talking about for many quarters now, there's just too much retail supply and not enough demand nationally, and that's certainly manifesting itself in the form of lower rents and more downtime. Increasing demand by expanding the playing field is critical in more profitable deals, not just more deals. One of the reasons that I'm more bullish about the rest of the year and next year than I had been, despite the fact that many obstacles still exist in our fundamental business, and that acquisitions so far generally remain too expensive to make any money from.
Let's dissect the quarter a bit. The appropriate operational comparison for FFO was $0.94 in the first quarter of 2010 compared with $0.99 for the first quarter of 2009. And as another point of reference, $0.93 in the first quarter of '08. The $0.05 reduction from last year is more than completely due to higher interest rate caused by rate, not volume, as we work to extend the maturity of our entire debt portfolio. Prudent move, I think, you would agree, given the likely rise in interest rates to come over time. Andy will go into more of that later. 
The bigger point that I'm trying to make though, is that this portfolio continue to generate higher operating earnings from our properties throughout this unprecedented recession of the last two years, despite lower occupancy, higher bad debt expense and unexpected rent relief. No large impaired asset charges, no unintended consequences from various joint venture agreements, no large severance or  restructuring charges. If we were ever tempted to move down the quality spectrum to pick up short-term yield, these results should serve as an important wake-up call that such a strategy is a short-term one. I remain convinced that acquiring a property could create exactly zero value. It's what happens to it over time that determines whether you created or destroyed value.
On the leasing front, the first quarter was a good one. We did 66 comparable deals at an average rent of $29.19, 16% more than the $25.08 that the previous tenant in that space is paying. As has been the case over the past few quarters, a few renewals of old expiring leases, both anchor and small shop, offset much more pedestrian results elsewhere. A couple of market-rate options for banks at our Florida properties were renewed at big increases, as was Toys ""R"" Us and an old lease at Huntington Shopping Center on Long Island. Those renewals were among the largest drivers of the strong lease rollover rate. 
In addition, we signed a new deal with Dick's Sporting Goods in Glen Burnie, Maryland, as they relocated from a weaker location to act as the centerpiece of our redevelopment of Governor Plaza. Lots of tenant improvement dollars are part of that deal, which are included in our estimated returns and on the lease rollover summary. This a great deal though for both Federal and Dick's.
In terms of same set of property income growth, we reported a strong 2.9%, excluding the impact of redevelopments and 5.7% including redevelopments. Before you get excited about the 5.7%, you shouldn't, since it's impacted by the acceleration of the unamortized piece of termination fee from Home Depot at Flourtown Shopping Center that had been expected to be recorded throughout the year. It's really just timing. Even so, 3.1% growth without that impact is still very strong and benefits from easy comparisons over last year when bad debt expense was extremely high. 
Our earlier guidance of minus same-store growth, I think Andy has 1% to 1½% in the model, remains unchanged for the full year. The year-over-year comparisons get much tougher for the balance of the year. 
Physical occupancy rose a bit during the quarter from 93.2% at the end of last year to 93.5% at March 31, even though the percentage leased dropped a bit to 94.1%. Barring some large bankruptcies that we don't see happening at this point, both the percentage leased and the percentage occupied, should remain fairly stable for the balance of the year. Before I turn it over to Andy, let me just touch on some development progress we're making at Santana Row. 
First, we signed our first 10-year deal for a full-floor user at 300 Santana Row, the office of a retail building that we built at the corner of Stevens Creek Boulevard and the Row. We signed that lease at strong economics relative to the market, but we're pretty close to a deal with a strong well-known national restaurant chain for the ground floor. We still got three floors of office to lease, but we're encouraged by both those deals and by the positive momentum that we're starting to see in the Silicon Valley office market. 
Secondly, we've just broken ground on a stand-alone 109-unit residential building at the property for $35 million, which we intend to lease as real units for a number of years and then likely sell as condominiums as dictated by the housing market. We hope to replicate the performance of the 200-loft apartment at Santana Row that we condo-ed several years back and expect an IRR well into the double digits if and when the sales are completed. 
Here in Maryland, we turned over the newly constructed building on Woodmont Avenue in Bethesda to Equinox, for opening later this year. That building is nearly 100% leased and was built on time and on budget. Jeff Berkes will be available to talk more about acquisition prospects when we open up the lines to your questions, but the bottom line remains, no deals are imminent, but the acquisition group is busier than they've been in quite some time. 
And finally, we got some great news from the judge in Arlington County, Virginia, who ruled in our favor in a lawsuit, in which we and our residential partner Post Properties sued Vornado for failing to honor our right of first offer on the land under Pentagon Row. The judge found in our favor and ordered Vornado to sell us that land at the price they allocated to the parcel in two transactions in 2005 and 2007. We expect Vornado to appeal, but we also expect to prevail. And we impose we'll hopefully own this fee on Pentagon Row within a year at a value that will be extremely accretive to earnings. 
I'll now turn it over to Andy, and look forward to seeing you all, at either ICSC in Las Vegas later this month, or at maybe Chicago in early June. Andy?"

Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'm going to review our financing activity for the first quarter.

This morning, I'm going to review our financing activity for the first quarter. I'll discuss our current financial position and then go over our guidance assumptions, which are pretty much unchanged from last quarter, before turning the call over to your questions. 
On our last call in February, I stated, we may take advantage of the improving capital markets at that time and utilized $135 million of cash at year end to lock in longer-term debt and retire our term loan. In early March, we did exactly that, as we issued $150 million of unsecured 5.9% 10-year notes, and utilized related the proceeds, along with cash on hand, to fully retire the $250 million outstanding balance on our term loan, which was set to mature in July of 2011. While we did not have a prepayment penalty associated with the pay-off of our term loan, we did have to write off $2.8 million of unamortized debt fees. This expense was partially offset by the $2.3 million of income recognized in the quarter from the acceleration of The Home Depot lease termination fee at Flourtown that Don spoke about in his remarks. 
As a result of our capital market transactions throughout 2009 and into 2010 and our long-term disciplined approach to capital, our balance sheet is really in great shape, highlighted by: no debt maturities in 2010 and only $112 million of maturities in 2011; an extension of our weighted average remaining debt term by one full year to 5.7 years at March 31, 2010, compared to 4.7 years at March 31, 2009; leverage of approximately 40% as measured by debt to our low historical undepreciated asset bases; net to total market capitalization of around 25%; a debt to EBITDA ratio of around 5x and a fixed charge coverage ratio in the neighborhood of 3x. 
A strong balance sheet, untapped $300 million revolving credit facility and the advantage of having a lower cost of capital within both our public and private peers will serve us well as we seek to acquire high-quality assets in our core markets. As Don said, Jeff's available to give you a little more color on the transactions environment during Q&A.
Finally, with the first three months of the year behind us and a bit more clarity on the rest of the year, we've increased our 2010 FFO per share guidance to a range of $3.82 to $3.89. Key assumptions in this guidance are largely unchanged from last quarter but include full year same center property operating income growth of around 1½%, including redevelopments, unchanged from last quarter. Yes, the full year growth rate is lower than our same center growth reported in the first quarter, resulting from tougher comps for the remainder of 2010. 
Lower interest costs for the full year of 2010 versus 2009 totaling around $7 million to $8 million in interest savings, including the fees and costs associated with the early pay-off of our term loan in March, largely resulting from eliminating the excess cash that we were holding over the past nine months, reflected in the dramatic improvement in capital market conditions. 
Finally, as always, we've not included the impact of any acquisitions in our guidance. We feel confident going to the second quarter of the year that 2010 will be another solid year for Federal Realty. We continue to run a very balanced business strategy, operating on the strength of our best-in-class property portfolio, while prudently evaluating opportunities for growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to your questions. Ahmed, if we can start polling for questions."

And I think, there's been a clear sentiment shift in the last two, three, four, five months. And sellers are a lot more willing to engage in discussions about parting with their property today than they were two, three, four, five months ago. And I think, I attribute that to a couple of things. One is some transactions have happened, and as we've talked about on past calls, I think, that's very good for the market. That gives sellers another's confidence with respect to bringing their property to the market, and more transactions that happen, the better, and that momentum kind of builds on it. So we're starting to see that now. Clearly, the fact that there's some clarity in an economic recovery or some early signs of an economic recovery, I think, are making it easier for people to make a sell decision. And then finally, the availability of mortgage debt capital is much greater than it was three, six, nine, certainly 12 months ago, and that's making a lot easier for sellers to get their heads around bringing their property to market now. So the momentum is really favorable on the activities picked up significantly. And we're busy underwriting a lot of stuff right now, most of which were in direct conversations with sellers on as opposed to poorly marketed properties. But the trend is good."

Remember that since the last period of time, when there were significant amount of acquisitions out there, the accounting rules have changed. And so virtually, all your costs associated with going after that acquisition are now going to be expensed but not capitalized in some projects. So I think, there'll very few high-quality properties that are purchased that are accretive in the first year, for two reasons. Not only because of the higher volumes, values which hammer down cap rates, but also because of the expensing of the initial cost of getting the acquisition. But we look at this stuff. We have and will continue to look at this stuff on an IRR basis. Since coming out of this recession, we'd love to be able to increase the size of the platform of great quality real estate."

The issue is quite frankly, what it always is and always has been for the kind of real estate we want to buy and don't care whether it's 2010 or 2004. When I started here doing this in 1997, there's always a gap that needs to be closed between the buyer and seller and that takes work. And it's just a function of the type of asset really that we want to buy, which is a high-quality asset that down the road we think we can add value to through redevelopment, leasing and intensive asset management. And the people that own those kinds of properties know they're good properties and there's always work to do to close that gap. And as Don mentioned, I mean one of the impediments that's maybe new to where we are in the cycle right now is, I think the box leasing environment was impacted maybe indefinitely by the recession. And there are still a lot of owners that don't understand the new dynamics of box leasing today. So when those centers when we have a box that maybe is not doing or a box tenant, that maybe is not doing the kind of sales that we'd like to see or has a near-term lease expiration, or some other opportunity to come back and take a whack at the rent that they're currently paying, that's creating a lot of the gap between what we'd like to pay for an asset right now and what the seller thinks it's worth."

I just looked at the first quarter sales stuff for a small shop and they're not going down anymore. Now the comparisons are not all that hard from first quarter of '09 versus first quarter of '10. But still, there has been a bottoming and the most important psychological thing of that bottoming is even those mom and pops now, who have now gotten comfortable or used to a lower sales level are in larger and larger numbers, not thinking about giving up the shift, but rather how they can start improving and growing again.

Good morning, everyone. With half of the 2010 year in the books, Federal is performing better than we expected, with reported FFO per share in the second quarter of $0.98, higher than the $0.94 we recorded in the first quarter and also sligh",1364,"Thanks, Gina. Good morning, everyone. With half of the 2010 year in the books, Federal is performing better than we expected, with reported FFO per share in the second quarter of $0.98, higher than the $0.94 we recorded in the first quarter and also slightly ahead of the $0.97 recorded in last year's second quarter.
It really was a fine operating quarter and first half in total for us, with rental income up 3.3% and expenses very much under control. We do see some potential cracks in the armor in the second half of the year, primarily related due to tenants who have given up after a couple of years of subsidizing their business from other sources and so bad debt expenses could creep up again, but nothing overly significant. In short, we expect overall performance in the second half of the year to mirror or perhaps be slightly better than our very good first half.
In terms of regional performance, our properties in the Washington D.C. Metro Area, which make up about a third of our company seem to be coming back a bit stronger than other markets, with modestly improving tenant sales and increased demand from retailers being the obvious signs. 
Overall, California remains the weakest performing region for us. Although Santana Row, which saw a double-digit sales hit over the course of the recession, seems to be coming back particularly well and has really solidified itself as the social center in Silicon Valley. We see it in the form higher occupancy in rate at Hotel Valencia. We see it in the form of higher rental rates in the apartments. And we certainly see it in higher foot traffic in retail sales.  
We did begin construction during the quarter on schedule, over 109-unit apartment building at Santana that should be completed next year and stabilize in 2012 at a 7% yield. As we've talked about previously, we may choose to convert those units into condos during the next condo market for a strong double-digit IRR. 
In terms of the newly built office or retail building at Santana, we're not there yet but we are making progress. We signed a strong deal during the quarter with for a 10,000 square-foot restaurant on corner of Stevens Creek in Santana Row. And in two other build-out is underway for the second floor of office tenant with a rent start date of September 1. Still more office leasing to go, but we're very encouraged by what's happening in Santana Row these days. And if you haven't been in our flagship property in a number of years, it might be a good time for a return trip.
Okay. Enough about Santana and let's talk a bit more about leasing for the quarter. 80 comparable deals for over 300,000 square feet at an average rent of $27.62, 4% more than the rent was replaced on a year-over-year cash basis and 13% more on a straight-line basis over the least term. While that rollover rate is lower than it's been, we also saw some good news in the detail behind that number. 
While there weren't any significant renewals of old leases at big bumps during the quarter as they were in first, there was also a lot less deal-by-deal deviation than in prior quarters. In other words, there were less deals done at significant decreases than there have been recently. And therefore, we saw more consistency in dealmaking. While we sure wish that we had some more leverage with retailers to push rents, this is still a solid result and perhaps more predicable. 
Physical occupancy has remained extremely stable at 93% overall and 94% on a same-center basis. And lease percentage is about 100 basis points better than that again. Again, I wouldn't expect to see much of a change for the balance of the year.
Okay. Let's talk about a couple more areas before turning it over to Andy. Acquisition prospects in Assembly Square, which is soon to be called Assembly Row. As you know by now, we certainly haven't found lots of big impactful acquisition values out there that will change the course of Federal Realty. But we have quietly put together a string of real estate investments that have either closed or about to close the total of about $60 million, that will contribute about a 7% return initially and create significant value over the years. 
The first is our $80 million acquisition of two great buildings on Newbury Street in Boston that hopefully represent our first of many investments on that great shopping street. Significant upside is expected by leasing up the office space in the upper floors of two buildings we bought. 
Second is our contract to buy the former Mervyn's store that has shadow anchored our strong-performing Escondido Center in the San Diego subur. The box should be retained with a new Dick's and Ross stores were pretty for long on leases. I think Dick's is a done deal. Ross is closed. And if it's not them, it will be somebody else. They'll not only increase the yield of the shopping center but will also arguably lower the cap rate of the entire center. 
Third is our acquisition of Huntington Square Shopping Center on Long Island for $18 million that will further build on Federal's already strong regional presence. Retail presence that includes Huntington Shopping Center, Greenlawns Plaza, Melville Mall and Hauppauge Shopping Center. Huntington Square includes tenants like Dress Barn, Barnes & Noble and Lane Bryant is shadow anchored by Sears. The property was renovated in 2007, was boarded in a strong yield and has additional lease upside.
Finally, we negotiated the buyout of the land under a portion of our extremely successful Bethesda Row project for about $10 million. The land is on Bethesda Avenue. And it's home to tenants like Apple, Dunkin' Donuts and local restaurants and by owning fee, further enhancing Bethesda's value in addition to producing a strong FFO portfolio. 
We continue to search for a great addition to this portfolio including much larger deals. But I think you'd agree that the $60 million enumerated above is much more likely to be long-term accretive to value than some of the similarly sized shopping center acquisitions that we've seen in the marketplace. 
And finally, a word about Assembly Row. Our mixed-use opportunity in Somerville, Mass [Massachusetts] just outside of Boston. As those of you who follow us know, I've been very cautious about making any promises concerning our ability to deliver a large viable development here given the state of economy, given our borrowing cost bases and given the numerous government hurdles regarding the proposed T-Stop at the site. 
Be assured that I'm still very cautious and would really prefer that when valuing Federal Realty, that you not ascribe incremental value to Assembly. In fact, without the T-Stop in the public financing that we're counting on, it's unlikely that we'd be able to recover our existing investments. 
Now having said that, this past three or four months have seen a tangible increase in interest in the site from retailers that we talked to, from potential office tenants and more significantly, from residential developers. Several months ago, we asked for bids on the first 400 residential units in the project in our RFP process that yielded significant interest in the site from some of the best residential developers in the country. In the end, we selected out the one they would negotiate with and we had a handshake deal with them to buy the residential rights for the first phase. Hopefully, we can get to a signed contract. 
Having a strong a name as Avalon compete aggressively for this site in their own backyard really validates Assembly Row as a residential destination. And when combined with Federal Realty's retail and mixed-use expertise, Row should be viewed as a very positive step. There are lot of hurdles to cross, but we're thrilled to be working with the right player on this team in Assembly.
That's all I got for my prepared remarks this morning. Now let me turn it over to Andy. And I look forward to your questions after that."
271305,108752623,78426,"Federal Realty Investment Trust, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-05-2010",2010-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Federal Realty Investment Trust","Executives","Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. Federal Realty produced another very solid consistent quarter despite the continuing tough economic environment. Lease rollovers were positive, though down from the exceptional results last quarter. Occupancy remai",840,"Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. Federal Realty produced another very solid consistent quarter despite the continuing tough economic environment. Lease rollovers were positive, though down from the exceptional results last quarter. Occupancy remains flat. And as a result, our portfolio again produced positive same-center growth. This consistent performance throughout the economic downturn, along with our very solid balance sheet, let us increase our dividend again this year, marking the 43rd consecutive year of increased annual dividends.
Same-center property operating income growth for the quarter was 3.4% including redevelopments. This growth was given by the 3.3% growth in rental income that Don discussed in his remarks, which includes an increase in minimum rent, supplemented with the boost in ancillary income and canned true-ups throughout the portfolio. 
Going forward, we expect same-center property income including redevelopments to come in at the top of our previous guidance of 1% to 1.5% on the positive side. This certainly implies lower same-center growth in the second half of the year than we've reported in both the first and second quarters. 
In particular, third quarter same-center growth will be impacted by the following items: first, a continued decrease in lease terms fees, as we accelerated the remaining lease term fee for the Home Depot termination at Flourtown into the first quarter of this year. I think it's about $1 million in the whole on a comparable basis.  
Second, an expected increase in demolition expenses in the third quarter to prepare for new major tenants, including Neiman Marcus Last Call at Congressional Plaza, Nordstrom Rack at Frienship Center, Dick's at Governor Plaza and others. 
And finally, bad debt to be higher than last year, as we reported less than $1 million in the third quarter of '09, one of the lowest levels we've seen since the downturn in the economy. Items such as these can cause same-center growth to vary quarter-to-quarter. Accordingly, we continue to believe the full year result is an appropriately way to give this metric. 
With respect to the dividend, recall that a year ago, many REITs decided to cut, suspend or pay the dividend in stock. Bucking that trend, Federal Realty is one of the very few REITs that not only continued to pay that dividend in cash, but also increased the dividend based on our expectation of consistent solid performance from our portfolio of high-quality intel of retail assets. 
Our decision to increase the dividend in each of the past two years was based on continued growth in taxable income, strong free cash flow after dividend payments and very solid dividend and coverage ratios. While you all know that this dividend record ranks first amongst all REITs, a record of our dividend achievement ranks 22nd amongst all publicly traded companies in the U.S. That's over 11,000 of them, putting us in the elite company of Procter & Gamble, 3M, Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, Johnson & Johnson, Tootsie Roll Industries, Altria and Hormel Foods. We continue to believe that increasing cash dividend is part of our contract with investors, and hope that we'll be talking about our 44th consecutive year 12 months from now. 
Our balance sheet remains in great shape. And the capital markets remain cooperative, with all-in debt costs remaining at or near the recent lows and equity prices remaining relatively attractive. As a result, we continue to be in enviable position to fund the right acquisitions both on a short-term and on a longer-term basis. At the quarter end, we have the full $300 million of credit facility capacity at our disposal. The one acquisition we've closed so far this year, Newbury Street in Boston, was funded with free cash flow.
Our balance sheet ratios continue to support our strong Baa1, BBB+ rating with a couple of key statistics. We have no debt maturities in 2010 and only $112 million coming due in 2011. Debt to book value of 41%, remember that, that book value reflects our very low historic cost basis. Debt to total market capitalization of 28%, fixed charge coverage above 3x and debt to preferred to annualized EBITDA of 5x. 
As for guidance, we now have a bit more clarity with the solid six months of operating performance behind us and have increase the lower end of our guidance by $0.02 to a range of $3.84 to $3.89 per diluted share, fueled by our upward revision to same-store property operating income growth including redevelopments I discussed earlier. 
Just to be clear, the increase in guidance comes despite some earnings dilution in 2010 from the four acquisitions we announced. As we've discussed for a number of quarters, we must now expense the related acquisition deal costs rather than capitalizing them into our bases. And these costs, plus associated borrowing costs, are greater than the partial year property operating income contribution of the acquisitions.
We're really pleased with the solid and consistent results that our portfolio continues to produce over this difficult economic time. With that, I'd now be happy to turn the call over to you for your questions."

They are the folks we've acquired Assembly Square from several years ago. We've maintained a great relationship with them, and they've been a very active investor all over the world, quite frankly, for the last several years. A couple of years ago, they formed a partnership or joint venture with the company that's headquartered in Back Bay, Boston called Urban Meritage. And they've developed with Urban Meritage a very nice operating platform to not only acquire but also to redevelop, manage and lease the types of buildings you'd see in Back Bay, Boston. I think together, Taurus and Urban Meritage acquired close to 20 buildings in Back Bay now over the last three, four years. So they've got a real well developed and strong operating platform. And we thought it made sense to invest along with them. The deal set up, where we put in 85% of the equity and they put in 15%, target leverage on the joint venture's 50% to 60%. And then through the joint venture documents, we have a significant amount of control and input on everything that's important, acquisitions and financing obviously. But also, we have an annual business plan process. It featured buildings we acquired that effectively gives us control over leasing decisions and redevelopment decisions as well. So again we're very, very happy to have them as a partner. I think they've set up a fabulous platform and I think that we have appropriate controls given our level of investments in the JV."

And I think some of the stuff that's happening on the basic grocery-anchored stuff that we've been seeing lately has made it real difficult to be able to see a path.

And if other people are willing to pay up for that, why not? So kind of by nature of what's happening in that sector, we're looking for high-quality retail and high-quality retail real estate primarily. And the mixed-use stuff in some of the urban areas, obviously, we've done a bunch of it before. So we kind of know our way around there. And when the Newbury Street opportunity came up, we kind of jumped on it. We did that for a couple of reasons. You have to enumerate them. First of all, the fact that we had the previous relationships with this guys is big. I mean, we knew it was a very, very good transaction to work out Assembly Square a few years back with them. We know how they deal, and that was really positive. Secondly, Boston is a big market for us now. And again, I don't know whether Assembly ultimately makes or doesn't make. But even without that, we have a full service office up there so Newbury was strong. It does look a little bit to me like the deal that we cut 15 years ago or so on Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, where we had a local partner, we JV-ed with them. We've made a lot of money out there and we're hoping to replicate that."

The fact of the matter is, if you've been operating with significantly lower sales over the past couple of years and you borrowed from all kinds of non-traditional sources to keep it going, at some point, if those sales don't come back, you say, the bank's closed.

First of all, the definition of why didn't it work out last time, it did work out in terms of making money for Federal Realty. It did not work out in terms of being impactful enough to matter and it took a whole bunch of management time. It takes the same amount of management time to manage a $60 million shopping center, as it does a $10 million or $12 million building in a lot of respects. And so that's what didn't make sense, which is why you're not going to find us entering new markets. We used to own something in Evanston, Illinois. We used to own something in Westfield, New Jersey. We used to own a lot of those small buildings that were scattered all around the country. We're not going to do that. It doesn't make any sense for the type of company we are. That's why I say this is a unique opportunity with a unique group of people to give us a strong presence on the street and in a particular area. And if we can do that, great. And if we can't, we'll probably never talk about it again because we've sold it."

Our second quarter 2010 supplemental disclosure package provides a significant amount of valuable information with respect to the Trust's operating and financial performance. This document is currently available on our website.
Certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

With half of the 2010 year in the books, Federal is performing better than we expected, with reported FFO per share in the second quarter of $0.98, higher than the $0.94 we recorded in the first quarter and also s",1376,"Thanks, Gina, and good morning, everyone. With half of the 2010 year in the books, Federal is performing better than we expected, with reported FFO per share in the second quarter of $0.98, higher than the $0.94 we recorded in the first quarter and also slightly ahead of the $0.97 recorded in last year's second quarter.
It really was a fine operating quarter and first half in total for us, with rental income up 3.3% and expenses very much under control. We do see some potential cracks in the armor in the second half of the year, primarily related to tenants who are given up after a couple of years of subsidizing their businesses from other sources and so bad debt expenses could creep up again, but nothing overly significant. In short, we expect overall performance in the second half of the year to mirror or perhaps be slightly better than our very good first half.
In terms of regional performance, our properties in the Washington D.C. Metro Area, which make up about a third of our company, seem to be coming back a bit stronger than other markets, with modestly improving tenant sales and increased demand from retailers being the obvious signs. 
Overall, California remains the weakest performing region for us. Although Santana Row, which saw a double-digit sales hit over the course of the recession, seems to be coming back particularly well and has really solidified itself as the social center of Silicon Valley. We see it in the form higher occupancy in rate at Hotel Valencia. We see it in the form of higher rental rates in the apartments. And we certainly see it in higher foot traffic in retail sales.  
We did begin construction during the quarter on schedule of our 109-unit apartment building at Santana that should be completed next year and stabilize in 2012 at a 7% yield. As we've talked about previously, we may choose to convert those units into condos during the next bull condo market for a strong double-digit IRR. 
In terms of the newly built office of a retail building at Santana, we're not there yet but we are making progress. We signed a strong deal during the quarter with Yard House for a 10,000 square foot restaurant on the hard corner of Stevens Creek in Santana Row. And interior build out is underway for the second floor office tenant with a rent start date of December 1. Still more office leasing to go, but we're very encouraged by what's happening at Santana Row these days. And if you haven't been in our flagship property in a number of years, it might be a good time for a return trip.
Okay. Enough about Santana and let's talk a bit more about leasing for the quarter. 80 comparable deals for over 300,000 square feet at an average rent of $27.62, 4% more than the rent that was replaced on a year-over-year cash basis and 13% more on a straight-line basis over the lease term. While that rollover rate is lower than it's been, we also saw some good news in the detail behind that number. 
While there weren't any significant renewals of old leases with big bumps during the quarter as they were in first, there was also a lot less deal-by-deal deviation than in prior quarters. In other words, there were less deals done at significant decreases than there have been recently. And therefore, we saw more consistency in deal making. While we sure wish that we had some more leverage with retailers to push rents, this is still a solid result and perhaps more predictable. 
Physical occupancy has remained extremely stable at 93% overall and 94% on a same-center basis. And lease percentage is about 100 basis points better than that. Again, I wouldn't expect to see much of a change for the balance of the year.
Okay. Let's talk about a couple more areas before turning it over to Andy. Acquisition prospects and Assembly Square, which is soon to be called Assembly Row. Well as you know by now, we certainly haven't yet found lots of big impactful acquisition values out there that will change the course of Federal Realty. But we have quietly put together a string of real estate investments that have either closed or are about to close the total of about $60 million that’ll contribute about a 7% return initially and create significant value over the years. 
The first is our $18 million acquisition of two great buildings on Newbury Street in Boston that hopefully represent our first of many investments on that great shopping street. Significant upside is expected by leasing up the office space in the upper floors of the two buildings we bought. 
Second is our contract to buy the former Mervyn's store that has shadow anchored our strong-performing Escondido shopping center in the San Diego suburb. The box should be retained with a new Dick's and Ross stores. We’re pretty far along on the leases. In fact, I think Dick's is a done deal, and Ross is close. And if it's not them, it’ll be somebody else. They'll not only increase the yield of the shopping center but will also arguably lower the cap rate of the entire center. 
Third is our acquisition of Huntington Square Shopping Center on Long Island for $18 million that will further build on Federal's already strong regional presence; retail presence that includes Huntington Shopping Center, Greenlawns Plaza, Melville Mall and Hauppauge Shopping Center. Huntington Square includes tenants like Dress Barn, Barnes & Noble and Lane Bryant and is shadow anchored by Sears. The property was renovated in 2007, was bought at a strong yield and has additional lease upside.
Finally, we negotiated a buyout of the land under a portion of our extremely successful Bethesda Row project for about $10 million. The land is on Bethesda Avenue. And it's home to tenants like Apple, Dunkin' Donuts and local restaurants and by owning the fee, further enhances Bethesda's value in addition to producing a strong FFO portfolio. 
We continue to search for a great addition to this portfolio including much larger deals. But I think you'd agree that the $60 million enumerated above is much more likely to be long-term accretive to value than some of the similarly sized shopping center acquisitions that we've seen in the marketplace. 
And finally, a word about Assembly Row. Our mixed-use opportunity in Somerville, Mass [Massachusetts] just outside of Boston. As those of you who follow us know, I've been very cautious about making any promises concerning our ability to deliver a large viable development here given the state of the economy, given our growing cost basis and given the numerous government hurdles regarding the proposed T-Stop at the site. 
Be assured that I'm still very cautious and would really prefer that when valuing Federal Realty, that you not ascribe incremental value to Assembly. In fact, without a T-Stop and the public financing that we're counting on, it's unlikely that we'd be able to recover our existing investments. 
Now having said that, this past three or four months have seen a tangible increase in interest in the site from retailers that we talk to, from potential office tenants and most significantly, from residential developers. Several months ago, we asked for bids on the first 400 residential units in the project in an RFP process that yielded significant interest in the site from some of the best residential developers in the country. In the end, we selected AvalonBay to negotiate with, and we have a handshake deal with them to buy the residential rights for the first phase. Hopefully, we can get to a signed contract. 
Having a strong a name as Avalon compete aggressively for this site in their own backyard really validates Assembly Row as a residential destination and when combined with Federal Realty's retail and mixed-use expertise, really should be viewed as a very positive step. Still lots of hurdles to cross, but we're thrilled to be working with Bryce Blair  on this team at Assembly.
That's all I’ve got for my prepared remarks this morning. Now let me turn it over to Andy. And I look forward to your questions after that."
271305,108752623,78448,"Federal Realty Investment Trust, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-05-2010",2010-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Federal Realty Investment Trust","Executives","Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. Federal Realty produced another very solid consistent quarter despite the continuing tough economic environment. Lease rollovers were positive, though down from the exceptional results last quarter. Occupancy remai",838,"Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. Federal Realty produced another very solid consistent quarter despite the continuing tough economic environment. Lease rollovers were positive, though down from the exceptional results last quarter. Occupancy remains flat. And as a result, our portfolio again produced positive same-center growth. This consistent performance throughout the economic downturn, along with our very solid balance sheet, allowed us to increase our dividend again this year, marking the 43rd consecutive year of increased annual dividends.
Same-center property operating income growth for the quarter was 3.4% including redevelopments. This growth was driven by the 3.3% growth in rental income that Don discussed in his remarks, which includes an increase in minimum rent, supplemented with a boost in ancillary income and canned true-ups throughout the portfolio. 
Going forward, we expect same-center property operating income including redevelopments to come in at the top of our previous guidance of 1% to 1½% on the positive side. This certainly implies lower same-center growth in the second half of the year than we've reported in both the first and second quarters. 
In particular, third quarter same-center growth will be impacted by the following items: first, a continued decrease in lease terms fees, as we accelerated the remaining lease term fee for the Home Depot termination at Flourtown into the first quarter of this year. I think this is about $1 million in the hole on a comparable basis.  
Second, an expected increase in demolition expenses in the third quarter to prepare for new major tenants, including Neiman Marcus Last Call at Congressional Plaza, Nordstrom Rack at Friendship Center, Dick's at Governor Plaza and others. 
And finally, bad debt to be higher than last year, as we reported less than $1 million in the third quarter of '09, one of the lowest levels we've seen since the downturn in the economy. Items such as these can cause same-center growth to vary quarter-to-quarter. Accordingly, we continue to believe the full year result is an appropriate way to view this metric. 
With respect to the dividend, recall that a year ago, many REITs decided to cut, suspend or pay the dividend in stock. Bucking that trend, Federal Realty is one of the very few REITs that not only continued to pay that dividend in cash, but also increased the dividend based on our expectation of consistent solid performance from our portfolio of high-quality intel of retail assets. 
Our decision to increase the dividend in each of the past two years was based on continued growth in taxable income, strong free cash flow after dividend payments and very solid dividend and coverage ratios. While you all know that this dividend record ranks first amongst all REITs, a record of dividend achievement ranks 22nd amongst all publicly traded companies in the U.S., that's over 11,000 of them, putting us in the elite company of Procter & Gamble, 3M, Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, Johnson & Johnson, Tootsie Roll Industries, Altria and Hormel Foods. We continue to believe that increasing cash dividend is part of our contract with investors and hope that we'll be talking about our 44th consecutive year 12 months from now. 
Our balance sheet remains in great shape. And the capital markets remain cooperative, with all-in debt costs remaining at or near the recent lows and equity prices remaining relatively attractive. As a result, we continue to be in enviable position to fund the right acquisitions both on a short-term and on a longer-term basis. At the quarter end, we had the full $300 million of credit facility capacity at our disposal. The one acquisition we've closed so far this year, Newbury Street in Boston, was funded with free cash flow.
Our balance sheet ratios continue to support our strong Baa1, BBB+ rating with a couple of key statistics. We have no debt maturities in 2010 and only $112 million coming due in 2011. Debt-to-book value of 41%, remember that, that book value reflects our very low historic cost basis. Debt-to-total market capitalization of 28%, fixed charge coverage above 3x and debtor preferred to annualized EBITDA of 5x. 
As for guidance, we now have a bit more clarity with the solid six months of operating performance behind us and have increased the lower end of our guidance by $0.02 to a range of $3.84 to $3.89 per diluted share, buoyed by our upward revision to same-store property operating income growth including redevelopments that I discussed earlier. 
Just to be clear, the increase in guidance comes despite some earnings dilution in 2010 from the four acquisitions we announced. As we've discussed for a number of quarters, we must now expense the related acquisition deal costs rather than capitalizing them into our basis. And these costs, plus associated borrowing costs, are greater than the partial year property operating income contribution of the acquisitions.
We're really pleased with the solid and consistent results that our portfolio continues to produce over this difficult economic time. With that, I'd now be happy to turn the call over to you for your questions."

They’re the folks we've acquired Assembly Square from several years ago. We've maintained a great relationship with them, and they've been a very active investor all over the world, quite frankly, for the last several years. A couple years ago, they formed a partnership or joint venture with the company that's headquartered in Back Bay, Boston called Urban Meritage. And they've developed with Urban Meritage a very nice operating platform to not only acquire but also to redevelop, manage and lease the types of buildings you'd see in Back Bay, Boston. I think together, Taurus and Urban Meritage have acquired close to 20 buildings in Back Bay now over the last three, four years. So they've got a real well developed and strong operating platform. And we thought it made sense to invest along with them. The deal set up, where we put in 85% of the equity and they put in 15%, target leverage on the joint venture's 50% to 60%. And then through the joint venture documents, we have a significant amount of control and input on everything that's important, acquisitions and financing, obviously, but also, we have an annual business plan process with each of the buildings we acquire that effectively gives us control over leasing decisions and redevelopment decisions as well. So again we're very, very happy to have them as a partner. I think they've set up a fabulous platform and I think that we have appropriate controls given our level of investment in the JV."

And I think some of the stuff that's happening on the basic grocery-anchored stuff that we've been seeing lately has made it real difficult to be able to see a path. I think there's a lot of anchor boxes in there or small anchors in there that are over market. And we see some of those things rolling down in the future, and other people are willing to pay up for that; we’re not. So kind of by nature of what's happening in that sector, we're looking for high-quality retail and high-quality retail real estate primarily. And the mixed-use stuff in some of the urban areas, obviously, we've done a bunch of it before. So we kind of know our way around there. And when the Newbury Street opportunity came up, we kind of jumped on it. We did that for a couple of reasons. Jeff enumerate them. First of all, the fact that we had the previous relationships with these guys is big. I mean, we knew it was a very, very good transaction to work out Assembly Square a few years back with them. We know how they deal, and that was really positive. Secondly, Boston is a big market for us now. And again, I don't know whether Assembly ultimately makes or doesn't make. But even without that, we have a full service office up there so Newbury was strong. It does look a little bit to me like the deal that we cut 15 years ago or so on Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, where we had a local partner, we JV-ed with them. We've made a lot of money out there and we're hoping to replicate that."

That is still the case. There are just some that aren't going to be able to. So I don't really see it as a special red flag or red light in any way, shape or form that way. I mean overall, we wouldn't be able to kind of give guidance towards the earnings we're talking about, toward the occupancy we’re talking about if we did see it as a big problem. But it is real. The fact of the matter is, if you've been operating with significantly lower sales over the past couple of years and you’ve borrowed from all kinds of non-traditional sources to keep it going, at some point, if those sales don't come back, you say, the bank's closed.

Most of the product that's come to the market over the last several quarters, we just really haven't been that interested in because as Don said earlier, there's probably downward pressure on NOI because a lot of the deals that have been brought to market had junior anchors that were leased at the peak of the market or a lot of small shop space that was leased at the peak of the market. And we really don't want to buy assets where we're going to be swimming upstream against declining our flat NOI going forward. We want to buy stuff that medium to long term is going to add value to the company, and we are finally starting to see some of that product come to market. Now it's ridiculously competitive."

We're not going to plan out the entire 10-year progress until we see what happens along the way.

And while we're not going to be able to push rents dramatically overall in the portfolio, we're also not -- there are just not that many occasions where we're dropping a lot either. So the range is getting tighter, Jay, and the best example I can give is we just did a deal with Neiman Marcus' Last Call Studio concept. It's a new concept for them. This, I think – and Chris is here, he can tell me -- I think this is the only one they're doing in the Washington D.C. Metropolitan area. And it's at Congressional. It's right here. We just did Nordstrom Rack, back filling, I think the Linens 'n Things space that was down in Friendship place. All are good rents, these are good deals. These are not subsidized deals.

And it almost happens all the time. But when you look over a number, here’s how we did, we were really, really close. Missing a little early, getting a bit more later, and we're really, really close. So I don't think that as we're underwriting today, that we've got our head in the sand or that we're too Pollyanna-ish is in terms of what we're trying to underwrite. I think we're pretty good.

Good afternoon, everyone.

Our third quarter FFO per share of $0.95 grew by 3.3% over prior year and significantly, that's the best quarter-over-quarter performance we've had since first quarter of '09. We expect that trend to continue into the fourth quarter and therefore, feel comfortable guiding 2010 FFO per share to the now a range of $3.85 to $3.87. It also makes me optimistic that we'll be able to achieve the thus far elusive $4 a share threshold in 2011, as Andy will talk about later. Consumer spending remains sluggish and unemployment remains high, it's hard to expect much of a change over the next 12 months that way. But given those conditions, we were able to achieve $4 a share next year or even a bit higher. We'd be generating solid 4% growth plus a higher dividend over our near all-time earnings record this year, not growth over a significantly diluted year. In other words, no easy comps in Federal.
Separately, we just got some great news in the resolution of our lawsuit with Renato. That as you may remember, centered around our rights along with our partners' rights post property to buy the land under our Pentagon Row property. We won the suit earlier in the year and Renato petitioned for appeal for the Virginia Supreme Court shortly after that judgment. That petition was denied a couple of days ago. And we would therefore expect to close in the coming weeks or months on the land. It's a great deal and value enhancer to the entire Pentagon Row industry [ph]. 
Alright, let's dig into the quarter math a bit and start by talking about topline results and indications about expectations for the future topline growth. Rental income grew by 3.2% in the quarter including recoveries, which is basically a same-store number given the limited new activity in the last year or so. And that's a very good sign at the health of the portfolio. Cash basis leads rollover growth to 6% in the quarter, 17% on a straight-line basis. It's another good sign for higher future cash flows and that growth was pretty evenly spread between leases for new tenants and renewals of existing ones. Overall occupancy grew modestly year-over-year from 93.1% to 93.3%, solid, but we've got room to improve further there. At the rental income line, both for the quarter and looking into the future, portfolio continues to perform well and remains extremely solid and stable. 
Now during the quarter, higher expenses offset the topline growth resulting in flat same-center operating income and actually, slightly negative when you consider properties in various stages of redevelopment. Both of those larger properties and redevelopment, by the way, will be contributing beginning in the fourth quarter, if things [ph] come online and start paying rent. In addition, demolition cost and future redevelopment was also a factor in the quarter. Otherwise, the higher operating expenses during the quarter were mostly a matter of quarterly timing of various maintenance projects and don't affect our previous estimates of same-center operating growth for the full year of 1% to 1½%. In fact, it looks like it would be in the high end of that range or maybe even exceeded for the year.
If I went back and i looked at the forward-looking comments that I made on this call back in August concerning our view of the major markets we do business in, as well as the leasing and operating environment, and I've got to say it all still applies. Retailers want to get deals done in virtually all the markets we do business in, but with a tough cost conscious mentality that's here to stay in all of the best locations. Washington D.C. remains the strongest of our markets with California the weakest, though improving, particularly at Santana Row. All of the smaller potential acquisitions I talked about on the second quarter call are on track to close by the end of the year and will benefit 2011.
Let me spend a few minutes talking about some of the initiatives we're working on these days because between the developments, the redevelopment and the refinancing projects that we also have in various phases of execution, along with what feels to me a lot like more acquisition opportunities worth looking at. I'm optimistic that we're starting to see a clearer roadmap to additional value creation in the quarters and years ahead. Beginning with the most certain of value enhancers, so it's best to invest for us and start to [indiscernible] on our own. Our completely redeveloped $14 million building on Handed [ph] lane is done on time, on budget and is fully leased. Rent from all tenants, including the building's flagship Equinox Health club, begins during this fourth quarter and when combined with some key re-tenanting moves that were made elsewhere in the Bethesda really has helped one of our most successful mixed-use developments shift into an even higher gear. 
Out of Santana Row, we're well out of the ground on our 109-unit apartment building. Here also, we're on time and we're on budget thus far with rental prospect strong enough at the cost of the speed up planning on the next phase of residential development there, which would create an additional 150 to 200 apartments. Demand for our completed office over retail building in Santana has also picked up and the first rent-paying tenants there will begin contributing by the end of this year. In addition, we just executed a new lease with exclusive luxury electric car manufacturer, Tesla at Santana, which would be their first and only new prototypical showroom anywhere. Keep an eye on Santana over the next several years. There's a lots of momentum underway there.
Planning for a significant mixed-use development at Mid-Pike Plaza moves closer and closer to the zoning approvals and a viable phase  development plan that should have a lot of value to that great piece of land for the next 10-plus years, hopefully with first phase construction starting in 2012. And of course, Assembly Row, our project in Somerville, Massachusetts just outside of Boston. I have a pretty full update last quarter, which still applies including all my caveat. But it surely has promised, and since that last call, we've taken an handshake deal that we had with AvalonBay to buy the rights to build the first 400 apartments on this site. And as of yesterday, turns into a signed contract. Design now starts in earnest, and we hope to have a late 2011 construction start, if and in fact, pee stop [ph] construction of the site is imminent.
We'll know more about that in the next couple of months. And while we have no significant acquisitions to announce this quarter, we sure are working on a fair number of potential deals for some truly high quality stuff. Some street retail oriented product in the Northeast, some larger necessity based retail in both Florida and California, and a smattering of other strong quality properties in our remaining markets. All that has me encouraged that we'll be able to find a way to add products to our portfolio in the next couple of quarters that we can surely work over the next bunch of years.
Pricing expectations remain high by almost all standards, but at least it appears that the future earnings potential of these properties can justify. And that's a subtle change from what we've been seeing in the recent past. We're starting to see the first glimpses to a path of real estate value creation led by retailing and non-retail development and refinancing opportunities, along with some new raw materials in the form of high-quality real estate for sale that may be able to work into an even stronger position. That's all happening despite what remains a very challenging economic environment and a persistent futile longing for return to the good old days of 2006, 2007, it certainly isn't happening. 
That's all I've got for my prepared remarks this morning. And I'll turn it over to Andy, and look forward to your questions after that."

After th",1073,"Thanks, Don, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to begin my prepared remarks with a more detailed review of our third quarter performance for a brief discussion of the balance sheet, and then an overview of our outlook and guidance for 2011. After that, we'll turn the call over to your questions. 
To start, Federal Realty once again produced positive lease rollovers of 6% on a cash basis and 17% on a GAAP basis. We maintain physical occupancy levels in the portfolio of 93.3%. On the year-to-date basis, rollovers are 8% on the cash basis, 19% on the GAAP basis, very much in line with expectations we set with our initial 2010 guidance a year ago. Portfolio occupancy remains within the same tight range that we've seen throughout the past two years, really reflecting the strength of our end field portfolio even during tough economic times. Same-center NOI was flat excluding redevelopments and down 90 basis points including redevelopments compared to third quarter of '09. The redevelopment pool continues to be negatively impacted on a comparative basis due to the decline in lease term fee income largely because of the Home Depot lease term fee at Flourtown Shopping Center. These tougher lease term fee comps will continue to impact our quarterly same-center numbers through the first quarter of next year and have a meaningful impact on our projected same-center, including redevelopment number for full year 2011. In total, the $5 million expected decline in same-center lease term fees expected in '11 equates to roughly 150 basis points of same-center growth for the next few weeks.
As Don discussed, the topline growth of 3.2% was offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses included an increase in demo cost and non-recovered pairs and maintenance. Demo cost, the largest impact of non-cam expenses in the quarter of about $500,000 are value-added expenses associated with getting spaces ready for occupancy by tenants such as Nordstrom Rack at Friendship Center, Neiman Marcus' Last Call Studio at Congressional, Dick's Sporting Goods at Governor Plaza, and LA Fitness in the associated redevelopment at Crossridge in Chicago. All strong lease feels signed over the past few quarters both from a rent and a merchandising perspective. While these four deals will minimally contribute a revenue in 2010, they are expected to generate almost $2 million in 2011 and will provide increased value beyond the rent contribution. Items such as demo costs, repairs and maintenance, and lease term fees can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter, which is the primary reason we utilize full year resident [ph] quarterly guidance metrics in looking at our portfolio.
With respect to the balance sheet, we're really in a great position to play offense for the right properties. Very low leverage of 26% on a market cap basis and 42% on a book basis. Fixed-charge coverage more than 3x, debt to EBITDA of only 5x and secured debt making up only 13% of our total book assets. The quantity of the balance sheet is so important as many of the deals we're looking at today come with outsized in-place mortgage debt that we can absorb with little impact to our credit. In addition, we begun to process of choosing our leads for the recast of our credit facility that comes due in July next year. The man so far from high-quality financial institutions has been very strong, with banks generally focused on the best credits, making us confident in our ability to upsize a credit facility while setting a new standard for pricing. More to come on the credit facility recast as we move through the process early next year.
Before getting to the specifics of our guidance, let's focus on a couple of big picture items. The quality of our portfolio has allowed us to maintain very solid portfolio metrics throughout this economic downturn. 2008 property operating income was higher than 2007. 2009 was higher than 2008. 2010 is going to be higher than 2009, and we're expecting 2011 to be higher than 2010. I don't believe there's another peer out there that can point to that record of consistency during the same period. In addition, we've avoided material impairments, achieved positive lease rollover every year, maintained strong and steady occupancy, reserved the conservative balance sheet with no significant equity delusion and had paid an increased common dividend in cash. I couldn't be prouder of the performance of the portfolio and our employees over that period.
Moving on to guidance, we've tightened, not increased, our FFO per share guidance range for 2010 to $3.85 to $3.87. We're currently looking at full year 2010 property leasing, store property operating income growth at/or above the top end of our previous expectations of 1% to 1½% growth. Some of this growth was being offset FFO line due to increases in G&A, including over $0.01 associated with Don's new comp package, an acquisition cost of $700,000 or another $0.01 in 2010. In total, we're expecting our acquisitions to be slightly dilutive toward 2010 results, as the timing of these deals occurred late in the year and transaction cost or expense as the deals close.''
As for 2011, we're providing initial FFO per share guidance of $3.95 to $4.02, which will be record FFO per share performance despite economic pressures. A couple of key items to note here. First, with respect to occupancy, we're calling for a continuation of our steady occupancy with no material changes. Second, as we discussed on the first and second quarter calls, the acceleration of the Home Depot lease term fee provides a very though comp on this line item. We're calling for a $5 million decrease in lease term fees on a year-over-year basis with over $3 million coming from Home Depot alone. Despite this decrease, which equates to over 150 basis point impact to full year same-center growth, we're looking at positive same-center growth of 1% in 2011.
Don's new comp package results an additional $0.04 of G&A in 2011. And finally, consistent with prior years, we're not including any acquisition activity in this guidance. In addition, please recognize as we experienced in 2010, the expensing of acquisition costs will negatively impact FFO in the period the acquisition occurs. As a result, acquisitions could have a negative impact on full year FFO depending on the timing of any acquisitions we've made. 
That's all I've got. Operator, we'll now turn it over to questions."

The idea of balancing FFO growth with redeploying capital and certainly your point of being able to do that better when there are acquisition opportunities is right on. And there's no question about that. We look very hard at each asset. We look at the value that we've created or not created over the last period of time and what it is that we expect to be able to do over the next five years or seven years, or to the extent we're sitting there and we're challenged. We're going to compare that with the ability to monetize it or to do something else with the asset. So yes, we're looking really hard at that.

On Santana, we looked at the timing of construction prices and we said, ""There is no question that any time anybody is living or staying even overnight at Santana in the form of either the hotel, the rental product that we have or the condos."" That it carries such a premium because of what happened on the ground floor and even though, look, it's an awful top tough time to be adding new product, if you sit and think about it in the worst part of 2009 when we started, we simply know we can get the right construction costs to get this done, and we know that we're going to get that building filled up. And so we started and so as we got into this, we got more and more comfortable that yes, in fact, it was what's going to happen. There was real demand and look, we haven't leased one of those 109 units yet. It's under construction. So it's still just speculative. But it looks good enough to me, and we know we'll make some money someday for sure on the condo. I'm converting to condos but it looks we're going to make some good money just on the rentals, so much so that we kind of took the -- we've taken a hard look at the next piece of land, which we weren't going to do until we saw how this first project worked out behind, it's called Building A, one of the other buildings there. And so we'd like to get on it and jump on it now, and get started on it, which we are. So that positive outlook has everything to do with a specific location in field of Santana and I was trying to -- just kind of trying to allude to in my comments, Bethesda Row and Santana Row are two great examples of places where we really are seeing amazing traction these days. And part of it's maturity of the property. Part of it is maturity of the merchandising mix and some tweaking that we're doing there. But there's some momentum at that type of product that's one of the things we like about the first couple of buildings certainly on Newbury, certainly what we like about Third Street Promenade. So very positive stuff that way. It's also impacting how we feel about Assemble, in terms of what Assembly could be down the road. And so maybe let me leave it at that and just ask your question about the ABB deal to Dawn."

What we've talked to Avalon about is really they'll be coming in with us on the first phase of the development, which would be three buildings to really get the project started with 400 residential units and about 225,000 square feet of retail to supplement the assembly Square Mall, which has 300,000-plus square feet of retail just across away from it. So it's the first starting point and what we have worked through with Avalon right now are really how we're going to build this project together. And much as you've seen before with us, Avalon is going to build the project, we buyback the retail. So we'll control the retail long term, Avalon will control the residential long term. I don't want to get into financial specifics of anything at this point. But that's the groundwork for it. And where we are at this point is everybody is working hard on the Avalon side on their due diligence to confirm where they are. And I think based on everything we've seen and the work they've done in advance, everyone is feeling very positive that from their perspective on the residential that we've got a good project going forward and we're seeing some really great interest from a lot of the retailers we're talking about, particularly entertainment venues as well as retail, as well as the restaurants out there. So that's how it's going to play out over the next several months. With hopefully the public funding coming together, so sometime I think as Don said towards the end of '11, we'd be able to have all the pieces really hitting our stride and get that first phase of development up and running to be the catalyst for the rest of the development out there."

And really from the beginning of this thing, I said well, okay we're sitting there with a yielding landslide. It started at seven basically which I viewed wonderfully, in terms of starting with that and having this other big piece of land behind it. Now we have a bunch more of that land to buy if we wanted to do something and we have done that over the years. But so we started 100 with the seven. We did knock down on the existing development site about $1.5 million worth of some pretty sloppy retail, but no offense to anybody [indiscernible] but pretty sloppy retail, a couple of years back. And so we've got remaining about $5.5 million or so of income. At the same time we bought a lot of additional pieces of land and so you're absolutely right, $190 million is certainly is not supported by $5.5 million of NOI, in terms of a value creation, value creative proposition, works for accounting not value creation. And so the idea of what we do going forward, how we do it in pieces, we're doing very much on a phase by phase justifiable basis, and this would be the first phase of development. In my view, it's second phase of Assembly Row."

Good afternoon, everyone.

Third quarter FFO per share of $0.95 grew by 3.3% over the prior year and significantly, that's the best quarter-over-quarter performance we've had since first quarter of '09. We would expect that trend to continue into the fourth quarter and therefore, feel comfortable guiding 2010 FFO per share to the narrow range of $3.85 to $3.87. It also makes me optimistic that we'll be able to achieve the thus far elusive $4 a share threshold in 2011, as Andy will talk about later. Consumer spending remains sluggish and unemployment remains high, it's hard to expect much of a change over the next 12 months that way. But given those conditions, if we were able to achieve $4 a share next year or even a bit higher, we'd be generating solid 4% growth plus the higher dividend over a near all-time earnings record this year, not growth over a significantly diluted year. In other words, no easy comps at Federal.
Separately, we just got some great news in the resolution of our lawsuit with Renato that as you may remember, centered around our rights, along with our partners' rights, Post Property, to buy the land under our Pentagon Row property. We won the suit earlier in the year and Renato petitioned for appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court shortly after that judgment. That petition was denied a couple of days ago, and we would therefore expect to close in the coming weeks or months on the land. It's a great deal and value enhancer to the entire Pentagon Row income stream. 
Alright, let's dig into the quarter a bit and start by talking about top line results and indications about expectations for the future top line growth. Rental income grew by 3.2% in the quarter including recoveries, which is basically a same-store number given the limited new activity in the last year or so. And that's a very good sign as to the health of the portfolio. Cash basis leads rollover growth 6% in the quarter, 17% on a straight-line basis. It's another good sign for higher future cash flows and that growth was pretty evenly spread between leases for new tenants and renewals of existing ones. Overall occupancy grew modestly year-over-year from 93.1% to 93.3%, solid, but we've got room to improve further there. At the rental income line, both for the quarter and looking into the future, portfolio continues to perform well and remains extremely solid and stable. 
Now during the quarter, higher expenses offset the top line growth resulting in flat same-center operating income and actually, it was slightly negative when you consider properties in various stages of redevelopment. Both of those larger properties and redevelopment, by the way, will be contributing beginning in the fourth quarter, as tenants come online and start paying rent. In addition, demolition cost and future redevelopment was also a factor in the quarter. Otherwise, the higher operating expenses during the quarter were mostly a matter of quarterly timing of various maintenance projects and don't affect our previous estimates of same-center operating income growth for the full year of 1% to 1½%. In fact, it looks like we'll be at the high end of that range or maybe even exceed it for the year.
I went back and I looked at the forward-looking comments that I made on this call back in August concerning our view of the major markets we do business in, as well as the leasing and operating environment, and I've got to say it all still applies. Retailers want to get deals done in virtually all the markets we do business in, but with a tough cost conscious mentality that's here to stay in all but the best locations. Washington D.C. remains the strongest of our markets with California the weakest, though improving, particularly at Santana Row. All of the smaller potential acquisitions I talked about on the second quarter call are on track to close by the end of the year and will benefit 2011.
Let me spend a few minutes talking about some of the initiatives we're working on these days because between the developments, the redevelopments and the re-tenanting projects that we also have in various phases of execution, along with what feels to me a lot like more acquisition opportunities worth looking at, I'm optimistic that we're starting to see a clearer roadmap to additional value creation in the quarters and years ahead. Beginning with the most certain of value enhancers, it's always been for us to start in Bethesda Row. Our completely redeveloped $14 million building on Hampden Lane is done on time, on budget and is fully leased. Rent from all tenants, including the building's flagship Equinox Health Club, begins during this fourth quarter and when combined with some key re-tenanting moves that were made elsewhere in Bethesda really has helped one of our most successful mixed-use developments shift into an even higher gear. 
Out at Santana Row, we're well out of the ground on our 109-unit apartment building. Here also, we're on time and we're on budget thus far with rental prospect strong enough as to cause us to speed up planning on the next phase of residential development there, which would create an additional 150 to 200 apartments. Demand for our completed office over retail building in Santana has also picked up and the first rent-paying tenants there will begin contributing by the end of this year. In addition, we just executed a new lease with exclusive luxury electric car manufacturer, Tesla at Santana, which would be their first and only new prototypical showroom anywhere. Keep an eye on Santana over the next several years. There's lots of momentum underway there.
Planning for a significant mixed-use development at Mid-Pike Plaza moves closer and closer to the zoning approvals and a viable phase development plan that should add a lot of value to that great piece of land for the next 10-plus years, hopefully with first phase construction starting in 2012. And of course, Assembly Row, our project in Somerville, Massachusetts just outside of Boston. I gave a pretty full update last quarter, which still applies, including all my caveats. But it surely has promise and since that last call, we've taken the handshake deal that we had with AvalonBay to buy the rights to build the first 400 apartments on the site and as of yesterday, turned it into a signed contract. Design now starts in earnest, and we hope to have a late 2011 construction start, if and in fact, T-Stop construction at the site is imminent. We'll know more about that in the next couple of months.
And while we have no significant acquisitions to announce this quarter, we sure are working on a fair number of potential deals for some truly high quality stuff. Some street retail oriented product in the Northeast, some larger necessity based retail in both Florida and California, and a smattering of other strong quality properties in our remaining markets. All that has me encouraged that we'll be able to find a way to add product to our portfolio in the next couple of quarters that we can surely work over the next bunch of years.
Pricing expectations remain high by almost all standards, but at least it appears that the future earnings potential of these properties can justify then. And that's a subtle change from what we've been seeing in the recent past. We're starting to see the first glimpses to a path of real estate value creation led by retail and non-retail development and re-tenanting opportunities, along with some new raw material in the form of high-quality real estate for sale that may be able to work into an even stronger position. That's all happening despite what remains a very challenging economic environment and a persistent futile longing for a return to the good old days of 2006, 2007. It certainly isn't happening. 
That's all I've got for my prepared remarks this morning. And I'll turn it over to Andy, and look forward to your questions after that."

I'm going to begin my prepared remarks with a more detailed review of our third quarter performance for a brief discussion of the balance sheet, and then an overview of our outlook and guidance for 2011. After th",1078,"Thanks, Don, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to begin my prepared remarks with a more detailed review of our third quarter performance for a brief discussion of the balance sheet, and then an overview of our outlook and guidance for 2011. After that, we'll turn the call over to your questions. 
To start, Federal Realty once again produced positive lease rollovers of 6% on a cash basis and 17% on a GAAP basis. We maintain physical occupancy levels in the portfolio of 93.3%. On the year-to-date basis, rollovers are 8% on a cash basis, 19% on a GAAP basis, very much in line with the expectations we set with our initial 2010 guidance a year ago. Portfolio occupancy remains within the same tight range that we've seen throughout the past two years, really reflecting the strength of our end field portfolio, even during tough economic times. Same-center NOI was flat excluding redevelopments and down 90 basis points including redevelopments compared to third quarter of '09. The redevelopment pool continues to be negatively impacted on a comparative basis due to the decline in lease term fee income largely because of the Home Depot lease term fee at Flourtown Shopping Center. These tougher lease term fee comps will continue to impact our quarterly same-center numbers through the first quarter of next year and have a meaningful impact upon our projected same-center, including redevelopment number for full year 2011. In total, the $5 million expected decline in same-center lease term fees expected in '11 equates to roughly 150 basis points of same-center growth for the next year.
As Don discussed, the top line growth of 3.2% was offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses included an increase in demo costs and non-recovered pairs and maintenance. Demo cost, the largest impact of non-cam expenses in the quarter of about $500,000 are value-added expenses associated with getting spaces ready for occupancy by tenants such as Nordstrom Rack at Friendship Center, Neiman Marcus' Last Call Studio at Congressional, Dick's Sporting Goods at Governor Plaza, and LA Fitness in the associated redevelopment at Crossridge in Chicago, all strong lease deals signed over the past few quarters both from a rent and a merchandising perspective. While these four deals will minimally contribute a revenue in 2010, they are expected to generate almost $2 million in 2011 and will provide increased value beyond a rent contribution. Items such as demo costs, repairs and maintenance, and lease term fees can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter, which is the primary reason we utilize full year resident [ph] quarterly guidance metrics in looking at our portfolio.
With respect to the balance sheet, we're really in a great position to play offense for the right properties. Very low leverage of 26% on a market cap basis and 42% on a book basis. Fixed-charge coverage more than 3x, debt to EBITDA of only 5x and secured debt making up only 13% of our total book assets. The quality of the balance sheet is so important, as many of the deals we're looking at today come with outsized in-place mortgage debt that we can absorb with little impact to our credit. In addition, we've begun the process of choosing our leads for the recast of our credit facility that comes due in July of next year. Demand so far from high-quality financial institutions has been very strong, with banks generally focused on the best credits, making us confident in our ability to upsize a credit facility while setting a new standard for pricing. More to come on the credit facility recast as we move through the process early next year.
Before getting to the specifics of our guidance, let's focus on a couple of big picture items. The quality of our portfolio has allowed us to maintain very solid portfolio metrics throughout this economic downturn. 2008 property operating income was higher than 2007. 2009 was higher than 2008. 2010's going to be higher than 2009, and we're expecting 2011 to be higher than 2010. I don't believe there's another peer out there that can point to that record of consistency during the same period. In addition, we've avoided material impairments, achieved positive lease rollover every year, maintained strong and steady occupancy, reserved a conservative balance sheet with no significant equity delusion and had paid an increased common dividend in cash. I couldn't be prouder of the performance of the portfolio and our employees over that period.
Moving on to guidance, we've tightened, not increased, our FFO per share guidance range for 2010 to $3.85 to $3.87. We're currently looking at full year 2010 property, a same-store property operating income growth at/or above the top end of our previous expectations of 1% to 1½% growth. Some of this growth is being offset at the FFO line due to increases in G&A, including over $0.01 associated with Don's new comp package, and acquisition costs of $700,000 or another $0.01 in 2010. In total, we're expecting our acquisitions to be slightly dilutive to our 2010 results, as the timing of these deals occurred late in the year and transaction costs or expense as the deals close.
As for 2011, we're providing initial FFO per share guidance of $3.95 to $4.02, which will be record FFO per share performance despite the economic pressures. A couple of key items to note here. First, with respect to occupancy, we're calling for a continuation of our steady occupancy with no material changes. Second, as we discussed on the first and second quarter calls, the acceleration of the Home Depot lease term fee provides a very though comp on this line item. We're calling for a $5 million decrease in lease term fees on a year-over-year basis with over $3 million coming from Home Depot alone. Despite this decrease, which equates to over 150 basis point impact to full year same-center growth, we're looking at positive same-center growth of 1% in 2011.
Don's new comp package results in an additional $0.04 of G&A in 2011. And finally, consistent with prior years, we're not including any acquisition activity in this guidance. In addition, please recognize as we experienced in 2010, the expensing of acquisition costs will negatively impact FFO in the period the acquisition occurs. As a result, acquisitions could have a negative impact on full year FFO, depending on the timing of any acquisitions we've made. 
That's all I've got. Operator, we'll now turn it over to questions."

I mean, first of all, the answer to that whether they're in those markets, which for the reason you just said, are more likely to be disposed of or even in our core markets. The idea of balancing FFO growth with redeploying capital and certainly your point of being able to do that better when there are acquisition opportunities is right on. And there's no question about that. We look very hard at each asset. We look at the value that we've created or not created over the last period of time and what it is that we expect to be able to do over the next five years or seven years. And to the extent we're sitting there and we're challenged, we're going to compare that with the ability to monetize it or to do something else with the asset. So yes, we're looking really hard at that. And I think you bring up the key point and that is, you have to be able to redeploy to capital. And so to the extent we've got opportunities and those prospects are better, clearly better than they've been, then you may see some of that."

The competition is many and varies on some deals, especially those that are fully marketed and takes the form now of private individuals that can mortgage that again and takes the form of our public peers.

As you know, a lot of our focus is trying to dig stuff up, dealing directly with owners and a lot of those cases we're the only ones talking to the owner or it's just a small group. And again, this a small group. We could have one or two from each of the major buyer groups that I mentioned; just kind of depends on the deal and what it is and where it is. You think really, it's a lot more. As Dawn mentioned, a lot more properties that we like are coming to market and a lot more owners that own properties that we like are willing to engage in a sale discussion today than they have been over the past four, five, six, seven quarters.

And so we do see some of those going away, it's just not that much. And so one of the things that I looked at, in fact, I just took our board through yesterday, was the amount of kind of a combination of bad debt and vacancies and rent relief. All of those things that deduct, if you will, from gross rent potential and where you see is kind of the second half a year plan out is actually very similar to the first half of the year and when you look 2010 over 2009, also very similar, not a lot better and not a lot worse.

There's no question that when you take the Federal portfolio and you take the top 20%, the bottom 20% and the middle stuff, there's no question that the bottom 20% of Federal's shopping centers, when I look at that at what the environment is there, those centers in particular would have more issues with small shop tenants than elsewhere, the top 20%, the Bethesda Row [indiscernible] is one of the strongest parts of the shopping center. So again, you kind of have to put -- geography trumps categorization of small shop regional and national. So within that context, when I look at -- I look at our bottom 20% and I think about some of the struggles we have in those centers on small shop and I do think, boy, if you're talking to another company that has more of that product type, it's a real issue. I get it, all day long. By the same token, if we had more of that top 20%, I think we'd be saying, ""What? We don't even understand what the issue is that you're talking about.""

This seems to be a very competitive environment right now on those categories, really trying to find locations. Obviously, they're encumbered by parking restrictions and other things that really restrict the amount that a landlord could put within its portfolio, but that category, in general, seems to be very high. No specific tenant, but just that category as a whole. We are seeing in the marketplace, Don mentioned that we're doing better in the D.C. market. We're seeing a lot more mom-and-pop oriented deals, where they are coming in and back filling of the small shop vacancies. And then on a more national regional basis, the anchor tenant interest certainly seems to be there for the right locations, but I think Don, on a macro level, really summarized it very well. It really depends on the quality of real estate. They're looking for markets that have the attributes of Federal's portfolio density of population, various to entry, places where they know it's basically a no-brainer for them to open business and they can generate sales."

On Santana, we looked at the timing of construction prices and we said, there is no question that anytime anybody is living or staying even overnight at Santana in the form of either the hotel, the rental product that we have or the condos, that it carries such a premium because of what happens on the ground floor and even though, look, it's an awful tough time to be adding new product. If you sit and think about, it in the worst part of 2009 when we started, we said we know we can get the right construction costs to get this done, and we know that we're going to get that building filled up. And so we started and so as we got into this, we got more and more comfortable that yes, in fact, that was what was going to happen. There was real demand and look, we haven't leased one of those 109 units yet. It's under construction. So it's still just speculative. But it looks good enough to me, and we know we'll make money someday for sure on the condo. I'm converting it to condos, but it looks we're going to make some pretty good money just on the rentals, so much so that we kind of took the -- we've taken a hard look at the next piece of land, which we weren't going to do until we saw how this first project worked out behind, it's called Building A, one of the other buildings there. And so we'd like to get on it and jump on it now, and get started on it, which we are. So that positive outlook has everything to do with the specific location and feel of Santana and I was trying to -- I’ve been trying to allude to in my comments, Bethesda Row and Santana Row are two great examples of places where we really are seeing amazing traction these days. And part of it's maturity of the property. Part of it is maturity of the merchandising mix and some tweaking that we're doing there. But there's some momentum at that type of product. That's one of the things we like about the first couple of buildings certainly on Newbury, certainly what we like about Third Street Promenade. So very positive stuff that way. It's also impacting how we feel about Assembly, in terms of what Assembly could be down the road. And so maybe let me leave it at that and just ask your question about the ABB deal to Dawn."

What we've talked to Avalon about is really they'll be coming in with us on the first phase of the development, which would be three buildings to really get the project started with 400 residential units and about 225,000 square feet of retail to supplement the Assembly Square Mall, which has 300,000-plus square feet of retail just across the way from it. So it's the first starting point and what we have worked through with Avalon right now are really how we're going to build this project together. And much as you've seen before with us, Avalon's going to build the project, we buy back the retail. So we'll control the retail long term, Avalon will control the residential long term. I don't want to get into financial specifics of anything at this point, but that's the groundwork for it. And where we are at this point is everybody is working hard on the Avalon side on their due diligence to confirm where they are. And I think based on everything we've seen and the work they've done in advance, everyone's feeling very positive that from their perspective on the residential that we've got a good project going forward and we're seeing some really great interest from a lot of the retailers we're talking about, particularly entertainment venues as well as retail, as well as the restaurants out there. So that's all going to play out over the next several months, with hopefully the public funding coming together. So sometime I think as Don said towards the end of '11, we'd be able to have all the pieces really hitting their stride and get that first phase of development up and running to be the catalyst for the rest of the development out there."

When we bought the property, we spent $100 million on the existing mall and the completion of that existing mall and that threw off about around $7 million. And really from the beginning of this thing, I said well, okay so we're sitting there with a yielding landslide. It started at seven basically, which I viewed wonderfully in terms of starting with that and then having this other big piece of land behind it. Now we have a bunch more of that land to buy if we wanted to do something and we have done that over the years. But so we started 100 with the seven. We did knock down on the existing development site about $1.5 million worth of some pretty sloppy retail, but no offense to anybody that was there in the sloppy group, but some pretty sloppy retail a couple of years back. And so we've got remaining about $5.5 million or so of income. At the same time we've bought a lot of additional pieces of land and so you're absolutely right, $190 million certainly is not supported by $5.5 million of NOI, in terms of a value creation, value creative proposition, works for accounting not value creation. And so the idea of what we do going forward, how we do it in pieces, we're doing very much on a phase-by-phase justifiable basis, and this would be the first phase of development. In my view, second phase of Assembly Row."
