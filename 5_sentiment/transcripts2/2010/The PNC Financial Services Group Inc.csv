When I look bac",1604,"Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Given the environment that we had in 2009, I believe this was truly an exceptional year for PNC, thanks for the hard work and the dedication of nearly 56,000 employees. When I look back, 2009 was probably the most difficult economic year that I've seen in my 37 years of banking. But to rate my experience, these accomplishments are all the more impressive. For the full year and for the quarter, we had solid revenue performance. We managed our expenses effectively and we continue to grow clients. In the second half of the year, we began to see signs that the pace of credit deterioration had eased. We made substantial progress in transitioning our balance sheet throughout the year, working to institute our moderate risk philosophy throughout our expanded franchise. And we ended the year with a better balance sheet that had more transaction deposits, greater reserves and higher capital ratios. The acquisition of National City continues to exceed even our own expectations and the client conversion process is proceeding smoothly.And while the current regulatory environment remains uncertain, we expect greater reforms and additional regulatory changes. Given our values and our operating principles, we believe that we are well positioned to navigate through this process.Now turning to 2009's financial performance, we produced strong results in a very difficult economy by successfully executing our business model. We began 2009 with a strong deposit franchise and ended the year with an even stronger one. We remain core funded with a loan to deposit ratio of 84% as of December 31.By delivering full year revenue of $17 billion from our diverse revenue sources, I think we performed even better than some expected. And we're continuing to focus on expense management and as you know, we increased our guidance on the integration savings that we'll get from National City. And we produced pretax pre-provision earnings that exceeded our credit costs by $3.3 billion.Also, we added to our loan loss reserves throughout the year and in the quarter. We added marks to our purchase impaired loans. And you know we already had fair value marks on those that which were substantial. Additionally, we added reserves to our mortgage book. At this point, we feel good about our reserve coverage.As a result of these efforts, PNC delivered full year earnings of $2.4 billion or $4.36 per diluted common share. And while I've said this before, it bears repeating, other than the fourth quarter of 2008 when we took the $500 million conforming provision for National City's acquisition, PNC has been profitable in every quarter since the economic downturn began in the middle of 2007. Now turning to our customers and perhaps most importantly, we continued to see strong product sales activity in the fourth quarter. In fact, it was our best quarter of the year. Our client retention trends are strong in all markets, as reflected in our solid revenue performance. And we see meaningful product sales opportunities in legacy National City markets and the results continue to improve after we completed the customer conversions in the first half of 2010.Retail Banking had a solid year and continued to grow customers, when you exclude the required divestiture of the branches last summer. And we successfully implemented our pricing strategy with the acquired deposit franchise. And while this results in lower net interest income credit to the segment, it adds significant value to PNC's bottom line. And because of our conservative balance sheet management, we have further opportunity for increased profitability should rates turn higher.Our Corporate and Institutional Banking segment had a very good year and a strong fourth quarter despite the credit environment. We continue to see soft loan utilization among middle market and large corporate clients. However, we are seeing wider loan spreads. On the fee income side, our solid capital markets results included higher M&A fees in the fourth quarter. And we continued to see a strong performance throughout the year in treasury management and corporate finance fees. And our cross-selling of products and services to National City customers is increasing.Our Asset Management Group had a successful year despite the difficult credit market conditions. Strong revenue reflected the continued focus on client growth and retention. Expenses were well managed and the business pipeline is strong as we begin the new year. Residential Mortgage Banking, as you know, had a good year. Our strategic challenge in 2009 was to fill the nationwide mortgage companies that met our risk goals. To that end, we successfully transformed this business. PNC Mortgage is a top 10 retail mortgage provider with new management, new operating processes and a philosophy that reflects our moderate risk approach.Global Investment Servicing saw its earnings increase from quarter to quarter in 2009 due to improvements in the equity markets, the benefits from the expense reductions that were initiated in previous quarters and from new customer acquisition. In fact, all of their key servicing statistics increased throughout the year, resulting in full year earnings of $63 million. Total fund asset service were $2.3 trillion as of December 31, and this business continues to have a strong sales pipeline and I'm pleased with its relative performance.The Distressed Assets Portfolio is focused on maximizing the value of our distressed loans. We continue to make good progress in reducing our foreclosed assets and overall, we believe the marks that we have taken on these assets are appropriate.Now let me talk briefly about credit availability. PNC remains committed to responsible lending. We recognize the vital importance of credit to our country's economic growth, and we continue to work closely with main street businesses and consumers during these financially difficult times. In fact, we originated and renewed more than $110 billion in loans and commitments in 2009.For homeowners, our goal is to avoid foreclosure where appropriate. And we've been expanding our use of short sales as one tool to help consumers. Additionally, we have completed nearly $0.5 billion in refinances through the end of the fourth quarter under the Home Affordable Refinance Program. And we've sent out more than 70,000 workout packages to troubled borrowers under the Home Affordable Modification Program.On the Commercial side, we continue to call on small businesses and corporations. We have stepped up our efforts and are giving a second look to credit requests given the importance of credit to the economic recovery. As a result, we originated and renewed nearly $4 billion in small business loans in 2009, and we continue to be a leader in loan syndications, arranging nearly $14 billion in business loans for the full year.Now let me turn briefly to the integration of National City. I'm very pleased with our efforts. We successfully completed the first of four waves in November, converting 240 branches and 1.8 million customers located in Western Pennsylvania, Eastern Ohio and Florida. Our next conversion wave will begin February 19, involving more than 1 million National City consumer and business customers in Kentucky, Southeastern Indiana and Southern Ohio. We expect to complete the customer conversion process at midyear ahead of the original schedule. As I have said before, this transaction is proving to be even better than expected. And it was positive to shareholders on the first year.We made great progress in capturing the expense savings from the National City acquisition in 2009. For the full year, we achieved more than $800 million in cumulative cost savings versus our original goal of $600 million. We are now very confident we will achieve our new annualized cost savings target of $1.5 billion by June of 2011.  Achieving these cost savings goals sooner will enhance our ability to invest in our businesses today, in order to deliver innovative solutions and meet changing customer demands and build revenue momentum for the future.But through the year, we've been using this scorecard to reflect the progress we're making, as we integrate National City and apply PNC's business model to our new franchise. And the results continue to be very positive. Of course, these goals are not new. Rather, these represent where we were prior to the recession and our acquisition of National City and demonstrate our efforts as we work to transition our balance sheet and position the company for future growth. As evidenced by our full year performance, I believe we're making good progress against these targets. And as we look ahead to 2010, we'll be focused on the following priorities: First, we recognize that the current economic situation and soft loan demand will put some pressure on revenue. However, we ended 2009 with strong sales momentum, and we expect to continue in 2010 as we see additional opportunities to utilize our balance sheet flexibility. Second, we will continue to focus on effectively managing expenses and achieving our cost-saving targets and our credit cost improvement targets. Third, we will continue to transition our balance sheet in an effort to reduce higher risk asset classes and to maintain our flexibility in the face of changing interest rate scenarios. And fourth, we'll complete the conversions of National City clients and we see opportunities to gain clients across our expanded franchise and provide them with a full range of products and services. And finally, during the year, we will continue to effectively manage our capital and as for TARP , our plans are to repay it this year.When the economy recovers, we believe we'll be well positioned to deliver returns consistent with our historical performance in excess of 1.3% return on average assets. Now Rick will provide you with some more detail about our financial performance."

Today, I will focus on: One, the repositioning of our balance sheet to a lower risk profile; two, our continued ability to deliver pretax, pre-provision earnings exceeding our credit costs; three, the stabilization of our credit quality and the adequacy of our reserve levels; and four, the enhancement to our capital position throughout the year.As you can see on Slide 6, we continue to be pleased with the progress we've made throughout 2009 in transitioning to a higher quality balance sheet. Our loan portfolio decreased by $18 billion throughout the year, primarily due to lower demand for credit. The decline was driven primarily by lower utilization levels from commercial lending among middle market and large corporate clients, although this downward trend and utilization rates seems to have eased in the fourth quarter. Over the course of 2009, we increased our investment securities by $13 billion through the purchase of short duration agency and government securities, resulting in a higher quality and more liquid investment book. We continued that effort in the fourth quarter. Over the course of 2009, the net unrealized pretax loss on our investment securities improved by $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion as of year end, reflecting better market liquidity for our credit sensitive securities. The risk shifting and shorter duration of this portfolio has and will continue to result in lower yields in the portfolio in 2010. During 2009, our transaction deposits increased by $15 billion. Those increases were more than offset by the planned reduction of $12 billion of higher rate brokered CDs and $9 billion in retail CDs along with a reduction of $13 billion in borrowed funds. These reductions and lower pricing on the CD balances retained, resulted in a 91 basis point reduction in our cost of funds from a year ago.Our balance sheet at the end of 2009 continued to be asset sensitive with the duration of equity at negative one year. This is exactly where we want to be. It positions us well for either a rising or a steepening yield curve. Overall, the actions we took in 2009 to reduce the risk profile of our balance sheet have worked well. Now, let's talk about how we've been able to deliver quality earnings at the same time.In 2009, our ability to grow revenue and effectively manage expenses continued to deliver pretax, pre-provision earnings that more than covered our credit cost. For the full year, we delivered $17 billion in revenue and $7.3 billion in pretax, pre-provision earnings, which more than offset $3.9 billion of credit costs, resulting in net income of $2.4 billion or $4.36 per common share and driving a substantial increase in our capital position.In the fourth quarter, we delivered more than $5  billion in revenue and $2.7 billion in pretax, pre- provision earnings, which more than offset our provision slightly more than $1 billion. Fourth quarter net income was $1.1 billion or $2.17 per diluted common share. Excluding the BGI gain and integration cost, fourth quarter net income would've been $521 million or $0.90 per diluted common share. Noninterest income for the quarter of $2.7 billion was up over $900 million, primarily due to the BGI gain of $1.1 billion partially offset by a $100 million decrease in residential mortgage revenues, primary due to a decline in origination revenue.During the course of the quarter, we increased our loan origination recourse reserve by $50 million to cover expected agency putbacks of prime mortgage originations from our 2007 vintage. Net interest income of $2.3 billion was up $123 million, resulting in a margin of 4.05% driven by 140 million of final cash payoffs on impaired commercial loans. It appears our workout process of these loans over the course of 2009 is starting to pay off. However, I do not expect this levels of recovery to continue in 2010.Our fourth quarter provision for credit losses was slightly more than $1 billion, which is up $135 million from the third quarter. The primary driver of this increase was due to additional reserves required for certain impaired consumer loans. I do not expect this level of provisioning to continue so in effect, the net additional noninterest income from recoveries on commercial impaired loans was offset by additional reserves on consumer impaired loans. As we look ahead to the first quarter of 2010, we expect net interest income, net interest margin and the provision to be more in line with amounts we reported in the third quarter of 2009 rather than the current quarter.Now I thought you might be pleased to know that we have reinstated our purchase accounting disclosures on Page 8 of the financial supplement. Better yet, we've even added to these disclosures. Let me give you what I think is important about this information.First, I believe the combination of the marks and the incremental allowance of $5.4 billion or 36% on the impaired loans continue to be adequate and appropriate. Second, while we've added $500 million of provision on certain impaired loans in 2009, other impaired loans improved in value and we are expected to recover this value of $900 million over time, as we have increased our future accretable yield. Finally, as we look to the first quarter, we estimated scheduled purchase accounting accretion of about $320 million. Keep in mind that this could change if recoveries are better than expected or values continue improve.We continue to manage our expenses effectively. Our fourth quarter noninterest expenses were $2.4 billion, which was roughly flat linked quarter, as additional cost saves of $100 million exceeded a 66 million increase in integration costs. Our quarterly run rate of acquisition cost savings increased to $300 million per quarter or $1.2 billion per year. Clearly, our ability to deliver strong revenue and manage expenses has served us well and we have been more than able to cover our credit cost and increase capital.Now let's take a look at our credit quality trends on Slide 8. Early-stage and late-stage delinquencies continued to show signs of stabilization, as both were essentially flat linked quarter. While nonperforming loans increased by $550 million, they did so at a substantially slower pace. From last quarter, total nonperforming loans were up 11% compared with the growth rate of 23% in the prior quarter.You should also know that $220 million or a third of the increase was related to troubled debt restructurings, primarily of performing loans in the home equity and the residential mortgage portfolios. Should these loans perform for six months according to the modified terms, they will be restored to the performing status. As we have discussed before, our moderate risk philosophy calls for keeping our loan portfolio very granular. For example, none of our nonperforming assets were greater than $50 million at year end and the largest is currently trading in the market at $0.90 on the dollar.Net charge-offs are up this quarter from last by $185 million due to commercial real estate, which was up by $233 million. We were not surprised by the increase in net charge-offs, as we aligned our charge-off policy on small dollar commercial and commercial real estate as a result of the consolidation of the bank charters. This change in policy or alignment of policies increased our charge-offs in the quarter by $130 million.Our provision for credit cost this quarter exceeded net charge-offs, contributing to a $262 million increase in the allowance for losses to $5.1 billion or 3.22% of loans. Given our 2009 net charge-offs, we have reserve coverage of nearly 1.9 years, which is one of the highest coverage levels in the industry. Additionally, the mark on our impaired loans was $4.9 billion at the end of the quarter. This means we have $10 billion or more than 6% of our loan outstandings in reserve, which provides substantial support and against the risk associated with these assets.Now let's turn to Slide 9. We continue to strengthen our capital ratios throughout 2009. Our Tier 1 common ratio was consistently increased throughout 2009. It has grown to an estimated 6% as of December 31, 2009. And the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio increased to an estimated 11.5% at the end of 2009. Since year end 2008, we have increased common equity by $4.5 billion to $22 billion due to retained earnings and an after-tax improvement in our AOCL of $2 billion that I mentioned earlier.All in all, given the environment, 2009 has been an exceptional year. And with that, I'll hand it back to Jim."

Our proven business model continues to demonstrate its effectiveness. Clearly, we have established a framework for success. Our achievements only serve to enhance our ability to grow our banking franchise and to better serve our customers. Now turning to our expectations for 2010, first of all, we expect the economy to slowly improve. Second, we anticipate that we'll be able to continue to grow our relationship-based deposits and that will be offset by additional runoff of higher cost time deposits. And third, given the current economic conditions, we expect soft loan demand and low utilization rates.Now given these assumptions and turning to net interest income, it will likely be modestly lower as a result of additional runoff of higher-yielding assets. This could be mitigated by rising interest rates and customer growth. However, when you exclude the hedging gains related to the residential mortgage servicing, primarily in the first quarter and the BlackRock-BGI gain, we expect our customer-related noninterest income to be relatively flat depending upon the economy. We anticipate meaningful expense reductions, driven by integration cost saves and finally, we expect that we will see credit cost improvements in line with the pace of the economic recovery, remembering what Rick said about looking more like the third quarter. Putting these things together, we expect 2010 to be a good year. If the economy recovers faster than we expect or if interest rates rise, it could be even better. Thank you for listening, and we'll now take your questions."

When I look back",1604,"Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Given the environment that we had in 2009, I believe this was truly an exceptional year for PNC, thanks for the hard work and the dedication of nearly 56,000 employees. When I look back, 2009 was probably the most difficult economic year that I've seen in my 37 years of banking. But to rate my experience, these accomplishments are all the more impressive. For the full year and for the quarter, we had solid revenue performance. We managed our expenses effectively and we continue to grow clients. In the second half of the year, we began to see signs that the pace of credit deterioration had eased. We made substantial progress in transitioning our balance sheet throughout the year, working to institute our moderate risk philosophy throughout our expanded franchise. And we ended the year with a better balance sheet that had more transaction deposits, greater reserves and higher capital ratios. The acquisition of National City continues to exceed even our own expectations and the client conversion process is proceeding smoothly.And while the current regulatory environment remains uncertain, we expect greater reforms and additional regulatory changes. Given our values and our operating principles, we believe that we are well positioned to navigate through this process.Now turning to 2009's financial performance, we produced strong results in a very difficult economy by successfully executing our business model. We began 2009 with a strong deposit franchise and ended the year with an even stronger one. We remain core funded with a loan to deposit ratio of 84% as of December 31.By delivering full year revenue of $17 billion from our diverse revenue sources, I think we performed even better than some expected. And we're continuing to focus on expense management and as you know, we increased our guidance on the integration savings that we'll get from National City. And we produced pretax pre-provision earnings that exceeded our credit costs by $3.3 billion.Also, we added to our loan loss reserves throughout the year and in the quarter. We added marks to our purchase impaired loans. And you know we already had fair value marks on those that which were substantial. Additionally, we added reserves to our mortgage book. At this point, we feel good about our reserve coverage.As a result of these efforts, PNC delivered full year earnings of $2.4 billion or $4.36 per diluted common share. And while I've said this before, it bears repeating, other than the fourth quarter of 2008 when we took the $500 million conforming provision for National City's acquisition, PNC has been profitable in every quarter since the economic downturn began in the middle of 2007. Now turning to our customers and perhaps most importantly, we continued to see strong product sales activity in the fourth quarter. In fact, it was our best quarter of the year. Our client retention trends are strong in all markets, as reflected in our solid revenue performance. And we see meaningful product sales opportunities in legacy National City markets and the results continue to improve after we completed the customer conversions in the first half of 2010.Retail Banking had a solid year and continued to grow customers, when you exclude the required divestiture of the branches last summer. And we successfully implemented our pricing strategy with the acquired deposit franchise. And while this results in lower net interest income credit to the segment, it adds significant value to PNC's bottom line. And because of our conservative balance sheet management, we have further opportunity for increased profitability should rates turn higher.Our Corporate and Institutional Banking segment had a very good year and a strong fourth quarter despite the credit environment. We continue to see soft loan utilization among middle market and large corporate clients. However, we are seeing wider loan spreads. On the fee income side, our solid capital markets results included higher M&A fees in the fourth quarter. And we continued to see a strong performance throughout the year in treasury management and corporate finance fees. And our cross-selling of products and services to National City customers is increasing.Our Asset Management Group had a successful year despite the difficult credit market conditions. Strong revenue reflected the continued focus on client growth and retention. Expenses were well managed and the business pipeline is strong as we begin the new year. Residential Mortgage Banking, as you know, had a good year. Our strategic challenge in 2009 was to fill the nationwide mortgage companies that met our risk goals. To that end, we successfully transformed this business. PNC Mortgage is a top 10 retail mortgage provider with new management, new operating processes and a philosophy that reflects our moderate risk approach.Global Investment Servicing saw its earnings increase from quarter to quarter in 2009 due to improvements in the equity markets, the benefits from the expense reductions that were initiated in previous quarters and from new customer acquisition. In fact, all of their key servicing statistics increased throughout the year, resulting in full year earnings of $63 million. Total fund asset service were $2.3 trillion as of December 31, and this business continues to have a strong sales pipeline and I'm pleased with its relative performance.The Distressed Assets Portfolio is focused on maximizing the value of our distressed loans. We continue to make good progress in reducing our foreclosed assets and overall, we believe the marks that we have taken on these assets are appropriate.Now let me talk briefly about credit availability. PNC remains committed to responsible lending. We recognize the vital importance of credit to our country's economic growth, and we continue to work closely with main street businesses and consumers during these financially difficult times. In fact, we originated and renewed more than $110 billion in loans and commitments in 2009.For homeowners, our goal is to avoid foreclosure where appropriate. And we've been expanding our use of short sales as one tool to help consumers. Additionally, we have completed nearly $0.5 billion in refinances through the end of the fourth quarter under the Home Affordable Refinance Program. And we've sent out more than 70,000 workout packages to troubled borrowers under the Home Affordable Modification Program.On the Commercial side, we continue to call on small businesses and corporations. We have stepped up our efforts and are giving a second look to credit requests given the importance of credit to the economic recovery. As a result, we originated and renewed nearly $4 billion in small business loans in 2009, and we continue to be a leader in loan syndications, arranging nearly $14 billion in business loans for the full year.Now let me turn briefly to the integration of National City. I'm very pleased with our efforts. We successfully completed the first of four waves in November, converting 240 branches and 1.8 million customers located in Western Pennsylvania, Eastern Ohio and Florida. Our next conversion wave will begin February 19, involving more than 1 million National City consumer and business customers in Kentucky, Southeastern Indiana and Southern Ohio. We expect to complete the customer conversion process at midyear ahead of the original schedule. As I have said before, this transaction is proving to be even better than expected. And it was positive to shareholders on the first year.We made great progress in capturing the expense savings from the National City acquisition in 2009. For the full year, we achieved more than $800 million in cumulative cost savings versus our original goal of $600 million. We are now very confident we will achieve our new annualized cost saving target of $1.5 billion by June of 2011.  Achieving these cost savings goals sooner will enhance our ability to invest in our businesses today in order to deliver innovative solutions and meet changing customer demands and build revenue momentum for the future.But through the year, we've been using this scorecard to reflect the progress we're making, as we integrate National City and apply PNC's business model to our new franchise. And the results continue to be very positive. Of course, these goals are not new. Rather, these represent where we were prior to the recession and our acquisition of National City, and demonstrate our efforts as we work to transition our balance sheet and position the company for future growth. As evidenced by our full year performance, I believe we're making good progress against these targets. And as we look ahead to 2010, we'll be focused on the following priorities. First, we recognize that the current economic situation and soft loan demand will put some pressure on revenue. However, we ended 2009 with strong sales momentum, and we expect to continue in 2010 as we see additional opportunities to utilize our balance sheet flexibility. Second, we will continue to focus on effectively managing expenses, and achieving our cost-saving targets and our credit cost improvement targets. Third, we will continue to transition our balance sheet in an effort to reduce higher risk asset classes and to maintain our flexibility in the face of changing interest rate scenarios. And fourth, we'll complete the conversions of National City clients, and we see opportunities to gain clients across our expanded franchise and provide them with a full range of products and services. And finally, during the year, we will continue to effectively manage our capital. And as for TARP , our plans are to repay it this year.When the economy recovers, we believe we'll be well positioned to deliver returns consistent with our historical performance in excess of 1.3% return on average assets. Now Rick will provide you with some more detail about our financial performance."

Today, I will focus on: One, the repositioning of our balance sheet to a lower risk profile; two, our continued ability to deliver pretax, pre-provision earnings exceeding our credit costs; three, stabilization of our credit quality and the adequacy of our reserve levels; and four, the enhancement to our capital position throughout the year.As you can see on Slide 6, we continue to be pleased with the progress we've made throughout 2009 in transitioning to a higher quality balance sheet. Our loan portfolio decreased by $18 billion throughout the year, primarily due to lower demand for credit. The decline was driven primarily by lower utilization levels for commercial lending among middle market and large corporate clients, although this downward trend and utilization rates seems to have eased in the fourth quarter. Over the course of 2009, we increased our investment securities by $13 billion through the purchase of short duration agency and government securities, resulting in a higher quality and more liquid investment book. We continued that effort in the fourth quarter. Over the course of 2009, the net unrealized pretax loss on our investment securities improved by $3.1 billion to $2.3 billion as of year end, reflecting better market liquidity for our credit-sensitive securities. The risk shifting and shorter duration of this portfolio has and will continue to result in lower yields in the portfolio in 2010. During 2009, our transaction deposits increased by $15 billion. Those increases were more than offset by the planned reduction of $12 billion of higher rate brokered CDs and $9 billion in retail CDs, along with a reduction of $13 billion in borrowed funds. These reductions and lower pricing on the CD balances retained, resulted in a 91 basis point reduction in our cost of funds from a year ago.Our balance sheet at the end of 2009 continued to be asset sensitive with the duration of equity of negative one year. This is exactly where we want to be. It positions us well for either a rising or a steepening yield curve. Overall, the actions we took in 2009 to reduce the risk profile of our balance sheet have worked well. Now, let's talk about how we've been able to deliver quality earnings at the same time.In 2009, our ability to grow revenue and effectively manage expenses, continue to deliver pretax pre-provision earnings that more than covered our credit cost. For the full year, we delivered $17 billion in revenue and $7.3 billion in pretax pre-provision earnings, which more than offset $3.9 billion of credit costs, resulting in net income of $2.4 billion or $4.36 per common share, and driving a substantial increase in our capital position.In the fourth quarter, we delivered more than $5  billion in revenue and $2.7 billion in pretax pre- provision earnings, which more than offset our provision slightly more than $1 billion. Fourth quarter net income was $1.1 billion or $2.17 per diluted common share. Excluding the BGI gain and integration cost, fourth quarter net income would've been $521 million or $0.90 per diluted common share. Non-interest income for the quarter of $2.7 billion was up over $900 million, primarily due to the BGI gain of $1.1 billion, partially offset by a $100 million decrease in residential mortgage revenues, primarily due to a decline in origination revenue.During the course of the quarter, we increased our loan origination recourse reserve by $50 million to cover expected agency putbacks of prime mortgage originations from our 2007 vintage. Net interest income of $2.3 billion was up $123 million, resulting in a margin of 4.05% driven by 140 million of final cash payoffs on impaired commercial loans. It appears our workout process of these loans over the course of 2009 is starting to pay off. However, I do not expect this level of recovery to continue in 2010.Our fourth quarter provision for credit losses was slightly more than $1 billion, which is up $135 million from the third quarter. The primary driver of this increase was due to additional reserves required for certain impaired consumer loans. I do not expect this level of provisioning to continue so in effect, the net additional net interest income from recoveries on commercial impaired loans was offset by additional reserves on consumer impaired loans. As we look ahead to the first quarter of 2010, we expect net interest income, net interest margin and the provision to be more in line with amounts we reported in the third quarter of 2009 rather than the current quarter.Now I thought you might be pleased to know that we have reinstated our purchase accounting disclosures on Page 8 of the financial supplement. Better yet, we've even added to these disclosures. Let me give you what I think is important about this information.First, I believe the combination of the marks and the incremental allowance of $5.4 billion or 36% on the impaired loans continue to be adequate and appropriate. Second, while we've added $500 million of provision on certain impaired loans in 2009, other impaired loans improved in value and we are expected to recover this value of $900 million over time as we have increased our future accretable yield. Finally, as we look to the first quarter, we estimated schedule purchase accounting accretion of about $320 million. Keep in mind that this could change if recoveries are better than expected or values continue to improve.We continue to manage our expenses effectively. Our fourth quarter non-interest expenses were $2.4 billion, which was roughly flat linked quarter, as additional cost saves of $100 million exceeded a $66 million increase in integration costs. Our quarterly run rate of acquisition cost savings increased to $300 million per quarter or $1.2 billion per year. Clearly, our ability to deliver strong revenue and manage expenses has served us well, and we have been more than able to cover our credit cost and increase capital.Now let's take a look at our credit quality trends on Slide 8. Early-stage and late-stage delinquencies continue to show signs of stabilization, as both were essentially flat linked quarter. While non-performing loans increased by $550 million, they did so at a substantially slower pace. From last quarter, total non-performing loans were up 11% compared with the growth rate of 23% in the prior quarter.You should also know that $220 million or a third of the increase was related to troubled debt restructurings, primarily of performing loans in the home equity and the residential mortgage portfolios. Should these loans perform for six months according to the modified terms, they will be restored to the performing status. As we have discussed before, our moderate risk philosophy calls for keeping our loan portfolio very granular. For example, none of our nonperforming assets were greater than $50 million at year end and the largest is currently trading in the market at $0.90 on the dollar.Net charge-offs are up this quarter from last by $185 million due to commercial real estate, which was up by $233 million. We were not surprised by the increase in net charge-offs, as we aligned our charge-off policy on small dollar commercial and commercial real estate as a result of the consolidation of the bank charters. This change in policy or alignment of policies increased our charge-offs in the quarter by $130 million.Our provision for credit cost this quarter exceeded net charge-offs, contributing to a $262 million increase in the allowance for losses to $5.1 billion or 3.22% of loans. Given our 2009 net charge-offs, we have reserve coverage of nearly 1.9 years, which is one of the highest coverage levels in the industry. Additionally, the mark on our impaired loans was $4.9 billion at the end of the quarter. This means we have $10 billion or more than 6% of our loan outstandings in reserve, which provides substantial support and against the risk associated with these assets.Now let's turn to Slide 9. We continue to strengthen our capital ratios throughout 2009. Our Tier 1 common ratio was consistently increased throughout 2009. It has grown to an estimated 6% as of December 31, 2009. And the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio increased to an estimated 11.5% at the end of 2009. Since year end 2008, we have increased common equity by $4.5 billion to $22 billion due to retained earnings and an after-tax improvement in our AOCL of $2 billion that I mentioned earlier.All in all, given the environment, 2009 has been an exceptional year. And with that, I'll hand it back to Jim."

Our proven business model continues to demonstrate its effectiveness. Clearly, we have established a framework for success. Our achievements only serve to enhance our ability to grow our banking franchise and to better serve our customers. Now turning to our expectations for 2010, first of all, we expect the economy to slowly improve. Second, we anticipate that we'll be able to continue to grow our relationship-based deposits and that will be offset by additional runoff of higher cost time deposits. And third, given the current economic conditions, we expect soft loan demand and low utilization rates.Now given these assumptions and turning to net interest income, it will likely be modestly lower as a result of additional runoff of higher-yielding assets. This could be mitigated by rising interest rates and customer growth. However, when you exclude the hedging gains related to the residential mortgage servicing, primarily in the first quarter and the BlackRock-BGI gain, we expect our customer-related non-interest income to be relatively flat depending upon the economy. We anticipate meaningful expense reductions, driven by integration cost saves and finally, we expect that we will see credit cost improvements in line with the pace of the economic recovery, remembering what Rick said about looking more like the third quarter. Putting these things together, we expect 2010 to be a good year. If the economy recovers faster than we expect or if interest rates rise, it could be even better. Thank you for listening, and we'll now take your questions."

I think the key there is going to be as we start to see some of these loans come ready for refinancing, I think that's going to be the real trick for the commercial real estate market, and whether or not there's going to be a position to be able to get someone to step in and actually keep that project going and make sure that we're getting them financed at a decent capitalization rate. So I think this is going to be something we'll be looking at and staring at for some time to come."

So we when we restructure it, we have to put it into non-performing for six months until that turns around.

First of all, I'd like to just say how pleased we are with the quarter. The financials speak for themselves, and I think they're relatively straightforward. But the quarter was actually even better than that. 
  A year ago at this time, I said that our goals were to successfully integrate National City and achieve our cost-savings goal, build our capital positions and repay TARP, transition our balance sheet to reflect a more moderate risk profile, have our credit cost normalized in line with the economy and to deliver a return on assets of greater than 1.3%.
  Our first quarter performance reflects the tremendous progress we have made against all of these strategic objectives. We posted well-diversified revenue, reduced expenses and improved credit costs. And in addition, we had several major accomplishments. First, this quarter we redeemed ours TARP preferred stock and issued common equity. Second, we announced plans to sell Global Investment Servicing at an attractive multiple, which will allow us to focus our capital more on our banking businesses. And third, the conversion of National City is now three quarters complete with more than 1,000 branches and more than 4 million National City business and consumer customers now on to PNC's technology platform. The final branch conversion wave is slated for early June.
  On our next quarterly call, I expect to tell you that we have successfully completed the branch conversion process almost six months ahead of our original schedule. And at the same time, we remain confident that we will exceed our annualized run rate acquisition cost-savings goal of $1.5 billion, well ahead of plan.
  This is truly a result of the great work of our 56,000 employees. And they also produced strong first quarter earnings of $671 million or $0.66 per diluted common share. And financially, the quarter was even better than that. The early redemption of our TARP preferred shares resulted in a $0.50 reduction in earnings per share. Excluding that and integration costs of $0.15 per diluted common share, first quarter earnings per diluted common share would've been $1.31, an increase of 46% on a link quarter basis and up 18% compared to the same period last year. And that is after adjusting those quarters as well for integration costs and the fourth quarter gain, of course, from the BlackRock-BGI transaction. Page 16 of the press release summarizes these few adjustments.
  Now our $1.31 in diluted earnings per common share this quarter reflected a final TARP dividend payment of $89 million or $0.18 per diluted common share. Now these results were driven by a larger distribution platform, which helped us deliver $3.8 billion in first quarter revenue. Our first quarter net interest income reflects our continued success in repricing our deposits, while maintaining the yield on our earning assets. Our balance sheet is highly liquid and well positioned to support an increased demand for credit as the economy recovers.
  In non-interest income, improvements in the equity markets drove higher first quarter asset-management fees. We also saw year-over-year growth in corporate fees reflecting success with our cross-selling efforts. Consumer fees were down linked quarter, primarily due to seasonally lower credit card fees and lower brokerage fees. Now these trends show us that as the economy recovers there are greater opportunities for growth in client-related, fee-based income.
  Now with regards to credit costs, our first quarter provision was $751 million, down 28% on a link quarter basis. Assuming a moderate growth in the economy, it appears that our provision may have peaked in the fourth quarter of 2009.
  And when we turn to our business segments, they performed well for our customers. Retail Banking remains focused on winning in the payment space. We saw strong relationships deposits growth, as average transaction deposits were up $1.4 billion link quarter. Further, we grew core checking account relationships this quarter in legacy markets. And we expect similar growth with Legacy National City as we apply our business model to those newly converted markets.
  Our business bankers are actively prospecting customers. We recently dedicated business development officers to support growth in our newly integrated National City markets, approval rates are up 20% from a year ago. And we're seeing increased customer growth at merchant services, especially in our new markets.
  Our Asset Management Group had a strong quarter driven by improvements in the equity markets and client growth. Strong revenue reflected increased assets under management and continued new business generation. Expenses continue to be well-managed and the business pipeline remains strong. And in February, AMG successfully completed its first and largest of the National City trust system conversions. And its institutional clients will be converted this weekend.
  On the Residential Mortgage front, business posted good first quarter results, largely as a result of increased loan servicing and loan sales revenue over the link quarter. The business continued to make great progress in transitioning its operations. We piloted a new mortgage origination system in the first quarter and expect to implement it by midyear. This system will provide an enhanced experience for customers and better data to manage our originations pipeline.
  The Corporate and Institutional Bank had a very good quarter. On the loan side, the decline in utilization levels among middle market and large corporate clients has slowed. That's good news. Business credit revenues exceeded the same period last year by 14%, and is well positioned to post strong second quarter results. The Corporate Bank also saw a 55% increase in new clients compared with the same period last year. We're deepening our selling efforts as capital market sales were up 31% year-over-year. 
  Now additionally, we added more new client names to our portfolio in the first quarter than any quarter before. While the majority came from legacy markets, we're seeing a steady increase in clients from new markets as brand awareness begins to take hold.
  Now regarding our Distressed Asset Portfolio, we continue to make progress in reducing our foreclosed assets. The portfolio is now $18 billion, down $500 million from December 31, primarily as a result of pay downs. We're focused on maximizing the value of our distressed loans. And have evidence that the marks that we have taken on these assets overall continue to be appropriate. We're also beginning to see more activity in the distressed market, which could help us reduce these assets even faster.
  Turning to BlackRock, as you know, they will release their earnings on Monday. And based on public comments, we expect BlackRock to report continued good progress of its integration of Barclays Global Investors.
  Overall, we achieved an excellent strategic and financial results in the first quarter. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes talking more detail about our well positioned balance sheet.
  Turning to Slide 4, we believe our balance sheet differentiates us. It remains highly liquid and well positioned for the current environment. On the asset side, we continue to invest some of our available liquidity in short duration agency and government securities. Total loans were flat in the first quarter. Now this is as a result of bringing credit card securitizations and market street funding under the balance sheet effective January 1. 
  However, we do see some positive signs. In a recession, loan demand typically picks up about 12 months after GDP turns positive. So our loan utilization remains soft across the country, primarily in commercial and residential real estate. We saw signs of stabilization in loan balances and increased M&A activity in the first quarter. And those two items are key drivers of future loan growth.
  Now we remain committed to responsible lending to support economic growth. We recognize the vital importance of credit to our country's economic growth. And we continue to work closely with Main Street businesses and consumers during these financially difficult times. We originated and renewed approximately $32 billion in loans and commitments in the first quarter. And we're committed to working with homeowners to help them avoid foreclosure where appropriate.
  As of March 31, we completed $600 million in refinancing under the Home Affordable Refinance Program. We also set out approximately 22,000 workout packages to troubled borrowers under the Home Affordable Modification Program. 
  On the deposit side, we continue to benefit from repricing. Retail CDs are expected to continue to decline throughout 2010, as higher rate CDs run-off but at a slower pace than 2009. Transaction deposits were flat compared to the link quarter, which we see as positive. The declines we typically see due to seasonal payments were offset by gains in our Retail segment. And importantly, we're not seeing any shifts in client behavior at this time. We have a strong deposit franchise. And we remain core funded, with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 86%. We're well positioned for any uptick in loan demand from our customers.
  Now in the balance sheet in general. As of March 31, we continue to be asset-sensitive with an estimated duration of equity of negative 1.7 years. And this positions us very well for either a rising or a steepening yield curve.
  Overall, our first quarter performance was very strong and reflects our ability to successfully execute our business model. And we have the capacity to support clients as the economy gains momentum. Now Rick will provide you with more detail about our first quarter results beginning with our ability to deliver high-quality earnings.

Good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to focus on three key messages. First, our strong performance and the key drivers in our pretax pre-provision earnings. Second, the stabilization of our credit quality and the adequacy of our reserv",1400,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to focus on three key messages. First, our strong performance and the key drivers in our pretax pre-provision earnings. Second, the stabilization of our credit quality and the adequacy of our reserve levels. And third, the improvements we have made in the quality of our capital structure.
  Now as an aside, based on this improve capital structure and our progress to date on the National City acquisition, three of our four rating agencies recently reaffirmed our ratings. And two of them raised their outlook on PNC. These positive changes were among the first for large-cap banks.
  In the first three months of the year, our ability to produce well-diversified revenue and effectively manage expenses continue to deliver pretax, pre-provision earnings that more than doubled our credit costs. As you can see on Slide 6, we delivered $3.8 billion in revenue and $1.7 billion in pretax pre-provision earnings compared to our provision of $751 million.
  Now let's begin with the components of revenue. Net interest income of $2.4 billion was higher than we expected, primarily as a result of better loan and deposit repricing and better-than-expected payoffs and gains on sales of impaired commercial loans. A decrease in our cost of funds of 14 basis points and an increase in asset yields of 10 basis points, resulted in a net interest margin of 4.25% in the first quarter, an increase of 19 basis points link quarter.
  Now the key driver on the funding side is the repricing of our deposit base. Our cost of deposits was 81 basis points. This is down 12 basis points link quarter and down 63 basis points year-over-year. And we also have approximately $19 billion of relationship-based CDs with an average rate of 2.4% that are scheduled to mature during the remainder of this year. Now assuming rates stay low, I believe we will continue to reprice these deposits and lower our funding costs even further. We expect to retain more than 80% of our relationship-based CDs in 2010, which is comparable to our year-to-date results.
  Non-interest income for the quarter of $1.4 billion and the sources of our non-interest income remain high-quality, well-diversified. Asset Management grew more than 18% on a link quarter basis due to improvements in the markets and client flows along with the impact of BlackRock's earnings. Corporate service fees were up 3% link quarter or 12% on an annualized basis, primarily due to special servicing revenue from commercial real estate loan serviced by Midland, which is one of the largest providers of commercial real estate loan servicing in the U.S. 
  We expect Midland to provide us with a countercyclical fee income source through the course of the year. As residential mortgage fees were up 37% link quarter, mainly due to lower payoff volume and lower additions to recourse reserves.
  As expected, consumer service fees and service charges on deposits were down primarily due to seasonality. And while trading and private equity fees were within our expectation, fees and other were down on a link quarter basis primarily due to lower gains on loan sales. I would expect other non-interest income to trend in this range going forward.
  Turning to credit costs. Our first quarter provision was $751 million, which was down almost $300 million from the fourth quarter driven primarily by economic factors that are beginning to stabilize. As Jim said, we believe our provisions may have peaked in the fourth quarter of 2009. Future provision levels will depend on the level of non-performing loans and our related coverage ratios.
  And as I will discuss further in a moment, we continue to do a great job managing our expenses.  Clearly, our ability to deliver well-diversified revenues and manage our expenses and credit costs continues to drive positive operating leverage and increase common capital. 
  Now let me take a moment to talk about our focus on expense management. As we have said before, achieving our cost-savings target is an important element of this year's plan. Our first quarter non-interest expenses were down -- of $2.1 billion, were down 2% year-over-year and down 4% link quarter. As you can see on Slide 7, we captured some $800 million in integration-related cost savings in 2009 and our original goal for 2010 was $1.3 billion. We have already achieved a running rate of savings for 2010 of at least $1.4 billion, which is $600 million higher than the prior year. This is $100 million increase to year-over-year savings versus our last update. 
  And by the end of 2010, we expect our running rate on expense savings to exceed $1.5 billion. This is $300 million higher in six months earlier than we originally planned. This reflects our commitment to continuous improvement and the ability we have as an enterprise to manage expenses effectively.
  Now let's take a look at our credit quality trends on Slide 8. Overall delinquencies and non-performing loans continued to show signs of stabilization as both were essentially flat link quarter. And as we have discussed before, our moderate risk philosophy calls for keeping our loan portfolio very granular. For example, none of our non-performing loans were greater than $32 million as of March 31. Net charge-offs were down 17% link quarter and are at 1.77% of our average loans, which is one of the lowest ratios among our peers. 
  Our provision for credit cost this quarter exceeded net charge-offs by $60 million. This, along with additional allowance of $141 million related to the credit card securitizations which were consolidated, resulted in an increase in the allowance for loan losses to $5.3 billion or 3.38% of loans. Given net charge-offs in the first quarter, we have reserved coverage of nearly two years, which is one of the highest coverage levels in the industry. 
  We continue to be comfortable with the marks on our impaired book, as the link quarter estimates of cash flows continue to perform better than expected. And we also contributed to strengthen our capital structure in the first quarter. As shown on Slide 9, our Tier 1 common ratio at the end of the first quarter of 2010 is estimated to be 7.6% as a result of first quarter earnings and our common issuance. Our Tier 1 common ratio increased by 270 basis points since the first quarter of 2009 and by 160 basis points since year end.
  The pro forma ratio of 8.3% reflects the pending sale of Global Investment Servicing, which is expected to improve our capital by approximately $1.6 billion. We believe that transaction will be completed in the third quarter. The Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio declined to an estimated 9.9% at the end of the first quarter as a result of redeeming the TARP preferred shares. On a pro forma basis, reflecting the pending GIS sale, it should be back up at an estimated 10.6%.
  We now have higher-quality capital base with 77% of our Tier 1 risk-based capital in common equity. This is up from 49% a year ago. Our capital position provides us with flexibility for future growth, while investing in innovative products and services. At PNC, we have a disciplined approach to capital management, which we believe serves us well during these uncertain times.
  Finally, let me provide some guidance around the sustainability of our performance. Our forecast reflects our assumptions regarding a moderate economic recovery and manageable regulatory reform. First, we are feeling more confident in our ability to keep revenue performance stable year-over-year given the strength of our net interest income performance and the diversification of our non-interest income revenue stream. This expectation excludes the impact of last year's gain on the BlackRock-BGI transaction and the expected gain from the sale of GIS this year.
  Second, we continue to feel comfortable that credit costs this year will be below those of last year. This quarter, clearly gets us off to a great start. And third, we are already on pace to exceed our cost-savings plan for 2010 by $100 million, bringing our total year-over-year cost-savings improvement to $600 million. And we are even more confident that we will exceed our $1.5 billion goal in 2010 than our original expectation of $1.2 billion in 2011. 
  As a result, we continue to believe our pretax, pre-provision earnings will continue to substantially exceed credit costs. And with that, I'll hand it back to Jim."

Turning to Slide 10, this slide is a scorecard that we used to measure our progress in building our company. I'm very pleased with the progress we've made against these objectives in the first quarter. 
  With the conversion of National City, three quarters complete, we're in an enhanced position to deepen the cross-selling of fee-based products throughout the larger franchise. And we expect to increase the percentage of non-interest income to total revenue over time.
  Our return on average assets for the first quarter was 1.02%. That's a 15 basis points increase in ROA for the year 2009 or a 40 basis point increase after adjusting for the BlackRock-BGI transaction, which makes the achievement even more impressive. This shows the great progress we've made against our goal of a return on average assets of 1.3% or greater. Clearly, we remain confident in our ability to achieve these strategic financial objectives over time. 
  In summary, we continued to execute on our business model and we had an excellent first quarter. Rick provided you with our full year guidance. And assuming a moderate economic recovery and manageable regulatory reform, we believe we're off to a strong start for 2010.

Most of the other portfolios are continuing to perform well and your saying that, because we keep up in the yield. If you look at Page 7, one of the things that I keep trying to point out is the fact that while we've added a $600 million of reserves on all of these impaired loans, add additional allowance since the marks. We've also added almost $2 billion to the accretable yield going forward. So you kind of upfront the cost to credit, and then you recognized the cost of NII over time.

The A properties are doing well and probably are doing better than anybody might mark them. So actually, we're not in the business of selling those, even though we might have taken a mark on them when we took them in. Those properties tend to come back with the economy and that's the right thing to do. The C properties, you just sell. C properties rarely come back, and so you take very strong marks on those right upfront, and you just sell them because they always have trouble recovering at all. And so we've been actively doing that and we're comfortable with our marks. The B properties, obviously, the majority of the portfolio, but those are the ones you mark down and you have to manage one by one. One of the advantages we have is Midland was originated commercial mortgages across the country to secure debt. And so we have staff in markets all around the country and when we marked the National City portfolio, it gave us a great advantage because we had people experienced, people actually going in and testing the markets and actually giving us real numbers. In some cases, actually, bidding on the properties to find what somebody might accept. And so that's a plus, and I think, the commercial real estate business over time, if a property loses a tenant, clearly, that property has less value, as you know Meredith. But then, they go reassign somebody else at a lower lease rate, so the property is worthless. But it's not like it falls off the planet. There is still cash flow. So I think those B properties, I think will work their way through for the most part. The big issue, two or three years from now is liquidity. There's a lot of those commercial mortgages. They're typically seven years minimum that are coming due. And if you look back a year ago, there was no ability to -- I mean, the scary part was there was no refinance opportunity. In today's environment, there is some refinance opportunity and because of capital markets just barely coming back. But on the other hand, assets and we're looking at Midland. I mean, Midland with their commercial service and capability. They know the cash flows assets by asset and they know the maturity date. And so nobody wants to refinance too quickly because the price of the credit is going to go up pretty significantly. But I think we'll be aggressive in pursuing commercial real estate, high-quality commercial real estate loans as they come due in the next one to three years."

First of all, I’d like to just say how pleased we are with the quarter. The financials speak for themselves and I think they’re relatively straightforward, but the quarter was actually even better than that.
A year ago at this time, I said that our goals were to successfully integrate National City and achieve our cost savings goal, build out capital positions and repay TARP, transition our balance sheet to reflect a more moderate risk profile, have our credit costs normalized in line with the economy and to deliver a return on assets of greater than 1.3%.
Our first quarter performance reflects the tremendous progress we’ve made against all of these strategic objectives. We posted well-diversified revenue, reduced expenses and improved credit costs. In addition, we had several major accomplishments.
First, this quarter we redeemed our TARP preferred stock and issued common equity. Second, we announced plans to sell Global Investment Servicing at an attractive multiple, which will allow us to focus our capital more on our banking businesses.
And third, the conversion of National City is now three-quarters complete with more than 1,000 branches and more than four million National City business and consumer customers now onto PNC’s technology platform. The final branch conversion wave is slated for early June.
On our next quarterly call, I expect to tell you that we’ve successfully completed the branch conversion process almost six months ahead of our original schedule, and at the same time, we remain confident that we will exceed our annualized run rate acquisition cost savings goal of $1.5 billion, well ahead of plan.
This is truly a result of the great work of our 56,000 employees and they also produced strong first quarter earnings of $671 million or $0.66 per diluted common share, and financially, the quarter was even better than that.
The early redemption of our TARP preferred shares resulted in a $0.50 reduction in our earnings per share excluding integration costs of $0.15 per diluted common share, first quarter earnings per diluted common share would have been $1.31, an increase of 46% on a linked quarter basis, and up 18% compared to the same period last year, and that is after adjusting those quarters as well for integrations costs and the fourth quarter gain of course from the Blackrock BGI transaction. Page 16 of the press release summarizes these few adjustments.
Now our $1.31 in diluted earnings per common share this quarter reflected a final TARP dividend payment of $89 million or $0.18 per diluted common share. These results were driven by a larger distribution platform, which helped us deliver $3.8 billion in first quarter revenue. Our first quarter net interest income reflects our continued success in re-pricing our deposit while maintaining yield on our earning assets. Our balance sheet is highly liquid and well positioned to support increased demand for credit as the economy recovers.
In non-interest income improvements in the equity markets drove higher first quarter asset management fees. We also saw year over year growth in corporate fees, reflecting success with our cross selling efforts.
Consumer fees were down linked quarter primarily due to seasonally lower credit card fees, and lower brokerage fees. These trends show us that as the economy recovers, there are greater opportunities for growth in client related fee based income.
With regards to credit costs, our first quarter provision was $751 million, down 28% on a linked quarter basis. Assuming a moderate growth in the economy, it appears that our provision may have peaked in the fourth quarter of 2009.
When we turn to our business segments, they performed well for our customers. Retail banking remains focused on winning in the payment space. We saw strong relationship deposit growth as average transaction deposits were up $1.4 billion linked quarter.
Further, we grew core checking account relationships this quarter in legacy markets and we expect similar growth with legacy National City as we apply our business model to those newly converted markets.
Our business bankers are actively prospecting customers and we recently added dedicated business development officers to support growth in our newly integrated National City markets. Approval rates are up 20% from a year ago, and we’re seeing increased customer growth in merchant services, especially in our new markets.
Our asset management group had a strong quarter, driven by improvements in the equity markets and client growth. Strong revenue reflected increased assets under management and continued new business generation. 
Expenses continue to be well managed and the business pipeline remains strong, and in February, AMG successfully completed its first and largest of the National City trust system conversions, and its institutional clients will be converted this weekend.
On the residential mortgage front, business posted good first quarter results largely as a result of increased loan servicing and loan sales revenue over the linked quarter. The business continued to make great progress in transitioning its operations. We piloted a new mortgage origination system in the first quarter and expect to implement it by mid-year. This system will provide an enhanced experience for customers and better data to manage our originations pipeline.
The corporate and institutional bank had a very good quarter. On the loan side, the decline in utilization levels by middle market and large corporate clients has slowed, and that’s good news. Business credit revenues exceeded the same period last year by 14% and is well positioned to post strong second quarter results.
The corporate bank also saw a 55% increase in new clients compared to the same period last year. We’re deepening our selling efforts as capital market sales were up 31% year over year. Additionally, we added more new clients names to our portfolio in the first quarter than any quarter before. While the majority came from legacy markets, we’re seeing a steady increase of clients from new markets as brand awareness begins to take hold.
Regarding our distressed asset portfolio, we continue to make progress in reducing our foreclosed assets. The portfolio is now $18 billion, down $500 million from December 31, primarily as a result of pay downs. We’re focused on maximizing the value of our distressed loans and have evidence that the marks we’ve taken on these assets overall, continue to be appropriate.
We’re also beginning to see more activity in the distressed market, which could help us reduce these assets even faster.
Turn to Blackrock, as you know, they released their earnings on Monday, and based on public comments, we expect Blackrock to report continued good progress on its integration of Barclay’s Global Investors. Overall, we achieved an excellent strategic and financial results in the first quarter. 
Now, I’d like to spend a few minutes talking more in detail about our well-positioned balance sheet. Turning to Slide 4, we believe our balance sheet differentiates us. It remains highly liquid and well positioned for the current environment.
On the asset side, we continue to invest some of our available liquidity in short duration agency and government securities. Total loans were flat in the first quarter and this is as a result of bringing credit card securitizations and Market Street funding onto the balance sheet effective January 1.
However, we do see some positive signs. In a recession, loan demand typically picks up about 12 months after GDP turns positive, so our loan utilization remains soft across the country primarily in commercial and residential real estate. We saw signs of stabilization in loan balances and increased M&A activity in the first quarter, and those two items are key drivers of future loan growth.
We remain committed to responsible lending to support economic growth. We recognize the vital importance of credit to our country’s economic growth and we continue to work closely with main street businesses and consumers during these financially difficult times. We originated and renewed approximately $32 billion in loans and commitments in the first quarter.
And, we’re committed to working with homeowners to help them avoid foreclosure where appropriate. As of March 31, we completed $600 million of refinancing under the Home Affordable Re-finance program and we also set out approximately 22,000 work out packages to troubled borrowers under the Home Affordable modification program.
On the deposit side, we continued to benefit from re-pricing. Retail CD’s are expected to continue to decline throughout 2010 as higher rate CD’s run off, but at a slower pace than 2009. Transaction deposits were flat compared to the linked quarter, which we see as positive. The declines we typically see due to seasonal payments were offset by gains in our retail segment, and importantly, we’re not seeing any shifts in client behavior at this time.
We have a strong deposit franchise and we remain core funded with a loan deposit ratio of 86%. We’re well positioned for any uptick in loan demand from our customers.
On the balance sheet in general, as of March 31, we continued to be asset sensitive with an estimated duration of equity of negative 1.7 years. It positions us very well for either a rising or a steepening yield curve.
Overall, our first quarter performance was very strong, and reflects our ability to successfully execute our business model, and we have the capacity to support clients as the economy gains momentum.
Now Rick will provide you with more detail about our first quarter results beginning with our ability to deliver high quality earnings.

Today I’m going to focus on three key messages; first, our strong performance and the key drivers in our pre-tax, pre-provision earnings; second, the stabilization of our credit quality and the adequacy of our reserve levels; and",1415,"Good morning, everyone. Today I’m going to focus on three key messages; first, our strong performance and the key drivers in our pre-tax, pre-provision earnings; second, the stabilization of our credit quality and the adequacy of our reserve levels; and third, the improvements we have made in the quality of our capital structure.
As an aside, based on this improved capital structure and our progress to date on the National City acquisition three out of four rating agencies recently reaffirmed our ratings and two of them, raised their outlook on PNC. These positive changes were among the first for large cap banks.
In the first three months of the year, our ability to produce well-diversified revenue and effectively manage expenses continued to deliver pre-tax, pre-provision earnings that more than doubled our credit costs. As you can see on Slide 6, we delivered $3.8 billion revenue and $1.7 billion in pre-tax, pre-provision earnings compared to our provision of $751 million.
Let’s begin with the components of revenue. Net interest income of $2.4 billion was higher than we expected, primarily as a result of better loan and deposit re-pricing and better than expected payoff’s and gains on sales of impaired commercial loans.
A decrease in our cost of funds of 14 basis points and an increase in asset yields of 10 basis points resulted in a net interest margin of 4.25% in the first quarter, an increase of 19 basis points linked quarter.
The key driver on the funding side is the re-pricing of our deposit base. Our cost of deposits was 81 basis points. This is down 12 basis points linked quarter and down 63 basis points year over year. We also have approximately $19 billion of relationship base CD’s with an average rate of 2.4% that are scheduled to mature during the remainder of this year.
Assuming rates stay low, I believe we will continue to re-price these deposits and lower our funding costs even further. We expect to retain more than 80% of our relationship based CD’s in 2010, which is comparable to our year to date results.
Non-interest income for the quarter of $1.4 billion are the sources of our non-interest income remain high quality while diversified. Asset management grew more than 18% on a linked quarter basis due to improvements in the markets and client flows along with the impact of Blackrock’s earnings.
Corporate services fees were up 3% linked quarter or 12% on an annualized basis, primarily due to special servicing revenues from commercial real estate loans serviced by Midland, which is one of the largest providers of commercial real estate loan servicing in the U.S.
We expect Midland to provide us with a counter cyclical fee income source through the course of the year. As residential mortgage fees were up 37% linked quarter, mainly due to lower pay off volume and lower additions to recourse reserves. As expected, consumer service fees and service charges on deposits were down primarily due to seasonality.
While trading and private equity fees were within our expectation, fees and other were down on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to lower gains on loan sales. I would expect other non-interest income to trend in this range going forward.
Turning to credit costs, our first quarter provision was $751 million, which was down almost $300 million from the fourth quarter driven primarily by economic factors that are beginning to stabilize. As Jim said, we believe our provision may have peaked in the fourth quarter of 2009. Future provision levels will depend on the level of non-performing loans and our related coverage ratios, and as I will discuss further in a moment, we continue to do a great job managing our expenses.
Clearly our ability to deliver well-diversified revenues and manage our expenses and credit costs, continues to drive positive operating leverage and increase common capital.
Now let me take a moment to talk about our focus on expense management. As we have said before, achieving our cost savings target is an important element of this year’s plan. Our first quarter non-interest expenses were $2.1 billion, were down 2% year over year and down 4% linked quarter.
As you can see on Slide 7, we captured some $800 million in integration related cost savings in 2009 and our original goal for 2010 was $1.3 billion. We have already achieved a running rate of savings for 2010 of at least $1.4 billion, which is $600 million higher than the prior year. This is a $100 million increase to year over year savings versus our last update.
And by the end of 2010, we expect our running rate on expense savings to exceed $1.5 billion. This is $300 million higher and six months earlier than we originally planned. This reflects our commitment to continuous improvement and the ability we have as an enterprise to manage expenses effectively.
Let’s take a look at our credit quality trends on Slide 8. Overall delinquencies and non-performing loans continue to show signs of stabilization as both were essentially flat linked quarter, and as we have discussed before, our moderate risk philosophy calls for keeping our loan portfolio very granular. For example, none of our non-performing loans were greater than $32 million as of March 31.
Net charges were down 17% linked quarter and are at 1.77% of our average loans, which is one of the lowest ratios among our peers. Our provision for credit costs this quarter exceeded net charge offs by $60 million. This, along with additional allowance of $141 million related to the credit card securitizations, which were consolidated, resulting in an increase for the allowance for loan losses to $5.3 billion or 3.38% of loans.
Given net charge offs in the first quarter, we have reserve coverage of nearly two years which is one of the coverage levels in the industry. We continue to be comfortable with the marks on our impaired book as the linked quarter estimates of cash flows continue to perform better than expected. 
We also continued to strengthen our capital structure in the first quarter. As shown on Slide 9, our tier one common ratio at the end of the first quarter of 2010 is estimated to be 7.6% as a result of first quarter earnings and our common issuance. Our tier one common ratio increased by 270 basis point since the first quarter of 2009 and by 160 basis points since year end.
The pro forma ration of 8.3% reflects the pending sale of Global Investment Servicing, which is expected to improve our capital by approximately $1.6 billion. We believe that transaction will be complete in third quarter.
The tier one risk based capital ratio declined to an estimated 9.9% at the end of the first quarter as a result of redeeming the TARP preferred shares. On a pro forma basis, reflecting the impending GIS sale, it should be back up at an estimated 10.6%.
We now have higher quality capital base with 77% of our tier one risk based capital in common equity. This is up from 49% a year ago. Our capital position provides us the flexibility for future growth while investing in innovative products and services. At PNC, we have a disciplined approach to capital management which we believe serves us well during these uncertain times.
Finally, let me provide some guidance around the sustainability of our performance. Our forecast reflects our assumptions regarding a moderate economic recovery and manageable regulatory reform.
First, we are feeling more confident in our ability to keep revenue performance stable year over year, given the strength of our net income interest performance and the diversification of our non-interest income revenue stream. This expectation excludes the impact of last year’s gain on the Blackrock PGI transaction and the expected gain from the sale of GIS this  year.
Second, we continue to feel comfortable that credit costs this year will be below those of last year. This quarter clearly gets us off to a great start.
And third, we are already on pace to exceed our cost savings plan for 2010 by $100 million, bringing our total year over year cost savings improvement to $600 million, and we are even more confident that we will exceed our $1.5 billion goal in 2010 than our original expectation of $1.2 billion in 2011.
As a result, we continue to believe our pre-tax, pre-provision earnings, will continue to substantially exceed credit costs.
And with that, I’ll hand it back to Jim.

I’m very pleased with the progress we’ve made against these objectives in the first quarter. With the conversion of National City three-quarters complete, we’re in an enhanced position to deepen the cross selling of fee based products throughout the larger franchise, we expect to increase the percentage of non-interest income to total revenue over time.
Our return on average assets for the first quarter was 1.02%. That’s a 15 basis point increase in our ROA for the year of 2009, or a 40 basis point increase after adjusting for the Blackrock PGI transaction, which makes the achievement even more impressive.
This shows the great progress we’ve made against our goal of a return on average assets of 1.3% or greater. Clearly, we remain confident in our ability to achieve these strategic financial objectives over time.
In summary, we continue to execute on our business model and we had an excellent first quarter. We’ve provided you with our full year guidance and assuming a moderate economic recovery and manageable regulatory reform, we believe we’re off to a strong start for 2010.

I think we just have to look at our customers and they simply continue to pay which is what they’re supposed to do.

The A properties are doing well and probably are doing better than anybody might mark them, so actually we’re not in the business of selling those even though we might have taken a mark on them when we took them in. Those properties tend to come back with the economy, and that’s the right thing to do.
The C properties, you just sell. C property rarely come back so you take very strong marks on those right up front and you just sell them because they always have trouble recovering at all. So we’ve been actively doing that and we’re comfortable with our marks.
The B properties, obviously the majority of the portfolio, but those are the ones you mark down and you have to manage one by one. One of the advantages we have is that Midland was originally commercial mortgages across the county to securitize. So we have staff in markets all around the country and when we marked the National City portfolio, it gave us a great advantage because we had people, experienced people actually going in and testing the markets and actually giving us real numbers, in some cases actually bidding on properties to find out what somebody might accept.
So that’s a plus, and I think the commercial real estate business over time, if a property loses a tenant, clearly that property has less value as you know. But then they go resign somebody else at a lower lease rate, so the property is worth less, but it’s not like it falls off the planet. There is some cash flow.  So I think those B properties, I think will work their way through for the most part.
The big issue  two or three from now is liquidity. There’s a lot of those commercial mortgages, they’re typically seven years minimum that are coming due and if you look back a year ago, there was no ability, I mean the scary part was there was no re-financing opportunity. In today’s environment there is some re-finance opportunity and because the capital markets are just barely coming back.
But on the other hand, assets and we’re looking at Midland, I mean Midland with their commercial servicing capability, they know the cash flows asset by asset and they know the maturity date. So nobody wants to re-finance too quickly because the price of the credit is going to go up pretty significant.
But I think we’ll be aggressive in pursuing commercial real estate, high quality real estate loans as they come due in the next one to three years.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This was an excellent quarter for PNC from both a financial and a strategic standpoint. We have executed our business plan in the first half of this year and are well positioned to deliver solid",1753,"Thank you, Bill. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This was an excellent quarter for PNC from both a financial and a strategic standpoint. We have executed our business plan in the first half of this year and are well positioned to deliver solid results in the second half.
I will say more about the financial results in a moment. But first, I would like to highlight some of our strategic accomplishments. 
The first one. We completed the final wave of National City customer and branch conversions last month. I believe this process was handled as well as any large client conversion that's been done in the banking industry. In total, we brought six million retail and business clients in nine states onto PNC's technology platform. We completed the process six months ahead of our original schedule. Client retention was within our expectations, and we've already significantly exceeded our original cost-savings target.
Second item. Sales across our franchise were 126% on plan through June 30. On a linked-quarter basis, total sales were up 6%. In our Western markets, sales were 113% on plan through the first half, and up 15% linked quarter. I believe that this reflects our customer focus throughout the conversion process. And what I'm very pleased about is the rate of customer penetration in our corporate bank.
Across the company, cross-selling is at 132% on plan year-to-date. In the Western markets, it's 110% on plan through six months. While not as robust as the levels in our Eastern markets, this reflects both the tremendous progress we're making and the opportunities for growth. With the conversion behind us, we are now investing in people to help us serve our customers in these markets, and we're implementing the PNC business model across the entire franchise.
Now another strategic highlight this quarter was arranging for the sales of residential mortgage loans and brokered home equity loans in our Distressed Assets segment. While the income statement effect of this sale is recorded in the second quarter, the balance sheet effect will take place in the third quarter as those sales close. It's important to note, the majority of these loans are seriously delinquent and they represent approximately $2 billion in customer balances. With the market for these loans opening up, we see this as an opportunity to reduce risk with reasonable valuations. And Rick will discuss this in more detail in a moment.
Finally, the regulatory reform legislation is now in place. We support many of the changes, such as the creation of a systemic risk regulator and the extension of consumer protection laws to nonbank financial companies. We believe core elements of the bill should contribute to a stronger and more secure financial system over time.
There are a variety of issues in the legislation that we are currently studying. There is much more to come in the hundreds of regulations expected over the next few years. One thing is clear. The reform bill will impact revenue and increase the cost of doing business. However, we believe that the expected changes will be manageable for PNC and will have a smaller impact on us than the Wall Street banks.
Now another important topic is capital, and we are well positioned from a capital standpoint. We closed the sale of Global Investment Servicing on July 1, which added to our capital. As of June 30, our estimated Tier 1 ratio was 10.8% and pro forma as of July 1, after the sale of GIS, Tier 1 would be 11.4%. The Tier 1 common ratio was 8.4% at the end of the quarter estimated, and reflecting the sale of GIS to pro forma as of July 1 is 9% for Tier 1 common. Since we closed on the National City acquisition, we have nearly doubled our Tier 1 common capital ratio when the impact of the GIS sale is included. 
Now overall, this was an exceptional quarter for PNC and we're well positioned for future growth despite the challenging economy.
Now let me provide you with some highlights of our financial results. We produced second quarter earnings of $803 million or $1.47 per diluted common share. That's a 20% increase in net income on a linked-quarter basis. Excluding integration costs of $0.13 per diluted common share, second quarter earnings per diluted common share would have been $1.60, an increase of 22% on a linked-quarter basis after adjusting the first quarter for integration costs and the early redemption of our TARP-preferred shares. Page 16 of the press release summarizes these adjustments. For the first half of the year, our net income of $1.5 billion was double that of the same period in 2009.
Starting with revenue. Our second quarter net interest income was up linked quarter, reflecting our ongoing success in repricing our deposits and lowering borrowing costs, somewhat offset by lowering yields on investment securities. Noninterest income was up linked quarter, primarily due to the higher loan servicing and residential mortgage loan sales revenue, debit card income and net security gains, partially offset by declines in our more market-sensitive fee categories.
Regarding credit costs, our second quarter provision was $823 million. Excluding an additional provision of $109 million related to the arranging for the third quarter sales of some distressed assets that I mentioned, the amount is lower than our first quarter provision of $751 million. Assuming continued economic growth, we believe that the credit quality has stabilized and some metrics are showing signs of improvement on a linked-quarter basis. Namely, our delinquent loans and our nonperforming loans have showed meaningful declines.
Our second quarter expenses were down 5% linked quarter, enough said. Our financial results, frankly, were driven by our business segments and we're seeing growth opportunities throughout our expanded franchise. Retail Banking remained focused on expanding and deepening customer relationships. Checking relationships grew by 20,000 during the second quarter of 2010. Now our goal is to deepen these relationships. We saw active online bill payment grow by 5% during the second quarter alone.
Our Corporate and Institutional Bank had a very good quarter, while loan demand remains tepid. We're focused on our goal of adding 1,000 new customers in our corporate bank this year, which would double our new client growth for the combined company. Through six months, we're on track to reach that target.
Now with more of our clients on one platform, we saw increases in Treasury Management revenue in the second quarter. For the first half of the year, Treasury Management revenue was up $40 million to $600 million, an increase of 7% over the same period last year.
Earnings for our Asset Management Group were reflected, as you might guess, by the second quarter declines in the equity markets. In the quarter, this segment remained focused on deposit growth and adding customers and expense management. And this will position the business for improved profitability as the market rebounds.
Our Residential Mortgage business posted good second quarter results. Application volume increased largely due to seasonal factors. Now I would have to tell you that this business is making great progress as it transitions to a more moderate risk position. A new mortgage origination system was implemented to better serve clients and manage risk. And our Mortgage business is continuing to rebuild its sales force, which should help to drive increases in high-quality loan originations.
Regarding our distressed assets, this portfolio of $17 billion is down $4 billion since the same time last year, primarily as a result of paydowns, net charge-offs and dispositions. However, the sales I mentioned earlier are not reflected in this decline because they haven't closed yet, and we're making progress in managing the risks and returns on our distressed loan portfolio.
BlackRock had a very good second quarter. Their net income increased linked quarter nearly doubled that over a year ago. They're making good progress in their merger with Barclays Global Investors, which made them the largest publicly-traded investment management firm in the world, with more than $3.1 trillion in assets under management. At the end of the second quarter, our share of BlackRock's earnings was 23%.
Overall, I believe that we achieved excellent strategic and financial results in the second quarter. But I'd like to spend a few minutes talking a little bit in detail about our well-positioned balance sheet.
Turning to Slide 4. We believe that our balance sheet differentiates us. It remains highly liquid and it's well positioned for the current environment. On the asset side, we remain patient with our investment securities and continue to focus on short-duration agency and government securities. 
Total loans were down 2% in the second quarter, which we believe was consistent with industry trends. Loan utilization remains soft across the country. However, the pace of contraction appears to be slowing as we begin the third quarter. 
We recognize the vital importance of credit to our country's economic growth. We originated and renewed approximately $40 billion in loans and commitments in the second quarter, $72 billion for the first half of the year, which includes more than $2 billion in small-business loans. And additionally, we're committed to working with homeowners to help them avoid foreclosure, where appropriate. We completed approximately $1.5 billion in refinancing of the Home Affordable Refinance Program from the inception of the program through June 30. Now we've also set up approximately 86,000 workout packages to troubled borrowers under the Home Affordable Modification Program.
On the deposit side, transaction deposits were relatively flat linked quarter, but up more than $5 billion year-over-year as we've been enhancing our deposit mix with a focus on customer relationships and increased profitability. We have a strong deposit franchise, and we remain core-funded with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 86% as of June 30.
Our balance sheet as of June 30 remained asset-sensitive, with an estimated duration of equity of approximately negative three years. Our balance sheet provides us with a capacity to support clients as the economy gains momentum. And at the same time, our position allows for patience in the event economic conditions are slowed or improved in a meaningful way.
We also saw a growth in common equity of $1.2 billion linked quarter, and this does not include the positive impact from the July 1 sale of Global Investment Servicing.
Overall, this was a very strong first half and we accomplished a lot. And now Rick will provide you with more detail about our second quarter results, beginning with our ability to deliver high-quality earnings. Rick?"
294585,108851296,68466,"PNC Financial Services Group Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-22-2010",2010-07-22,"Earnings Calls","The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will focus on: first, our strong financial results and the key drivers of our pretax pre-provision earnings; second, the stabilization of our credit quality and the improvement in some of our credit met",1409,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will focus on: first, our strong financial results and the key drivers of our pretax pre-provision earnings; second, the stabilization of our credit quality and the improvement in some of our credit metrics and related credit costs and the adequacy of our reserve levels; and third, our continued improvements in the quality of our capital structure. 
In the second quarter, our well-diversified revenues increased and we reduced expenses. This allowed us to deliver pretax, pre-provision earnings that more than doubled our credit cost. As you can see on Slide 6, we delivered $3.9 billion in revenue in the second quarter and $1.9 billion in pretax pre-provision earnings compared to our provision of $823 million. 
Now let's begin with the components of revenue. Net interest income of $2.4 billion and our net interest margin of 4.35% for the quarter were up modestly from our first quarter results. A key driver is the ongoing repricing of our deposit base and higher-than-expected interest income on impaired loans. The latter, which you can see on Page 7 of the supplement, our cost of deposits in the second quarter was 71 basis points, down 10 basis points linked quarter and down 54 basis points year-over-year. We have approximately $14 billion of relationship-based CDs at an average rate of more than 2% that are scheduled to mature during the remainder of the year. Assuming rates stay low, and I believe they will, we will continue to reprice these deposits and lower our deposit funding costs even further.
Our total yield on interest earning assets declined linked quarter. While loan yields were up slightly due to higher-than-expected interest income on impaired loans, this improvement was more than offset by a 27-basis-point decline in the yield on our investment securities portfolio. This downward trend reflects the continuing migration of the portfolio to lower risk-asset classes, such as U.S. Treasury and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, along with impact of the lower rate environment.  The yield on new security purchases has declined significantly as interest rates have declined.
Looking forward, retail deposits costs should continue to decline albeit at a slower pace than we've seen in previous quarters. And I do expect interest income on loans and loan yields to decline as the contribution from impaired loans will decrease, looking more like the contribution in the first quarter. In addition, yields on securities will continue to decline as we replace maturities and prepayments with low-risk securities in a low-rate environment. 
As a result, you would expect to see the net interest income and yield on earning assets to decline, putting pressure on net interest income and the margin in the second half of the year. 
Noninterest income of $1.5 billion was up 7% linked quarter. The sources of our noninterest income remain high quality and well diversified. 
While client flows remained strong, asset management fees were affected by declines in the equity market values, resulting in a 6% decline linked quarter. Consumer services and service charges on deposits were up 6% linked quarter, primarily due to higher transaction volume-related fees and seasonality. We expect that the new Regulation E rules related to overdraft charges will negatively impact our second half revenue by an estimated $145 million. 
Corporate service fees saw higher merger and acquisition advisory fees in the second quarter. However, overall fees were down marginally linked quarter, primarily due to the exceptional special servicing revenue from commercial mortgage loans in the first quarter.
Residential mortgage fees were up 22% linked quarter, mainly due to higher loan servicing revenues and improved origination volumes. 
Net gains on securities sales and the impact of OTTI contributed $53 million in the second quarter compared to a loss of $26 million in the first quarter. Security gains for the quarter were primarily driven by sales of U.S. agency residential mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasury securities. Looking ahead, we anticipate ongoing improvement in the OTTI as the economy recovers. 
Finally, total other noninterest income was down primarily due to lower customer-related trading revenues. And once again, the diversification of our noninterest income revenue streams delivered good value in the quarter. As Jim mentioned, expenses declined 5% linked, primarily due to the reversal of certain accrued liabilities, with $73 million related to a franchise tax settlement and $47 million associated with a litigation indemnification.
Now if you go to Slide 7, we'll take a moment to talk about our cost-savings targets. We captured another $50 million of savings in the quarter, bringing us to $800 million in annualized acquisition-related cost savings in the first six months of the year, and our 18-month total comes to $1.6 billion. Our new goal for the end of 2010 is $1.8 billion.
If you recall, our original cost-savings target of $1.2 billion represented 10% of the expense base of the combined companies. When we reach $1.8 billion at the end of this year, we will have reduced the combined expenses by 15%, six months ahead of schedule. At the same time, we have remained focused on making investments in support of new customers and product development.
Now let's take a look at our credit quality and cost trends on Slide 8. Overall credit quality continued to stabilize, and delinquencies and nonperforming loans showed signs of improvement. All delinquencies were down approximately 25% in the quarter compared to linked quarter. And for the first time since the recession began in 2007, our nonperforming loans declined. 
On a linked-quarter basis, nonperforming loans decreased by almost $0.5 billion or 8%, driven by a substantial reduction in loans transferred to nonperforming loans, which you can see on Page 11 of the supplement. 
Our provision of $823 million for the second quarter is an increase of $72 million compared to the prior quarter. And net charge-off of $840 million increased from the prior quarter by $149 million. As Jim mentioned, we made a strategic decision during the quarter to sell some of our residential mortgage and brokered home equity loans in our Distressed Assets segment. These loans, the majority of which are seriously delinquent, reflect customer balances of approximately $2 billion and represent a carrying value of approximately $1 billion. 
As a result of the planned dispositions, we increased our provision and our charge-offs by $109 million and $75 million, respectively. We expect these sales to close in the third quarter. Now even with the impact of this sale decision, our ratio of net charge-offs to average loans, while higher than last quarter at 2.18%, compares favorably to the industry ratios.
Now we're beginning to see some more liquidity in the market, providing opportunities to sell our distressed assets to avoid future deterioration in servicing cost. For example, the residential mortgage sales included more than 8,000 loans, the majority of which are seriously delinquent. We believe these actions are prudent, as they will accelerate the reduction of future credit costs and will allow us to redeploy our resources to loans with a higher probability of recovery.
Now even with the final conversion to PNC systems, we also increased our reserve coverage on our remaining portfolio of impaired loans by approximately $200 million. We remain comfortable with our reserve coverage, including our $5.3 billion allowance and our marks of 27% on our impaired book. Clearly, our ability to deliver well-diversified revenues and manage our expenses continues to drive positive operating leverage and provides us with the ability to effectively manage our credit costs while still increasing common capital.
Now as shown on Slide 9, our Tier 1 common ratio at the end of the second quarter is estimated to be 8.4%, primarily as a result of second quarter earnings and our lower balance sheet. Since year end, our Tier 1 common ratio has increased by 240 basis points.
The pro forma ratio of 9% reflects the gain from the sale of Global Investment Servicing and the elimination of the related intangible assets on our balance sheet. The estimated net impact on capital from the sale is $1.4 billion. We now have a higher quality capital base, with 78% of our Tier 1 risk-based capital in common equity up from 50% a year ago. Our capital position provides us with the flexibility for future growth while investing in innovative products and services.
At PNC, we have a disciplined approach to capital management, which we believe serves us well. And with that, I'll hand it back to Jim."

Our focus now is on lowering our credit costs and growing revenue. 
We're making good progress on credit. And with the completion of National City's branch conversion, we're in a better position to provide fee-based products throughout a larger franchise. Over time, we expect to increase the percentage of noninterest income to total revenue. 
Our return-on-average assets in the second quarter was 1.22% and 1.12% through the first half of the year. We now have the branch conversions behind us. The passage of financial regulatory reform. With that and our strong first half performance, we have confidence to increase our return-to-average assets goal to 1.5% or greater, which is closer to our historical levels of performance. Clearly, we remain confident in our ability to achieve these strategic financial objectives over time as the economy recovers.
Finally, let me update the guidance we provided last quarter on our 2010 full year forecast as compared to the prior year. This forecast assumes a slow growth economy and continued low interest rates for the remainder of the year. 
First, we expect some pressure on net interest income in the second half of the year. However, we remain confident in our ability to keep revenue performance stable year-over-year. But this expectation, of course, excludes the impact of last year's BlackRock/BGI gain. Second, our overall credit quality has stabilized given the signs of improvement we are seeing. We're optimistic, frankly, that the loss provision will decline in the second half of the year, primarily because of declining delinquencies and nonperforming loans. And third, we have demonstrated our ability to effectively manage expenses.
As a result, we continue to believe that our pretax pre-provision earnings will substantially exceed credit cost, and we believe we are on target to deliver a strong full year 2010 and are comfortable with the range of the second half estimates for PNC. 
With that, we've been proud to announce the second quarter. We'll be happy to take your questions."

I think what you have to look at, the risk return.

So it's a really a mixed bag across the board, so it's very hard to say what level we would sell them because it depends on the return of the risk that we're taking. So I think you'll see it continue to shrink over time as it has already, but we would be opportunistic in our sales. With regards to buyers, I mean we found multiple buyers for that portfolio. So different people have different appetites, but the market is opening up. I mean there's a lot of liquidity sitting on the sidelines, and people are starting to aggressively bid on assets in a way that they didn't even six months ago.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This was an excellent quarter for PNC from both a financial and a strategic standpoint. We have executed our business plan in the first half of this year and are well positioned to deliver solid",1753,"Thank you, Bill. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This was an excellent quarter for PNC from both a financial and a strategic standpoint. We have executed our business plan in the first half of this year and are well positioned to deliver solid results in the second half.
I will say more about the financial results in a moment. But first, I would like to highlight some of our strategic accomplishments. 
The first one. We completed the final wave of National City customer and branch conversions last month. I believe this process was handled as well as any large client conversion that's been done in the banking industry. In total, we brought six million retail and business clients in nine states onto PNC's technology platform. We completed the process six months ahead of our original schedule. Client retention was within our expectations, and we've already significantly exceeded our original cost-savings target.
Second item. Sales across our franchise were 126% on plan through June 30. On a linked-quarter basis, total sales were up 6%. In our Western markets, sales were 113% on plan through the first half, and up 15% linked quarter. I believe that this reflects our customer focus throughout the conversion process. And what I'm very pleased about is the rate of customer penetration in our corporate bank.
Across the company, cross-selling is at 132% on plan year-to-date. In the Western markets, it's 110% on plan through six months. While not as robust as the levels in our Eastern markets, this reflects both the tremendous progress we're making and the opportunities for growth. With the conversion behind us, we are now investing in people to help us serve our customers in these markets, and we're implementing the PNC business model across the entire franchise.
Now another strategic highlight this quarter was arranging for the sales of residential mortgage loans and brokered home equity loans in our Distressed Assets segment. While the income statement effect of this sale is recorded in the second quarter, the balance sheet effect will take place in the third quarter as those sales close. It's important to note, the majority of these loans are seriously delinquent and they represent approximately $2 billion in customer balances. With the market for these loans opening up, we see this as an opportunity to reduce risk with reasonable valuations. And Rick will discuss this in more detail in a moment.
Finally, the regulatory reform legislation is now in place. We support many of the changes, such as the creation of a systemic risk regulator and the extension of consumer protection laws to nonbank financial companies. We believe core elements of the bill should contribute to a stronger and more secure financial system over time.
There are a variety of issues in the legislation that we are currently studying. There is much more to come in the hundreds of regulations expected over the next few years. One thing is clear. The reform bill will impact revenue and increase the cost of doing business. However, we believe that the expected changes will be manageable for PNC and will have a smaller impact on us than the Wall Street banks.
Now another important topic is capital, and we are well positioned from a capital standpoint. We closed the sale of Global Investment Servicing on July 1, which added to our capital. As of June 30, our estimated Tier 1 ratio was 10.8% and pro forma as of July 1, after the sale of GIS, Tier 1 would be 11.4%. The Tier 1 common ratio was 8.4% at the end of the quarter estimated, and reflecting the sale of GIS to pro forma as of July 1 is 9% for Tier 1 common. Since we closed on the National City acquisition, we have nearly doubled our Tier 1 common capital ratio when the impact of the GIS sale is included. 
Now overall, this was an exceptional quarter for PNC and we're well positioned for future growth despite the challenging economy.
Now let me provide you with some highlights of our financial results. We produced second quarter earnings of $803 million or $1.47 per diluted common share. That's a 20% increase in net income on a linked-quarter basis. Excluding integration costs of $0.13 per diluted common share, second quarter earnings per diluted common share would have been $1.60, an increase of 22% on a linked-quarter basis after adjusting the first quarter for integration costs and the early redemption of our TARP-preferred shares. Page 16 of the press release summarizes these adjustments. For the first half of the year, our net income of $1.5 billion was double that of the same period in 2009.
Starting with revenue. Our second quarter net interest income was up linked quarter, reflecting our ongoing success in repricing our deposits and lowering borrowing costs, somewhat offset by lower yields on investment securities. Non-interest income was up linked quarter, primarily due to the higher loan servicing and residential mortgage loan sales revenue, debit card income and net security gains, partially offset by declines in our more market-sensitive fee categories.
Regarding credit costs, our second quarter provision was $823 million. Excluding an additional provision of $109 million related to the arranging for the third quarter sales of some distressed assets that I mentioned, the amount is lower than our first quarter provision of $751 million. Assuming continued economic growth, we believe that the credit quality has stabilized and some metrics are showing signs of improvement on a linked-quarter basis. Namely, our delinquent loans and our nonperforming loans have showed meaningful declines.
Our second quarter expenses were down 5% linked quarter, enough said. Our financial results, frankly, were driven by our business segments and we're seeing growth opportunities throughout our expanded franchise. Retail Banking remained focused on expanding and deepening customer relationships. Checking relationships grew by 20,000 during the second quarter of 2010. Now our goal is to deepen these relationships. We saw active online bill payment grow by 5% during the second quarter alone.
Our Corporate and Institutional Bank had a very good quarter, while loan demand remains tepid. We're focused on our goal of adding 1,000 new customers in our corporate bank this year, which would double our new client growth for the combined company. Through six months, we're on track to reach that target.
Now with more of our clients on one platform, we saw increases in Treasury Management revenue in the second quarter. For the first half of the year, Treasury Management revenue was up $40 million to $600 million, an increase of 7% over the same period last year.
Earnings for our Asset Management Group were reflected, as you might guess, by the second quarter declines in the equity markets. In the quarter, this segment remained focused on deposit growth and adding customers and expense management. And this will position the business for improved profitability as the market rebounds.
Our Residential Mortgage business posted good second quarter results. Application volume increased largely due to seasonal factors. Now I would have to tell you that this business is making great progress as it transitions to a more moderate risk position. A new mortgage origination system was implemented to better serve clients and manage risk. And our Mortgage business is continuing to rebuild its sales force, which should help to drive increases in high-quality loan originations.
Regarding our distressed assets, this portfolio of $17 billion is down $4 billion since the same time last year, primarily as a result of paydowns, net charge-offs and dispositions. However, the sales I mentioned earlier are not reflected in this decline because they haven't closed yet, and we're making progress in managing the risks and returns on our distressed loan portfolio.
BlackRock had a very good second quarter. Their net income increased linked quarter nearly doubled that over a year ago. They're making good progress in their merger with Barclays Global Investors, which made them the largest publicly-traded investment management firm in the world, with more than $3.1 trillion in assets under management. At the end of the second quarter, our share of BlackRock's earnings was 23%.
Overall, I believe that we achieved excellent strategic and financial results in the second quarter. But I'd like to spend a few minutes talking a little bit in detail about our well-positioned balance sheet.
Turning to Slide 4. We believe that our balance sheet differentiates us. It remains highly liquid and it's well positioned for the current environment. On the asset side, we remain patient with our investment securities and continue to focus on short-duration agency and government securities. 
Total loans were down 2% in the second quarter, which we believe was consistent with industry trends. Loan utilization remains soft across the country. However, the pace of contraction appears to be slowing as we begin the third quarter. 
We recognize the vital importance of credit to our country's economic growth. We originated and renewed approximately $40 billion in loans and commitments in the second quarter, $72 billion for the first half of the year, which includes more than $2 billion in small-business loans. And additionally, we're committed to working with homeowners to help them avoid foreclosure, where appropriate. We completed approximately $1.5 billion in refinancing of the Home Affordable Refinance Program from the inception of the program through June 30. Now we've also set up approximately 86,000 workout packages to troubled borrowers under the Home Affordable Modification Program.
On the deposit side, transaction deposits were relatively flat linked quarter, but up more than $5 billion year-over-year as we've been enhancing our deposit mix with a focus on customer relationships and increased profitability. We have a strong deposit franchise, and we remain core-funded with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 86% as of June 30.
Our balance sheet as of June 30 remained asset-sensitive, with an estimated duration of equity of approximately negative three years. Our balance sheet provides us with a capacity to support clients as the economy gains momentum. And at the same time, our position allows for patience in the event economic conditions are slowed or improved in a meaningful way.
We also saw a growth in common equity of $1.2 billion linked quarter, and this does not include the positive impact from the July 1 sale of Global Investment Servicing.
Overall, this was a very strong first half and we accomplished a lot. And now Rick will provide you with more detail about our second quarter results, beginning with our ability to deliver high-quality earnings. Rick?"
294585,108851296,68647,"PNC Financial Services Group Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-22-2010",2010-07-22,"Earnings Calls","The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will focus on: first, our strong financial results and the key drivers of our pretax pre-provision earnings; second, the stabilization of our credit quality and the improvement in some of our credit met",1409,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will focus on: first, our strong financial results and the key drivers of our pretax pre-provision earnings; second, the stabilization of our credit quality and the improvement in some of our credit metrics and related credit costs and the adequacy of our reserve levels; and third, our continued improvements in the quality of our capital structure. 
In the second quarter, our well-diversified revenues increased and we reduced expenses. This allowed us to deliver pretax, pre-provision earnings that more than doubled our credit cost. As you can see on Slide 6, we delivered $3.9 billion in revenue in the second quarter and $1.9 billion in pretax pre-provision earnings compared to our provision of $823 million. 
Now let's begin with the components of revenue. Net interest income of $2.4 billion and our net interest margin of 4.35% for the quarter were up modestly from our first quarter results. A key driver is the ongoing repricing of our deposit base and higher-than-expected interest income on impaired loans. The latter, which you can see on Page 7 of the supplement, our cost of deposits in the second quarter was 71 basis points, down 10 basis points linked quarter and down 54 basis points year-over-year. We have approximately $14 billion of relationship-based CDs at an average rate of more than 2% that are scheduled to mature during the remainder of the year. Assuming rates stay low, and I believe they will, we will continue to reprice these deposits and lower our deposit funding costs even further.
Our total yield on interest earning assets declined linked quarter. While loan yields were up slightly due to higher-than-expected interest income on impaired loans, this improvement was more than offset by a 27-basis-point decline in the yield on our investment securities portfolio. This downward trend reflects the continuing migration of the portfolio to lower risk-asset classes, such as U.S. Treasury and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, along with impact of the lower rate environment.  The yield on new security purchases has declined significantly as interest rates have declined.
Looking forward, retail deposits costs should continue to decline albeit at a slower pace than we've seen in previous quarters. And I do expect interest income on loans and loan yields to decline as the contribution from impaired loans will decrease, looking more like the contribution in the first quarter. In addition, yields on securities will continue to decline as we replace maturities and prepayments with low-risk securities in a low-rate environment. 
As a result, you would expect to see the net interest income and yield on earning assets to decline, putting pressure on net interest income and the margin in the second half of the year. 
Noninterest income of $1.5 billion was up 7% linked quarter. The sources of our noninterest income remain high quality and well diversified. 
While client flows remained strong, asset management fees were affected by declines in the equity market values, resulting in a 6% decline linked quarter. Consumer services and service charges on deposits were up 6% linked quarter, primarily due to higher transaction volume-related fees and seasonality. We expect that the new Regulation E rules related to overdraft charges will negatively impact our second half revenue by an estimated $145 million. 
Corporate service fees saw higher merger and acquisition advisory fees in the second quarter. However, overall fees were down marginally linked quarter, primarily due to the exceptional special servicing revenue from commercial mortgage loans in the first quarter.
Residential mortgage fees were up 22% linked quarter, mainly due to higher loan servicing revenues and improved origination volumes. 
Net gains on securities sales and the impact of OTTI contributed $53 million in the second quarter compared to a loss of $26 million in the first quarter. Security gains for the quarter were primarily driven by sales of U.S. agency residential mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasury securities. Looking ahead, we anticipate ongoing improvement in the OTTI as the economy recovers. 
Finally, total other noninterest income was down primarily due to lower customer-related trading revenues. And once again, the diversification of our noninterest income revenue streams delivered good value in the quarter. As Jim mentioned, expenses declined 5% linked, primarily due to the reversal of certain accrued liabilities, with $73 million related to a franchise tax settlement and $47 million associated with a litigation indemnification.
Now if you go to Slide 7, we'll take a moment to talk about our cost-savings targets. We captured another $50 million of savings in the quarter, bringing us to $800 million in annualized acquisition-related cost savings in the first six months of the year, and our 18-month total comes to $1.6 billion. Our new goal for the end of 2010 is $1.8 billion.
If you recall, our original cost-savings target of $1.2 billion represented 10% of the expense base of the combined companies. When we reach $1.8 billion at the end of this year, we will have reduced the combined expenses by 15%, six months ahead of schedule. At the same time, we have remained focused on making investments in support of new customers and product development.
Now let's take a look at our credit quality and cost trends on Slide 8. Overall credit quality continued to stabilize, and delinquencies and nonperforming loans showed signs of improvement. All delinquencies were down approximately 25% in the quarter compared to linked quarter. And for the first time since the recession began in 2007, our nonperforming loans declined. 
On a linked-quarter basis, nonperforming loans decreased by almost $0.5 billion or 8%, driven by a substantial reduction in loans transferred to nonperforming loans, which you can see on Page 11 of the supplement. 
Our provision of $823 million for the second quarter is an increase of $72 million compared to the prior quarter. And net charge-off of $840 million increased from the prior quarter by $149 million. As Jim mentioned, we made a strategic decision during the quarter to sell some of our residential mortgage and brokered home equity loans in our Distressed Assets segment. These loans, the majority of which are seriously delinquent, reflect customer balances of approximately $2 billion and represent a carrying value of approximately $1 billion. 
As a result of the planned dispositions, we increased our provision and our charge-offs by $109 million and $75 million, respectively. We expect these sales to close in the third quarter. Now even with the impact of this sale decision, our ratio of net charge-offs to average loans, while higher than last quarter at 2.18%, compares favorably to the industry ratios.
Now we're beginning to see some more liquidity in the market, providing opportunities to sell our distressed assets to avoid future deterioration in servicing cost. For example, the residential mortgage sales included more than 8,000 loans, the majority of which are seriously delinquent. We believe these actions are prudent, as they will accelerate the reduction of future credit costs and will allow us to redeploy our resources to loans with a higher probability of recovery.
Now even with the final conversion to PNC systems, we also increased our reserve coverage on our remaining portfolio of impaired loans by approximately $200 million. We remain comfortable with our reserve coverage, including our $5.3 billion allowance and our marks of 27% on our impaired book. Clearly, our ability to deliver well-diversified revenues and manage our expenses continues to drive positive operating leverage and provides us with the ability to effectively manage our credit costs while still increasing common capital.
Now as shown on Slide 9, our tier 1 common ratio at the end of the second quarter is estimated to be 8.4%, primarily as a result of second quarter earnings and our lower balance sheet. Since year end, our tier 1 common ratio has increased by 240 basis points.
The pro forma ratio of 9% reflects the gain from the sale of Global Investment Servicing and the elimination of the related intangible assets on our balance sheet. The estimated net impact on capital from the sale is $1.4 billion. We now have a higher quality capital base, with 78% of our tier 1 risk-based capital in common equity up from 50% a year ago. Our capital position provides us with the flexibility for future growth while investing in innovative products and services.
At PNC, we have a disciplined approach to capital management, which we believe serves us well. And with that, I'll hand it back to Jim."

Our focus now is on lowering our credit costs and growing revenue. 
We're making good progress on credit. And with the completion of National City's branch conversion, we're in a better position to provide fee-based products throughout a larger franchise. Over time, we expect to increase the percentage of non-interest income to total revenue. 
Our return-on-average assets in the second quarter was 1.22% and 1.12% through the first half of the year. We now have the branch conversions behind us. The passage of financial regulatory reform. With that and our strong first half performance, we have confidence to increase our return-to-average assets goal to 1.5% or greater, which is closer to our historical levels of performance. Clearly, we remain confident in our ability to achieve these strategic financial objectives over time as the economy recovers.
Finally, let me update the guidance we provided last quarter on our 2010 full year forecast as compared to the prior year. This forecast assumes a slow growth economy and continued low interest rates for the remainder of the year. 
First, we expect some pressure on net interest income on the second half of the year. However, we remain confident in our ability to keep revenue performance stable year-over-year. But this expectation, of course, excludes the impact of last year's BlackRock/BGI gain. Second, our overall credit quality has stabilized given the signs of improvement we are seeing. We're optimistic, frankly, that the loss provision will decline in the second half of the year, primarily because of declining delinquencies and nonperforming loans. And third, we have demonstrated our ability to effectively manage expenses.
As a result, we continue to believe that our pretax pre-provision earnings will substantially exceed credit cost, and we believe we are on target to deliver a strong full year 2010 and are comfortable with the range of the second half estimates for PNC. 
With that, we've been proud to announce the second quarter. We'll be happy to take your questions."

I think what you have to look at, the risk return. There's a significant portion of our distressed book where we believe that the asset value will be fully recovered at our current book value, and so those we would probably not want to sell in a rapid fashion. There are others, like the ones that we just sold, where clearly, they were the low end of the food chain and we're more than happy to have someone else try and recover those. So it's really a mixed bag across the board, so it's very hard to say what level we would sell them because it depends on the return of the risk that we're taking. So I think you'll see it continue to shrink over time as it has already, but we would be opportunistic in our sales. With regards to buyers, I mean we found multiple buyers for that portfolio. So different people have different appetites, but the market is opening up. I mean there's a lot of liquidity sitting on the sidelines, and people are starting to aggressively bid on assets in a way that they didn't even six months ago. I think you saw that there were two commercial mortgage-backed securities books that are going to go public in the next quarter, so I think that really is indicative of how the market is changing."

We continue to improve the quality of our capital, and our Tier 1 capital is now at record levels. And following the completion of National City's branch conversion, we saw a strong sales momentum across the franchise. And most importantly, we grew new customers throughout our operations. 
As a result, you can see that we produced third quarter earnings of $1.1 billion or $2.7 per diluted common share. Excluding integration costs and a gain on our sale of Global Investment Servicing, third quarter earnings per diluted common share would have been $1.56. Page 18 of the press release details these adjustments. Our year-to-date net income of $2.6 billion was nearly double the same period in 2009. 
Now let me provide you with some highlights of our financial results. Our sources of revenue continued to be well diversified. While net interest income remains under pressure, we've demonstrated opportunities for future non-interest income growth. And as we told you to expect, revenue in the third quarter was lower linked-quarter, primarily due to the challenging operating environment, i.e., the implementation of certain regulations, and we have two items in our net interest income that we have signaled that we wouldn't repeat.
Our third quarter expenses were essentially flat compared to the prior period when two second quarter reversals totaling $120 million are excluded. Overall, expenses continued to be well managed, and we are on track to achieve our annualized acquisition cost savings goal of $1.8 billion by year end. Rick will discuss our overall income statement in more detail.
Our pretax pre-provision earnings were $1.4 billion in the third quarter, which was nearly 3x the cost of credit. And turning to our credit cost, overall credit quality showed signs of improvement, and credit costs were significantly lower in the third quarter. Our provision was $486 million, sharply lower, linked-quarter, and down 47% compared to the same period last year, in part due to the sales of residential mortgage loans and brokered home equity loans which closed in the third quarter. 
We are making good progress in returning to a moderate-risk profile through deliberate actions to manage our risks and returns.
Other factors that contributed to the decline in the provision were credit exposure reductions and basically, overall improving credit migration.
Now with the integration of the National City branches behind us, we are now on a common technology and product platform. This allows us to distribute new products and services into our new markets, providing us with tremendous opportunities to grow our businesses. Sales across our combined franchise were 128% of plan through September 30. And on a linked-quarter basis, total sales were up 15%.
Our third quarter sales results demonstrated this momentum. In our newly acquired markets, sales were 122% of plans for the first nine months, up 35% linked-quarter and 68% year-over-year. And I think, clearly, this reflects our customer focus throughout the conversion process. 
Now we're also seeing excellent progress in our ability to deepen relationships with customers, and I'm especially pleased with the performance in our newly acquired markets as cross-selling activity there through nine months has increased 11% year-over-year.
Now one thing I'm sure of, we are using our balance sheet strength to make credit available to qualified borrowers, as we recognize, this is extremely important to the country's economic growth. We originated and renewed approximately $39 billion in loans and commitments in the third quarter while $112 billion for the first nine months of the year, which includes more than $2.6 billion in small business loans. 
We also saw increased demand for PNC products as a result of implementing our business model in converted markets. On a retail banking side, we saw a significant customer growth as checking relationships increased by 53,000 during the third quarter, which is more than 2.5x the growth we saw in the second quarter. 
Our goal is to deepen these relationships, and we saw our active online bill payment customers grow by 8% in the quarter, and we continued to see strong customer and employee engagement levels throughout the retail operations. 
We've been expanding our University Banking program and recently signed agreements with Grove City College in Pennsylvania, Bowling Green State University and the University of Cincinnati in Ohio and DePaul University in Illinois. We now have relationships with more than 150 colleges and universities, enabling PNC to reach a large group of customers with a variety of banking products and services to students, faculty and staff.
Our Corporate and Institutional Bank had a very good quarter. While loan demand remains tepid, our new client growth was at 2x the face of any previous record year. With more of our clients in one platform, we're seeing increases this year in treasury management, capital market revenues. 
Treasury management revenue for the first nine months increased by 9% compared with the same period last year. In healthcare alone, revenues year-to-date are up more than 20% compared to the same period last year. Year-to-date capital markets revenue, which is basically customer business, is up 19% compared to the first nine months of last year. And we booked some of the largest transactions in the history of the company during the first three quarters of this year. 
Our Asset Manager business had a strong quarter and outperformed its sales and client acquisition goals, due primarily to significant referrals from other business segments. In fact, referrals in newly acquired markets were up 40% linked-quarter. Assets under administration at the end of the third quarter were more than $200 billion, and operating expenses remained well controlled.
Residential Mortgage also had a good quarter. Mortgage loan originations were $2.7 billion in the third quarter, up 17% from the second quarter, driven by seasonal factors and the marketplace of course. Year-to-date servicing fees are up 15% compared to the first nine months of last year, and expenses through three quarters are down 29% year-over-year. 
Now I'd like to talk to you briefly about the recent industrywide focus on foreclosure documentation. As you know, our market share for Residential Servicing is less than 2%. The vast majority of our Servicing business is on behalf of other investors, principally Freddie [Freddie Mac] and Fannie [Fannie Mae]. 
Nonetheless, PNC understands how important it is that the foreclosure process is correct, so both borrowers are protected and necessary foreclosures are able to proceed. We are taking a close look at our foreclosure procedures, and while that review is ongoing, I can report the following: Based on the review today, we believe that PNC has systems designed to ensure that no foreclosure goes forward, unless the loan is genuinely in default. Indeed, on average, our loans and foreclosure are more than one year delinquent. Like a number of other banks, we have identified issues with respect to some of the documentation. We're holding off pursuing individual pending foreclosures until we're confident that any documentation issues have been fixed. But as of now, we are proceeding with new foreclosures under enhanced procedures designed as part of this review to remove any question about the processing of documentation in foreclosure cases.
Moving on, I'm pleased with the progress we're making with our Distressed Assets. This portfolio of $16 billion is down $4 billion since the same time last year, primarily as a result of pay downs, net charge-offs and dispositions. And that included the loan sales I mentioned earlier. 
And last but not the least, BlackRock had a very good third quarter; a reported net income of $551 million yesterday, which was up $234 million year-over-year. Compared to a year ago, their operating results reflect the benefits of the Barclays Global Investor acquisition and the improved markets. They continued to make good progress on their merger with BGI, which made them the largest publicly traded investment management firm in the world, with more than $3.4 trillion in assets under management. For the third quarter, our share of BlackRock earnings was 23%.
Now Rick will provide you with more detail about our third quarter results, beginning with our high-quality balance sheet. Rick?"

Today, I'm going to focus on three topics. First, the steps we are taking to return our balance sheet to a moderate-risk profile, and this includes continued improvement in our credit quality metrics; second, our strong earnings, including the impact of credit risk, reduction activities on our net interest income and our provision; and finally, the continued growth in our capital ratios and our book value per share.
Now let me begin on Slide 6 with our balance sheet, which remains highly liquid, well capitalized and asset sensitive. Loan balances continued to, contract driven by loan payoffs, loan sales, net charge-offs and continued soft credit demand, primarily in the commercial and commercial real estate categories. 
On the deposit side, third quarter transaction deposits increased by $2.5 billion linked-quarter, a strong sign of our ability to grow our customer deposit franchise. 
We also continued to reduce our higher cost CDs and other time accounts, while retaining nearly 80% of the relationship balances. These trends resulted in a loan-to-deposit ratio of 84%, a highly liquid balance sheet.
We also added nearly $10 billion in high-quality, short duration securities to our portfolio, with approximately 90% of the growth coming in purchases of agency residential mortgage-backed securities. A significant portion of the increase reflected the settlement of previous quarter forward purchases, repositioning from swaps into securities and investments to utilize the excess liquidity we continued to create.
We also saw a growth in common equity at $1.7 billion linked-quarter to $29.4 billion, bringing our total increase in common equity for the year to $7.4 billion. Our capital and liquidity positions provide us with the capacity to support clients as the economy gains momentum. At the same time, our positioning and our ability to grow fee income and manage expenses allow for patience in the event economic conditions do not approve in the near term.
Slide 7 shows our credit quality metrics, which continued to improve in the third quarter. Our non-performing loans at the end of the third quarter were down $274 million or 5% on a linked-quarter basis, and they were lower by $835 million or 15% compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. 
Early-stage delinquencies declined by 23%, and late stage delinquencies were essentially flat in the third quarter compared to linked-quarter results. This clearly reflects improving credit trends. 
Net charge-offs declined, due to the $75 million of charge-offs in the second quarter related to our bulk sale in the consumer space and the improvement in residential real estate, commercial real estate and equipment lease categories.
In addition, we continued to see an overall improvement in credit migration for performing loans and a reduction in overall credit exposure. 
Now assuming, at least, a modest GDP growth, we believe delinquencies and non-performing metrics will continue to come down in the fourth quarter. 
Before I review our overall third quarter earnings in greater detail, let me focus on our trends in net interest income and provision, two areas, I know, are great interest to all of you.
Now Slide 8 shows a roll-forward of our net interest income and provision from the second to the third quarter, along with the trend of our net interest margin, our cost of credit and our credit risk adjusted net interest margin. The chart in the upper left-hand corner showed the effects on net interest income of certain purchase accounting adjustments recorded in the second quarter of $93 million, which we do not expect to repeat, and the net interest impact of consumer and commercial distressed loan sales that closed in the third quarter of $56 million. 
The chart also shows the residual impact of $71 million on net interest income, due to lower purchase accounting accretion, as expected, and the challenge of lower loan balances in a low-interest-rate environment. This latter decline of $71 million represents 3% of our third quarter net interest income and is a better indication of the net interest income decline you can expect from PNC from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2010.
The chart in the lower left shows the roll-forward of our provision for the second to the third quarter. Similar to net interest income, the provision was lower partly due to the second quarter addition of $109 million for the loan sales we discussed in the second quarter and of an additional $100 million for seriously delinquent loans in our Distressed Asset portfolio, which was also booked in the second quarter. We also saw the provision decreased by $128 million linked-quarter, due to the credit migration improvement I described in the prior slide and due to an overall reduction in credit exposure.
On the chart in the upper right shows our net interest margin trend, which as expected, declined this quarter. However, we are paying particular attention to the credit risk adjusted net interest margin, which considers the impact of annualized provision as a percentage of our average interest earning assets on net interest income. We used this ratio to help demonstrate our commitment to our moderate-risk philosophy and to show the impact of declining net interest income compared to improvements in credit costs as we focus on lowering our balance sheet risks. 
As you can see, the credit risk adjusted margin has remained stable over the past couple of quarters. Our focus remains on securing assets that have appropriate risk adjusted returns. Similar to our strategy prior to the credit crisis, we did not plan to take undue credit or interest rate risk as a means to enhance our net interest margin. We will continue to remain disciplined to help ensure we get paid for the risk we take.
Now looking ahead, we expect net interest income and margin to trend down in the fourth quarter, but at a slower pace than we saw from the second to the third quarter. And assuming there is no downturn in the economy, we expect a relatively stable to improving provision and a relatively stable credit risk adjusted net interest margin in the fourth quarter compared to recent quarters of 2.9% to 3.1%.
Now let's review our overall income statement on Slide 9. We delivered $3.6 billion in revenue in the third quarter and $1.4 billion in pretax pre-provision earnings compared to our provision of $486 million. This allowed us to deliver pretax pre-provision earnings that were nearly 3x greater than our credit cost. And while pretax earnings declined as expected by 12% compared to the second quarter, we delivered a 32% increase in pretax earnings from a year ago.
Since we already discussed net interest income and provision, now let's focus on non-interest income, expenses and taxes. As Jim mentioned earlier, we saw a substantial improvement in sales momentum in the third quarter, and our core fees increased linked-quarter in most categories, with Asset Management, Consumer Services and Residential Mortgage fees up 2%, 4% and 21%, respectively.
The Residential Mortgage improvement was driven by a strong origination volumes and net hedging gains on mortgage servicing rights, partially offset by additional repurchase reserves of $44 million. On the other hand, we saw a decrease in corporate service fees, which were down $78 million linked-quarter, primarily due to a $100 million evaluation adjustments in our commercial mortgage servicing rights driven primarily by lower interest rates. Otherwise, corporate service fees increased by 8%.
As expected, service charges on deposits were down $45 million linked-quarter, primarily due to the impact of Regulation E. Net security gains decreased by $26 million, similar to the amount of improvement in our OTTI charges. Our OTTI charges were down to $71 million in the third quarter. And other non-interest income was down $24 million linked-quarter, primarily due to $52 million of repurchase reserves on assets related to our Distressed Asset Portfolio. 
We continued to be disciplined in expense management. Excluding the $120 million of accrued liabilities reversed in the second quarter, expenses were essentially flat to linked-quarter.
Regarding acquisition-related cost savings, we captured another $25 million in the quarter, bringing our current 21-month total to $1.7 billion of annualized cost savings. We are well on our way towards reaching our year-end goal of $1.8 billion. 
The effective tax rate was lower for the third quarter at 18.8%. The lower rate resulted primarily from the favorable tax settlement of approximately $89 million that we previously discussed. 
As a result, including the $328 million after-tax gain on the sale of Global Investment Servicing, which closed at the beginning of the quarter, we reported net income of $1.1 billion for the third quarter and $2.6 billion year-to-date, which has been a strong contributor to our capital growth.
As shown on Slide 10, our Tier 1 common ratio at the end of third quarter is estimated to be 9.6%. The 130 basis point gain linked-quarter was due to the sale of Global Investment Servicing, along with third quarter earnings and our lower risk-weighted assets. 
Since year end, our Tier 1 common ratio has increased by 360 basis points, and our book value per share has increased 17% since December 31, 2009, and it's up 42% since we closed on the acquisition of National City on December 31, 2008.
While we are still waiting for greater clarity regarding Basel III, I believe our capital position, along with our future earnings, will provide us with the flexibility for growth while investing in our markets, our people and innovative products and services. At PNC, we have a disciplined approach to capital management, which we believe, serves as well. 
Now turning to the fourth quarter, let me provide some guidance. Regarding revenues, I discussed, we expect to see continued reduced pressure on net interest income. However, as mentioned earlier, I am optimistic about prospects for a stable to lower provision. 
As a result, we expect our credit risk adjusted net interest margin to be reasonably stable with recent quarters. We look for solid performance in fee income assuming fewer impairments, and I believe our expenses will be down, primarily due to lower integration cost. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Jim."

In summary, PNC's business model continued to deliver strong results in the third quarter during a time of significant uncertainty for our industry. The management team has been through cycles like this before, and we are focused on delivering for our customers and our shareholders. 
Our balance sheet is strong, our credit metrics continued to improve. We're going customers through our expanded franchise, and our expenses are well managed. And we're focused on returning to a moderate-risk profile. And then, importantly, our capital is at record levels.

And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As you can see, this was an excellent quarter for PNC in a very challenging operating environment.

As you can see, this was an excellent quarter for PNC in a very challenging operating environment. We produced very strong third quarter earnings, closed on a sale of Global Investment Servicing in July 1, our balance sheet remains well positioned and we're core-funded with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 84%.
We continue to improve the quality of our capital, and our Tier 1 capital is now at record levels. And following the completion of National City's branch conversion, we saw a strong sales momentum across the franchise. And most importantly, we grew new customers throughout our operations. 
As a result, you can see that we produced third quarter earnings of $1.1 billion or $2.07 per diluted common share. Excluding integration costs and a gain on our sale of Global Investment Servicing, third quarter earnings per diluted common share would have been $1.56. Page 18 of the press release details these adjustments. Our year-to-date net income of $2.6 billion was nearly double the same period in 2009. 
Now let me provide you with some highlights of our financial results. Our sources of revenue continued to be well diversified. While net interest income remains under pressure, we've demonstrated opportunities for future non-interest income growth. As we told you to expect, revenue in the third quarter was lower linked-quarter, primarily due to the challenging operating environment, i.e., the implementation of certain regulations, and we have two items in our net interest income that we have signaled that we wouldn't repeat.
Our third quarter expenses were essentially flat compared to the prior period when two second quarter reversals totaling $120 million are excluded. Overall, expenses continue to be well managed, and we are on track to achieve our annualized acquisition cost savings goal of $1.8 billion by year-end. Rick will discuss our overall income statement in more detail.
Our pretax pre-provision earnings were $1.4 billion in the third quarter, which was nearly 3x the cost of credit. And turning to our credit cost, overall credit quality showed signs of improvement, and credit costs were significantly lower in the third quarter. Our provision was $486 million, sharply lower, linked-quarter, and down 47% compared to the same period last year, in part, due to the sales of residential mortgage loans and brokered home equity loans which closed in the third quarter. 
We are making good progress in returning to a moderate-risk profile through deliberate actions to manage our risks and returns.
Other factors that contributed to the decline in the provision were credit exposure reductions and basically, overall improving credit migration.
Now with the integration of the National City branches behind us, we are now on a common technology and product platform. This allows us to distribute new products and services into our new markets, providing us with tremendous opportunities to grow our businesses. Sales across our combined franchise were 128% of plan through September 30. And on a linked-quarter basis, total sales were up 15%.
Our third quarter sales results demonstrated this momentum. In our newly acquired markets, sales were 122% of plans for the first nine months, up 35% linked-quarter and 68% year-over-year. And I think, clearly, this reflects our customer focus throughout the conversion process. 
Now we're also seeing excellent progress in our ability to deepen relationships with customers, and I'm especially pleased with the performance in our newly acquired markets as cross-selling activity there through nine months has increased 11% year-over-year.
Now one thing I'm sure of, we are using our balance sheet strength to make credit available to qualified borrowers, as we recognize, this is extremely important to the country's economic growth. We originated and renewed approximately $39 billion in loans and commitments in the third quarter and $112 billion for the first nine months of the year, which includes more than $2.6 billion in small business loans. 
We also saw increased demand for PNC products as a result of implementing our business model in converted markets. On a retail banking side, we saw a significant customer growth as checking relationships increased by 53,000 during the third quarter, which is more than 2.5x the growth we saw in the second quarter. 
Our goal is to deepen these relationships, and we saw our active online bill payment customers grow by 8% in the quarter, and we continue to see strong customer and employee engagement levels throughout the retail operations. 
We've been expanding our University Banking program and recently signed agreements with Grove City College in Pennsylvania, Bowling Green State University and the University of Cincinnati in Ohio and DePaul University in Illinois. We now have relationships with more than 150 colleges and universities, enabling PNC to reach a large group of customers with a variety of banking products and services to students, faculty and staff.
Our Corporate and Institutional Bank had a very good quarter. While loan demand remains tepid, our new client growth was at 2x the pace of any previous record year. With more of our clients on one platform, we're seeing increases this year in treasury management, capital market revenues. 
Treasury management revenue through the first nine months increased by 9% compared with the same period last year. In healthcare alone, revenues year-to-date are up more than 20% compared to the same period last year. Year-to-date capital markets revenue, which is basically customer business, is up 19% compared to the first nine months of last year. And we booked some of the largest transactions in the history of the company during the first three quarters of this year. 
Our Asset Management business had a strong quarter and outperformed its sales and client acquisition goals, due primarily to significant referrals from other business segments. In fact, referrals in newly acquired markets were up 40% linked-quarter. Assets under administration at the end of the third quarter were more than $200 billion, and operating expenses remained well controlled.
Residential Mortgage also had a good quarter. Mortgage loan originations were $2.7 billion in the third quarter, up 17% from the second quarter, driven by seasonal factors and the marketplace of course. Year-to-date servicing fees are up 15% compared to the first nine months of last year, and expenses through three quarters are down 29% year-over-year. 
Now I'd like to talk to you briefly about the recent industry-wide focus on foreclosure documentation. As you know, our market share for Residential Servicing is less than 2%. The vast majority of our Servicing business is on behalf of other investors, principally Freddie and Fannie. 
Nonetheless, PNC understands how important it is that the foreclosure process is correct, so both borrowers are protected and necessary foreclosures are able to proceed. We are taking a close look at our foreclosure procedures, and while that review is ongoing, I can report the following: Based on the review to date, we believe that PNC has systems designed to ensure that no foreclosure goes forward, unless the loan is genuinely in default. Indeed, on average, our loans and foreclosure are more than one year delinquent. Like a number of other banks, we have identified issues with respect to some of the documentation. We're holding off pursuing individual pending foreclosures until we're confident that any documentation issues have been fixed. But as of now, we are proceeding with new foreclosures under enhanced procedures designed as part of this review to remove any question about the processing of documentation in foreclosure cases.
Moving on, I'm pleased with the progress we're making with our Distressed Assets. This portfolio of $16 billion is down $4 billion since the same time last year, primarily as a result of pay-downs, net charge-offs and dispositions. And that included the loan sales I mentioned earlier. 
And last but not the least, BlackRock had a very good third quarter; a reported net income of $551 million yesterday, which was up $234 million year-over-year. Compared to a year ago, their operating results reflect the benefits of the Barclays Global Investor acquisition and the improved markets. They continued to make good progress on their merger with BGI, which made them the largest publicly traded investment management firm in the world, with more than $3.4 trillion in assets under management. For the third quarter, our share of BlackRock earnings was 23%.
Now Rick will provide you with more detail about our third quarter results, beginning with our high-quality balance sheet. Rick?"

And good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to focus on three topics: First, the steps we are taking to return our balance sheet to a moderate-risk profile, and this includes continued improvement in our credit quality metrics; second, our strong earnings, including the impact of credit risk reduction activities on our net interest income and our provision [ph]; and finally, the continued growth in our capital ratios and our book value per share.
Now let me begin on Slide 6 with our balance sheet, which remains highly liquid, well capitalized and asset sensitive. Loan balances continued to contract driven by loan payoffs, loan sales, net charge-offs and continued soft credit demand, primarily in the commercial and commercial real estate categories. 
On the deposit side, third quarter transaction deposits increased by $2.5 billion linked-quarter, a strong sign of our ability to grow our customer deposit franchise. 
We also continue to reduce our higher cost CDs and other time accounts, while retaining nearly 80% of the relationship balances. These trends resulted in a loan-to-deposit ratio of 84%, a highly liquid balance sheet.
We also added nearly $10 billion in high-quality, short duration securities to our portfolio, with approximately 90% of the growth coming in purchases of agency residential mortgage-backed securities. A significant portion of the increase reflected the settlement of previous quarter forward purchases, repositioning from swaps into securities and investments to utilize the excess liquidity we continue to create.
We also saw a growth in common equity at $1.7 billion linked-quarter to $29.4 billion, bringing our total increase in common equity for the year to $7.4 billion. Our capital and liquidity positions provide us with the capacity to support clients as the economy gains momentum. At the same time, our positioning and our ability to grow fee income and manage expenses allow for patience in the event economic conditions do not approve in the near term.
Slide 7 shows our credit quality metrics, which continued to improve in the third quarter. Our non-performing loans at the end of the third quarter were down $274 million or 5% on a linked-quarter basis, and they were lower by $835 million or 15% compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. 
Early-stage delinquencies declined by 23%, and late stage delinquencies were essentially flat in the third quarter compared to linked-quarter results. This clearly reflects improving credit trends. 
Net charge-offs declined, due to the $75 million of charge-offs in the second quarter related to our bulk sale in the consumer space and the improvement in residential real estate, commercial real estate and equipment lease categories.
In addition, we continued to see an overall improvement in credit migration for performing loans and a reduction in overall credit exposure. 
Now assuming, at least, a modest GDP growth, we believe delinquencies and non-performing metrics will continue to come down in the fourth quarter. 
Before I review our overall third quarter earnings in greater detail, let me focus on our trends in net interest income and provision, two areas, I know, are great interest to all of you.
Now Slide 8 shows a roll-forward of our net interest income and provision from the second to the third quarter, along with the trend of our net interest margin, our cost of credit and our credit risk adjusted net interest margin. The chart in the upper left-hand corner shows the effects on net interest income of certain purchase accounting adjustments recorded in the second quarter of $93 million, which we do not expect to repeat, and the net interest impact of consumer and commercial distressed loan sales that closed in the third quarter of $56 million. 
The chart also shows the residual impact of $71 million on net interest income, due to lower purchase accounting accretion, as expected, and the challenge of lower loan balances in a low interest rate environment. This latter decline of $71 million represents 3% of our third quarter net interest income and is a better indication of the net interest income decline you can expect from PNC from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2010.
The chart in the lower left shows the roll-forward of our provision for the second to the third quarter. Similar to net interest income, the provision was lower partly due to the second quarter addition of $109 million for the loan sales we discussed in the second quarter and of an additional $100 million for seriously delinquent loans in our Distressed Asset portfolio, which was also booked in the second quarter. We also saw the provision decreased by $128 million linked-quarter, due to the credit migration improvement I described in the prior slide and due to an overall reduction in credit exposure.
Now the chart in the upper right shows our net interest margin trend, which as expected, declined this quarter. However, we are paying particular attention to the credit risk adjusted net interest margin, which considers the impact of annualized provision as a percentage of our average interest earning assets on net interest income. We used this ratio to help demonstrate our commitment to our moderate-risk philosophy and to show the impact of declining net interest income compared to improvements in credit costs as we focus on lowering our balance sheet risk. 
As you can see, the credit risk adjusted margin has remained stable over the past couple of quarters. Our focus remains on securing assets that have appropriate risk adjusted returns. Similar to our strategy prior to the credit crisis, we did not plan to take undue credit or interest rate risk as a means to enhance our net interest margin. We will continue to remain disciplined to help ensure we get paid for the risk we take.
Now looking ahead, we expect net interest income and margin to trend down in the fourth quarter, but at a slower pace than we saw from the second to the third quarter. And assuming there is no downturn in the economy, we expect a relatively stable to improving provision and a relatively stable credit risk adjusted net interest margin in the fourth quarter compared to recent quarters of 2.9% to 3.1%.
Now let's review our overall income statement on Slide 9. We delivered $3.6 billion in revenue in the third quarter and $1.4 billion in pretax pre-provision earnings compared to our provision of $486 million. This allowed us to deliver pretax pre-provision earnings that were nearly 3x greater than our credit cost. And while pretax earnings declined as expected by 12% compared to the second quarter, we delivered a 32% increase in pretax earnings from a year ago.
Since we already discussed net interest income and provision, now let's focus on non-interest income, expenses and taxes. As Jim mentioned earlier, we saw a substantial improvement in sales momentum in the third quarter, and our core fees increased linked-quarter in most categories, with Asset Management, Consumer Services and Residential Mortgage fees up 2%, 4% and 21%, respectively.
The Residential Mortgage improvement was driven by strong origination volumes and net hedging gains on mortgage servicing rights, partially offset by additional repurchase reserves of $44 million. On the other hand, we saw a decrease in corporate service fees, which were down $78 million linked-quarter, primarily due to a $100 million evaluation adjustments in our commercial mortgage servicing rights driven primarily by lower interest rates. Otherwise, corporate service fees increased by 8%.
As expected, service charges on deposits were down $45 million linked-quarter, primarily due to the impact of Regulation E. Net security gains decreased by $26 million, similar to the amount of improvement in our OTTI charges. Our OTTI charges were down to $71 million in the third quarter. And other non-interest income was down $24 million linked-quarter, primarily due to $52 million of repurchase reserves on assets related to our Distressed Asset Portfolio. 
We continued to be disciplined in expense management. Excluding the $120 million of accrued liabilities reversed in the second quarter, expenses were essentially flat to linked-quarter.
Regarding acquisition-related cost savings, we captured another $25 million in the quarter, bringing our current 21-month total to $1.7 billion of annualized cost savings. We are well on our way towards reaching our year-end goal of $1.8 billion. 
The effective tax rate was lower for the third quarter at 18.8%. The lower rate resulted primarily from the favorable tax settlement of approximately $89 million that we previously discussed. 
As a result, including the $328 million after-tax gain on the sale of Global Investment Servicing, which closed at the beginning of the quarter, we reported net income of $1.1 billion for the third quarter and $2.6 billion year-to-date, which has been a strong contributor to our capital growth.
As shown on Slide 10, our Tier 1 common ratio at the end of third quarter is estimated to be 9.6%. The 130 basis point gain linked-quarter was due to the sale of Global Investment Servicing, along with third quarter earnings and our lower risk-weighted assets. 
Since year-end, our Tier 1 common ratio has increased by 360 basis points, and our book value per share has increased 17% since December 31, 2009, and it's up 42% since we closed on the acquisition of National City on December 31, 2008.
While we are still waiting for greater clarity regarding Basel III, I believe our capital position, along with our future earnings, will provide us with the flexibility for growth while investing in our markets, our people and innovative products and services. At PNC, we have a disciplined approach to capital management, which we believe, serves as well. 
Now turning to the fourth quarter, let me provide some guidance. Regarding revenues, I discussed, we expect to see continued but reduced pressure on net interest income. However, as mentioned earlier, I am optimistic about prospects for a stable to lower provision. 
As a result, we expect our credit risk adjusted net interest margin to be reasonably stable with recent quarters. We look for solid performance in fee income assuming fewer impairments, and I believe our expenses will be down, primarily due to lower integration cost. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Jim."

One is that, we're not certain that BlackRock even falls under the definition of financial institution. As you know, the rule about investing in minority interest and other financial institutions was really proposed to affect banks investing in other banks and then, re-levering the same capital. And so, BlackRock is not a leveraged institution, as you know. So it kind of doesn't fall in the category of the purpose of the rule. So we have to wait and see what whether it's -- and haven't included under Basel I or Basel II. So we have to wait and know whether it actually fits at all. And secondly, as Rick said earlier, we have almost $2 billion reserve for taxes set up. So it clearly seems to me that there's got to be an after-tax view, because of -- the theory is, if the stock runs down, well, if the stock runs down, we're not going to be able to pay those taxes. So there's got to be an after-tax item. And then, there's another issue that says in the rule, that it's common stock. And only 50% of our holdings in BlackRock are in common, the other in preferred.

When you think of that, and usually when I think about risk-adjusted margins, it's charge-offs, because the provisions got this kind of little bit of a backward-looking catch-up to it, particularly at this point.

As you can see, this was an excellent quarter for PNC in a very challenging operating environment. We produced very strong third quarter earnings, we closed on the sale of Global Investment Servicing on July 1, our balance sheet remains well positioned and we're core-funded with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 84%.
We continue to improve the quality of our capital, and our Tier 1 capital is now at record levels. And following the completion of National City's branch conversion, we saw strong sales momentum across the franchise. And most importantly, we grew new customers throughout our operations. 
As a result, you can see that we produced third quarter earnings of $1.1 billion or $2.07 per diluted common share. Excluding integration costs and the gain on our sale of Global Investment Servicing, third quarter earnings per diluted common share would have been $1.56. Page 18 of the press release details these adjustments. Our year-to-date net income of $2.6 billion was nearly double the same period in 2009. 
Now let me provide you with some highlights of our financial results. Our sources of revenue continue to be well diversified. And while net interest income remains under pressure, we've demonstrated opportunities for future non-interest income growth. And as we told you to expect, revenue in the third quarter was lower linked-quarter, primarily due to the challenging operating environment, i.e., the implementation of certain regulations, and we have two items in our net interest income that we had signaled that we wouldn't repeat.
Our third quarter expenses were essentially flat compared to the prior period when two second quarter reversals totaling $120 million are excluded. Overall, expenses continue to be well managed, and we are on track to achieve our annualized acquisition cost savings goal of $1.8 billion by year-end. Rick will discuss our overall income statement in more detail.
Our pretax pre-provision earnings were $1.4 billion in the third quarter, which was nearly 3x the cost of credit. And turning to our credit cost, overall credit quality showed signs of improvement, and credit costs were significantly lower in the third quarter. Our provision was $486 million, sharply lower linked-quarter, and down 47% compared to the same period last year, in part due to the sales of residential mortgage loans and brokered home equity loans which closed in the third quarter. 
We are making good progress in returning to a moderate-risk profile through deliberate actions to manage our risks and returns.
Other factors that contributed to the decline of the provision were credit exposure reductions and basically, overall improving credit migration.
Now with the integration of the National City branches behind us, we are now on a common technology and product platform. This allows us to distribute new products and services into our new markets, providing us with tremendous opportunities to grow our businesses. Sales across our combined franchise were 128% of plan through September 30. And on a linked-quarter basis, total sales were up 15%.
Our third quarter sales results demonstrated this momentum. In our newly acquired markets, sales were 122% of plans for the first nine months, up 35% linked-quarter and 68% year-over-year. And I think, clearly, this reflects our customer focus throughout the conversion process. 
Now we're also seeing excellent progress in our ability to deepen relationships with customers, and I'm especially pleased with the performance in our newly acquired markets as cross-selling activity there through nine months has increased 11% year-over-year.
Now one thing I'm sure of, we are using our balance sheet strength to make credit available to qualified borrowers, as we recognize, this is extremely important to the country's economic growth. We originated and renewed approximately $39 billion in loans and commitments in the third quarter or $112 billion for the first nine months of the year, which includes more than $2.6 billion in small business loans. 
We also saw increased demand for PNC products as a result of implementing our business model in converted markets. On the retail banking side, we saw significant customer growth as checking relationships increased by 53,000 during the third quarter, which is more than 2.5x the growth we saw in the second quarter. 
Our goal is to deepen these relationships, and we saw active online bill payment customers grow by 8% in the quarter, and we continued to see strong customer and employee engagement levels throughout the retail operations. 
We've been expanding our University Banking program and recently signed agreements with Grove City College in Pennsylvania, Bowling Green State University and the University of Cincinnati in Ohio and DePaul University in Illinois. We now have relationships with more than 150 colleges and universities, enabling PNC to reach a large group of customers with a variety of banking products and services to students, faculty and staff.
Our Corporate and Institutional Bank had a very good quarter. While loan demand remains tepid, our new client growth was at 2x the pace of any previous record year. With more of our clients on one platform, we're seeing increases this year in treasury management, capital market revenues. 
Treasury management revenue through the first nine months increased by 9% compared with the same period last year. In healthcare alone, revenues year-to-date are up more than 20% compared to the same period last year. Year-to-date capital markets revenue, this is basically customer business, is up 19% compared to the first nine months of last year. And we booked some of the largest transactions in the history of the company during the first three quarters of this year. 
Our Asset Management business had a strong quarter and outperformed its sales and client acquisition goals, due primarily to significant referrals from other business segments. In fact, referrals in newly acquired markets were up 40% linked-quarter. Assets under administration at the end of the third quarter were more than $200 billion, and operating expenses remained well controlled.
Residential Mortgage also had a good quarter. Mortgage loan originations were $2.7 billion in the third quarter, up 17% from the second quarter, driven by seasonal factors and the marketplace, of course. Year-to-date servicing fees are up 15% compared to the first nine months of last year, and expenses through three quarters are down 29% year-over-year. 
Now I'd like to talk to you briefly about the recent industry-wide focus on foreclosure documentation. As you know, our market share for Residential Servicing is less than 2%. The vast majority of our Servicing business is on behalf of other investors, principally Freddie and Fannie. 
Nonetheless, PNC understands how important it is that the foreclosure process is correct, so both borrowers are protected and necessary foreclosures are able to proceed. We are taking a close look at our foreclosure procedures, and while that review is ongoing, I can report the following: Based on the review to date, we believe that PNC has systems designed to ensure that no foreclosure goes forward, unless the loan is genuinely in default. Indeed, on average, our loans in foreclosure are more than one year delinquent. Like a number of other banks, we've identified issues with respect to some of the documentation. We are holding off pursuing individual pending foreclosures until we're confident that any documentation issues have been fixed. But as of now, we are proceeding with new foreclosures under enhanced procedures designed as part of this review to remove any question about the processing of documentation in foreclosure cases.
Moving on, I'm pleased with the progress we're making with our Distressed Assets. This portfolio of $16 billion is down $4 billion since the same time last year, primarily as a result of pay-downs, net charge-offs and dispositions. And that included the loan sales I mentioned earlier. 
And last but not the least, BlackRock had a very good third quarter; a reported net income of $551 million yesterday, which was up $234 million year-over-year. Compared to a year ago, their operating results reflect the benefits of the Barclays Global Investor acquisition and the improved markets. They continue to make good progress on their merger with BGI, which made them the largest publicly traded investment management firm in the world, with more than $3.4 trillion in assets under management. For the third quarter, our share of BlackRock's earnings was 23%.
Now Rick will provide you with more detail about our third quarter results, beginning with our high-quality balance sheet. Rick?"
294585,114082404,90465,"PNC Financial Services Group Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2010",2010-10-21,"Earnings Calls","The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone.

Today, I'm going to focus on three topics: First, the steps we are taking to return our balance sheet to a moderate-risk profile, and this includes continued improvement in our credit quality metrics; second, our strong earnings, including the impact of credit risk reduction activities on our net interest income and our provision; and finally, the continued growth in our capital ratios and our book value per share.
Now let me begin on Slide 6 with our balance sheet, which remains highly liquid, well capitalized and asset sensitive. Loan balances continued to contract driven by loan payoffs, loan sales, net charge-offs and continued soft credit demand, primarily in the commercial and commercial real estate categories. 
On the deposit side, third quarter transaction deposits increased by $2.5 billion linked-quarter, a strong sign of our ability to grow our customer deposit franchise. 
We also continued to reduce our higher cost CDs and other time accounts, while retaining nearly 80% of the relationship balances. These trends resulted in a loan-to-deposit ratio of 84%, a highly liquid balance sheet.
We also added nearly $10 billion in high-quality, short duration securities to our portfolio, with approximately 90% of the growth coming in purchases of agency residential mortgage-backed securities. A significant portion of the increase reflected the settlement of previous quarter forward purchases, repositioning from swaps into securities and investments to utilize the excess liquidity we continue to create.
We also saw a growth in common equity at $1.7 billion linked-quarter to $29.4 billion, bringing our total increase in common equity for the year to $7.4 billion. Our capital and liquidity positions provide us with the capacity to support clients as the economy gains momentum. At the same time, our positioning and our ability to grow fee income and manage expenses allow for patience in the event economic conditions do not improve in the near term.
Slide 7 shows our credit quality metrics, which continued to improve in the third quarter. Our non-performing loans at the end of the third quarter were down $274 million or 5% on a linked-quarter basis, and they were lower by $835 million or 15% compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. 
Early-stage delinquencies declined by 23%, and late-stage delinquencies were essentially flat in the third quarter compared to linked-quarter results. This clearly reflects improving credit trends. 
Net charge-offs declined, due to the $75 million of charge-offs in the second quarter related to our bulk sale in the consumer space and improvement in residential real estate, commercial real estate and equipment lease categories.
In addition, we continued to see an overall improvement in credit migration for performing loans and a reduction in overall credit exposure. 
Now assuming at least a modest GDP growth, we believe delinquencies and non-performing metrics will continue to come down in the fourth quarter. 
Before I review our overall third quarter earnings in greater detail, let me focus on our trends in net interest income and provision, two areas, I know, are of great interest to all of you.
Now Slide 8 shows a roll-forward of our net interest income and provision from the second to the third quarter, along with the trend of our net interest margin, our cost of credit and our credit risk adjusted net interest margin. The chart in the upper left-hand corner shows the effects on net interest income of certain purchase accounting adjustments recorded in the second quarter of $93 million, which we do not expect to repeat, and the net interest impact of consumer and commercial distressed loan sales that closed in the third quarter of $56 million. 
The chart also shows the residual impact of $71 million on net interest income, due to lower purchase accounting accretion, as expected, and the challenge of lower loan balances in a low interest rate environment. This latter decline of $71 million represents 3% of our third quarter net interest income and is a better indication of the net interest income decline you can expect from PNC from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2010.
The chart in the lower left shows the roll-forward of our provision for the second to the third quarter. Similar to net interest income, the provision was lower partly due to the second quarter addition of $109 million for the loan sales we discussed in the second quarter and of an additional $100 million for seriously delinquent loans in our Distressed Asset portfolio, which was also booked in the second quarter. We also saw the provision decrease by $128 million linked-quarter, due to the credit migration improvement I described in the prior slide and due to an overall reduction in credit exposure.
Now the chart in the upper right shows our net interest margin trend, which as expected, declined this quarter. However, we are paying particular attention to the credit risk adjusted net interest margin, which considers the impact of annualized provision as a percentage of our average interest earning assets on net interest income. We used this ratio to help demonstrate our commitment to our moderate-risk philosophy and to show the impact of declining net interest income compared to improvements in credit costs as we focus on lowering our balance sheet risk. 
As you can see, the credit risk adjusted margin has remained stable over the past couple of quarters. Our focus remains on securing assets that have appropriate risk-adjusted returns. Similar to our strategy prior to the credit crisis, we did not plan to take undue credit or interest rate risk as a means to enhance our net interest margin. We will continue to remain disciplined to help ensure we get paid for the risk we take.
Now looking ahead, we expect net interest income and margin to trend down in the fourth quarter, but at a slower pace than we saw from the second to the third quarter. And assuming there is no downturn in the economy, we expect a relatively stable to improving provision and a relatively stable credit risk adjusted net interest margin in the fourth quarter compared to recent quarters of 2.9% to 3.1%.
Now let's review our overall income statement on Slide 9. We delivered $3.6 billion in revenue in the third quarter and $1.4 billion in pretax pre-provision earnings compared to our provision of $486 million. This allowed us to deliver pretax pre-provision earnings that were nearly 3x greater than our credit costs. And while pretax earnings declined as expected by 12% compared to the second quarter, we delivered a 32% increase in pretax earnings from a year ago.
Since we already discussed net interest income and provision, now let's focus on non-interest income, expenses and taxes. As Jim mentioned earlier, we saw a substantial improvement in sales momentum in the third quarter, and our core fees increased linked-quarter in most categories, with Asset Management, Consumer Services and Residential Mortgage fees up 2%, 4% and 21%, respectively.
The Residential Mortgage improvement was driven by strong origination volumes and net hedging gains on mortgage servicing rights, partially offset by additional repurchase reserves of $44 million. On the other hand, we saw a decrease in corporate service fees, which were down $78 million linked-quarter, primarily due to a $100 million evaluation adjustments in our commercial mortgage servicing rights driven primarily by lower interest rates. Otherwise, corporate service fees increased by 8%.
As expected, service charges on deposits were down $45 million linked-quarter, primarily due to the impact of Regulation E. Net security gains decreased by $26 million, similar to the amount of improvement in our OTTI charges. Our OTTI charges were down to $71 million in the third quarter. And other non-interest income was down $24 million linked-quarter, primarily due to $52 million of repurchase reserves on assets related to our Distressed Asset Portfolio. 
We continued to be disciplined in expense management. Excluding the $120 million of accrued liabilities reversed in the second quarter, expenses were essentially flat to linked-quarter.
Regarding acquisition-related cost savings, we captured another $25 million in the quarter, bringing our current 21-month total to $1.7 billion of annualized cost saves. We are well on our way toward reaching our year-end goal of $1.8 billion. 
The effective tax rate was lower for the third quarter at 18.8%. The lower rate resulted primarily from the favorable tax settlement of approximately $89 million that we previously discussed. 
As a result, including the $328 million after-tax gain on the sale of Global Investment Servicing, which closed at the beginning of the quarter, we reported net income of $1.1 billion for the third quarter and $2.6 billion year-to-date, which has been a strong contributor to our capital growth.
As shown on Slide 10, our Tier 1 common ratio at the end of the third quarter is estimated to be 9.6%. The 130 basis point gain linked-quarter was due to the sale of Global Investment Servicing, along with third quarter earnings and our lower risk-weighted assets. 
Since year-end, our Tier 1 common ratio has increased by 360 basis points, and our book value per share has increased 17% since December 31, 2009, and it's up 42% since we closed on the acquisition of National City on December 31, 2008.
While we are still waiting for greater clarity regarding Basel III, I believe our capital position, along with our future earnings, will provide us with the flexibility for growth while investing in our markets, our people and innovative products and services. At PNC, we have a disciplined approach to capital management, which we believe serves as well. 
Now turning to the fourth quarter, let me provide some guidance. Regarding revenue, as I discussed, we expect to see continued but reduced pressure on net interest income. However, as mentioned earlier, I am optimistic about prospects for a stable to lower provision. 
As a result, we expect our credit risk adjusted net interest margin to be reasonably stable with recent quarters. We look for solid performance in fee income assuming fewer impairments, and I believe our expenses will be down, primarily due to lower integration costs.
And with that, I'll hand it back to Jim."

In summary, PNC's business model continued to deliver strong results in the third quarter during a time of significant uncertainty for our industry. The management team has been through cycles like this before, and we are focused on delivering for our customers and our shareholders. 
Our balance sheet is strong; our credit metrics continue to improve. We're going customers through our expanded franchise, and our expenses are well-managed. And we're focused on returning to a moderate-risk profile. And importantly, our capital is at record levels. 
We are a company that's looking to the future by investing in markets, products and technology. And we believe we're on target for a good fourth quarter and a strong full year 2010 and well-positioned for the future.

One is that we're not certain that BlackRock even falls under the definition of financial institution. As you know, the rule about investing in minority interest in other financial institutions was really proposed to affect banks investing in other banks and then re-levering the same capital. And so, BlackRock's not a leveraged institution, as you know. So it kind of doesn't fall in the category of the purpose of the rule. So we have to wait and see whether it's -- and they've not been included under Basel I or Basel II. So we have to wait and know whether it actually fits at all. And secondly, as Rick said earlier, we have an almost $2 billion reserve for taxes set up. So it clearly seems to me that it's got to be an after -tax view, because the theory is, if the stock runs down, well, if the stock runs down, we're not going to have to pay all those taxes. So that's got to be an after-tax item. And then, there's another issue that says in the rule, that it's common stock. And only 50% of our holdings at BlackRock are in common, the other in preferred. So I mean, we've got a number of things that have to be interpreted around the BlackRock, a number of which could go our way.

In total, we've got about $290 million of reserves, and it's concentrated primarily in the mortgage company at about $150 million to $160 million. We feel pretty good about that reserve given the fact that: one, the amount of claims that are being made is coming down and has been coming down, this is all related to 2008 and prior; and as well as the fact that I think we're just getting better as an organization in terms of defending the claims and what the actual risk is. So that appears to be -- we, this quarter, actually, handled some additional claims on mortgage insurance as well as the GSE's taking a harder look at OREO, and we feel we've got that reasonably well reserved. So we're pretty comfortable there. We also have the distressed asset book where we've got $100 million of reserves, and that's a combination of things. But probably, the most significant, being brokered home equity sales at National City. We're getting a little bit of pushback on that. And we just felt that appropriate to set up some reserves on that. There may be some further smaller reserves we have to add to that over time as that becomes clear, but whatever it is, it'll be a manageable number."

So right off the top, that's one of the items. We also made an adjustment in our purchase accounting for debt for about $29 million. So you can see the delta on that, second to third quarter. So that's roughly over $100 million of adjustments which were made in the second we didn't expect to repeat. And then, the other decrease was that we did have some loan sales, but it was primarily in the commercial space where we sold a number of loans and we're able to drive net interest income. It came down. We had a lot of those sales in the third quarter, and what it did was it caused that scheduled NII [net interest income] to come down. But we picked that up in the recovery area."
