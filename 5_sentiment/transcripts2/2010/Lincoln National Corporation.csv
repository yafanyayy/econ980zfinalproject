For Lincoln, in terms of strategic focus and execution, it was certainly one of the most active years in our history.",1206,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning to all of you on the call. 2009 was an eventful and challenging year for our country and for our industry. For Lincoln, in terms of strategic focus and execution, it was certainly one of the most active years in our history. In the face of challenging markets, we completed a series of actions designed to place the company firmly on the path to performance and growth while preserving our financial flexibility and our franchise value. I never doubted the strength and resilience of our business model. But today, looking back on 2009 with a little perspective, it is worth noting just how well our operating businesses performed. Given the severity of the downturn, we had expected somewhat reduced production, but we found that the quality of our business model protected our market share in key lines and generated increasing levels of activity throughout the year.For the full year 2009, we reported total positive net flows of $7 billion and total gross deposits of nearly $20 billion, only modestly off 2008 levels. Our retirement asset balances reached $110 billion, up 27% from last year due to net flows and market lift, close to the record levels of 2007. Through the third quarter, we steadily increased market share for variable and fixed annuities and maintained our share of life industry sales.In spite of the noise and headwinds and due to the fact that we remained active in our markets with all of our products and services and proactively engaged in dialogue with our partners, we in fact grew our franchise in 2009.  At Lincoln Financial Distributors, we added or expanded relationships with 26 firms. We increased the number of active advisors recommending Lincoln solutions by 11% to more than 55,000. And we significantly increased the number of new producers recommending Lincoln solutions for the first time. At Lincoln Financial Network, we increased net new advisors by more than 300 to approximately 7,700 at year end, and an industry magazine recently ranked LFN [Lincoln Financial Network] as one of the largest independent broker/dealers in the country.Turning to our employee base, we added to the experience of our workforce by attracting talented individuals from inside and outside of the industry. We also benefited in 2009 from our commitment to a broad product portfolio designed to support different financial planning needs. And our distribution organizations proved to be nimble, keeping pace as consumers adjusted their preferences over the course of the year.  For example, in our Annuity business, we were able to take advantage of the shift from variable annuities to fixed solutions during the year and then tipped it back to variable solutions with our clients as the markets improved. Similarly, our Individual Life business benefited from the breadth of our solution set and, again, nimble distribution. Throughout 2009, we saw steady quarter-over-quarter increases in policies sold for both UL and term. And total policies sold in 2009 were 28% and 98% higher, respectively, over 2008.  In our Defined Contribution business, we saw an increase of more than 20% in both total net flows and ending balances.Group Protection had another very strong year across all measures and a strong fourth quarter. Total sales were up 14% over 2008 and fourth quarter sales were up 29% over the year-ago period. We are successfully taking advantage of the growing importance of voluntary sales in these relationships. 38% of sales came from voluntary business, an increase of seven percentage points over the year-ago period.The financial services landscape will continue to shift as our competitors change and our distribution partners settle into new structures and regulations. Our approach to distribution and reputation for distribution excellence at Lincoln Financial Distributors, Lincoln Financial Network and our worksite sales and service organizations will continue to be catalysts for market share gains, as consultants, advisors, employers and consumers seek out providers they trust. Given this backdrop, we continue to evolve our distribution strategies to maintain our competitive advantage. At LFD, one of the largest wholesale distribution organizations in the industry, our focus today is on driving productivity, which has already resulted in a 22% increase during the year.  Lincoln Financial Network is leveraging its model to attract seasoned advisors who want to affiliate with the company with national presence, a recognized brand and a commitment to support their independence while helping them grow deeper relationships with their clients. We also continue to build our worksite-based sales platform, primarily found in our Group Protection and Defined Contribution businesses, with the goal of expanding opportunities to help employers and employees understand how to make the most of company-sponsored retirement benefits and additional voluntary benefits.Now let me turn to financial strength. As you know, we achieved positive net income from operations in every line of business and every quarter of 2009. We ended the year with an estimated risk-based capital ratio of approximately 450%. And we have roughly $1 billion in cash at the holding company, net of cash set aside to repay a $250 million maturity in March.Product updates completed last year are adding to our long-term financial strength and profitability. We improved the risk/return profile for our income guarantee variable annuity products and also redesigned our secondary guarantee life product, which allows us to meet our ROE expectations on new business without a capital solution. Our need for additional capital over the past 18 months has been mostly related to asset impairment and downgrades and some maturing debt. We expect some level of investment losses in 2010. But absent any new market disruption, we expect those losses will be significantly lower than in 2009, benefiting from a well-diversified portfolio spread across a broad spectrum of issuers and asset types. In summary, we are on a strong financial footing.I expect a slow economic recovery in 2010. And as we've seen lately, it is likely that the capital markets will remain volatile for some time. Given these expectations, we will continue to manage expenses carefully and maintain a conservative approach to overall capitalization. We are balancing prudence, however, with targeted strategic investments to grow top line sales and further spur productivity, particularly in Defined Contribution and Group Protection, with technology upgrades and in new products for the voluntary market and an expanded distribution focus for Group Protection.  We're also increasing the visibility of our brand in the market, for example, by returning to network TV with the CBS SportsDesk. With respect to CPP [Capital Purchase Program], as I discussed at our annual investor conference in November, we expect to repay the funds in the second half of 2010 or first half of 2011 as market conditions dictate, again, without diluting earnings per share. And importantly, we have not to date seen any evidence that our participation in the program has adversely impacted our businesses in any meaningful way.As we move into 2010, everyone at Lincoln is focused on capitalizing on the tailwinds provided by today's landscape, including consumer demographics, the need for Americans to rebuild their portfolios and the expected higher tax environment and on executing our plans to grow our revenues and earnings.  Now let me turn the call over to Fred to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results in more detail."

We reported income from operations of $297 million or $0.90 per share for the fourth quarter. Our release points out notable earnings items impacting the business segments, but a few of the more meaningful items worth noting include the following: CPP preferred stock dividends and related accretion of the discount totaled $18 million in the quarter. This cost to our shareholders does not run through income from operations but does impact the calculation of earnings per share. We completed our review of the Individual Disability Income business taking back from Swiss Re earlier this year. The review resulted in a charge to operating earnings of about $33 million in the quarter. The loss was somewhat offset by the combination of favorable unlocking in our Annuity segment of $12 million and a favorable state income tax liability release of $13 million taken through other operations.We experienced a strong recovery in our alternative investment portfolio, contributing about $22 million to earnings. While returns can be volatile at times, we would expect normalized returns in the 5% to 10% range pretax on this $700 million portfolio as we move through 2010.We recorded net income of $102 million or $0.27 per share, impacted by net realized investment losses and an impairment taken on our media holdings. Continued weakness in our radio broadcasting properties resulted in impairment to goodwill and intangibles totaling $109 million in the quarter. Net losses on invested assets were $91 million after tax. Gross realized losses and impairments on general account invested assets were $212 million pretax. Concentrations include RMBS [residential mortgage-backed securities] totaling $52 million, impairment taken on the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds hybrid securities totaling $60 million and commercial real estate equity of 49 million. While elevated from recent quarters, we view the banking impairment as isolated and took a prudent approach to marking down the value of our real estate equity exposures. As we focus on our overall Mortgage Lending business, core metrics remain strong, with only eight delinquencies on a very granular portfolio of 1,300 loans. This equating to a delinquency rate of roughly a half a percent. As a matter of practice, we have not been active in restructuring loans, which artificially lowers delinquency rates.Finally, our variable annuity hedge program performance had very little net impact on the quarter's results. Our strategic position on interest-rate coverage as we prepared for the adoption of VACARVM contributed to positive results in the period. This offset by refinements to our existing hybrid approach to estimating the liabilities on our income and lifetime benefits to a mix of FAS 133 and traditional SOP insurance reserving, which increased GAAP reserves.  Our VA hedge program finished the quarter with assets comfortably in excess of the actuarial liability. Annuity results benefited from unlocking, which contributed about $12 million to the quarter's results. Our DAC model uses a corridor process in estimating account values. Having reset our assumptions when the S&P was at roughly 900, the market recovery in the quarter produced a significant cushion against the negative DAC unlocking under stressed markets.  Results in this segment also benefited from positive tax items, contributing $7 million to earnings and favorable alternative investment results. Annuity earnings continue to benefit from increased average account values and improved trends in DAC amortization. Average account values in our Variable Annuity business increased approximately $5 billion in the quarter, driving expense assessment revenue up 10% sequentially. We ended the fourth quarter with total average annuity account values of $73 billion, an increase of roughly $16 billion over a year ago, and amazingly, only $3 billion short of our all-time highs reported in 2007.Turning to our Defined Contribution business, ending average account values were up about $1.8 billion sequentially, driving a 5% increase in overall expense assessment revenue. We ended the fourth quarter with total DC account values of $35  billion, up $1 billion over the third quarter's ending values . Net asset flows were negative in the quarter, but can be seasonal and lumpy when focused on a quarter. For the year, we recorded positive flows of $1 billion, up roughly 27% over the previous year.  We experienced margin compression on the fixed portion of our DC business, weighed down in part by a few unusual items impacting yields. While under pressure, we would expect some recovery heading into 2010. The changing mix of business also impacts earnings, with lower ROA and higher long-term ROE business becoming more prevalent in our sales mix. These items, together with current and planned infrastructure and product investments, will hold back on earnings growth rates throughout 2010. In our Life business, fundamentals remain stable. Average account values and in-force were up 2% and 1% respectively from the third quarter, returning to more normalized growth rates, annualized in the mid-single digit area. Our Life segment absorbs most of the results of our alternative investment portfolio, contributing about $7 million to the  period's results. A few comments on this segment with respect to 2010, it's important to factor into your forecast the impact of our $550 million term life financing and the cost of the long-term letter of credit. The cost of the LOC, together with investment shifting from reserves to surplus, will result in lowering our quarterly Life segment earnings by about $7 million, $4 million of which will simply shift to other operations where we house our unallocated capital. The transactions serve to contribute roughly $400 million to our statutory capital position.We're also working through converting our Life and Annuity valuation systems to a single platform. As part of this process, we review methodologies across various blocks of business. This is more important in our Life segment, given we run on two different systems dating back to the merger. Not unlike our annual prospective unlocking exercise, this may result in one-time gains or losses, adjustments we would expect to have little impact on net earnings trends in this segment. We should complete this work in the first half of the year.Turning to our Group business, another strong earnings performance, with favorable loss ratios coming in at roughly 69%. We experienced strong loss ratios in both our life and long-term visibility lines, with favorable mortality and solid overall fundamentals. Net earned premium increased 5% sequentially and up about 4% over last year's quarter. As we move into 2010, we would expect loss ratios at the low end of our range closer to 70% and a modest recovery in premium growth rates to the high-single digit area, recognizing we ended the year with strong production results.Turning to capital, there were a number of moving parts as we closed out the year, including our year-end reserve financing, the NAIC's new approach to rating RMBS, impairments and statutory earnings. As Dennis highlighted, we estimated our year-end RBC ratio will approach 450%. We successfully installed AG43 or the new variable annuity reserving guidelines. The adoption resulted in very little impact to our Life subsidiary capital ratios. However, we did make a capital contribution into our reinsurance captive of $250 million at year end. The contribution consisted of approximately $100 million in support of reserve credit taken by Lincoln Life and an additional $150 million in support of a captive's future capital needs.Overall, we believe the capital position of our insurance subsidiaries is very strong. Our insurance subsidiaries are positioned to absorb stressed economic conditions, fund core insurance new business growth. We are afforded both flexibility and patience, as we work on efficient life capital solutions, which include refinancing letters of credit over the next few years.Turning then to the holding company capital and liquidity position, we currently have approximately $1.3 billion in short-term investments after giving effect for the closing of Delaware Investments, a $300 million debt offering during the quarter and the $250 million capital contribution to our reinsurance captive. We ended the year with roughly $100 million of commercial paper outstanding. Looking forward, we have a debt maturity in March of $250 million, prefunded by the debt offering in the fourth quarter and set to be paid off with cash on hand. All told, we would expect to settle into roughly $1 billion in holding company capital liquidity as we proceed to the first quarter.Before closing, a few additional comments on expense trends as we enter 2010. When looking at our enterprise-wide expenses, we accomplished our savings goals for the year with only modest spring back to support better-than-expected strength in our core business model. We were as much playing good defense as offense, meaning we have seen some expenses naturally elevate during a year of financial market stress. The sale of the U.K. and Delaware results in a level of unabsorbed overhead. While we have worked to reduce the strain, we expect an EPS impact of roughly $0.05 for the year. Dennis highlighted various investments back into our business model. We expect these investments to impact earnings per share by roughly $0.10 for the year. We fully expect returns on these investments in the form of increased production, improved market share and efficiencies in time.So in closing, we end the year on a solid financial footing, having taken significant actions in the face of economic and market challenges and are now turning our attention to earnings growth and building risk-adjusted returns. We have seen most of our core earnings drivers return back to normal patterns, not fully recovered, but healthy when considering the significance of last year's events. We have important capital strategies yet to execute on, namely our approach to exiting CPP and structuring cost-effective life insurance capital solutions.  Now let me turn it back to Dennis for closing comments."

In terms of the 450% RBC, to give some boundaries around that, that's, rough justice, around $6.7 billion to $6.8 billion of capital above $1.5 billion of RBC. And that's how you get to that number, just to provide that information. In terms of the upstreaming of capital, we are just now settling into this RBC having a number of moving parts at year end and assessing overall capital conditions as we speak. A couple of things I would point out, and that is while we do have a significant capital margin, roughly $1.5 billion above a 350% RBC, for example, we do think it's important to maintain a level of margin related to turbulence or economic conditions in the marketplace if they were to become choppy again. It's also important to maintain a level of excess capital to support the business growth that we've been experiencing across the company and that we expect to continue. And then obviously, we want to be cautious about our ability to execute on and our ability to be patient in putting in place longer-term solutions for capital solutions on our Life business. All of those reasons suggest to me and suggest to us as a company that we need to retain a level of excess capital down the life company as a precautionary measure. Now as these things start to unfold and become more sure-footed, this can truly turn into a level of excess capital that could be better utilized for greater returns and investment back into our business. But at the moment, we're going to be cautious as we move through the early part of this year. On the media, a couple of dynamics of the media, as you recall, we had contributed the media asset down into the life company back a few quarters ago. The impairment itself resulted in about a six-or-so-point impact to RBC and is fully reflected in the 450% estimate. In looking at that business, we have a carrying value of roughly $180 million. And I believe that's split in general between goodwill and intangibles, rough justice. But both intangibles and goodwill will tend to be reviewed for markdown when you're looking at the value of those properties. And so the write down we took this quarter, for example, was a mix of write down on both goodwill as well as the intangible aspect of the business. That marketplace has gone through substantial turmoil. Literally, a handful of the largest players in the industry have. In one case, a player has actually announced bankruptcy. A couple other players are in the midst of having to renegotiate bank covenants having been over-levered and seeing a tremendous fall off in cash flow. So you really have an upside-down industry right now among most of the players. And that's weighing down on valuations. And for us, it suggests being patient in continuing to monitor and manage the properties. These are good properties that performed well in their given markets. We like how they're positioned. But we think it's an awfully-difficult time to be considering monetizing those investments. And instead, we intend to continue to support them for the time being."

Last year, just because of all the stress that was going on in the economy, and of course at Lincoln, we stopped that investment.

And then it would take a pretty severe drop in the markets for us to unlock negatively upwards of 30%, 35% drop in the market from year-end levels, to be contemplating a negative unlocking. So that's what I mean when I suggest that we've created some cushion. For example, if today, we were to unlock, unravel the corridor and unlock to the mean, we'd be looking at a positive DAC unlocking of roughly $200 million to $250 million pretax. That gives you a little bit of an idea of the kind of cushion we've built out. You do see some retrospective DAC unlocking coming through and helping earnings out. And that's nothing more than the underlying account values performing better than the DAC model assumption upon reset. And so the combination of arising market driving account values, positive underlying fund performance and slightly better than expected lapse rates are all driving account values up relative to our model, and resulting in some level of retrospective unlocking.

First, the fourth quarter is always larger, by far, than the other quarters during the year. So that explains, in part, the fourth quarter uptick. Second point, and substantive to the increasing results at the company sales results, is that we're in the second full year of change to the distribution model. So the model is beginning to settle in, and the sales rep development and tenure is paying off. Average rep productivity increased 10% versus 2008 to up to the highest productivity ever, about $3 million per rep. We've done our annual pricing review in mid-2009, just like every other year some prices increased, some prices decreases, but we're certain that pricing is not driving the results. Furthermore, continued refinement in the service model, underwriting and implementation is paying dividends with improved broker and customer experience. I guess, in short, the model is working. We continue to focus on the 50 to 500 market. We've got increased penetration in the voluntary market. And we have some, what I refer to, as opportunistic sales in the 1,000 employee market, where it fits our model, both from a service, the simplicity of product and distribution."

The transaction we did at year-end, the 550 million LOC for $400 million of relief was related to term life block. And the degree to which we continue to sell term life, which has been growing and building any reserves on that front, we feel comfortable that we can find attractively or, at least, reasonably attractively priced long-term solutions. On the universal life side, it is arguably more difficult to structure transactions because of the dynamics of that product. Our approach to it is really the following: And that is we would expect to use a combination of long-term solutions, structured solutions, which they are out there but they're more complex to execute on. And that's why we want to be patient when pulling the trigger on them; a combination of that, letters of credit, shorter term in nature or intermediate term letters of credit, but downsized from our current usage; and then just capital, on a temporary basis. So the degree to which we have to absorb and take the after-tax impact to capital, related to the run off of any letters of credit, will do that within our RBC, just to be patient. It's a timing issue. We do believe these are markets that will offer up opportunities for term solutions. We also think the bank market is notorious for running hot and cold on letters of credit over the years. And so what we're most pleased with in terms of our capital position is that we can be patient and work to execute a long-term solution that makes sense for the returns on the business, and that's what we'll attempt to do. On the regulatory front, there continues to be dialogue, as you know, on this topic. But the progress is slow. And we continue to try to push it forward. We think that's very necessary for the industry, and good for the industry. But the progress is slow. And I don't think we can build our plans around that kind of a solution, albeit we continue to work hard on it."

That what we have is what we've got in terms of the need to release some of these reserves as LOCs mature. And as Fred has been pointing out, this really is a longer-term issue and it's mitigated quite substantially, even under the most difficult environment, by the fact that we have a 450% RBC as we sit here today. So it's not a growing problem. It's one that we could handle with smaller market availability, if that were to happen. And then I want to make the important point as well that we're the number one player in the universal life business. We have been for many years. And that gives us a advantage over others, because we just have such a large number of policies, such varied number of the different type of underwriting sales. And so if anyone's going to be able to do this, Lincoln is going to be able to do this. And again, I think, over time, as Fred said, the banks will be back in this market. But I'll just summarize by saying the size of our block, the skill of our finance team, the different avenues that we have at this point to handle the situation, it is something that we're resolving.

So that was just to marry up assets with the reserve credit. The additional 150 million was there to bolster capitalization of the captive recognizing the business that runs through it and the need to hold higher capital levels to absorb market volatility, et cetera. I don't have at my fingertips the balance sheet, if you will, of the Barbados subsidiary, other than to say, we think the injection of capital went a long way to building out its balance sheet to absorb some of these movements going forward. What we're going to have to do, Mark, is we watch our overall insurance capitalization is a balance the level of capital margin we have in our core life insurance subsidiaries with what the captives need to support these reinsurance credits that we take. We also need to be mindful of the fact that these captives need to, to some degree, stand on their own relative to their capitalization. And so part of what we did when we injected the capital into Barbados was not simply a VACARVM issue but also to start moving in the direction of capitalizing these captives at higher ratings levels or the equivalent of high ratings levels."

I think what you're referring to is what we took through the hedge program in a negative related to a refinement of our estimate of 133 versus SOP reserve. What we're doing there and this is somewhat commonly done in the industry is when you're offering a variable annuity that has a mortality element to it such as an income benefit or a lifetime withdrawal benefit, you have to and are really required to take a level of insurance reserving and not just a pure FAS 133 derivative. And when you take that insurance component of the reserving, that's done under an SOP approach. In our particular case, it ended up actually increasing the reserves back in these guarantees. The reason being that on a pure derivatives, basis interest rate movements and equity market recovery had driven down the derivative nature of the liability pretty significantly while the SOP reinsurance liability is more specifically sensitive to equity markets and not interest rates. So as interest rates rise, you don't have quite the dynamic of driving down your reserve need as you would in a derivative structure. So that result and so to blend it our so-called hybrid approach 133 SOP and serve to increase the reserve in the period, offsetting what otherwise would've been a gain in the actual hedge program itself. On the RBC, you're absolutely correct. There is a growing level of discussion and work being done at the rating agencies on how best to treat shorter-term securitization or life solutions in the overall capital structure of insurance companies. And most notably, the agencies have been looking out for a while now the notion of shorter-term letters of credit or long-term solutions that are reaching closer to maturity and factoring in or feathering in some element of that to your overall leverage. So when we look at the total company capitalization, the combination of RBC and holding company leverage, we have to factor in the notion of to the degree we can't find long-term solutions, we have to be de-levering the company to absorb this. Now obviously, we continue to look for long-term solutions and most of the rating agencies have pointed to the longer-term solutions, out beyond five years, for example, as retaining their capital credit and not being necessarily infused into your leverage. So yes, it does play into our overall view."

If you exclude goodwill, we reported on ROE in the Life business of around 9.6%, shy of 10%, on an unlevered basis. If you normalize for normal limited partnership income that runs through there, you would kick that up closer to 11%. The reserve financing equation, that is the ability to finance reserves, has in and around a couple hundred basis point or so benefit to returns, upwards of 200 to 300 basis point benefits to returns. And so the degree to which you're unable to do any versus able to do all of it, has a relatively big swing factor in the returns. The actual cost of the securitization is less an impact on the returns. For example, the recent transaction we did on the term life business, over the course of the entire block of the business, would have as much as maybe a 50 basis point or so negative impact on returns. So finding these long-term solutions is important to supporting the returns of the in-force block. As Dennis mentioned, we've restructured the product and done some level of repricing to alleviate that need on a go-forward. But we have to continue to address the returns on the in-force. And so as a result, we'll keep looking for these long-term solutions but what we want to be is patient. We don't want to have a gun to our head to have to put them in place if pricing is not cooperating or if market dynamics don't dictate. And so we're hopeful that being patient, we can securitize a lot of this product and do it at rates that defend the returns in the business."

So despite its preferred stock nature, it serves to pump up your leverage. So repayment of CPP, whether with cash on hand or other forms of financing, will naturally be a de-levering event. And you want that de-levering event to take place as you then go out to tap the credit markets for long-term solutions on life insurance. So there are some sequencing issues that really work in your favor as a company.

They're not always available, just as you've noted. So that's a number one is were not relying upon having to have a solution to manage that competitive and strong risk-based capital for our ratings. Having said that, these markets -- the engineers that surround these markets are quite creative and quite active. And as you can imagine, we are in a level of dialogue and have been for quite some time looking at a number of structures, many of which have pros and cons but you have to weigh before you look to execute. One of the things that we want to be very careful about and set ourselves up for is not having to have a rush into a marketplace that's disruptive and costly. And that's what we mean by being patient. Letter of credit markets are notorious for falling out of bed and then coming back. Reserve securitization structures can fall out of favor and back in favor. And so you're right to say it's more complicated. You're right to say that the financial crisis has hurt the securitization market. But we do think the dynamics around this are such that we can find some longer-term solutions in time.

The early part of the year mostly showed signs of an improving economy, more robust capital markets and growing sense of stability. Our view is that advisors and consumers attitudes are improving but both remain cautious as evidenced by significant amount of cash still on the sideline. Lincolnâ€™s first quarter operating results were very good in view of these conditions.
Consistent with recent quarters our fundamentals were strong. We had good production in all businesses and high and sustainable levels of sales in several products. We reported net flows in our life, annuities and defined contribution businesses and our already strong capital position was strengthened further with improved general account conditions, recovering net income and strong overall statutory earnings, leading to higher levels of risk-based capital.
More specifically, we generated total gross deposit of 4.7 billion and positive net flows of 1.3 billion benefiting from our top ten or better market position in all of our core product lines and our strategy of maintaining consistent presence in the market with a full suite of competitive products and continued strong distribution support.
Net flows in our life, annuities and DC businesses, capped nine straight quarters of positive net flows in these businesses with a single quarter exception in Defined Contribution.
Looking at annuities we expect solid demand for annuities to continue given good consumer interests in guaranteed sources income. Providers who are committed to the opportunity stay in the market over cycles are disciplined with product features and risk management and have multiple distribution channels like Lincoln will be the winners.
Lincoln capitalized on this approaching the quarter generated 18% sales growth in our variable products, with average account values of 40% over the prior year period. Fixed annuities are essentially at the interest rates and in the wake of lower rates our fixed annuity deposits were down over the first quarter of last year.
Looking forward our distribution strategy of having wholesalers carry both fixed and variable annuity products allows us to pivot between our annuity solutions with market conditions and consumer demand.
In Defined Contribution we continue to hold a strong market position in the 403(b) business, and particularly, in healthcare and K through 12 education plans. First year sales in the mid-large 403(b) market are inherently lumpy driven by the timing of on boarding new plans. So while first quarter deposits were weak when compared to the year ago quarter which benefited from a few large cases, the second quarter is developing nicely in terms of new cases and deposits.
We are also seeing some improvement in terms of ongoing contributions for larger plans as the recovering economy begins to spur employers to increase salaries and reinstate matches. Our strategy to build on strategic partner relationships to introduce DC solutions to intermediaries was small business clients is gaining traction with an increase of 68% in first year sales over last year.
Our core individual life insurance business continues to perform well, with earnings drivers in the 5% growth range. We reported a 68% sales increase for MoneyGuard where we are the clear product category leader and saw continued high demand for term life which generated an 81% sale increase.
We expect strong growth rates to continue in these products. Our core Universal Life business continued to reflect higher numbers of policy sold of 37% over last year at this time, but extending the trend of lower average pace amounts. As consumer wealth rebuilds I expect case size to increase.
In Group Protection, momentum from high fourth quarter sales continued into the first quarter with annualized sales of 16% over the year ago period. Year-over-year net earned premium growth was 6%, which I expect to climb to the high single digits over the course of the year as sales increase.
We are growing our reputation as a voluntary benefits provider and continued to invest in distribution, worksite enrolment, administrative capabilities and product development to enable us to capitalize on growth prospects offered in this market. We saw strong market share gains in this business over the course of 2009. And based on (inaudible) data is now the sixth largest provider of voluntary group benefits in the country. 41% of the sales this quarter came from our voluntary business up 38% over last year.
We are continuing our product development efforts across business lines to enhanced sales, increase profitability and lower risk. Our core variable annuity and secondary guarantee universal life products were good illustrations of these efforts last year.
This year, we intend to further refine our product portfolios to ensure we keep pace with evolving consumer needs and to help spur sales growth. Weâ€™re introducing long-term care annuity hybrid, group accident insurance and a new life product designed to meet term like needs through a universal life design.
Distribution remains a competitive advantage for Lincoln and our ability to tailor our distribution models to the evolving needs of our partners and clients will be a catalyst for market share gains.
Across Lincoln Financial distributors Lincoln Financial Network and our work site sales and service organizations, LFD remains one of the largest wholesale distribution organizations in the industry and our ability to leverage our competitive advantage in wholesale distribution helped us to add or expand relationships with seven firms this quarter.
One measure of wholesaling effectiveness is a number of advisors who sell at least one Lincoln product in the period. In the first quarter, that number is up 20% over a year ago. We view this as an indicator of our ability to influence advisors across products and channels.
Also, a 23% increase in wholesaler productivity is another sign of how well weâ€™re capitalizing on the strength and reach of LFD. Lincoln Financial Network continues to leverage its model to attract season advisors who value affiliation choice. Adding more than 150 new net advisors in the first quarter to approximately 7,850 total with favorable retention rates of top advisors across the network.
LFN reliably outpaces the industry in overall life insurance sales making it both a valuable distribution channel for proprietary life products as well as an important source of information about trends in the life marketplace.
We continue to build worksite sales and service platforms, primarily found in our Group Protection and Defined Contribution businesses, which will expand our opportunities in these critical growth businesses.
From an earnings perspective, Iâ€™m pleased with the performance and positive momentum in core drivers such as account values, in-force space amounts and net earned premium levels. And we continue to hold the line on expenses despite expanding numbers of distribution partners, clients and accounts. Weâ€™re mindful however that ROE is needed to improve and weâ€™re focusing on efforts across all ROE drivers to support this goal.
Turning to financial strength, capital level are stronger at the end of the first quarter with an estimated risk based capital ratio above 475% and more than 1 billion in cash at the Holding company.
We continue to see a more positive trend in investment losses and gains as the markets recover. In fact, moving to a net unrealized gain position of1.2 billion at the end of the quarter. And we believe our investment portfolio is well balanced across issuers and asset types and well positioned for a slow economic recovery.
With regard to our participation in the capital purchase program, we are increasingly comfortable with the recent improvements in the outlook for this economy, strength of the capital markets are strong, operating performance and capital adequacy. Assuming no disruption to this generally favorable pattern we are likely to accelerate our repayment timeframe.
As I look at the quarter and outlook for Lincoln Iâ€™m pleased with the underlying strength, positive momentum and capital generating capacities of our core businesses. The investments weâ€™re making in talent, technology, brand and risk management are important components of our goal to be a top quartile performer. And I believe the life insurance industry is stronger and Lincoln in particular is well positioned to deliver long-term value to clients and shareholders.
Now let me turn the call over to Fred for additional detail on the quarter.

We reported income from operations of $276 million or $0.83 per share for the first quarter. I would characterize the quarter as on par with our expectations when normalizing for unusual items and higher than expected mortality impactin",1423,"Thank you, Dennis. We reported income from operations of $276 million or $0.83 per share for the first quarter. I would characterize the quarter as on par with our expectations when normalizing for unusual items and higher than expected mortality impacting both our Group Life and Individual Life earnings.
Combined mortality across our Group and Individual Life businesses impacted earnings by $18 million. We expect mortality in both businesses to recover in future periods.
Setting aside mortality, we reported a positive DAC adjustment of $21 million in our annuity segment reflecting a refinement to our estimates. This positive annuity earnings item was partially offset by various balance sheet adjustments in our life segment and our other operations that combined impact earnings in the quarter by about $10 million.
Net income of $283 million or $0.85 per share recovered considerably from recent quarters as net investment losses were modest and weâ€™re offset by final gains recorded on the sale of Lincoln UK and the closing of Delaware Investments. Our variable annuity hedge performance came in as expected with very little impact to earnings.
We reported a net realized loss on invested assets of 28 million after-tax, down significantly from what weâ€™ve been experiencing throughout 2009.
Gross realized losses and impairments on general account invested assets were $108 million pretax. Also much improved over 2009 where we averaged over $200 million a quarter. Gross losses were offset by $50 million in gains as we took advantage of recovering credit markets to reduce our holdings in riskier assets, some of which have been previously impaired.
RMBS represented about half of the impairments in the period as housing stabilizes we would expect these losses to moderate. We took about $21 million in write-downs in our direct commercial real estate portfolio including real estate equity. Our overall mortgage lending portfolio remains solid with only 13 loans either delinquent or in for closure, representing about 1% of the $7 billion portfolio and adequately reserved for.
Given the ratings actions in Greece, Portugal and Spain, let me pause here to address our exposure. We have very little sovereign debt exposure to the five primary countries under question. Portfolio, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain. Less than 3 million of exposure in total. We have zero banking exposure to Greece and Portugal and only$36 million of exposure to banks domicile in the five countries in question. We will be expanding our 10Q disclosures on this topic but feel comfortable with our sovereign debt exposure.
Aside from the positive DAC adjustment in the period, annuity earnings continued to benefit from increase average account values and positive trends in asset base revenue. Average account values increased approximately $2 billion in the quarter driving expense assessment revenue up 6% sequentially with stable fixed margins.
We ended the first quarter with total average annuity account values of $75 billion, an increase of roughly $19 billion over the year ago values.
Our DAC model uses a corridor approach to estimating account values for the purposes of amortizing debt. We reset our corridor in the fourth quarter of 2008 growth in account value since that time of inched us closer to a positive unlocking. We estimate an unlocking to the midpoint of the corridor would result in a 200 million to 250 million positive earnings impact. As of the quarter end we estimate markets would have to appreciate approximately 20% before contemplating an adjustment.
Turning to our Defined Contribution business, a steady quarter overall with key earnings drivers of flows, markets and spreads, cooperating in the period. We ended the first quarter with total DC account values nearing $37 billion, an increase of $8 billion over year ago. Average account values were up $1 billion sequentially.
Revenues from asset-based fees followed growth in account values with expense assessment revenue up 2% sequentially and over 27% year-over-year. An individual life, elevated mortality and various true-ups serve to mask otherwise stable sequential growth rates in both in-force and account values. Rates consistent with our earnings growth rate outlook in the 5% range.
Itâ€™s not uncommon to have higher levels of mortality in the first quarter but in this case we had a large single death claim that was not fully covered by reinsurance. This claim alone accounted for roughly half the adverse mortality impact in the quarter.
When looking at the trends in our Life results itâ€™s important to take into account two meaningful transactions completed in 2009. Reinsurance transaction in the first quarter and the year-end life reserve financing. The latter of which reduced Life earnings by about $6 million in the current quarter. We suggest adjusting this quarterâ€™s reported Life earnings were about $14 million of an unfavorable mortality and true-ups when modeling our forward earnings.
In Group Protection the loss ratio came in at 75% considerably higher than what we have experienced in the last several quarters and outside our expected range. The increase was primarily due to high mortality in our Group Life blocks. Disability loss ratios remain solid in the quarter with dental loss ratios running a bit higher than our planned levels.
We have reviewed conditions in our Group Life block for any notable concentrations including new business and believe this quarter to be an aberration. We expect overall non-medical loss ratios well above the (inaudible) times to fall back towards the low 70% range on average in future periods. The elevated loss ratios impacted Group earnings in the period by about $10 million.
Net earned premium increased 3% sequentially and up about 6% over last yearâ€™s quarter. As Dennis noted earlier premium growth rates benefited from consecutive periods of strong sales growth. We expect continued progress in year-over-year premium growth rates up towards the high single digit area at the close of 2010.
Turning to capital our insurance subsidiaries remain in a strong position with an RBC ratio estimate in excess of 475%. Statutory results came in as expected with normalized statutory income running at about 60% of GAAP earnings and our risk-based capital requirement has come down as markets recover and credit quality improves.
We have total adjusted capital of about $7 billion and risk-based capital improving from approximately 1.5 billion recorded at year-end. We have pulled dividends out of the life companies throughout the year, likely managing our RBC closer to the 450% range while maintaining a strong excess liquidity position at the holding company.
Our holding company liquidity position at the end of the quarter stood at roughly $1 billion during the quarter we paid up senior debt of $250 million with cash on hand having prefunded with an offering late in 2009.
Overall, a strong capital position when contemplating futures stress testing with the agencies and regulators and giving us flexibility when addressing life reserve financing solutions.
While net income recovered sharply, book value was up only modestly in the period. The result of adopting a new accounting guidance which changes how we account for our $600 million in credit linked note investments. The effect of the new accounting is to consolidate the underlying collateral on our balance sheet and in the process marking to market securities the equities.
All told this reduced our book value by about $169 million in the period. This adoption does not represent an impairment of the securities. Going forward, any change in market valuation of our credit linked notes will run through net income.
Enterprise wide, operating expenses were essentially flat with last year while revenues improved with positive net flows and recovery in the markets. As noted last quarter, we expect investments back into our business to impact earnings per share by roughly $0.10 for the year. These investments will build slowly and impacted first quarter EPS by only $0.01. It is possibly strategic expenses will come in a little better than our full year estimate.
Overall, weâ€™re pleased with the health of our core earnings drivers in the quarter. Positive flows and strong account value growth, a steady build and life insurance in-force were the more diversified mix of business. We defended spreads overall despite new money rates and net earned premium growth rates are building in our Group businesses.
We would have expected strong reported earnings but recognize mortality will fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our capital position has only improved since year-end. We think the turnaround in our general account to an unrealized gain position and reduced realized losses and impairments bode well for future capital conditions.
Now let me turn it back to Dennis for some closing comments.

Before we move to your questions Iâ€™d like to take a moment to reflect on the landscape post prices.

At the same time, our competitors are reexamining assumptions for long-term growth and profitability and in any cases rethinking business models and key lines of business. This is a time that I think demanded very strong focus on longer-term strategy and proactively seeking emerging opportunities, which is a key factor in the decision to create a new senior management committee role dedicated to exploring strategic opportunities and actions that can take Lincoln to the next level. And also to ask spread to take on the challenge once the successor CEO is identified.

As I said we do think that because of the lumpiness in this mid-to-large market and sales that we actually made in the first quarter that will show up in the second quarter that we will see some good deposit growth in the second quarter. We are investing significantly in several areas to improve our organic results. That includes, as an example, in our retirement consultant worksite group, weâ€™re investing in that, upgrading to people, change in their focus from service to asset gathering, that will help. We will probably be because of added shelf space weâ€™ll probably be expanding our support inside of Lincoln Financial distributors by adding co-sellers to increase opportunity with our advisors there, so weâ€™re making investments there.
I think weâ€™ve been fairly clear that we have administrative investments that need to be made in order for us to be in the game all the time when weâ€™re in a competitive situation and we think we will have that result in the next 12 months. So weâ€™re doing that as well. So I would say the momentum is strong, itâ€™s taking us a little bit longer than we had hoped, I think we had some missteps couple of years back where how to do things, but Iâ€™m pretty confident that this business will begin to show some earnings growth, perhaps better than what weâ€™ve been seeing in 2011.

First, weâ€™re seeing the revenue drivers that you would expect to build with building account values happening or seeing it happening come through our numbers, but what is holding back or being a little bit of a headwind on earnings growth rates relative to market growth rate, is the fact that, weâ€™re really amortizing DAC at a larger level than we have historically. Itâ€™s really the K factor using a technical term on the factor used to amortize your DAC and thatâ€™s really simply a result of expected gross profits having been impacted throughout the crisis so you would have expected to be the case that youâ€™re amortizing a more DAC.
Youâ€™re right, in that that sort of an environment will overtime start to moderate if your markets remain stable and building. Weâ€™re also somewhat amortizing death benefits that were taken when the market was at its low point and we were paying our claims under our guaranteed minimum death benefits. The SOP benefit ratio practice of amortizing those claims are cost into your P&L, will hang with you also for a while, as the company, but eventually, we would find that to moderate overtime certainly as a percentage of our revenue should account values continue to build.
The other elements is, of course, the DAC court, or recognize that when you unlock your DAC negative, you also impact that K factor and you end up amortizing your DAC at a higher rate going forward and thatâ€™s in part whatâ€™s arisen the amortization rates. The reverse is true as well. If you are to unlock positively i.e., not use a corridor approach, you would impact positively your lower your K factor and help those amortization rates going forward. So to some degree weâ€™re sort of housing, if you will, potential future earnings growth rates in that corridor and we still think itâ€™s the right thing to do.
We think the concept of having a more assured permanency to market moves before you unlock is a good thing. We think itâ€™s the right direction to go as a company. But for these periods of time where the market has responded very quickly and recovered itâ€™s going to be a little bit of a hold back to our earnings growth rates relative to what you would expect with the account value growth.

They may fluctuate a little bit after that depending on the structure, but theyâ€™re not going to be too far off CDS type spreads or dollar-based spreads on our bonds.
When it comes to the bank market pricing it has come in from certainly the last several quarters, but it is not back at the levels that the marketplace was experiencing pre-crisis where thereâ€™s just a tremendous amount of supply or capacity in very low pricing. I would say if a company like Lincoln was paying 25 basis points to 35 basis points and letters of credit coming into the crisis the pricing these days is probably between 100 basis points and 150 basis points probably more on the upper end of that range, but again market conditions continue to change pretty quickly and thatâ€™s in part why weâ€™re being patient. So certainly has come in from those 300 basis point levels, for sure, I would say at least at the 200 basis point level for a long-term solution, but you can actually see the pricing by just tracking spreads in the marketplace for the life industry.

And then secondly, I had a question on variable annuity sales. This quarter I think sequentially, your sales were down about 10%. Industry sales seem like they will be up around 1%. So not sure whatâ€™s going on. Seems like youâ€™ve lost share. You had been gaining share over the last few quarters.

What I said was I firmly believe is that there are going to be opportunities in the market as other companies spin off properties that arenâ€™t core to them and that we canâ€™t wait until we get a book, we have to be proactive out in the marketplace looking for these opportunities. Iâ€™ve done this once before at a point in time where I thought it was most important to have somebody whoâ€™s Fredâ€™s qualifications that simply focused on these opportunities. If you have something that you want to get done, the best way to do it is put somebody who is really talented, and charge of it. And no matter how difficult the markets might be, we will be in a better position to be successful I think with this change. So thatâ€™s the answer to that question.
With respect to variable annuity sales, every quarter can be effective by different competitive actions. Last year, a couple of our competitors were closing out products that had high features, which gave them a temporary lift in their sales. So each quarter I think stands on its own and you have to look at the entire competitive environment to see what plus or minus in the quarter.
I would also say that importantly, at Lincoln, where we have relied more heavily on the warehouses and the banks that the warehouses and the banks for all of last year was still trying to find their equilibrium, if you will, with all of the integration and purchases that were going on. Weâ€™re beginning to see some uptick in sales from the wares so we remain pretty confident that we will continue to hold share, hopefully, improve share over the course of the year. But in the first quarter results are what they are, I am disappointed at all in results, and I expect them to continue to improve.

Even though the profitability has come down, my recollection is that weâ€™re still achieving ROEs in the 15% range or better on the current level of earnings you donâ€™t see that too much in the insurance business, those kinds of return. Again, the demand, there is no question in my mind that the demand to these income guarantee products are going to continue.
So I am quite optimistic about the growth rate in that business. At the same time for a variety of reasons I donâ€™t want the individual annuity business to overwhelm the rest of the businesses in terms of its contributions to earnings. Right now, itâ€™s about 30%; frankly, I like to keep it in that range. And I say that because a lot of the earnings are generated inside the VA contract from the equity market. I rather be able to drive earnings in good equity markets and bad equity markets.
So I think diversifying into business is itâ€™s not so dependent where so much of the earnings growth is driven by market reaction, is a good idea. So just to summarize like the annuity business weâ€™re going to continue to invest and then weâ€™re not holding back at all, but it requires us to look for faster growth inorganically, as well as organically, in our other businesses so that weâ€™re not getting too reliant on for growth just on that one business. Okay?

I would tell you thatâ€™s generally where my head is. And for the simple fact that weâ€™re all patiently watching things unfold in the economy. Weâ€™ve learnt here this past week with announcements out of Europe that things can still be choppy from time to time and so I donâ€™t know that weâ€™re altogether misaligned it all with rating agency views. I think once markets truly stabilize and feel more and more comfortable, which clearly, thatâ€™s taking place, you may gradually find risk-based capital levels moderating at a lower level.
I would also say that there has been adjustments in the approach to risk-based capital that have taken place throughout the crisis and continue to take place whether itâ€™s a variable annuity reserving issues, there are discussions going on around the amount of capital clearly against mortgages, there has been several different changes that have moderated overtime and I think once those all settle in and once the rating agencies make their appropriate adjustments to their models then we could see some improvement in risk-based capital levels given that the reserving requirements and capital requirements overall have really risen, particularly on variable annuities. So we just simply have to see it play out, Randy, itâ€™s difficult to predict. I think the rating agencies are going through a lot of change and adjustments and theyâ€™re thinking and we need to let that settle down as well.

So my view on the life insurance capital front is that weâ€™ve gotten ourselves into a good position, both at the Lincoln National Life level as well as our captives, and thatâ€™s what I mean when I say they will hover around 450% is thatâ€™s a comfortable level to be in and gives us a plenty of room to maneuver through life reserve financing solutions as we go forward which is good.

That is about a $0.5 billion or so depending on the year for Lincoln and so that gives you a little bit of an idea of what weâ€™re holding over and above this policy of contingent liquidity at the holding company.

Weâ€™ve asked ourselves that question and I think more likely the first quarter as a result across the industry on the individual side and perhaps on the group side is more likely. If there is one factor the factor is called winter is probably, the biggest issue and it was a pretty brutal winter. It may weaken that people try to stay alive until 1st January, but again just two things. One on the group side, and I have experienced over the ten years Iâ€™ve been watching this business from time to time you have a spike mortality, which is just as way things shake out in a quarter. Now, when you do that, again, as Fred said, you have to go back and make sure cohort by cohort new business, old business that thereâ€™s nothing that is related to stay over particular cohort, whether itâ€™s new business or old business and weâ€™ve done that and we canâ€™t identify anything that will be systematic in the block of business.
The other thing I would point out, this was one of the few businesses where the earnings of the individual group (inaudible) the 143 people that are out in the marketplace selling this stuff, there is bad claims and a block of business that they sold they have to participate in that with lower economics, get back some of their commissions, so people are pretty good about paying attention to that.
On the individual side, again, weâ€™re carrying on this a little bit more. The individual side really turn out to be one large claim which really wasnâ€™t across the board and ended up being predominantly one large claim, which was a person, who had a significant amount of insurance and weâ€™re not the only insurance company that will be suffering from that one large claim. Iâ€™m going into too much of detail here. We think itâ€™s random in both the individual and group protection. In group, sometimes randomness can carry on for 60 days or 90 days or so, so we will be watching it.

And we just have to move along at a pace and watch all of these things again to make sure that weâ€™re comfortable with making a move like that.
By the way Iâ€™d also say the fact of this issue letters of credit that we apply the same philosophy. I would say that the conditions in the marketplace are such that, as Fred said that we would be wanting to do two things, one renew some portion of letter of credit, to get that off the minds of the analysts and then what Fred and I, the team, are even more enthusiastic about just terming out significant portions of that letter of credit facility as quickly as we can.

The early part of the year mostly showed signs of an improving economy, more robust capital markets and a growing sense of stability. Our view is that advisors and consumers' attitudes are improving,",1366,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning to everyone on the call. The early part of the year mostly showed signs of an improving economy, more robust capital markets and a growing sense of stability. Our view is that advisors and consumers' attitudes are improving, but both remain cautious as evidenced by a significant amounts of cash still on the sidelines. Lincoln's first quarter operating results were very good in view of these conditions. 
Consistent with recent quarters, our fundamentals were strong. We had good production in all businesses and high and sustainable levels of sales in several products. We reported positive net flows in our Life, Annuities and Defined Contribution businesses. And our already strong capital position was strengthened further with improved general account conditions, recovering net income and strong overall statutory earnings, leading to higher levels of risk-based capital. 
More specifically, we generated total gross deposits of $4.7 billion and positive net flows of $1.3 billion, benefiting from our top 10 or better market position in all of our core product lines and our strategy of maintaining consistent presence in the market, with a full suite of competitive products and continued strong distribution support. Net flows in our Life, Annuities and DC businesses capped nine straight quarters of positive net flows in these businesses, with a single quarter exception in Defined Contribution. 
Looking at Annuities, we expect solid demand for Annuities to continue, given good consumer interest in guaranteed sources of income. Providers who are committed to the opportunity, stay in the market over cycles, are disciplined with product features and risk management and have multiple distribution channels, like Lincoln, will be the winners. Lincoln capitalized on this approach in the quarter, generating 18% sales growth in our variable products, with average account values of 40% over the prior-year period. Fixed annuities are sensitive to interest rates. And in the wake of lower rates, our fixed annuity deposits were down over the first quarter of last year. 
Looking forward, our distribution strategy of having wholesalers carry both fixed and variable annuity products allows us to pivot between our annuity solutions with market conditions and consumer demand. 
In Defined Contribution, we continue to hold a strong market position in the 403(b) business and particularly in healthcare and K-12 education plans. First year sales in the mid large 403(b) market are inherently lumpy, driven by the timing of on-boarding new plans. So while first quarter deposits were weak when compared to the year-ago quarter, which benefited from a few large cases, the second quarter is developing nicely in terms of new cases and deposits. 
We're also seeing some improvement in terms of ongoing contributions from larger plans, as the recovering economy begins to spur employers to increase salaries and reinstate matches. Our strategy to build on strategic partner relationships to introduce DC solutions to intermediaries with small business clients is gaining traction, with an increase of 68% in first year sales over last year. 
Our core Individual Life Insurance business continues to perform well, with earnings drivers in the 5% growth range. We recorded a 68% sales increase from MoneyGuard, where we are the clear product category leader, and saw a continued high demand for term life, which generated an 81% sales increase. We expect strong growth rates to continue in these products. Our core Universal Life business continued to reflect higher numbers of policies sold, up 37% over last year at this time, but extending the trend of lower average base amounts. As consumer wealth rebuilds, I expect case size to increase. 
In Group Protection, momentum from high fourth quarter sales continued into the first quarter, with annualized sales of 16% over the year-ago period. Year-over-year net earned premium growth was 6%, which I expect decline to the high single-digits over the course of the year as sales increase. We're growing our reputation as a voluntary benefits provider, and continue to invest in distribution, worksite enrollment, administrative capabilities and product development to enable us to capitalize on growth prospects offered in this market. We saw strong market share gains in this business over the course of 2009, and based on member data, are now the sixth largest provider of voluntary group benefits in the country. 41% of the sales this quarter came from our Voluntary business, up 38% over last year. 
We are continuing our product development efforts across business lines to enhance sales, increase profitability and lower risk. Our core variable annuity and secondary guarantee Universal Life products were good illustrations of these efforts last year. This year, we intend to further refine our product portfolios to ensure we keep pace with evolving consumer needs and to help spur sales growth. We're introducing long-term care annuity hybrids, group accident insurance and a new life product designed to meet term life needs through a Universal Life design. 
Distribution remains a competitive advantage for Lincoln. And our ability to tailor our distribution models to the evolving needs of our partners and clients will be a catalyst for market share gains across Lincoln Financial Distributors, Lincoln Financial Network and our worksite sales and service organizations. LFD remains one of the largest wholesale distribution organizations in the industry. And our ability to leverage our competitive advantage in wholesale distribution helped us to add or expand relationships with seven firms this quarter. 
One measure of wholesaling effectiveness is the number of advisors who sell at least one Lincoln product in the period. In the first quarter, that number is up 20% over a year ago. We view this as an indicator of our ability to influence advisors across products and channels. Also, a 23% increase in wholesaler productivity is another sign of how well we are capitalizing on the strength and reach of LFD. 
Lincoln Financial Network continues to leverage its model to attract seasoned advisors who value affiliation choice, adding more than 150 new net advisors in the first quarter to approximately 7,850 total, with favorable retention rates of top advisors across the network. LFN reliably outpaces the industry in overall life insurance sales, making it both a valuable distribution channel for proprietary life products, as well as an important source of information about trends in the life marketplace. We continue to build our worksite sales and service platforms, primarily found in our Group Protection and Defined Contribution businesses, which will expand our opportunities in these critical growth businesses. 
From an earnings perspective, I am pleased with the performance and positive momentum in core drivers such as account values, in-force space amounts and net earned premium levels. And we continue to hold the line on expenses, despite expanding numbers of distribution partners, clients and accounts. We are mindful, however, that ROEs need to improve, and we are focusing efforts across all ROE drivers to support this goal. 
Turning to financial strength. Capital levels are stronger at the end of the first quarter, with an estimated risk-based capital ratio above 475% and more than $1 billion in cash at the holding company. We continue to see a more positive trend in investment losses and gains as the markets recover, in fact, moving to a net unrealized gain position of $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter. And we believe our investment portfolio is well balanced across issuers and asset types and well-positioned for a slow economic recovery. 
With regard to our participation in the capital purchase program, we are increasingly comfortable with the recent improvements in the outlook for the economy, the strength of the capital markets, our strong operating performance and capital adequacy. Assuming no disruption to this generally favorable pattern, we are likely to accelerate our repayment time frame. 
As I look at the quarter and outlook for Lincoln, I am pleased with the underlying strength, positive momentum and capital-generating capacity of our core businesses. The investments we're making in talent, technology, brand and risk management are all important components of our goal to be a top quartile performer. And I believe the life insurance industry is stronger, and Lincoln in particular, is well positioned to deliver long-term value to clients and shareholders. 
Now let me turn the call over to Fred for additional detail on the quarter."

We reported income from operations of $276 million or $0.83 per share for the first quarter. I would characterize the quarter as on par with our expectations when normalizing for unusual items and higher-than-expected mortality, impacting both our Group Life and Individual Life earnings. Combined mortality across our Group and Individual Life businesses impacted earnings by $18 million. We expect mortality in both businesses to recover in future periods. 
Setting aside mortality, we recorded a positive DAC adjustment of $21 million in our Annuity segment, reflecting a refinement to our estimates. This positive annuity earnings item was partially offset by various balance sheet adjustments in our Life segment and our other operations that combined the impact earnings in the quarter by about $10 million. 
Net income of $283 million or $0.85 per share, recovered considerably from recent quarters, as net investment losses were modest and were offset by final gains recorded on the sale of Lincoln U.K. and the closing of Delaware Investments. Our variable annuity hedge performance came in as expected with very little impact to earnings. 
We reported a net realized loss on invested assets of $28 million after tax, down significantly from what we had been experiencing throughout 2009. Gross realized losses and impairments on general account invested assets were $108 million pretax, also much improved over 2009 where we averaged over $200 million a quarter. Gross losses were offset by $50 million in gains, as we took advantage of recovering credit markets to reduce our holdings in riskier assets, some of which had been previously impaired. 
RMBS represented about half the impairments in the period. As housing stabilizes, we would expect these losses to moderate. We took about $21 million in write-downs in our direct commercial real estate portfolio including real estate equity. Our overall mortgage lending portfolio remains solid, with only 13 loans, either delinquent or in foreclosure, representing about 1% of the $7 billion portfolio and adequately reserved for. 
Given the ratings actions in Greece, Portugal and Spain, let me pause here to address our exposure. We have very little sovereign debt exposure to the five primary countries under question: Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain, less than $3 million of exposure in total. We have zero banking exposure to Greece and Portugal, and only $36 million of exposure to banks domiciled in the five countries in question. We will be expanding our 10-Q disclosures on this topic, but feel comfortable with our sovereign debt exposure. 
Aside from the positive DAC adjustment in the period, Annuity earnings continued to benefit from increased average account values and positive trends in asset-based revenue. Average account values increased approximately $2 billion in the quarter, driving expense assessment revenue up 6% sequentially with stable fixed margins. We ended the first quarter with total average annuity account values of $75 billion, an increase of roughly $19 billion over the year-ago values. 
Our DAC model uses a corridor approach to estimating account values for the purposes of amortizing DAC. We reset our corridor in the fourth quarter of 2008. Growth in account value since that time have inched us closer to a positive unlocking. We estimate an unlocking to the midpoint of the corridor will result in a $200 million to $250 million positive earnings impact. As of the quarter end, we estimate markets would have to appreciate approximately 20% before contemplating an adjustment. 
Turning to our Defined Contribution business, a steady quarter overall, with key earnings drivers of flows, markets and spreads cooperating in the period. We ended the first quarter with total DC account values nearing $37 billion, an increase of $8 billion over year-ago values. Average account values were up $1 billion sequentially. Revenues from asset-based fees followed growth in account values, with expense assessment revenue up 2% sequentially and over 27% year-over-year. 
In Individual Life, elevated mortality and various true-ups served to mask otherwise stable sequential growth rates in both in-force and account values, rates consistent with our earnings growth rate outlook in the 5% range. It's not uncommon to have higher levels of mortality in the first quarter. But in this case, we had a large single death claim that was not fully covered by reinsurance. This claim alone accounted for roughly half the adverse mortality impact in the quarter. 
When looking at the trends in our Life results, it's important to take into account two meaningful transactions completed in 2009: the reinsurance transaction in the first quarter and the year-end life reserve financing, the latter of which reduced Life earnings by about $6 million in the current quarter. We suggest adjusting this quarter's reported Life earnings for about $14 million of unfavorable mortality and true-ups when modeling our forward earnings. 
In Group Protection, the loss ratio came in at 75%, considerably higher than what we have experienced in the last several quarters and outside our expected range. The increase was primarily due to high mortality in our Group Life blocks. Disability loss ratios remained solid in the quarter, with dental loss ratios running a bit higher than our planned levels. We have reviewed conditions in our Group Life block for any notable concentrations, including new business, and believe this quarter to be an aberration. We expect overall non-medical loss ratios, while volatile at times, to fall back towards the low 70% range on average in future periods. The elevated loss ratios impacted group earnings in the period by about $10 million. 
Net earned premium increased 3% sequentially and up about 6% over last year's quarter. As Dennis noted earlier, premium growth rates benefited from consecutive periods of strong sales growth. We expect continued progress in year-over-year premium growth rates, up towards the high single-digit area at the close of 2010. 
Turning to capital. Our insurance subsidiaries remained in a strong position with an RBC ratio estimate in excess of 475%. Statutory results came in as expected, with normalized statutory income running at about 60% of GAAP earnings. And our risk-based capital requirement has come down as markets recover and credit quality improves. We have total adjusted capital of about $7 billion and risk-based capital improving from approximately $1.5 billion recorded at year end. 
We have pulled dividends out of the Life company throughout the year, likely managing our RBC closer to the 450% range, while maintaining a strong excess liquidity position at the holding company. Our holding company liquidity position at the end of the quarter stood at roughly $1 billion. During the quarter, we paid out senior debt of $250 million with cash on hand, having pre-funded with an offering late in 2009. Overall, a strong capital position when contemplating future stress testing with the agencies and regulators and giving us flexibility when addressing life reserve financing solutions. 
While net income recovered sharply, book value was up only modestly in the period, the result of adopting a new accounting guidance, which changes how we account for our $600 million in credit-linked note investments. The effect of the new accounting is to consolidate the underlying collateral on our balance sheet, and in the process, marking to market the securities through equity. All told, this reduced our book value by about $169 million in the period. This adoption does not represent an impairment of the securities. Going forward, any change in market valuation of our credit-linked notes will run through net income. 
Enterprise-wide, operating expenses were essentially flat with last year, while revenues improved with positive net flows and recovery in the markets. As noted last quarter, we expect investments back into our business to impact earnings per share by roughly $0.10 for the year. These investments will build slowly and impacted first quarter EPS by only $0.01. It is possible strategic expenses will come in a little better than our full year estimate. 
Overall, we are pleased with the health of our core earnings drivers in the quarter. Positive flows and strong account value growth, a steady build in life insurance in-force with a more diversified mix of business, we defended spreads overall despite new money rates and net earned premium growth rates are building in our Group businesses. We would have expected stronger reported earnings, but recognize  mortality will fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our capital position has only improved since year end. We think the turnaround in our general account to an unrealized gain position and reduced realized losses in impairments, bode well for future capital conditions. Now let me turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments."

And your risk-based capital and the denominator has come down about $40 million or $50 million or so from year end. And that's really what's driving the strong risk-based capital dynamics. Right now, Andrew, if the overall question is really, where do you think you're at from an excess capital perspective, I'll give you my vantage point on it. First, recognize that, I think the industry is being asked the whole relatively higher levels on average of risk-based capital. So when I was quoting you excess capital last quarter, I was using sort of a conventional standard of 350% risk-based capital. I think it's safe to assume that the industry is going to run a little higher than that now, probably approaching more like 400% for a period of time. But even when using that as a high watermark on risk-based capital, we still, between insurance company and excess liquidity at the holding company, are comfortably in about $1.5 billion excess capital range. And that's after holding a level of idle capital at the holding company for liquidity needs and carrying ourselves at a higher standard of risk-based capital around 400%. So that's the way I would size it up right now. The only adjustment in that really, Andrew, is just recognizing that, as we talk with the rating agencies and we watch the environment, it appears to us that for at least a period of time, the industry is being asked to run at a little higher RBC levels."

As I've said, we do think that because of the lumpiness in this mid to large market and sales that we actually made in the first quarter that will show up in the second quarter, that we'll see some good deposit growth in the second quarter.

That includes, as an example, in our retirement consultant worksite group, we're investing in that, upgrading the people, changing their focus from service to asset gathering. That will help. We will probably be, because of added shelf space, would probably be expanding our support inside of Lincoln Financial Distributors by adding wholesalers to increase opportunity with our advisors there. So we're making investments there. I think we have been fairly clear that we have administrative investments that need to be made in order for us to be in the game all the time when we're in a competitive situation. And we think we'll have that resolved in the next 12 months. So we're doing that as well. So I would say that the momentum is strong. It's taking us a little bit longer than we had hoped. I think we had some missteps a couple of years back of where and how to do things. But I'm pretty confident that this business will begin to show some earnings growth, perhaps better than what we've been seeing in 2011. And just to add to that, of course, although difficult to find, when I talk about focusing on what's happening in the industry, it may very well be properties coming available, hard to get probably a lot of competition for them. But this is one of those areas where we can advance the ball with an acquisition if we can find it, or we want to advance the ball with an acquisition if we could find it. So to summarize, I'm confident that we're taking the right steps and that momentum will begin to build faster than it has over the last 12 months or so."

First, we're seeing the revenue drivers that you would expect to build with building account values happen. We're seeing it happen and come through our numbers but what is holding back or being a little bit of a headwind on earnings growth rates relative to market growth rates is the fact that we're really amortizing DAC at a larger level than we have historically. It's really the K factor, using the technical term on the factor used to amortize your DAC. And that's really simply a result of expected gross profits having been impacted throughout the crisis. So you would expect it to be the case that you're amortizing more DAC. But now in the case of -- you're right in that, that sort of environment will over time start to moderate if your markets remain stable and building. We're also somewhat amortizing death benefits that were taken when the market was at its low point. And we're paying out claims under our guaranteed minimum death benefits. The SOP benefit ratio practice of amortizing those claims are costs into your P&L will hang with you also for a while as a company. But eventually, we would find that to moderate over time, certainly as a percentage of our revenue should account values continue to build. The other element is of course the DAC corridor. Recognize that when you unlock your DAC negative, you also impact that K factor and you end up amortizing your DAC at higher rate going forward. And that's in part what's reasonably the amortization rates. The reverse is true as well. If you were to unlock positively, i.e., not use a corridor approach, you would impact positively or lower your K factor and help those amortization rates going forward. So to some degree, we're sort of housing, if you will, potential future earnings growth rates in that corridor. And we still think it's right thing to do. We think the concept of having a more assured permanency to market moves before you unlock is a good thing. We think it's the right direction to go as a company. But for these periods of time when the market has responded very quickly and recovered, it's going to be a little bit of a holdback to our earnings growth rates relevant to what you would expect with account value growth."

They may fluctuate a little bit off of that, depending on the structure, but they're not going to be too far off CDS-type spreads or dollar-based spreads on our bonds. When it comes to the bank market pricing, it has come in from certainly the last several quarters but it is not back at the levels that the marketplace was experiencing pre-crisis, where there was just a tremendous amount of supply or capacity and very low pricing. I would say if a company like Lincoln was paying 25 to 35 basis points in letters of credit coming into the crisis. The pricing these days is probably between 100, 150 basis points, probably more on the upper end of that range. But again, market conditions continue to change pretty quickly, and that's why in part we're being patient. So certainly, it's come in from those 300 basis point levels. For sure, I would say at least at the 200 basis point level for our long-term solution. But you can actually see the pricing by just tracking spreads in the marketplace for the life industry."

And then second, the other question on variable annuity sales. This quarter, I think sequentially your sales were down about 10%. Industry sales seem like they'll be up around 1%.

What I said was and I firmly believe is that there aren't going to be opportunities in the market as other companies spin off properties that aren't core to them. And we can't wait until we get a book. We have to be proactive out of the marketplace booked looking for these opportunities. I've done this once before at a point in time where I thought it was most important to have somebody with spreads qualifications to simply focus on these opportunities. If you have something that you want to get done, the best way to do it is to put somebody who's really talented in charge of it and the matter how difficult markets might be, will be in a better position to be successful I think with this change. So that's the answer to that question. With respect to variable annuity sales, every quarter can be affected by different competitive actions. Last year, a couple of our competitors were closing out product that had high features, which give them a temporary lift in their sales. So each quarter, I think, stands on its own. And you have to look at the entire competitive environment to see if it will be plus or minus in the quarter. I would also say that importantly, at Lincoln, where we have relied more heavily on the wirehouses and the banks. That the wirehouses and the banks for all of last year were still trying to find their equilibrium, if you will, with all the integration and purchases that were going on. We're beginning to see some uptick in sales from the wires. So we remain pretty confident that we'll continue to hold share, hopefully improve share over the course of the year. But in the first quarter, the results are what they are. I'm not disappointed at all in the results, and I expect them to continue to improve."

It's a profitable business. Even though the profitability has come down, my recollection is that we're still achieving ROEs in the 15% range or better on the current level of earnings. You don't see that too much in the insurance business, those kinds of returns. Again, the demand, there's no question in my mind that the demand for these income-guaranteed products are going to continue. So I'm quite optimistic about the growth rate in that business. At the same time, for a variety of reasons, I don't want the Individual Annuity business to overwhelm the rest of the businesses in terms of its contributions to earnings. Right now, it's about 30%. And frankly, I'd like to keep it in that range. And I say that, because a lot of the earnings are generated inside the VA contract from the equity markets. I'd rather be able to drive earnings in good equity times, in good equity markets and bad equity markets. And so I think diversifying into businesses where it's not so dependent, where so much of the earnings growth is driven by market reaction, is a good idea. So just to summarize, I like the Annuity business. We're going to continue to invest and that we're not holding back at all. But it requires us to look for faster growth inorganically as well as organically in our other businesses, so that we're not getting too reliant for growth just on that one business."

I would tell you that's generally where my head is. And for the simple fact that we're all patiently watching things unfold in the economy, we've learned here this past week, with announcements out of Europe, that things could still be choppy from time to time. And so I don't know that we're together misaligned at all with rating agency views. I think once markets truly stabilize and feel more and more comfortable, which clearly that's taking place, you may gradually find risk-based capital levels moderating at a lower level. I would also say that there's been adjustments in the approach to risk-based capital that has taken place throughout the crisis and continue to take place, whether it's variable annuity-reserving issues, there are discussions going on around the amount of capital to carry against mortgages. There has been several different changes that have moderated over time. And I think once those all settle in and once the rating agencies make their appropriate adjustments to their models, then we could see some improvement in risk-based capital levels, given that the reserving requirements and capital requirements overall have really risen for, particularly on variable annuities. So we just simply have to see it play out, Randy. It's difficult to predict. I think the rating agencies are going to do a lot of change and adjustments in their thinking and we need to let that settle down as well."

And I think more likely, the first quarter's result across the industry on the Individual side and perhaps on the Group side, is more likely -- if there's one factor, the factor is cold winter. It's probably the biggest issue. And it was a pretty brutal winter. It may leak in that people try to stay alive until the 1st of January. But again, just two things: One on the Group side, as Fred said, and I've experienced over the 10 years of that I've been watching this business, from time to time, you have a spike in mortality, which is just as the way things shake out in a quarter. Now when you do that, again as Fred said, you have to go back and make sure cohort by cohort, new business, old business, that there's nothing that is related to the sale of a particular cohort whether it's new business or old business. And we've done that and we can't identify anything that would be systemic in the locker business. The other thing I'd point out, this is one of the few businesses where the earnings of the individual group revved, the 143 people that are out in the marketplace selling the stuff, if there's bad claims and a block of business that they sold, they'd have to participate in that with lower economics, a give back of some of their commissions. So people are pretty good about paying attention to that. On the individual side, again, we're carrying out on this a little bit more. The Individual side really turned out to be one large client which really wasn't across-the-board. It ended up being predominantly one large client which was a person who had a significant amount of insurance, and we're not the only insurance company that will be suffering from that one large claim. So again, we think, I'm going into too much detail here, we think it's random in both the Life, Individual and Group Protection. In Group, sometimes, randomness can carry on for 60, 90 days or so. So we'll be watching it."

One, renew some portion of the letter of credit to get that off the minds of the analysts.

Continuing our momentum from recent quarters, our fundamentals were very good. Deposits were up year-over-year in each of our businesses and 10% overall, and total net flows of $2 billion were up 8% year-over-year extending our long and consistent trend of positive net flows in our insurance and retirement businesses.
A focus on distribution relationships and productivity is essential to achieving these performance levels. At Lincoln Financial Distributors, we continue to expand distribution shelf space, adding product at five new firms this quarter.
Each of our top 20 distribution partners offers at least three Lincoln products and half of those firms offer four or more products. Wholesaler productivity is up 13% year-to-date on top of impressive productivity gains made last year.
Lincoln Financial Network continues to attract and retain seasoned advisors, who value our multiple affiliation models. The number of LFN advisors has now reached more than 7,800 and retention of our most productive advisors remains extremely high.
We are enhancing distribution productivity in our defined contribution and group benefit businesses by marrying our high-touch service-oriented worksite models with more efficient enrollment and servicing platforms.
The combination of distribution heft and our comprehensive and innovative suite of products help generate solid sales in each of our businesses. Life insurance experienced modest year-over-year sales growth with high levels of sustainable sales in term life insurance and MoneyGuard are linked benefit UL long-term care product.
MoneyGuard is producing double-digit sales increases and the number of advisors recommending this product to their clients is up more than 50%. Lincoln created the market for these flexible, hybrid solutions more than 20 years ago, and we believe there are compelling option that will continue to gain traction with advisors and consumers. With this kind of advantage, we are confident that Lincoln will continue to lead this market even as competitors begin to enter the space.
We are pleased with progress and deposits inflows in our variable annuities this quarter, and with the strength of our fixed offerings. The individual annuity business continues to benefit from increased reach in the form of 25 new firms carrying our fixed and index products in the past year and our successful strategy of having wholesalers represent the full suite of solutions allowing them to pivot as markets and consumer preferences require.
Defined contribution results were held by strong first year sales in mid to large case 403(b) plans and we are seeing progress in our strategy to more effectively leverage our LFD relationships to support small case for a 1K business.
Group Protection sales trends were positive as well and current sales are driving premium growth rates to 8%. Loss ratios were elevated this quarter. We have seen this occur before. Understand the cycles of the business and know what actions are needed to work through it.
We continue to refine our offerings to around out our product portfolio. With the launch in August of our duration guarantee UL term product to fill the gap between traditional term and life time guarantee UL and which we believe will generate healthy sales in its first year and over time.
Our new accident product for the voluntary market is also slated for August and should also open additional distribution opportunities in our group benefits business.
We maintained our leading market positions in top eight or better sales ranking in each of our core businesses last quarter and increased market share in certain key products, and although the data is not yet available. We expect to see product market share increases in the second quarter as well.
Our financial foundation was strengthened during the quarter with the completion of our broad capital plan. We executed the number of capital actions including raising debt and equity, redeeming the preferred shares issued under the capital purchased program, refinancing outstanding letters of credit and addressing life reserve financing needs.
Life company capital and holding company cash levels remain at historically high levels at the end of the second quarter with an estimated risk based capital ratio of around 500% and more than $800 million in cash at the holding company.
All four major rating agencies have now moved to a stable outlook for Lincoln. Reflecting the success of our capital plan and acknowledging the consistency of our execution and the resilience of our model through the crisis.
Asset quality remains strong in our investment portfolio with growth in our unrealized gain position. As we sit here today, we see no significant areas of credit concern for the balance of the year.
I recognize that the current interest rate environment is on many investors' minds, and lower rates are a concerned for the industry. Fred will cover the impact of lower rate on Lincoln in his remarks.
I personally share the view of many economists, who predict that we will see higher rates within two years due to monitory and fiscal stimulus as well as huge deficit finance needs. Nonetheless, we have and we will take necessary steps to address the interest rate environment.
We are starting the implication of financial reform on our operations and early analysis leads us to believe that there will not be any material impact on Lincoln. We will continue to follow developments and additional rule making over the coming months.
As we execute our strategies for growth ROE expansion continues to be a focus for this management team. The leverage for ROE improvement includes, first, unleveraged double-digit returns on all new product sales. Importantly, we have and we will continue to adjust pricing to respond the market realities, but at the same time we have never miss the mark such that we had to pullback a product. VA and secondary guarantee UL pricing changes last year were good examples.
Second on the ROE front, our ability to effectively redeploy excess capital could add in the range of 75 basis points or more to our ROE. Third, shipping the business mix towards group in DC and fourth, continued disciplined expense management. With cooperative capital markets and capital redeployment, we believe we can make solid return on equity progress over the next two years.
Overall, the outlook for Lincoln is very positive, even more so today given all that have been accomplished and the quality of our execution. This industry has enormous opportunity to help consumers regain confidence in their financial security and I firmly believe that company is like Lincoln that understand and align their resources this opportunity will be the winners.
Now let me turn the call over to Fred.

The only notable items in the quarter were positive DAC amortization in the annuity business, which contributed about $15 million to the segment's earnings.
This offset by unfavorable loss ratios in our group business negatively impacting earnings by about $8 million relatively to plan expectations. We also had a number of smaller items spread across our segments that taken together impacted the quarter's earnings negatively by about $7 million.
Net income per share of $0.33 included the early retirement of the CPP funds and the associated write-off of the unamortized discount on the preferred stock of $131 million, together with the quarterly carry on the securities of $18 million.
Market volatility returned this quarter and had some impact on our VA hedge program performance. We made a conscious decision to not chase implied volatility higher in recent quarters, which resulted in mark-to-market losses in the period. This entirely offset by movement in the non-performance risk factor.
Overall the hedge program was better than 90% effective and our hedge assets remain in excess of our actuarial calculation of the liabilities and well above the statutory reserves needed under the calculation according to VA curve.
Gross losses and impairments on general account investments were down significantly coming in around $37 million pre-tax and entirely offset by realized gains in the quarter. As noted in our press release, we have a few asset categories subject to mark-to-market adjustments.
These include our credit linked notes under recently adopted accounting rules, a modest amount of credit defaults swaps and other derivative positions and certain trading portfolios. These marks resulted in the $30 million net loss in the quarter, driven primarily by spread widening on corporate CDS and its impact on our credit linked notes.
Turning to the segment results and starting with annuities, our results continued to benefit from increased average account values. While June markets drove down, end of period account values, positive flows and stronger markets earlier in the quarter resulted in average account values increasing $1.2 billion in the quarter.
End of period account values were $73 billion, about $3 billion lower than the average in the second quarter. There has since been some market recovery, and we expect positive flows will mitigate some of the pressure on earnings as we look towards the third quarter.
We currently sit comfortably in the center of our debt corridor method, which guides our prospective account value assumptions. We estimate markets would have to fall by approximately 30% before contemplating a negative unlocking.
Fixed margins were stable during the quarter with normalized spreads in the 190 to 200 basis point range consistent with the last several quarters.
Turning to our Defined Contribution business, a steady quarter overall with key earnings drivers of positive net flows, stable account values and spreads cooperating in the period.
Average account values were up about $700 million, sequentially, despite the market declines in June. As with our Annuity business, end of period account values were little over $1 billion lower than the average in the quarter at about $35 billion.
Fixed margins and spreads were both, strong in the quarter with normalized spreads of approximately 225 basis points, a result of credit and rate actions taken in the second quarter.
In Individual Life, reported earnings were inline with our expectations and underlying trends we see in the core earnings drivers of the business. Mortality bounced back to normal in the quarter. We are seeing both, mortality and lapse rates were unfavorable rates run favorable to our pricing assumptions.
Fixed margins remained steady helped by investment strategies deployed last year to lock in higher yielding assets. Also contributing, was a solid quarter of alternative investment returns.
Normalized spreads are running at around 190 basis points and have been fairly consistent over the last few quarters. In our Group Protection business, our non-medical loss ratio came in at 76%, above what we experienced last quarter, and above our long range expectations in the low 70% range.
The increase was primarily due to elevated long term disability lost ratios, life ratios recovered as expected in the period.
Poor disability results were driven primarily by unfavorable incidents into a lesser degree, claim termination experience. We believe economic conditions are playing a role and see no concentrations that suggest underwriting issues.
We expect ratios to recover in time, but are likely to remain elevated for the remainder of the year. Net earned premium continues its strong trend, up about 8% over last year's quarter. Premium growth rates benefiting from consecutive periods of strong sales results and improved retention and persistency rates. We expect year-over-year premium growth rates to remain the high single digit area.
I want to spend a few minutes to address some of the concerns over the current low interest rate environment and its impact on our core insurance businesses.
Let me be clear at the start. A prolonged period of historically low rates is not healthy for our business fundamentals in isolation. However, we long ago recognized this threat and have been proactive in our investment strategies, our product designs, including crediting rate actions and overall asset liability practices to defend against this type of environment.
The bottom line is, we see a prolonged low rates scenario is having a relatively modest drag to near-term earnings. We see little in the way of near-term capital implications and we do not see interest rates in isolation as a driver of goodwill impairment across our businesses.
In time, there could be a one-time impact related to revising our prospective yield assumption supporting intangibles, but again, at manageable levels.
To provide further detail, let's look at the estimated financial impact assuming new money rates, currently running about 75 basis points below our portfolio yields, remain in place through 2012.
The earnings drag from spread compression in our retirement business is modest and largely concentrated in Defined Contribution. There is little impact expected on individual annuities.
For some time now, new products have been sold with very low minimum crediting floors and we apply disciplined ALM standards locking in spreads on these products at the time of issue.
The risk in the individual annuities business is more sharp rising rates, we managed this risk by selling market value adjusted product and through the purchase of derivative protection.
Defined Contribution experiences more of an impact, a function of higher guarantee crediting rates and reoccurring premiums.
Assuming our two-year low rate scenario and looking at our annuities and Defined Contribution business in total, we would expect very little earnings impact in 2011 and $10 million to $15 million of annualized earnings impact in 2012.
In our Group business, the impact is also not material. The combination of lower portfolio yields and adjustments to reserve discount rates having an estimated annualized earnings impact in the $5 million range.
In our Life segment, the stress on earning is more pronounced, but has been reduced by proactive strategies to lock in long dated and high yielding assets. We moved quickly to put idle liquidity to work after last year's capital raising efforts and executed on strategies that allowed us to effectively pre-buy attractive assets in anticipation of future flows and maturing securities.
In fact, we do not need to purchase a single asset in support of universal life secondary guarantee portfolios until mid-2011.
Under our two-year low rate scenario, we estimate the combination of spread compression, DAC unlocking and building reserves would combine to impact annualized earnings by about $35 million in 2011 and $50 million in 2012.
As noted a few quarters ago and in our disclosures, we are currently reviewing all of our life models as part of converting to a new valuation system. Included in this work is a review and harmonization of methodologies across all blocks of our Life business along with our traditional prospective DAC assumption testing
Under our two-year low rate scenario, Life portfolio yields drop on average only 5 to 10 basis points per year, a result of our investments and ALM strategies. If you assume for example, a 50-basis point reduction in our long-term yield assumption, the expected earnings impact from unlocking at adoption would be in the $50 million range.
It's important to note, that we are taking a level of DAC unlocking along the way, which helps to contain this number and we look at all gross profit assumptions in our prospective reviews.
It is often the case that we adjust multiple and at times offsetting estimates such as lapse rates and mortality.
On goodwill assigned to the life business, the valuation is more to core franchise issues such as new business growth and returns, mix of business and distribution strength.
Goodwill is also sensitive to discount rates applied to the new business. While threats to future profitability can theoretically push up the discount rate, a drop in the risk free rates will also lower the cost of capital applied to the business.
Our current disclosures therefore provide sensitivities to both, discount rates and new business generation and do not isolate interest rates. We are pleased with the overall health of the franchise and our second quarter results continue to improve that out.
It is however; fair to say that while economic conditions remain fragile, we will need to monitor the health of the franchise and potential movements in conventional discount rates applied to this business.
Finally on capital, the review of our cash flow testing results could withstand a 50 basis point drop in portfolio yields and still be considered sufficient under both, regulatory and our internal cash flow testing standards.
We have cushion to weather the current low rate environment in both, our aggregate life reserves and those reserves backing universal life with secondary guarantees.
So to wrap this up for you, should new money investment yields remain at their current low levels for two years, we would experience a moderate drag to earnings more so in 2012, and mostly in our Life segment.
We see little risk to near-term capital dynamics and in the event we believe prudent to unlock our perspective yield assumptions on DAC and VOBA, the one-time impact is manageable.
Finally, we do not see interest rates in isolation as a driver of goodwill impairment and believe our Life franchise to be solid and building.
Dennis touched on capital in his comments, and you are all well aware of the series of transactions that we undertook in the last quarter. Our insurance subsidiaries remain in a strong position with RBC ratio estimated in the 500% range, this after sending a dividend of $275 million up to the holding company during the quarter.
We currently sit with about $800 million in net liquidity at the holding company, well above our stated policy of holding 12 to 18 months of cash flow needs.
The combination of our $550 million tenure letter of credit executed in 2009, our new credit facility allowing for $1.5 billion of letters of credit out to 2016 and this quarter's $500 million 30-year universal life transaction place our reserve funding needs in solid position.
General account conditions continue to improve. Impairments are down significantly and our unrealized gain position increased to $3 billion in pre-tax.
Capital charges associated with our general account holdings have stabilized and with the average and with the average credit quality improving, we are seeing a modest reversal of the ratings migration impact experienced in 2008 and 2009.
We continue to position our general account portfolio in a defensive mode recognizing economic conditions remain volatile.
Overall, strong capital position with significant financial flexibility as we monitor market conditions for the remainder of 2010.
Now let turn it back to Dennis for some closing comments.

With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for question.

With that 34% decline does it really triggers an analysis inside the company and particularly focus is on where do we think markets are going forward
If we think they are going to recover, because there was a relatively acute short-term issue then we may not unlock. So if you think it's going to be persistently low markets then we would unlock as we did in the late in 2008. Interestingly, right now if you were to unlock our corridor to the mean of the estimate we would book a pre-tax gain in about a $150 million, so that gives you a little bit of idea of where we are in terms of relative to the center of the corridor.

That kind of analysis would be correct.
If you look at the secondary guarantee universal life block itself, that analysis really has more to do with the lock-in of that premium is locked in. The lock-in of that cost to the policyholder is locked in, and there's less for the company to do about that. That also allows us as Fred has mentioned, to design it in a way that allows us to invest very long because there is no optionality either in that policyholders [back arsenal] and therefore if we can lock-in long rate, that mitigates the impact of the low interest rate environment for acute period, say two years as we've talked about.

In the annuity business for example, we're really in very good position. There's really only roughly 30%, 35% of our business is at the minimum guarantee levels and we've got some 90 basis points or so of room between the average crediting rate and minimum crediting rate guarantees and that's impart while we are able to more proactively manage the onset of spread compression in that business with a little to no effect. There are other reasons too namely ALM, mechanics and so forth.
When you get the DC business, that's a bit of a different story. We have upwards of 80% of the block of business traveling at the minimum guarantee rate and more like 20 to 25 basis points of room between crediting rate, average crediting rate and minimum guarantee, so you have less room and that's impart why under a reducing portfolio yield environment you'll suffer a bit more spread compression in the out years in the DC business.
On the life side, it's a very similar dynamic with better than 80% of the book traveling at minimum guarantee, so lets flexibility to adjust crediting rates, and more like 15 to 20 basis points maybe 17 or so basis points of room between crediting rates and minimum guarantees on an average. So that's impart why you'd see under our two-year down interest rate scenario more spread compression impact in both DC and of course on the life side.

We have broken down as you can imagine the disability loss ratio climb, it was running at about 76% or so, which is about 5 or so percentage points north of what we would otherwise plan on a stabilize basis.
We believe it's attributable largely to the economic cycle and I'd say cycle because we believe some of the early shock to the economy wasn't part resulting in stronger loss ratios for a period of time as people resisted going out on disability out of fear of potential job loss or job elimination.
As things stabilized and employments levels albeit lower stabilize a move back to people maybe going on disability more proactively. In some respects this could be viewed as a reversion to the mean, meaning that for a several quarters we were running below our plan loss ratio expectations in the mid-to-high 60% range for example and this to some degree is playing out as you would expect over the long run and that now we're running a bit higher, but looking back over the last couple of years we have been running around our planned levels.
That's in part why we believe, we're confident that these ratios will come back in line in time, it probably remain elevated for the remainder of the year, would be our expectation, but come back in line over time.

The dynamic movement of lapse rates surrounding our block of business per se as it relates to interest rates and isolation. The life business in general I would tell you that lapse rates have been running better than our pricing assumptions for a while now.
In fact, particularly where they can be more sensitive is in the UL secondary guarantee business, where we have been running on the UL block in total we have been running around 5 or so percent type lapse rates. I think on those secondary guarantee businesses maybe in the 4%, right on the 4% territory, that is quite a bit higher than what we price that, as we have talked about before we typically reduced substantially the secondary guarantee lapse rate assumptions in our pricing often times traveling between 1% and 2%, for example on those policies that are running out of account value and going into guaranty if you will, we zero it out completely, when we are thinking about the pricing.
So, that gives you some color on the lapse rate experience. It's been going favorable and that's in part why I noted that when you look at long-term assumptions and you think about intangibles and profitability, you have to be very careful about isolating one single margin contribution to assess the financials. It's not uncommon for other elements of the profit drivers to be cooperating and doing better than our pricing and best serving as an offset to the issues.

The lower lapse rate maybe not the first version to the industry put out, as you begin to understand this product you get better and better probably understand the economics of a product always, but for the majority of the business it really does come down to very low lapse rate and in fact, we are experiencing higher lapse rate than that.
So, from that you can take that up. From the rest of the book of business the universal life book and that's all over the board. This goes back to the 1980s, some of this business. So, there is a lot of different assumptions in there, but I go back also what Fred said, which is in total lapse rates continue to track better than expectation and each quarter to 5% number.

I think our preference would be to wait and understand what the full context of the adoption is, the timing of it to be able to better assess its impact on our business.
I think back in June I was asked question in general about this topic at the S&P conference and I answered largely same way I do here and that is, at the end of the day we price our product and we think about the embedded value of the business that we are putting on in terms of the appropriate pricing of the cash flows in the future and the risk adjusted pricing of those cash flows. That's where we focus our attention. That's what we sell each and every day and that's what has really the greatest impact on the degree to which we are adding value or not.
The accounting is something that's a reality and we've got to deal with it, and it could give rise to some volatility upon adoption, but at the end of the day the amortization of DAC, the DAC concept in general is an earnings recognition timing issue in general and as long as we think we are putting good economic business on the books, which we do, we think it will work itself out. So, that's bit of an overarching comment I realize, but we simply have to watch this work before we get into more specifics.

The bad news on isolating lower interest rates is that, it brings about the prospects of weaker, forward looking earnings or volatility in earnings, which would suggest for any business of the need to apply higher discount rate, but because we are talking largely about treasuries, when we think about interest rates, we also see the risk free rate dropping and the cost of capital assign to that business dropping, and that provides a downward pressure to the discount rates.
I think it has been pointed out by a few in the analytical community you may even need to start in time, thinking about the new world order of ROEs, when assessing the lower cost of capital that comes with a persistently low risk free rate of return. That's a little bit of the dynamic that plays into the notion of discounting a business, particularly a business that's a low data business, and is stable as the life operations, does appears to potentially more volatile return scenario on the VA business or equity market driven businesses. So, it's a push and pull as the answer, which made me more difficult to judge.

I'd say that we all having some respects slightly different blocks of business, which require a little deeper understanding small case versus middle and large case, different industry concentrations. For example, we have a fairly large educational concentration in our business, which is normally stable, but as we now all know reading a newspapers, we are seeing teachers being let go more and more and so that all the sudden is becoming a more riskier occupation as it relates to that.
So, there are different dynamics as you really dig into the details of your block, and I think what companies are doing as they are trying to do the best they can to assess what's driving it.
In our case, we've seen incidence pop-up, which we believe to be combination of reverting back to the mean having enjoyed unusually low loss ratios for period of time and the economy. We have also seen the termination rates on our business also slow down a bit, which has to do with really claims management and administration and these types of issues that's a lesser issue for us, but that's involving just good stable claims management work, which we are going to look at and we think we can make some improvements in that respect.
So, there are some actions you can take as a management team, but you are correct, you will see a different rate from different companies, but I think that gets into diving a couple of layers down in the block.

So, I mentioned in my comments that we are currently in a position, where our actual asset values, derivative asset value supporting the reserves on this business are pretty substantially in excess of the statutory capital requirement. In fact, north of $0.5 billion in excess of that statutory requirement.
For Lincoln, that doesn't come true in our risk-based capital, because we effectively house those capital dynamics as you've mentioned in a captive reinsurance vehicle. For those companies that have it on their balance sheet, they may see some pumping up, if you will, of their statutory capital by virtue of that dynamic.
What it does provide me is a great deal of comfort that what we are very unlikely to see is any sort of capital call to our holding company in support of the VA business. In fact quite the opposite if we remain in these low interest rate environment.
Something that relates to our interest rate discussion that you should all be mindful of is that we have a substantial amount of floor protection on your balance sheet as it relates to just running our VA hedge program, when thinking about statutory. So while the low interest rate environment creates some capital dynamics and earnings dynamics on the life insurance side, it can when it's in the tail scenario provide a real booster in terms of asset values relative to statutory capital needs for your VA business and provide somewhat of an offsetting level of comfort. So that would be kind of the statutory dynamic.
Now what I would be careful about this of course this is a quarter's worth of experience in the capital markets and those capital markets move around and we are not ""spending that excess capital"" right?
It's there to support the economic view of the hedge program not just the statutory view, but what I'm pleased about is, even on an economic basis, our hedge assets are traveling a $200 million north of the actuarial calculation liability, so we are simply in good shape on both fronts.

Secondly for Fred, I appreciate the interest in DAC discussions. On annuities, when you're talking about whether or not you have to adjust DAC, and how much of the market could drop?
I was wondering how lapse has factored into that, because if I am thinking in my own VA contracts, I think they are about 35% of the money at the end of second quarter and it would seem to me when they are that deep assume lapse is on your VA business and are also essentially pretty much going to zero.

While on the secondary guarantee UL, we have with new products taking care of the need to have a capital solution, the term insurance we sell still requires the capital solution.

If over time, we're traveling down towards 400 basis points of RBC as we targeted and I say over time in a sense that we as well as people who look at us such as the rating agencies want to see little more stability and then with our guideline of holding 18 months of cash at the holding company.
If you take the 400 and you take that second criteria, we're $1.7 billion or so in capital above those levels. So we have ample capital to redeploy over time and again, not immediately but over time. So that can provide a good kick. Then, the third one which is consistent with this is just that we do want to diversify away from the life business and businesses that have higher ROEs and over time I think we can do that. Then, fourth, and this is more modest but still, it's a factor, it's the disciplined expense management that will drive some incremental ROE over time. So it's really those four things.

So it's driven by the equity markets and it's driven by flows and performance in the underlying funds, everything that drives an account value, we tend to think about it as being primarily an equity market type prospective view, but it's really an account value driven.
Fortunately, what's helped us out over the years really is we have been steadily producing positive flows and actually the underlining performance of our separate account funds has really outperformed in market industries as well in recent years which has helped us well. Separate and apart from that are our lapse rate assumptions and when you are thinking about the prospective work we do on the annuities, we also have to contemplate all drivers as you point out including lapse rates.
In that particular case, we dynamically view the lapse rates similar to what we were doing on stochastic basis, such that if we believe there to be a risk in-the-moneyness as you've pointed out, then we would also expect just what you are saying and that is lapse rates to drop significantly.
Looking at our lapse rates, it is kind of interesting; we have seen our lapse rates in the last year, across our entire and annuity block go for about a little over 8%, to down around 7%, and at first blush I would have thought that to be driven by just what you are saying, in the moneyness, on these variable annuity guarantees particularly death benefit guarantees and the like, but actually we have seen variable annuity lapse rates remains fairly steady, year-over-year, at about 7% where we are seeing improvement in lapse rates over where retention is on our equity index annuities and fixed annuities which is a good guide, relative to our assumptions, keeping that on.
We have interestingly seen a level of lapsation of in the money death benefits for example, are in the money guarantees, living benefits and death benefits, we think it's very low, it's in the couple percent range, but even that some what surprises us, from what we would expect, but we think that is again driven by economic conditions, where you have the ware results to wait it out, you are going to wait it out, and take a look at that, as an added benefit or guarantee or rather you would expect to capitalize on that in the future, but if you are need of cash and capital now, we have people, just as they tap, they define contribution plan unwisely, they also need to tap their annuities at times for cash flow, we think that is in part, what is driving it.
So, overall, we are comfortable with it, but yes to your point, we dynamically stress the lapse rates just as you pointed out.

So be careful in your views on that. I think that's a good rational statement.
For example, just in the second quarter alone, we saw a period of time where the stock was trading up in the low 30s and if you add a control premium to that which any company would expect, you're all of the sudden in that book value and it's really hard to kind of take a look at your stock price at any moment in time and render a long-term judgment about the valuation of your business.
It is true that I would say, that if your stock price remains below book for persistent period of time what that will typically do is trigger the need to go ahead and do just what you're saying which is a further analysis of your business including outright appraisals. In fact we did do that back not this past year but previous year and brought in for example, I believe it was [Milliman] to assist management and of course working with our auditors on outright doing a full fledged appraisal of our life business including stressing all of the mechanics associated with goodwill impairment on that business and of course we came out of that analysis feeling as if the certainly the business and its franchise was every bit worth what was stated on our books.
So, we will take it in another step, and part of what pushes you into that additional step is in fact your share price remaining low, but I'd be very careful about that sort of mark-to-market environment as opposed to the long-term appraisal of the cash flows involved and you also have to be very mindful of the mechanics of what's driving your stock price up and down and whether or not that in fact relates to the long-term valuation you think you are driving in your business.

We typically, in the October timeframe, start into a full fledge review of goodwill across all of our businesses, somewhat in time for the annual audit process. Again, if we are traveling through second quarter or first quarter or third quarter and we see something that has really acutely affected the business and its franchise then we may be forced into looking at the valuation more specifically.

Our third quarter sales, net flows and operating results reflect the year's continuing positive trends and are attributable to our core franchise strength, including strong distribution, innovative",1439,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning to all of you on the call. Our third quarter sales, net flows and operating results reflect the year's continuing positive trends and are attributable to our core franchise strength, including strong distribution, innovative and well-priced products, the consistent market presence, expense discipline and risk management.
As you have seen, the quarter's earnings had several assumptions and model related impacts which Fred will cover.
Looking at our operating performance, sales and net flows accounted for about half of the 10% increase in our record-setting ending account balances of $150 billion, again, reflecting the effectiveness of our franchise and our commitment to consistency, product distribution support and service over market cycles.
Consistency enhances profitability and distribution relationships. Our distribution system is among the largest and most diversified in the industry, and our ability to execute the model efficiently creates value to the enterprise across all three platforms, wholesale, retail and worksite.
At Lincoln Financial Distributors, we continue to focus on increasing productivity and reducing cost. We saw meaningful year-over-year growth in wholesaler productivity, up 11% and a growing number of advisors recommending our products, up 60% to more than 48,000 advisors in the first nine months of year.
In addition, strategic distribution expansion efforts, which include introducing new products to distribution partners and adding new partners like banks are responsible for 17% of sales over the past two years. This is a clear measure of how we are maximizing the size and scope LFD to spur top-line growth and drive a diverse mix of business efficiently.
Lincoln Financial Network continues to attract and retain seasoned advisors. The number of active LFN advisors is up again this quarter by almost 100 net new advisors to a total approaching 8,000. Our experience shows that consumers remain risk-averse, but are seeking professional advice and security in greater numbers as they rebuild their savings. And LFN is well positioned to take advantage of these trends.
Both LFN and LFD ran within pricing in the quarter. This reflects a significant improvement at LFD where we have evolved the model to focus on productivity rather than headcount increases over the past two years.
Finally, we are making good progress in our goal to increase productivity in our worksite sales and service organizations. During the quarter we updated enrolment capabilities in our group benefits business, and announced a new partnership to enhance our recordkeeping and web technology in our defined contribution business.
Life insurance sales were up 2% over the prior year quarter, fueled by a strong increase in our Lincoln MoneyGuard, UL long term care linked benefit product. We are the industry leader for hybrid solutions with Lincoln MoneyGuard, and expect our momentum to continue as a growing number of consumers look for more flexible ways to plan for and fund their retirement needs.
The introduction this quarter of DurationGuarantee UL, our new limited coverage guaranteed Universal Life product was well received by advisors and distribution partners. This was a product that combines the flexibility and guarantees of Universal Life with the affordability of term insurance, and we expect the product to make a meaningful contribution to Life sales in coming quarters.
In anticipation of the opportunities that will arise with the likelihood of more clarity around state taxes in 2011, we will introduce new pricing on our guaranteed survivorship UL product early next year, reflecting a lower interest rate environment while maintaining our historical value proposition that has made us an industry leader in this space.
Variable annuity sales were up 11%, while fixed annuity sales were dampened by the weak interest rate environment, thus driving our overall annuity sales down slightly from a year ago. As market conditions change, the versatility of our products and our distribution teams allow us to pit it to the right solution for our clients. Recognizing the need to continue to balance competitive positioning with sound financial and risk management discipline, we are launching refreshed versions of our patented i4LIFE Advantage immediate income solution, as well as our guaranteed withdrawal benefits lifetime income advantage in the fourth quarter.
We are increasing pricing on both solutions and making other changes to increase capital efficiency, while maintaining consistency for our distribution partners and value to the customer. Capitalizing on our leadership in designing hybrid product offerings, we expect that the rollout of our fixed annuity long-term care linked benefit products in November will further differentiate our annuity portfolio, much like Lincoln MoneyGuard's differentiated by life insurance portfolio. This will be followed by a variable offering in early 2011.
Total deposits in our defined contribution business were up 14% over the year-ago period, benefiting from both new case sales and renewal deposits. Helping drive our strength in renewal flow was an increase in average contributions for individual participants, possibly a sign of growing confidence after the disruption of the financial crisis.
The business is inherently lumpy and we lost a few large cases this quarter due to client consolidation as well as some competitive pressure. We are making significant investments in technology and intermediary and worksite distribution to continue to grow and retain the business.
Sales in our group benefit business were down from last year, although both traditional group and voluntary sales were up modestly over the second quarter. The team continues to position the company to take advantage of the growing trend toward voluntary benefits with the launch of a new accident product in August.
I'd like to pause here for a moment to address non-medical loss ratios, which remained elevated in the quarter, primarily due to higher disability incidents. We've been in this business for many years now, and we know that loss ratios fluctuate. The business has outperformed for most of the last decade, and the last two years have been particularly strong years with loss ratios well below our expectations. In short, we expect a recovery in profitability based on our experience.
At the same time, we are studying the situation closely to isolate any contributing factors and take action as needed. We see nothing in pricing or underwriting that is negatively affecting loss ratios and the elevated incidents was spread across all issue years, size (bands) and industries. We are experiencing elevated case flows, however, so we have brought in additional resources to manage the increased volume, rolling out more case management training and new tools to improve outcomes and support claimants as they return to work.
What isn't changing is our approach to the market, our risk management discipline to effectively balance both top-line and bottom line growth and our flexibility to adjust pricing as we monitor this elevation in incidents. This is a very good business for us, and again, we are confident that we can bring loss ratios back into line over the next several quarters.
Now a little bit about the balance sheet. We continue to hold significant levels of capital and liquidity with an estimated risk-based capital ratio in our Life subsidiaries above 500%, and nearly $800 million in cash at the holding company. I believe the 500% plus RBC is qualitatively somewhat stronger this quarter than in previous quarters based in part on a slowly improving economy, and an unrealized gain position in our investment portfolio of $5 billion, which should to some degree point toward lower credit loss expectations.
Low interest rates and our decision to invest cash in mid-2009 at good returns also explain the unrealized gain position. Our increased confidence in our excess capital position contributed to our decision to purchase $48 million of warrants this quarter.
Now, before I turn the call over to Fred, I do want to comment on macroeconomic factors very quickly. First and foremost, we believe that we are well positioned from an operational and capital position to sustain solid footing in almost any realistic economic scenario.
With respect to today's conditions, we took proactive steps to address the balance sheet headwinds of lower interest rates this quarter. Importantly, macroeconomic events are also creating tailwinds for us, witnessed our end of period or comp value growth this quarter.
Company wide gross operating revenues climbed 9% year-to-date compared to the year-ago period, reflecting both tailwinds and headwinds. Our job as always is to drive that number higher organically while bringing top-line success to the bottom line, and I am confident that we have the right tools to make meaningful progress on this front.
At our upcoming investment conference, we will focus on actions management will take to further drive top-line growth, strengthen an already strong franchise and improve earnings.
Now let me turn the call over to Fred.

During the quarter, we completed our model review project and annual prospective assumption review. In addition, we booked estimates for the impact of our valuation system conversion in the retirement segments.
Focusing on the model review work, this was a significant undertaking launched late last year, and I am very pleased with the outcome. While resulting in the few line item adjustments, the overall impact on income from operations was negligible in the quarter.
The more significant impact came as a result of our annual review of long-term actuarial assumptions guiding DAC amortization and reserving. As is always the case, there were offsetting items. However, the most notable impact to the operating earnings was an adjustment to our long term portfolio yield assumption in the Life segment.
I'll spend more time on this specific assumption change in a moment. Looked at in total, the model work valuation systems conversion and change in actuarial assumptions had a negative $72 million or $0.22 per share impact on the quarter's operating income.
If you adjust for all the notable items in our press release, including tax benefits and negative mortality, our run rate earnings came in at around $0.86 a share. This makes no adjustment for unfavorable loss ratios, which we expect to recover somewhat in the fourth quarter.
Net income per share of $0.75 benefited from mark-to-market gains on investments. Gross losses and impairments on general account investments came in at $65 million pre-tax, offset to a small degree by realized gains in the quarter. Concentrations included RMBS and select corporate bond holdings.
Mark-to-market adjustments, which included our credit-linked notes, credit default swaps and certain training portfolios combined to generate a $106 million of pre-tax gains in the quarter. These gains were driven by spreads coming in on corporate CDS and declining interest rates.
The underlying hedge program performed as expected, generating gains as volatility recovered in the quarter. These gains were offset by the unhedged FAS 157 adjustment. There are other items that ran through our hedge results but have little impact on earnings. Hedge assets continue to track in excess of our GAAP liability, and comfortably above our statutory reserve needs.
Turning to the segment results, and starting with annuities, our results continued to benefit from increased average account values, up $1 billion from the second quarter. Market appreciation, together with $1.3 billion of positive flows resulted in ending account values exceeding $80 billion for the first time in our history.
The sharp increase in account values was the principle driver of improvement in segments' run rate earnings. In fact, October average separate account values are up 8% over third quarter levels.
We sit comfortably towards the favorable end of our DAC corridor, which guides our prospective account value assumptions. Unlocking our corridor assumption today would result in a $270 million pre-tax gain in our annuity business.
Another way to think about this is our current assumption calls for a roughly 15% immediate drop in separate account returns, followed by an annual recovery of 9% going forward. In short, we are comfortable with our current annuity DAC assumptions.
Fixed margins were stable during the quarter with normalized spreads of 200 basis points, consistent with the last several quarters. We do not see signs of spread compression in our annuity business.
Turning to our defined contribution business, a solid quarter overall with stable account values in the period. We booked an $11 million gain, reflecting the impact of converting to our new valuation system, a result of a more granular approach to estimating gross profits.
Fixed margins and spreads held up nicely in the quarter with normalized spreads approaching 230 basis points, a result of crediting rate actions taken in the third quarter with additional moves planned on the fourth quarter as a result of a low interest rate environment.
This is obviously a noisy quarter in our Life segment, a result of completing the bulk of our model work in this area and adjustment to our prospective assumptions. There were two overarching areas of adjustments we made during the quarter. First, we modeled refinements which had little net impact on our results, but more significant on a line item basis.
The second area of adjustment's focused on our annual prospective assumption review. We had adjustments related to surrender, mortality and premium persistency assumptions which taken together had a $33 million positive impact on the segments earnings. This was more than offset by a change to our new money investment yield assumptions which alone negatively impacted the segments results by $114 million. There were other less material adjustments, but these are the more significant ones.
Focusing on portfolio yields, the revised assumption embeds current new money investment yields, expected cash flows, and actions we have taken to defend portfolio yields. Portfolio yields are currently hovering around 6%. Our assumption shows results in those yields falling over the next five years and not recovering back to current levels until 2020. We assume new money rates will recover only gradually over several years, arguably a conservative position, but prudent given current markets. Recognizing this as an adjustment guided by our best estimates, we believe the move lowers the risk profile of our future Life earnings.
Turning to mortality, gross mortality was fairly stable and where we would expect in the quarter. The issue was where mortality occurred, namely on blocks of business with less reinsurance in place, recognizing our retention limits in reinsurance programs differ by block of business. This was an unusual outcome, and we don't believe it to be indicative of expected mortality margins looking forward.
Fixed margins remained steady, helped by investment strategies deployed last year to lock in higher yielding assets. Normalized spreads are running at around 190 basis points and have been fairly consistent over the last few quarters.
Before leaving the Life segment and understanding the challenge in modeling our results, our underlying earnings drivers remained healthy and we expect to return to historical run rate earnings levels in the fourth quarter in the $150 million range.
In Group Protection, our non-medical loss ratio came in at 79%; 78% when adjusting for the lowering of our reserve discount rate, but still up from the already elevated levels experienced in the second quarter. Dennis commented on our review of loss ratio developments, so I'll not add to his comments. Poor disability results were driven primarily by unfavorable incidents which also impacted life loss ratios.
We expect loss ratios to remain elevated relative to our long term expectations, but recovering in the fourth quarter to the 75% to 77% range. As a reminder, every one percentage point of loss ratio is about $2.5 million of earnings in a given quarter.
Net earned premium continues at strong trend, up about 9% over last year's quarter, with premium growth rates benefiting from improved retention.
I want to refresh last quarter's interest rate sensitivity analysis to reflect a more severe scenario of new money rates, which are currently running about 100 basis points to 125 basis points below portfolio yields, remaining in place through 2012, said differently, freezing the ten-year treasury at 2.5% for the next two years.
The earnings drag from spread compression in our retirement business is largely concentrated in defined contribution as well as impacting individual annuities. Looking at our defined contribution business, we would expect an annualized earnings impact in the range of $5 million in 2011 and $15 million in 2012, entirely spread compression driven.
In our Life segment we benefit in the short run by the proactive investment strategies we detailed last quarter. As noted in our comments, we do not need to purchase a single asset in support of our UL secondary guarantee portfolio until mid-2011.
Under our two-year low rate scenario, we estimate an impact of about $25 million in 2011, and $45 million in 2012. These numbers appear similar to what we disclosed last quarter, but are skewed towards pure spread compression as the quarterly DAC unlocking and reserved build is reduced by our prospective assumption change this quarter.
The Group business would be impacted to a lesser degree. We would expect an annualized impact to this segment's earnings up to $5 million a year.
Timing and capital; we continue to believe cash flow (capital) will result in no material impact to capital and reserve levels. We hold considerable excess capital in our insurance companies, should test and dictate modest reserve strengthening, and do view interest rates as a near term capital issue to manage.
Turning more specifically to overall capital conditions, our insurance subsidiaries remain in a strong position with an RBC ratio in excess of 500% and just under $800 million in net liquidity at the holding company.
We estimate our capital margin to be approximately $1.9 billion if serving for a 400% RBC at the insurance company level and approximately $250 million above our holding company idle liquidity target of $500 million. As a result of improved capital conditions, we repurchased $48 million of our warrants participating in the U.S. Treasury auction process in September.
The purchase had little impact on our diluted share count in the third quarter. We estimate the repurchase would have about a $1.5 million share equivalent impact next quarter. This, holding all else equal, namely share price.
General account conditions continue to improve. Our unrealized gain position increased over $5 billion pre-tax. Capital charges associated with our general account holdings have stabilized with positive trends and overall credit quality. Impairments, while improved from 2009 levels, ticked up a bit related to a few select securities, but we would expect this number to come back down in future quarters.
Overall, a strong capital position as we monitor market conditions for the remainder of 2010 and entering 2011.
Now let me turn it back to our Operator to start the Q&A session.

So the actual assumption we changed was our new money investment rate assumption and that new money rate assumption expectation over the next several years. And what we did is, we dialed that down to our current experience in investing new cash flows across our life insurance portfolios. And then we only gradually increased that over several years back up to approaching our current portfolio levels.
When taking that kind of a severely reduced new money rate assumption over time, that has the effect of dragging down our portfolio yields over the next 5 to 7 years then slowly recovering on back up around 2020. What ends up happening is you see a bleed down in portfolio yields of around 25 to 30 basis points over time and then a gradual recovery. Part of the reason for that relatively slow drop-down in portfolio yields and gradual rise is the fact that these are fairly long duration portfolios, so you only have so much rolling off each year into those new money assumptions.
Also recognize all of the actions we've taken to lock in our forward buy, much of that high yield environment which serves to moderate the near term reduction in portfolio yields over time. So overall, we think, and you can obviously argue on whether or not we're being overly conservative in our approach to the new money rate. But what we felt was prudent here was recognizing an additional 50 basis point drop in rates since the third quarter. We are viewing our reinvestment strategies in the portfolios throughout the quarter, and recognizing that conditions suggest there could be a more sustainable low rate environment, we simply felt it was prudent to go ahead and make this move.
And also note that the size of the impact was a bit larger than what we had talked about under our assumption of 50 basis points in the past quarter. Well what's very important to understand is, it's not so much that ultimate assumption, although that plays a role; it's really the path of your assumption over time and the fact that we really dropped that ultimate portfolio assumption fairly significantly by taking this low new money rate environment and stringing it out more slowly over time.

What we're talking about here today in terms of earnings impact is more to do with in-force.

When we look at the cost associated with securitizing or financing reserves on the business and how that plays into the future profitability or returns, we have pricing power in the marketplace which has a lot to do with your market share which is significant at Lincoln.
All those things play into your views of this cash flow. If any of those things wee to go negative on you, it becomes more expensive to reserve for the products, capital costs increase beyond your assumptions, sales fall off, if those things start to happen, that's where you'll see sensitivity around goodwill.
I guess I'd call it more subjective element is once you have isolated those cash flows which really need to be proven out in your experience, particularly your recent experience, once you've settled in on that, you need to go about the business of discounting those cash flows.
And as I mentioned last quarter, there is good news and bad news on that front. Certainly if the view of the risk profile of the business has increased, you'd suggest a higher risk premium and a higher discount rate applied to the business. However, given the risk free rate environment has dropped so significantly, that has a counterbalancing or offsetting pressure, lowering discount rates.
You're starting to see a little bit of that even in some of the transactions that have taken place in the industry, although there is not a lot of great examples. And so that will go back and forth, and it's not necessarily a bad thing in terms of the industry environment. But what we'll guide you there is a reasonable expectation for discount rates applied to your business. Comparables in the market will guide your thinking.
And as we mentioned before, the reason why you do additional testing on your goodwill when your stock is trading at a discounted book is because of suggestion in that is there is a higher discount rate being applied to certain businesses. And so you've got to go that extra step of really analyzing on a segment by segment basis.
Again, we feel comfortable with the overall conditions of the business, but we do have to go through the process of course.

Honestly, Eric, where we've been really focusing frankly is making sure that in this period of time we actually are putting in place protection against the rising interest rate which would be more detrimental to those businesses. And we've been actively putting protection on in that regard.
But also importantly is to note that with on the defined contribution business, which is really where you find most of the spread compression, it's because of relatively older business with high interest rate guarantees. And that's really where we're seeing the spread compression still select lots of business.
It just so happens to be the case that because in part of the age of that business, we have very little back asset left on those businesses that are more susceptible to spread compression. So as a matter of mechanics, there simply was less DAC to impact. Otherwise, there would be a level of impact.

The other parts of our earnings margins are made of, and at one point, it was about a third, a third, a third between equity-driven fees, and mortality, and morbidity.
So I understand again the importance and the significance of the focus on interest margins long term interest rates, but just to add to the conversation, there are tailwinds and headwinds and this represents only about a third of our earnings.

I do feel better about the quality of our excess capital position this quarter than I did a quarter ago, again for the reasons I've stated. At the same time, when I look forward, we're not completely out of the woods on a double dip recession. The rating agencies remain cautious about the industry.
Potentially although, I don't think so there's some regulatory issues that are floating around. So, yes, I am more comfortable; yes, we want to put this capital to work. We did a little bit this quarter, $48 million. We are very conscious of the concept of getting idle capital put to work, either returning it to the shareholders in some way or shape or investing it in the business.
I can just say that our confidence continues to improve, and we'll just continue to watch the environment and the opportunities that we might have.

And there may be some of you that have been around long enough to know that we had this type of a discussion with the people who were following at the time Jefferson-Pilot because, I forget, in 2004 or 2005 we saw the same type of spike.
Now let me try to parse out some of your questions. With respect to the issue of bringing more resources, that's a responsive management action to deal with, frankly more claims coming in the door and having to be managed. And so that helps us get, if you will, the claims to the right position, either off the books or keep them on the books. But even if we keep them on the books, trying to work hard to get the people back to work with either long or short term disability. So put that in the bucket. We are taking actions to deal with a larger inflow of activity. And that will subside as we get the inventory claims down. So that's one issue.
The second issue is, where is it coming from? And what I've tried to explain is that it's coming from completely across the board. So it's not new business that might have somehow been mis-priced. Again, it's from all cohorts of sales, all industries. And so that would lead us to believe that in some way, shape or form this incident spike is externally driven. So that would be another issue.
Now just to put some perspective on our incidence ratios, historically around from 3.89 to 3.9 per thousand in '09 when we had a spectacular year they were at 3.7 per thousand, and the current quarter they're at 4.1.
So now let me come back to the pricing issue. If we think that there is something that's happening externally that causes us to raise pricing, we will do that. And in fact we probably raised pricing on some of the blocks and some of our new business already in the 3% to 4% range.
So to put in perspective, we think it's predominantly externally driven. We're working very hard and adding resources to deal with the increased activity. We were watching what has been a spike, we hope temporary in nature in incidence. But if it isn't temporary in incidence, then we will be more aggressive with our future pricing. And remember, this is by and large short term pricing business so that we can get out of bad blocks and re-price it pretty quickly.

I think, Fred, you mentioned that earnings in the Life business kind of should revert back to the $150 million range.

And so I guess what I am confused about is why isn't there an ongoing earnings impact going forward, whether it's just narrower spreads, which maybe that's accounted for in the $27 million to $35 million you talked about earlier, but definitely a higher DAC amortization rate?

So for example, the interest rate change in and of itself had both the DAC impact and an SOP impact. There are other positive adjustments that were made in the period, which is commonly the case when you're reviewing all your assumptions, adjustments around mortality. For example, based on the mortality studies we've done internally, a finer more exacting approach to surrender activity and how to model that from a profit perspective.
So on a net basis, you didn't have quite as dramatic a change in some of the DAC balance related issues. You had more of a dramatic change in the SOP reserve on a net basis. So there are some implications for forward-looking earnings, but on balance, not a material degradation in the run rate expectation for the company.

It wouldn't make sense for us to have one interest rate outlook for one business and a different interest rate outlook for another. And so you can assume that we've applied this discipline across all our businesses. But that'll be very different impact based on the nature of the business.
And so as I mentioned earlier, on a fixed annuity basis, because we have ample room in our crediting rate structures and a bit more of a matched booked environment, plus obviously an ability to re-price or adjust our crediting rates very rapidly, or weekly as commonly done in the industry, we can really react quickly to low interest rates and mitigate the extent of pressure and the related DAC unlocking or assumption changes related to it.
On the variable annuity side, what's important to know, which I think is what's driving your question, is that when you're looking at separate account returns, you have both an equity return and a fixed return. And what allows us to be very comfortable is our corridor approach. You tend to want to think of that corridor as an equity market assumption, but it's really not. It's a separate account value assumption. It's what our expectations for growth in those separate account values.
And as I mentioned during my comments when I was talking about the corridor, we sit here today with an account value assumption going forward where the returns on those account values are going to drop immediately 15% and then recover very slowly at a 9% annualized rate, this is why I personally and we have grown fond of the corridor process. It does what you would expect it do.
After a series of quarter where the equity markets have been hot and rising, it would stand to reason that you would want to lower your forward-looking expectations in an environment where the markets had dropped significantly and would stand the reason that your forward expectation for market recovery will be more robust. The corridor process sort of encapsulates all of that and doesn't run our results up and down for those shorter-term movements.
And that's where it gets uncomfortable. So if your apply your low interest rate assumption to the fixed portion of the variable annuity business, that's really incorporated in the overall corridor account value approach. And we feel comfortable with it.

We did adjust our lapse rate assumption on the business, predominantly on our variable annuity business. But it didn't actually have to do necessarily within the moneyness or what would more commonly be discussed related to lapse rates on annuities. This had more to do with just a pattern of better persistency over a number of years now that has led us to bring down particularly the lapse assumption once our product is outside the surrender charts period.
And so we brought that assumption down. That had a positive DAC impact in the quarter on our annuity business. You didn't see that in the results on a net basis, because it was offset by a negative impact from our valuation conversion estimate. And so it netted out to have very little impact in the quarter, a couple million dollars of negative impact in the quarter.
So we did make adjustments to the lapse assumption. That also carries through to some adjustments made related to the hedge program that will move that around and are embedded in our results this quarter. So that's really where we worked in the lapse rate. It wasn't so much of an impact item on the fixed side.
