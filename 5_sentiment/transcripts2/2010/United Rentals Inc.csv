Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer; and other members of our senior management team. Bill will discuss our 2009 financial performance, which, as you know from",2622,"Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer; and other members of our senior management team. Bill will discuss our 2009 financial performance, which, as you know from the release, we showed a loss for the year of $0.98 per share. And that's obviously not where we want to be. But 2009 was more about controlling the things that we could control. And in that regard, our performance included numerous accomplishments.This morning, I want to spend some time on the improvements that helped us outperform almost every target that was part of our outlook. As reported last night, we reduced our SG&A expense by $101 million in 2009 year-over-year. The reduction in cost of rentals, excluding depreciation, was $227 million. Our free cash flow was very strong at $367 million. And our net rental CapEx showed a modest outflow of $31 million compared to the net zero we projected because we saw opportunities to make strategic investments in the right kinds of rental fleet. This was a solid performance. With the cost of rentals, we fell short, in part because our rental revenues were higher than we expected in the fourth quarter. Now Bill's going to go over and discuss this further in just a minute. But still, as I mentioned, we took cost of rentals down by $227 million, which is still a big number. But as you'll hear from us today, the numbers are only part of the story. I want to use our time this morning to talk candidly with you about where we're taking this company and how our strategy is intended to transform United Rentals into a company that is much better equipped to create value. It began with Operation United more than a year ago. Operation United is the foundation of our strategy that defines United Rentals as first and foremost an equipment rental company. It may instates [ph] that we continuously improve our cost structure and our fleet management on the basis of profitable growth. And it challenges us to win customer loyalty through customer service leadership. If anything, our strategy intensified in 2009 as we continued to analyze our opportunities. We're now operating with these specific objectives: First, to continue to engineer efficiencies throughout the business; second, manage our rates for the maximum return on fleet; and third, to leverage our size and to serve the right customer segments. When the economy does better, even a partial realization of these objectives would benefit our top line and bottom line. In the current environment, the impact is more modest but still apparent. For example, our rental revenues declined in 2009, but we still outperformed our peers in the first nine months. The idea of resilience is a big part of our story today. We didn't just weather 2009. We showed the financial and operational discipline to outperform the industry in an economic trial by fire. And before I move on to operations, let me tell you where we stand on 2010. Realistically, it's going to be another tough year. In our opinion, a turnaround in construction will happen sometime in the back half of 2010. But we won't see any significant improvement in our end markets until 2011. And when that happens, we think that recovery will be slow and steady. And that seems to be the consensus of the industry forecasters as well. And if the worst of the cycle is behind us, then most of the heavy lifting has been done in terms of branch closures and workforce reductions. The same goes for fleet. And we'll continue to de-fleet this year but at a slower pace. However, if the downturn drags on longer than expected, we won't hesitate to pull all the levers in our disposal. Now our plan takes the economy into account. But it's also about the optimization of our operations, branches, fleet, sales force and corporate infrastructure. Last year, we closed 64 branches and opened four specialty locations when we saw market opportunity. We also reduced our average fleet by 9% based on OEC. But if you unbundle that number, you would see investments in earthmoving, light towers and other strategic purchases. Now for us, optimization is about making sure that we have the right types of branches in the right markets, with the right fleet serving the right customers.Now I want to turn to the three objectives I mentioned a minute ago: Efficiency, rate management and customer segmentation. There is no question that we became much more disciplined with our cost in 2009. We saw that in the numbers we reported last night. Now I want to share some metrics that were not in the press release so you understand how serious we are about weeding out inefficiencies. Our repair and maintenance expense was 17% lower in 2009 than 2008. And some of that comes from decline in our fleet size. But there were also other drivers, including new technology that lets our service departments communicate in realtime with the front counter. Such a good story, especially given a fleet aged three months. And while we're spending less, we still kept our preventive maintenance currency above 90% for the year. Our OEC available for rent improved to 90.2%. So we know for a fact that we're servicing our fleet more efficiently in the shop. And equipment transfers among branches are proving to be very valuable in managing our fleet. Transfers allow us to allocate our rental CapEx more efficiently and to act quickly to capture business that might otherwise go to competitors. In 2009, we leveraged our footprint and transferred 36% of our fleet each quarter on average compared to 30% in 2008. So these are just four of many examples I could name. But we're doing a lot of things right in the field, and we have 8,000 employees to thank for that progress.Now I want to move on to the second objective: Rate management. I'm very passionate about rates because they're such a powerful force for us as a company but also as an industry. And over the last four months of 2009, our rates were essentially flat on a sequential monthly basis, which shows that we were successful at pushing back against the environment. And bear in mind that seasonality always affects our business in the winter. In 2009, market activity went deeper into the red because new projects were tailing off while existing projects were wrapping up. So the pressure on rates was coming from several different directions, but we managed that pressure aggressively.For the full year we reported last night, our rates were down 11.8%. And clearly, we're not satisfied with that number. And we're doing something about it. You could say that our approach to rate management is a mix of brains and brawn. By brains, I'm referring to our strategy and its focus on profitability that every pricing decision we make takes margin into account as well as the customer relationship. The brawn is being provided by our new price optimization program. And this is just one of the technologies that are helping us transform our business, along with sales force automation and additional changes to our branch operations.As most of you know, we put optimized baseline rates in place in all of our branches in early September, including hard stops for price exceptions. Now in a few weeks, we will review and refresh those rates. We're also testing dynamic customer-centric pricing in 10 of our branches, with plans to roll it out company-wide later this year. As part of that pilot, we've implemented new tools so that price optimization extends from the counter to the field where our sales force reps will be able to quote rates on their Blackberries. From rates to fleet to customer mix, we're looking at our business very differently than we have in the past. A transaction isn't profitable for taking all costs into account. We don't want to book that business. Our people understand that we're not trying to add to our top line at any price. The goal is to grow our revenues by using customer service to earn a premium price for our services, and even in this environment. The third, and in many ways the most important part of our transformation, has to do with customer segmentation. Earlier, I mentioned Operation United was the original initiative in our strategy. We now know for a fact that Operation United is moving us in the right direction, focusing on customers that best fit our vision for growth. These are large national accounts, as well as regional accounts, industrial accounts and to a lesser degree, Government business. And let me explain why.Our analysis has shown that large customers can be very profitable for us. We serve them properly. And they share similar characteristics. They rent equipment for longer periods of time. They pay in a more timely fashion. They return equipment with less damage. And they see our broad North American footprint as an advantage. In addition, larger accounts often prefer to place their orders to a centralized point of contact. Our customer care center in Tampa handled more than 368,000 calls in 2009 and wrote about 30,000 reservations, which helped our branch teams focus on customer service during the fulfillment process. Of the 233 national accounts we previously signed in 2009, 62 were industrial companies. This increased our national account base to more than 1,200 customers. Our national account revenue was 24% of total revenue in 2009. And our industrial account revenue was 18%, both represent a increase over prior year on a percentage basis. Also, we know that we increased our share of wallet with our top 25 customers in 2009. That tells us that even if rental demand declines again this year, we're building the right kind of customer base for long-term profitability. Customer segmentation is far more than a sales strategy for us and extends to our entire operation. For example, our fleet mix and fleet management are changing because our strategy calls for something different now. Large customers understand where our priorities lie. And it is earning us a larger share of their wallet. Like the contract we recently signed with one of the world's largest civil engineering companies, so national account who liked what they saw from us and gave us the opportunity to earn their business on a major rail project in the U.S. We won the contract because we persevered as a team at the national level, regional, district, branch and corporate. It's a perfect example of Operation United in action. At the same time, we're working to optimize our Transactional business. And by that I mean, the occasional or one-off rentals that come our way in local levels. When we get these requests, we want to make sure that we quote a price that reflects the real cost of fulfilling these transactions. The standard is met. Even a small rental has a place in our strategy. Small customers represent the potential to grow with us over time.On our last call, I gave you an overview of our customer focus scorecard, which measures branch performance in five dimensions that customers value most. These metrics are largely universal, meaning, they are important to our customers, all sizes. The scorecard was rolled out in June of 2009. So the data is relatively recent. But I want to give you a couple of metrics to illustrate how quickly we can move our field operations along the path of continuous improvement.In our Southwest region, the total response time improved by more than 15% in the fourth quarter. That's the time it takes to get a machine up and running at a customer's job site after he puts a request in for service. It's a huge deal for our customers. And in Northeast Canada, on-time delivery improved by more than 17% in the fourth quarter. This is a meaningful improvement based on real-life expectations of our customers. But we're not done yet. We believe that the customer service analytics available through our scorecard are the most comprehensive in our industry. We can track how we're doing at any level: Branch, district, region and company. And by the end of this month, we'll be able to drill down and look at how we performed for individual customers. Not just key accounts, any customer. This is the major differentiator that gives us real ammunition in the battle for customer loyalty. Even with these focused objectives, we're still keeping an open mind. Markets are never static. And the underpenetrated rental market has more potential than most. Our most profitable customer segment, five or 10 years from now, may not even be on our radar today. Or a new kind of equipment may come available with applications in completely new markets. I can tell you 30 years ago, I drove an aerial machine around to contractors who'd never seen a lift and had no intention of renting one. Today, everyone in construction has an appreciation for aerial equipment. So I know it happens.Looking back to late 2008, we stood on the brink of a downturn and decided there was no good reason to set our engine on idle when the economy turns around. We have chosen to take advantage of these volatile times by showing that we know how to steer a steady and purposeful course. And by the way, we're not the only ones acting now with an eye towards the future. We share same strategic thinking, driving large projects when we have a presence. For example, the Philadelphia Convention Center, that's a $786 million expansion with 440,000 square feet of exhibit space. And we had more than 100 aerial machines on rent with customers for over a year now. When the facility opens in 2011, it's going to give Philadelphia a huge advantage in competing for convention business. And we like that kind of thinking. But 2010 is not a new road map for us. Operation United already has us moving in the right direction. This year is about executing with increasing precision on the roadmap we already have. In January, we brought all of our branch managers and field leaders, together with senior management and Board members, at our annual meeting in St. Louis. It was an intense three days of preparation for 2010. And by the end, it was evident to our employees that are as inspired as we were about the possibilities for a new United Rentals. And I saw more than an acceptance. I saw real excitement. We're moving together, forward together, united as one, in total agreement about our goals. Let me tell you what I told our managers. This path that we're on takes courage. And it takes willpower. We've deliberately set a course that makes demands on our leadership and our willingness to innovate. Right now, the economy is working against us. But our strategy is more enduring to any environment and is being executed by a seasoned management team that brings the right mix of executive ability and industry experience to the job at hand.Every objective we set in 2010 builds on the fundamentals of Operation United. Every opportunity ties to our competitive advantages of customer service and size. And we're taking our core business to a more profitable place with the ultimate objective of creating value. And we will create that value by delivering the most efficient and customer-focused services in the equipment rental industry. And with that, I'll now pass it over to Bill who will review our results. And then we'll go to Q&A, and we'll take your questions. Bill?"

As Mike said, I'll provide more detail on our fourth quarter and full year financial results. But before I do that, I'd like to comment on the timing of this call.

But before I do that, I'd like to comment on the timing of this call. Those of you who followed the company for a while may note that this call is happening well [ph] about three weeks earlier in the month than it has historically. And I just wanted to point out that, that is the result of a tremendous amount of effort on the part of people within the finance organization here at United Rentals.Our view is that the sooner we can get through the reporting process, the sooner we're able to refocus on driving improvement in the business. And so we have set an objective of continuing to report on an earlier basis. So you'll see our annual reports happen along about this time every year going forward. You'll also see the quarterly reports happen a week sooner in that quarter than we have historically as well. This is no accident. It's a result of a lot of hard work by a lot of people in United Rentals. So I wanted to take this opportunity to say thanks to all the folks who made it happen.So let's turn our performance against the targets that we've been laying out for 2009. Starting with SG&A, as Mike noted, we delivered $101 million of SG&A reductions for the year. And that included $20 million of reduction in the fourth quarter alone. Consistent with what we saw through 2009, those saves in SG&A came in nearly every line of our SG&A total. So we had reductions in salaries, benefits, travel and entertainment, professional fees, marketing spend. Again, anywhere you look in SG&A, we had improvements.On cost of rent, excluding depreciation, we reduced costs by $227 million for the year. And that included $51 million of reduction in the fourth quarter. And like SG&A, the reductions came in virtually all lines: Salaries, benefits, delivery costs, fuel, repair and maintenance, facility costs. Again, just about every line in our cost of rentals x depreciation. Mike mentioned that, that $227 million reduction fell a little short of our target of $240 million to $250 million. Quite honestly, that was disappointing for us. But there are a number of puts and takes that happened at the end of the year that resulted in the $227 million number that I reported. Part of it's good news. The fourth quarter revenue was actually stronger than we had in our forecast when we gave the $240 million to $250 million range. Available cost that came with that stronger revenue explained part of the variance. But there are also other puts and takes in several non-cash, non-operating lines. For example, we had a $4 million adjustment in a self-insurance reserve. So between the extra revenue and the self-insurance reserve, that's the bulk of the miss versus the $240 million bottom of our range. Despite the shortfall though, $227 million of reduction is real money. And it's a result of a lot of work. So we're proud of that performance in 2009. We simplified. We streamlined. We've automated more of our rental processes. And we think there's opportunity to continue to drive cost out of this business. On net rental CapEx, we finished the year with a net outflow of $31 million, which was slightly above our target of about zero for the year. That additional CapEx reflects what we talked about in the third quarter, which was our effort to take advantage of opportunities that we see in the market and reinforce those opportunities with investment as appropriate. As Mike mentioned, the equipment that we bought during the quarter immediately was put on rent at high utilization levels. And again, that supports the extra revenue that we saw in the fourth quarter.Turning to free cash flow, we delivered $367 million of free cash flow. That was better than our target of $350 million despite having spent the incremental amount of rental CapEx. Within free cash flow, we generated $440 million of cash from our operating activities. Our ability to overachieve on free cash flow despite the additional CapEx shows that we built flexibility and to our ability to manage the company and manage the cash flow of the company. And we exercised that flexibility in the fourth quarter. You can expect us to continue to exercise that flexibility and respond to investment conditions as we go through 2010 as well.Now a few thoughts on our capital structure and liquidity. In this area, we made significant progress in 2009. As many of you are aware, in November, we issued a total of $673 million of new debt that included $0.5 billion of senior unsecured debt and another $173 million of convertible notes that we issued out of our holding company. When you combine that November activity with the $0.5 billion of 10 7/8% notes that we did in June, plus the redemption of our 14% HoldCo Notes that we did in the fourth quarter, we've substantially improved the profile of our debt maturities over the next several years. We don't have, at this point, significant maturities other than the 6 1/2% in the next several years. And as, again, many of you have noted, we've already announced that we will be calling the 6 1/2% senior unsecured notes on February 16 of this year. So that'll be $435 million worth of maturities in 2012, which will be called and removed from the maturity profile. So you put all these together and you can see that we proactively addressed the capital structure throughout 2009. We don't have any significant maturities until 2013. And the decks are very well cleared for us to be able to respond to any level of investment that we might need over the next several years.On liquidity, we continue to have a very strong liquidity position. We ended the year with over $1 billion of total liquidity. That includes $954 million of availability under our asset base loan facility, plus $169 million of cash on hand. And I just mentioned the redemption that we're going to do of the 6 1/2%, that'll eat up a part of that available liquidity. But even after redeeming the 6 1/2%, we'll still have about $700 million of total liquidity available to us. So that puts us in a very strong position for a company of this size in a cycle at this point in the cycle.A few thoughts on our fleet. We continue to manage the fleet, consistent with our fleet management strategy during the quarter. We continue to aggressively transfer fleet, as Mike mentioned, optimized the use of the capital that we have invested in fleet. So we transferred $1.4 billion of fleet in the quarter. And that represents about 36% of our overall fleet size. As Mike said, this is a nice lever that we have to address our customer needs with greater utilization rather than putting more capital into the business.At the end of December, our overall fleet age was 42.4 months. That's up a month from September. But it's still below the 43 months that we previously guided to at the end of the year. And again, that's consistent with the approach that we decided to take in managing the fleet. On a year-over-year basis, our overall fleet size was down by 9%. While on a unit basis, the OEC was down 26,000 units or 11%, again, consistent with the strategy we're taking. We wanted to size the fleet last year, appropriate to the level of demand. And we think we've done that well. So with all of that as background, let me address a few of the financial results. First on revenues, rental revenue was down 26% in the quarter. And within that, rates were down 9.6% year-over-year for the quarter. Time utilization was down 2.4 percentage points. And dollar utilization for the quarter came in at 46.0%, which is down 2.7 percentage points from the third quarter, which is a seasonally strong quarter for us. For contractor supplies, revenue was down 40% year-over-year. And that reflects our continued strategic focus on the higher margin, contract-to-supply sales, along with the overall soft operating environment. We did improve margin. Gross margin improved for the quarter by 130 basis points compared to last year. On used equipment sales, we generated $37 million of proceeds during the quarter of used equipment sales. Although that's down slightly from the third quarter, our sales were in line with our fleet strategy. And our margins were up sequentially, consistent with the trend that we saw in the third quarter.So when we put all that together with the cost performance that I talked about earlier, our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter came in at $149 million. And the margin on that EBITDA was 46.8%. And even though that's not where we want to be on a margin basis, it still allowed us to end the full year with a margin of -- excuse me, I said 46.8%, it's 26.8%. And that allowed us to end the full year with a margin of 26.6%, that, in a very challenging environment.So those are the remarks that I wanted to make on 2009. Very briefly, on 2010, we'll continue to execute the strategy that Mike mentioned. Driving efficiency is a prominent part of that. But also, the customer segmentation strategy is key as well. The environment continues to be challenging for us in terms of visibility for our outlook. And so we've chosen to continue the same level of guidance that we've given throughout 2009. And we will focus on the same metrics. So for SG&A, we expect to continue to reduce SG&A this year by another $25 million to $35 million. On cost of rent, excluding depreciation, we expect to reduce another $70 million to $90 million for the full year compared to 2009. Put those together, that's $110 million worth of additional cost reductions in 2010. And if you look back over the last couple of years, 2008 and 2009 combined have resulted to nearly $0.5 billion of total cost reduction for the company, as consistent with the strategy and certainly going to be a continuing focus in 2009.On fleet, we expect the fleet to age into the high 40s during the course of this year. But again, we don't expect any significant impact of that aging to our ability to generate revenue. We're keeping our fleet well maintained. And that's really all that matters to the customers. For free cash flow, we expect to generate $175 million to $200 million of free cash flow in the year. That will be after investing about $100 million to $120 million of net rental CapEx during the course of the year. That will also include, by the way, about $40 million of  a net cash tax refund for the year. And like in 2009, we'll use that free cash flow to pay down debt. So those are the comments on 2010. Before I open for Q&A, I just like to re-emphasize the points that Mike made. We got a clear strategy. We're focused on driving it. And we believe that we got a lot of good momentum built up. We certainly have the people to execute on the strategy. And we feel confident that we're going to make progress in a challenging environment in 2010 and position ourselves for better performance when better times come. So with that, I'd ask the operator to open up the call for Q&A. Operator?"

I would expect that on a GAAP basis, interest expense will be up slightly compared to 2009 simply because we had so many of the gains on debt repurchases that flow through interest expense in 2009. If you adjust to take out those gains and other amortization write-offs from the 2009 number, I think you're looking at interest expense being, again, just slightly down from that adjusted basis. So up slightly on a GAAP basis, let's put it that way."

So you'll have less ability to amortize fixed cost over the revenues. So that's just sort of a normal seasonal pattern for us. We did have, as I noted, greater investments in some of the fleet.

Keep in mind, you're right. We could always sell more fleet. We could spend less, if need be. And I think we've proven in 2009, that we're willing to do that if we have to. For 2010, we think that we will start to see the bottom and see some improvement. We are making some strides in some of our customers. And we see that as opportunity. So the way we look at it today, it can change, obviously. And we'll update you. But with cost, it's what we can wrap our arms around. If we get more, we'll report it, and we'll say we can do more. With regards to our spend, if demand's there, we'll spend it. If it's not there, we won't. And if we have to balance that against selling something today in the market for $0.30 or $0.40 on the dollar and say, next year, you have to spend $0.100 on the dollar.

What we said in our press release was that our fleet would end the year at $3.6 billion, as I recall. And that's down from the $37.63 billion that I just gave at the end of 2009. The average size of our fleet during 2010 will be down as a result of that. So when you look at the reduction in size of our fleet, along with an assumption around time utilization, which is -- let's just say time utilization stays flat year-over-year. That's a pretty powerful negative impact on earnings and cash flow. So that's a big chunk of that sort of missing cash flow, if you will. And then you have to look at the impact of rate. I mentioned that we've got a negative carryover effect from rate, and that's assuming that rates stay stable throughout the course of 2010. If revenues are going down, to use your 11% number, you'd have to make it some kind of assumption about how rates are going to perform in that environment. They are likely to be down. So, rate impact is very powerful in affecting cash flow as well. So the combination of the fleet and rate challenges are probably the bulk of the delta that you're trying to explain in free cash flow. There are other knits in that.

And then there's some other elements in terms of the mix of revenues that could have an impact. So those are the key missing pieces. And we've made our estimate for what 2010 is going to look like. And that's where the cash flow falls out. That makes sense to you, David?"

With me is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer, and other members of our senior management team. This morning, I want to spend some time on the external environment, also to share with you where we think we are in the cycle and then update you on the actions that we are taking for both the short term and long term, in order to move the needle towards profitable growth.
Before I get to that, first, the first quarter is always the weakest period, due to seasonality. And this period's no different. This was pushed down even further by the weather and also the economy. However, we're starting to see some positive indicators. 
The turn in the industry, as far as our cycle is concerned, was always not a question of if, it was more a question of when. And from the first days of the downturn, everybody involved here at United Rentals, from the senior management team all the way down to our employees and our front lines, have been working hard to ensure that we're in the best position to benefit in the upturn. 
Today, we're looking forward to sharing some of the specifics with you about the positive momentum that we're seeing, and the first quarter results we reported don't reflect the strategic momentum that we're gaining in the field. Rental revenue was down 15%. Now some of that was due to fleet being down by 6% on a year-over-year basis. The worst of the environment happened in January to mid-February. And then we saw a shift late in February and continue into March, and March came back stronger than we anticipated.
Time utilization in the quarter was basically flat, on a year-over-year basis, at 56.2%. Rates, however, were down 6.5%. It's not great. It's not where we want to be. We put a lot of focus on this and a lot of effort, and we're managing this everyday. However, we're still under pressure, but declines are beginning to show signs of leveling of. So we've seen a very clear positive change in used equipment pricing. Used margin in the first quarter was 31.4% versus 11.9% a year ago. Used equipment pricing is a leading indicator of where we are in the cycle.
Now turning to cost cutting. Obviously, it's a great story to talk about, particularly in the first quarter. SG&A down $22 million, cost of rent down an additional $19 million. Bill's going to go into a lot more detail and discuss our decision to raise the financial targets for both SG&A, as well as the free cash flow target for the year.
So where are we? It's fair to say that we're more optimistic than we have been for a while. We see a healthy mix of conditions driving our metrics for the first three months in 2010. Some of that is coming from the external environment, and I'll talk about that next, but a lot is being driven by our own efforts. And that will be my second topic that I want to cover this morning with you.
So first, looking at the operating environment. Here's a look at what we're seeing in the field. It's still challenging out there, but as we move to the first quarter, things seem to get a little better. And so far, in April, this positive trend is continuing. 
Now in terms of geographies, Bill and I spent several weeks in the field during business reviews, talking to district managers, branch managers and all of the employees. The tones changed. They're now more cautiously optimistic. 
Canada, we talked about three months ago, was also going to be a bright spot. And that's holding true. In March, rental revenue for Canada, as a whole, was basically flat, on a year-over-year basis, in local currency. And that's with 6% less fleet. But right now, that's being driven by the activity in Northeast Canada, but we're also beginning to see Western Canada come back online as oil prices improve.
Southeast is also picking up in projects like infrastructure, power plants and bridges. The Gulf area activity is increasing, as industrial plants return to a more normalized maintenance schedule, which impacts the local economies. 
California, if you recall, was the first to see the weakness back in 2008, and had a terrible track record as it went through the recession. We're now seeing that level off, both in North and Southern California. However, the Midwest is still the weakest, and it will be for a while. However, we got some good news yesterday, with the ABI index for the region up over 50, for the first time in a long time.
Now a lot of recent big projects are tied to infrastructure, helping the performance of our Trench Safety, Pump and Power operations. To give you an example, revenues were down 7% in the first quarter and rental revenues for that segment were up 10%, on a year-over-year basis, for March alone. Stimulus money is driving some of that performance, but there's also uptick in underground construction, which is also typical of leading edge of recovery. 
Now we said that before. We expect the public construction and infrastructure to recover first, followed by institutional construction and then commercial construction being the last to show improvement. But there's also a historical sequence to the metrics that I've experienced in my career, with used prices improving, recovering first, then time utilization would improve, and lastly, you would see rates improve after that. We believe that will happen in this cycle too. And when you look at the first quarter, as I mentioned, used equipment pricing for most categories is the best we've seen in over a year. 
Rates are lagging in the cycle, as we expected, but the year-over-year decline is moderating. Now to give you some early insight into the first quarter, and actually, into April, rates have been essentially flat. So when you put the rate trend together with used equipment pricing and time utilization, which is continuing a positive trend as we move to April, it suggests that we saw the worst part of the cycle in the first quarter.
So the big question is, where do we go from here? Our opinion hasn't changed. We expect to see an increasing number of local markets begin to recover, as we move to the balance of the year. It's not going to be upward trajectory. It's going to remain choppy. A broader recovery will begin in the back half of 2010, and take hold in 2011. Please feel free to ask us more about the environment on the Q&A.
Now I want to turn the discussion to operations, talk about actions that we are taking to transform the way we create long-term value. We've been very successful at cutting costs, as you know, we reported last night, further cost reductions. It's becoming part of our culture, and we are committed to doing more, providing a low-cost structure, going forward. 
Now we're pivoting towards revenue generation. We're beginning to see some momentum of our strategy, which is our customer service and customer segmentation through Operation United. Our strategy is not about the economy, it's about United Rentals, and it's where we intend to take this company and the actions that we are taking to reach these goals: leveraging our footprint and fleet to our people; focusing our sales efforts on larger and more profitable accounts, key accounts, national, strategic, government and local accounts that have been assigned a single point of contact; also, investing in areas to drive growth. For example, our headcount is down in the first quarter year-over-year, but the number of national and strategic account managers is up 27%.
So the segmentation strategy is working. Numbers show that our larger target customers are the right customers for our long-term growth. They're more stable in times of economic uncertainty. National account revenue is only down 6% year-over-year in the first quarter. New service accounts more profitably over time, there's more upside in terms of share of wallet and there's more benefit realized on both sides, from servicing these accounts to a single point of contact. 
Today, we now have coverage of 50% of our revenue, meaning our reps are assigned directly to customers. Equally as important, complete visibility to our sales force automation, also pursuing Industrial business with our goal of 30% of rental revenue. Currently, for the quarter, 19%, but it continues to make progress. Of the 65 national accounts signed in the first quarter, 25 were industrial, with a total wallet estimated to be at $25 million.
Now within our national accounts team, we now have a broad base of managers, who are subject matter experts in industrial, to help us grow that business. And everything I just mentioned relates to target customers, also paying close attention to the rest of our customer base, our sales initiatives, in-place design to drive revenue generation across all markets. One of the examples of that is reactivating dormant accounts. In March, we pushed out to our sales force automation tool 7,000, what we call, quiet accounts, accounts that revenue was declining over the last trailing 12 months. We generated over $1.3 million of additional revenue in March alone, by calling on these customers.
Our Customer Care Center is taking more proactive poll in revenue generation to co-calling. Our centers, to us, is a key differentiator. And we believe our center is the only one in the industry with the ability to solve 100% of the customers' needs with one contact. For example, you can take an order and place it anywhere in North America. You can take a unit offhand [ph] (27:54) or just answer our question. It's multilingual, open 24/7. 
There's a lot going on with our service initiatives as well in 2010. The customer-focused scorecard, our price optimization software, our workflow process to drive efficiencies and field automation. We've talked about these initiatives before, and we'll have more to say, as we move through the year to report our progress. If you have specific questions today, we'll be happy to answer to the best we can.
So service is where our business is at. It's the right thing to focus on as a differentiator. It's also listening and learning from our customers. It's critically important to revenue generation. Exceptional service earns that customer loyalty. It lends to repeat business and referrals, and it also strengthens that relationship between the company and the customers. That makes this easier to ramp up new business when we open cold starts or warm starts. We're now much more efficient at customer service than we have been in the past, able to handle greater inflow of business at lower cost. 
In March, we also streamlined our field platform under the leadership of Matt Flannery, industry venom with over 20 years of experience. We also continued to optimize our footprint by closing and consolidating summon locations in the first quarter without leaving any market, and our business development team is in fact, constantly reviewing market opportunities. We expect to open some strategic cold and warm starts later this year, plus do some selective consolidations. We also continue to repurpose our capital to serve the needs of our targeted customers. An example would be our fleet mix, less aerial, more earthmoving, because that's what our customers need. 
So to summarize, while our first quarter results were down year-over-year, we believe that we've seen the lowest point in the cycle, based on what we've experienced in March, and now, what we're seeing in April. We're comfortable where the estimation of the recovery will begin in the back half of 2010, and become more universal in 2011. The things that we are hearing and seeing in the field support this. We see positive signs. Our branches are more optimistic in many trade areas, but more importantly, when we go out and we talk to our customers, we're hearing that there's more bidding activity. It's competitive, but nonetheless, there's more bidding activity. We're also in a great place to jump on opportunities presented by the recovery, not indiscriminately, but where our efforts can bear the most fruit. 
Everything we just discussed today will be covered in more detail on our new investor presentation. However, we're doing something different this quarter. It's not posted on our website yet. It contains a lot of new information. However, we want to walk you through it, and we're going to be introducing it this Thursday, the 29th. We're going to webcast it, 12:30 on Eastern time. And I urge all of you to join us, so that we can walk through this together and we hope you find the information very valuable. Now with that, I'm going to pass it over to Bill to review our results, and then we'll go into Q&A and we'll take your questions. Over to you, Bill."

As usual, I'll give more detail on the numbers, but also hope to provide some more color on what made them up. We'll look at cost revenue, and then we'll update our outlook before I finish up.
So first, turning to revenues. For our Rental line of business, our rental revenue, as Mike mentioned, was down 15% in the quarter. And as you would expect, that revenue was really a story of rates, fleet size and fleet utilization. Mike touched on the rates, down 6 1/2% for the quarter, on a year-over-year basis. But as you dive a little deeper, there's some positive news there, and that the year-over-year decline for each month of the quarter was less, successively, as you went through the quarter. So March, less of a decline, then February less than January. We've seen that momentum continue in April and are heartened by the fact that, that is continuing. And we hope that portends a better rate environment, as we get further into the year.  
Looking forward, in fact, while we're not going to get too aggressive talking about the rate impact that we'll see over the full year, we do think that we will see a slight modest decline of rates, overall, for the full year. What we're talking about is something in the low single digits, on a full year basis, for rates this year, compared to last.
A little bit more context on our fleet. Our fleet size during the quarter was down versus last year, down 6% at the end of the quarter. And obviously, that was a positive in supporting utilization. Utilization, as Mike said, was essentially flat. It was up, actually, a tenth of a percentage point, compared with the same quarter last year.
As you look within that, the other interesting piece is that we're seeing some significant gains from certain categories. For example, the earthmoving categories were up significantly. Earthmoving categories were up 6 1/2%, on a year-over-year basis, in time utilization. As we've said before, that's an early cycle component of our portfolio, and so we take that as positive news for utilization of the equipment. 
Turning to used equipment sales, revenues from used equipment this quarter were $35 million for our sales. And as Mike mentioned, the margin was 31.4%, it's up 19 1/2 percentage points compared to last year. And within that, we're seeing, as Mike said, improvement in the prices that we realized in our used equipment sales, whether through our retail channel, or through auction or other channels. That's good news. We certainly take that as positive news for where the market is, overall. The mix of channels that we use this year was also very favorable. That was another significant part of that improvement in margin.
So we sold 70% of our sales in the quarter through our own retail channels this year. That compares to 34% through retail last year. Auction was 17% of our sales this quarter, compared to about 39% last year. So that certainly was a positive contribution, in addition to the improvement in underlying equipment prices.
Earthmoving, in particular, was a better performing component of our used sales than other categories. For contractor supplies, another solid story for us, even though the revenue was down materially, down 28% year-over-year, the gross margin improved very significantly. Gross margin was up 230 basis points for the quarter, to just over 30% in our Contractor Supplies business. So we're continuing to execute the strategy that we've talked about, focusing on the higher margin sales opportunity, making sure that the sales that we do, do support our Rental line of business, and that's playing out to better margins in that line of business.
Let me now turn to costs and touch on our SG&A performance for the quarter. We delivered $22 million of SG&A reduction for the quarter, compared to last year, and that's consistent with what we've been focused on for the last number of quarters. We're looking to take advantage of cost savings in every line of our SG&A. And in this quarter, virtually every line was again a save versus last year. 
Specifically, salaries and benefits were a major component, and they came down in line with a significant headcount reduction. Professional fees were down materially as well. They came down in line with our greater focus on being careful on where we engage professional service providers. Travel and entertainment came down, as we focused more on what's the right travel and what's the right way to travel to drive savings there. We also saw a modest reduction in bad debt expense for the quarter. 
So all in all, we feel very good about the SG&A performance. Good enough, in fact, to raise our target for SG&A reduction this year to $40 million to $50 million for the full year. That compares to our previous target of $25 million to $35 million. Now because of some discrete items that we had in the quarter, we won't just annualize the $22 million save that we had in the first quarter. But we are very confident that we can deliver $40 million $50 million of SG&A reduction, and as always, we continue to look for more opportunities.
On our cost of rent, excluding depreciation, that came down $19 million in the quarter. And like SG&A, we had contributions from most of the lines of our cost of rent. Salaries and benefits, again, in line with headcount, was a significant contributor. But other areas such as R&M, facility costs were also down, and we continue to look for opportunities to continue that momentum.
As we streamline, as we automate, as we really drill into our rental processes, we believe there are more opportunities available. Things like the fast initiative that Mike mentioned, to help optimize our logistics operation, we think, will contribute to our path on costs in our cost of rent lines. We feel comfortable with the outlook that we have provided, $70 million to $90 million. Quite honestly, we're focused on greater opportunities there, and hopefully, we'll be able to continue to deliver good results in those areas.
Put it all together, between revenue and cost, and you see that we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $115 million for the quarter, and that was in a margin of 21.4%. So none of us are satisfied with 21.4% EBITDA margin, but for the first quarter, seasonally the weakest quarter, and compared to last year, we think that represents solid performance in the quarter. The EBITDA margin was only 3/10 of a percentage point, down versus last year. And obviously, in light of a 15% rental revenue decline, nearly 19% total revenue decline, we'll claim that as solid performance and we'll continue to look to drive it.
Turning to free cash flow. We generated $99 million of free cash flow for the quarter. That included a $55 million cash tax refund that we received in March. That tax refund is consistent with the cash tax impact that we talked about in February. As we've looked at that cash tax refund and some other tax planning strategies and changes in our estimate, we now think that cash taxes will be a greater contribution to free cash flow than we had initially guided to. So it contributes to our increased outlook for free cash flow for the full year.
We now expect a total of $200 million to $225 million of free cash flow for the full year. And that's up, compared to the $175 million to $200 million that we gave in February. It's up, primarily because of the SG&A cost reductions, which were essentially all cash, and with an improved view on what the cash tax benefit will be roughly $10 million more cash tax benefit than we were in February.
A couple of thoughts on fleet. We continue to drive the fleet strategy, and in terms of leveraging our fleet the best way that we can, transfers are a key component. We had 1.02 billion of transfers this quarter, that was about 33% of our overall fleet involved in our transfer activities over the quarter. When you look at our used sales activity, the age of what we sold from the fleet in our used sales this quarter were 75 months, again, consistent with our strategy of selling the oldest fleet first. And within those sales, about 60% of the sales were in aerial and reach forklift categories that are lagging a little bit, in terms of overall market performance.
As I mentioned, on a year-over-year basis, our overall fleet size is down 6% at the quarter end. And this helped us achieve the essentially flat time utilization that we remarked earlier. In terms of rental CapEx, we spent $40 million gross in the quarter, and we spent that money buying categories that we expect to perform well, as we go forward. For instance, we're buying high-capacity reach forklifts. We're buying light towers, compressors, excavators and a host of gen rent and earthmoving products that help us focus on the earlier stage activity that we're starting to see. We're skewing our buy away from aerial products, except for very specific categories that continue to see good demand.
Importantly, among that $49 million of spend, about $10 million in the quarter was spent for two specific strategic relationships that we have, where we had identified needs with the customer that we spend into. And that reflects the approach that we're trying to take with our rental CapEx spend this year. We want to be targeted and focused in trying to support specific customer needs, along with our general level of spending needed to keep the fleet fresh.
Now just a couple of thoughts on our capital structure. Last night, you noted that we filed an update to our shelf registration. And I must admit, I've been surprised by the level of questions and energy that we've gotten around that filing. Recall, last year, that we had initially filed $1 billion shelf in the summertime. We drew down on that shelf in November for our issues of senior unsecured and our convert issue. It left us with a shelf that was about a little north of $300 million. 
That's not a usable level of shelf capacity, from our perspective. And so our filing last night was simply to push our shelf registration size back up $1 billion. There's nothing specific, nothing concrete going on. We don't have a current plan to issue anything under the shelf, whether debt or equity, and I just wanted to take some time to emphasize that point. It's housekeeping, and we'll certainly continue to talk actively about what our thoughts are around the capital structure.
In the quarter, on the capital structure, you'll note that we did redeem the 6 1/2% senior unsecured in February. That was $435 million of an issue that matured in 2012. So with that redemption, our maturity decks are now essentially clear until 2013 when our ABL matures.
During the quarter, we also temporarily moved a large portion of our Canadian cash position down to the U.S., and we carried that intercompany loan position over the quarter end. So that explains a significant decline in cash balance that you see on the balance sheet. It was roughly $160 million U.S., and obviously, when we moved the cash in the U.S., we used it to pay down the ABL.
Total debt at the end of the quarter was down by $245 million since the year end, and our net debt was down by $96 million. On liquidity, we continue to have an exceptional liquidity position. We ended the quarter with about $800 million of total liquidity. That's made up of $713 million under our ABL facility and another $58 million of capacity under our accounts receivable facility. So we continue to be well positioned, in terms of liquidity.
Those are the key comments that I want to make for the quarter. Before we open it up for Q&A, I just like to echo the sentiment of Mike's comments. We're seeing positive momentum in our business. And indeed, we are as optimistic as we've been in quite some time. Obviously, rates are still a challenge, but we're focusing on managing rates as actively as we can. The uptick that we see in the used equipment pricing, the strength that we're seeing in time utilization, we think will give us a better basis for managing rate and managing our business overall. We're positioning ourselves to take full advantage of it. Too soon to say whether it's cyclical or seasonal, but we certainly feel optimistic and we're going to go after the businesses as strongly as we can. So with that, I'll stop and ask the operator to open up the call for questions and answers. Operator?"

The one that is most significant issue right now is the limitation at the subordinated debt level. The basket calculation for our sub debt RP limitation right now is negative 500 in change. It's a big number. What that means, of course, is that we can't use operating company cash to go below the subordinated debt level of the opco [operating company]. Meaning, we can't use opco cash to buy back stock. We can't use opco cash to buy back any of the debt of the outstanding HoldCo issues. So that's probably the most significant one. There's also an RP limitation within the senior unsubordinated debt of the opco, and that basket is negative about $70 million or so as we speak. And that's really only the result of the net losses that we've experienced since we'd issued our issues last year. That makes sense to you?"

I mentioned the workflow process. There's a lot of things that we're doing differently today than we've done in the past. That will change the outcome in the future. Those things still have to play out. Obviously, if we start adding fleet, yes, we're going to have to add more people as we go forward. But we still think we've got a bandwidth here that we can clearly control. And when you look at what the costs that we have taken out, we have said that roughly 55% or more is going to be out permanently as we go forward. And obviously, in SG&A, yes, that's one who's going to fluctuate. It's going to fluctuate as revenues go up. Sales expense will be there. Other things, inflationary factors around fuel could go up and have an impact. So on balance, we think that we've got very good controls in place. Our people understand it. Our people buy into it, and we're clearly focused after a more profitable customer. So that, into itself, will help drive to performance."

With me is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of our senior management team. This morning I went to spend some time on the external environment, also to share with you where we think we’re in the cycle and then update you on the actions that we’re taking for both the short-term and long-term in order to move the needle towards profitable growth.
Before I get to that, first the quarter is always -- the first quarter is always the weakest period due to seasonality and this period is no different, it’s been pushed down even further by the weather and also the economy.
However, we’re starting to see some positive indicators, the turn in the industry, as far as our cycle is concerned was always not a question of if, it was more a question of when. And from the first days of the downturn everybody involved here at United Rentals from the senior management team all the way down to our employees in our front lines have been working hard to ensure that we’re in the best position to benefit in the upturn.
Today we’re looking forward to sharing some of the specifics with you about the positive momentum that we’re seeing. The first quarter results we reported don’t reflect the strategic momentum that we’re gaining in the field.
Rental revenue was down 15%, now some of that was due to fleet being down up by 6% on a year-over-year basis. The worst of the environment happened in January through mid-February and then we saw a shift late in February continue into March and March came back stronger than we anticipated.
Time utilization in the quarter was basically flat on a year-over-year basis at 56.2%. Rates however were down 6.5%, not great, it’s not where we want to be, we put a lot of focus on this and a lot of effort and we’re managing this everyday. However, we’re still under pressure but declines are beginning to show signs of leveling off.
We’ve been -- seen a very clear positive change in used equipment pricing. The used margin in the first quarter was 31.4% versus 11.9% a year ago. Used equipment pricing is a leading indicator of where we’re in the cycle.
Now turning to cost cutting, obviously it’s a great story to talk about, particularly the first quarter. SG&A down $22 million, cost of rent down an additional $19 million. Bill is going to go into a lot more detail and discuss our decision to raise the financial targets for both SG&A, as well as the free cash flow target for the year.
So where are we? It’s fair to say that we’re more optimistic than we have been for a while. We see a healthy mix of conditions driving our metrics for the first three months in 2010. Some of that’s coming from the external environment, I’ll talk about that next but a lot is being driven by our own efforts. And that will be my second topic that I want to cover this morning with you.
So first, looking at the operating environment, here is a look at what we’re seeing in the field. It’s still challenging out there but as we move through the first quarter things seem to get a little better and so far in April the positive trend is continuing.
Now in terms of geographies, Bill and I spent several weeks in the field during business reviews talking to district managers, branch managers and hourly employees. The tones changed, they’re now more cautiously optimistic.
Canada, we talked about three months ago, was also going to be a bright spot and that’s holding true. In March rental revenue for Canada as a whole was basically flat on a year-over-year basis in local currency and that’s with 6% less fleet. Right now that’s being driven by the activity in Northeast Canada, but we’re also beginning to see Western Canada come back online as oil prices improve.
Southeast is also picking up in projects like infrastructure, power plants and bridges. The Gulf area, activity is increasing as industrial plants return to a more normalized maintenance schedule, which impacts the local economies.
California, if you recall was the first to see the weakness back in 2008 and had a terrible track record as it went through the recession. We’re now seeing that level off both in North and Southern California. However, the Midwest is still the weakest and it will be for a while. However, we got some good news yesterday with the ABI index for the region up over 50 for the first time in a long time.
Now a lot of recent big projects are tied to infrastructure, helping the performance of our trench safety, pump and power operations. I’ll give you an example, revenues were down 7% in the first quarter and rental revenues for that segment were up 10% on a year-over-year basis for March alone. A stimulus money is driving some of that performance but there’s also uptick in underground construction which is also a typical of leading edge of a recovery.
Now we’ve said that before, we expect public construction and infrastructure to recover first, followed by institutional construction and then, commercial construction being the last to show improvement. But there’s also a historical sequence to the metrics that I’ve experienced in my career with used prices improving, recovering first, then time utilization would improve and lastly, you would see rates improve after that. We believe that will happen in this cycle too.
And when you look at the first quarter, as I mentioned, used equipment pricing for most categories is the best we’ve seen in over a year. Rates are lagging in the cycle, as we expected but the year-over-year decline is moderating.
Now to give you some early insight into the first quarter (inaudible) into April, rates have been essentially flat. So when you put the rate trend together with used equipment pricing and time utilization, which is continuing a positive trend as we move through April, it suggests that though we saw the worst part of the cycle in the first quarter.
So the big question is, where do we go from here? Our opinion hasn’t changed. We expect to see an increasing number of local markets begin to recover as we move through the balance of the year. It’s not going to be an upward trajectory. It’s going to remain choppy. A broader recovery will begin in the back half of 2010 and take hold in 2011. Please feel free to ask us more about the environment in the Q&A.
Now I want to turn our discussion to operations and talk about actions that we’re taking to transform the way we create long-term value. We’ve been very successful at cutting costs; as you know, we reported last night further cost reductions. It’s becoming part of our culture and we’re committed to doing more, providing a low cost structure going forward.
Now we’re pivoting towards revenue generation. See -- we’re beginning to see some momentum of our strategy, which is our customer service and customer segmentation to operation of United. Our strategy is not about the economy, it’s about United Rentals and it’s where we intend to take this company and the actions that we’re taking to reach those goals.
Leveraging our footprint and fleet through our people, focusing our sales efforts on larger more profitable accounts, key accounts, national, strategic, government and local accounts, that have been assigned a single point of contact.
Also investing in areas to drive growth, for example, our headcount is down in the first quarter year-over-year, but the number of national and strategic account managers is up 27%.
So the segmentation strategy is working. Numbers show that our larger target customers are the right customers for our long-term growth. They’re more stable in times of economic uncertainty. National account revenue is only down 6% year-over-year in the first quarter.
We serve these accounts more profitably overtime, there’s more upside in terms of share of wallet and there’s more benefit realized on both sides from servicing these accounts through a single point of contact.
Today we now have coverage of 50% of our revenue, meaning our reps are assigned directly to customers. Equally as important, complete visibility through our sales force automation, also pursuing industrial business with our goal of 30% of rental revenue, currently for the quarter at 19%, but it continues to make progress. Of the 65 national accounts signed in the first quarter, 25 were industrial with a total wallet estimated to be at $25 million.
Now within our national accounts team we now have a broad base of managers who are subject matter experts in industrial to help us grow that business. Everything I just mentioned relates to target customers, also paying close attention to the rest of our customer base, our sales initiatives in place and designed to drive revenue generation across all markets.
One of the examples of that is reactivating dormant accounts. In March, we pushed out through our sales force automation tool 7,000 we call quiet accounts, accounts that revenue was declining over the last trailing 12 months. We generated over $1.3 million of additional revenue in March alone by calling on these customers.
Our customer care center is taking more proactive call and revenue generation to cold calling. Our center to us is a key differentiator and we believe our center is the only one in the industry with the ability to solve 100% of the customer’s needs with one contact.
For example, you can take an order and place it anywhere in North America, you can take a unit off rent or just answer a question, it’s multilingual, open 24x7.
There’s a lot going on with our service initiatives as well in 2010. The customer focused scorecard, our price optimization software or workflow process to drive efficiencies and field automation. We’ve talked about these initiatives before and we’ll have more to say as we move through the year to report our progress. But if you’ve specific questions today we’ll be happy to answer the best we can.
So, service is where our business is at. It’s the right thing to focus on as a differentiator. It’s also listening and learning from our customers. It’s critically important to revenue generation, exceptional service earns that customer loyalty, it lends to repeat business and referrals and also strengthens that relationship between the company and the customers. And makes it easier to ramp up new business when we open cold starts or warm starts.
We’re now much more efficient at customer service than we have been in the past, able to handle greater inflow of business at lower cost. In March, we also streamlined our field platform under the leadership of Matt Flannery, an industry veteran with over 20 years of experience.
We also continued to optimize our footprint by closing and consolidating seven locations in the first quarter without leaving any market. And our business development team is constantly reviewing market opportunities to expect to open some strategic cold and warm starts later this year plus do some selective consolidations. We also continue to repurpose our capital to serve the needs of our targeted customers. An example would be our fleet mix, less aerial, more earthmoving because that’s what our customers need.
So to summarize, our first quarter results were down year-over-year; we believe that we’ve seen the lowest point in the cycle based on what we’ve experienced in March and now what we’re seeing in April. We’re comfortable that the estimation to recovery will begin in the back half of 2010 and become more universal in 2011.
The things that we are hearing and seeing in the field support this, we see positive signs, our branches are more optimistic in many trade areas. But more importantly, when we go out there and we talk to our customers, we’re hearing that there’s more bidding activity. It’s competitive, but nonetheless there’s more bidding activity. We’re also in a great place to jump on opportunities presented by the recovery, not indiscriminately but where our efforts can bear the most fruit.
Everything we just discussed today will be covered in more detail in our new investor presentation. However, we’re doing something different this quarter, it’s not posted on the website yet, it contains a lot of new information.
However, we want to walk you through it and we’re going to be introducing it this Thursday the 29th, we’re going to webcast it 12:30 Eastern Time. And I urge all of you to join us so that we can walk through this together. We hope you find the information very valuable.
Now with that I’m going to pass it over to Bill to review our results and then we’ll go into Q&A and we’ll take your questions. Over to you, Bill.

As usual I’ll give more detail on the numbers, but also hope to provide some more color on what made them up. We’ll look at cost revenue and then we’ll update our outlook before I finish up.
So first turning to revenues, for our rental line of business, our rental revenue, as Mike mentioned was down 15% in the quarter and as you’d expect, that revenue was really a story of rates, fleet size and fleet utilization. Mike touched on the rates, down 6.5% for the quarter on a year-over-year basis.
But as you delve a little deeper there’s some positive news there in that the year-over-year decline for each month of the quarter was less successively as you went through the quarter. So, March less of a decline then February less than January.
We’ve seen that momentum continue in April and are heartened by the fact that that is continuing and we hope that portends a better rate environment as we get further into the year.
Looking forward, in fact, while we’re not going to get too aggressive about -- talking about the rate impact that we’ll see over the full year, we do think that we’ll see a slight modest decline of rates overall for the full year. What we’re talking about is something in the low single digits on a full year basis for rates this year compared to last.
A bit more context on our fleet. Our fleet size during the year or during the quarter was down versus last year, down 6% at the end of the quarter. And obviously that was a positive in supporting utilization. Utilization, as Mike said was essentially flat. It was up actually 10th of a percentage point compared to the same quarter last year.
As you look within that, well, the other interesting piece is that we’re seeing some significant gains from certain categories. For example, the earthmoving categories were up significantly, earthmoving categories were up 6.5% on a year-over-year basis in time utilization. As we’ve said before, that’s an early cycle component of our portfolio and so we take that as positive news for utilization of the equipment.
Turning to used equipment sales, revenues from used equipment this quarter were $35 million for our sales and as Mike mentioned. The margin was 31.4%, that’s up 19.5 percentage points, compared to last year. And within that we’re seeing, as Mike said, improvement in the prices that we realize in our used equipment sales, whether through our retail channel or through auction or other channels.
That’s good news. We certainly take that as positive news for where the market is overall. The mix of channels that we used this year was also very favorable, that was another significant part of that improvement in margin. So we sold 70% of our sales in the quarter through our own retail channels this year that compares to 34% through retail last year.
Auction was 17% of our sales this quarter, compared to about 39% last year. So, that certainly was a positive contribution in addition to the improvement in underlying equipment prices.
Earthmoving in particular was a better performing component of our used sales than other categories. For contractor supplies, another solid story for us even though the revenue was down materially, down 28% year-over-year, the gross margin improved very significantly. Gross margin was up 230 basis points for the quarter to just over 30% in our contractor supplies business.
So we’re continuing to execute the strategy that we’ve talked about, focusing on the higher margin sales opportunity, making sure that the sales that we do do support our rental line of business and that’s playing out to better margins in that line of business.
Let me now turn to costs and touch on our SG&A performance for the quarter. We delivered $22 million of SG&A reduction for the quarter, compared to last year. And that’s consistent with what we’ve been focused on for the last number of quarters. We’re looking to take advantage of cost savings in every line of our SG&A and in this quarter virtually every line was, again, a save versus last year.
Specifically salaries and benefits were a major component and they came down in line with a significant headcount reduction. Professional fees were down materially as well, they came down in line with our greater focus on being careful on where we engage professional service providers.
Travel and entertainment came down as we focused more on what’s the right travel and what’s the right way to travel to drive savings there. We also saw a modest reduction in bad debt expense for the quarter. So all in all we feel very good about the SG&A performance, good enough in fact to raise our target for SG&A reduction this year to $40 to $50 million for the full year and that compares to our previous target of $25 to $35 million.
Now because of some discrete items that we had in the quarter, we won’t just annualize the $22 million save that we had in the first quarter. But we’re very confident that we can deliver $40 to $50 million of SG&A reduction and as always, we continue to look for more opportunities.
On our cost of rent excluding depreciation, that came down $19 million in the quarter and like SG&A we had contributions from most of the lines of our cost of rent. Salaries and benefits again in line with headcount was a significant contributor. But other areas such as R&M, facility costs were also down and we continue to look for opportunities to continue that momentum.
As we streamline, as we automate, as we really drill into our rental processes we believe there are more opportunities available, things like the fast initiative that Mike mentioned to help optimize our logistics operation we think will contribute to our path on costs in our cost of rent lines.
We feel comfortable with the outlook that we’ve provided $70 to $90 million. Quite honestly we’re focused on opportune -- greater opportunities there and hopefully, we’ll be able to continue to deliver good results in those areas.
Put it all together between revenue and cost and you see that we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $115 million for the quarter and that was at a margin of 21.4%. So none of us are satisfied with 21.4% EBITDA margin but for the first quarter, seasonally the weakest quarter and compared to last year we think that represents solid performance in the quarter.
The EBITDA margin was only three-tenth of a percentage point down versus last year and obviously in light of a 15% rental revenue decline nearly 19%, total revenue decline, we’ll claim that as solid performance and we’ll continue to look to drive it.
Turning to free cash flow, we generated $99 million of free cash flow for the quarter that included a $55 million cash tax refund that we received in March. That tax refund is consistent with the cash tax impact that we talked about in February.
As we’ve looked at that cash tax refund and some other tax planning strategies and changes in our estimate we now think that cash taxes will be a greater contribution to free cash flow than we had initially guided to. So it contributes to our increased outlook for free cash flow for the full year.
We now expect a total of $200 to $225 million of free cash flow for the full year and that’s up, compared to the $175 to $200 million that we gave in February. It’s up primarily because of the SG&A cost reductions which were essentially all cash and with an improved view on what the cash tax benefit will be roughly $10 million more cash tax benefit than we were in February.
A couple of thoughts on fleet, we continue to drive the fleet strategy, in terms of leveraging our fleet, the best way that we can. Transfers are a key component. We had $1.2 billion of transfers this quarter and that was about 33% of our overall fleet involved in our transfer activities over the quarter.
When you look at our used sales activity, the age of what we sold from the fleet in our used sales this quarter was 75 months, again consistent with our strategy of selling the oldest fleet first. And within those sales about 60% of the sales were in aerial and reach forklift categories, categories that are lagging a little bit in terms of overall market performance.
As I mentioned, on a year-over-year basis our overall fleet size is down 6% at the quarter end and this helped us achieve the essentially flat time utilization that we remarked earlier.
In terms of rental CapEx, we spent $40 million gross in the quarter and we spent that money buying categories that we expect to perform well as we go forward. For instance we’re buying high capacity reach forklifts, we’re buying light towers, compressors, excavators and a host of gen rent and earthmoving products that help us focus on the earlier stage activity that we’re starting to see.
We’re skewing our buy away from aerial products except for very specific categories that continue to see good demand. Importantly, among that $49 million of spend about $10 million in the quarter was spent for two specific strategic relationships that we have where we had identified needs with the customer that we spent into.
And that reflects the approach that we’re trying to take with our rental CapEx spend this year. We want to be targeted and focused in trying to support specific customer needs along with our general level of spending needed to keep the fleet fresh.
Now just a couple of thoughts on our capital structure, last night you noted that we filed an update to our shelf registration and I must admit, I’ve been surprised by the level of questions and energy that we’ve gotten around that filing.
Recall last year that we had initially filed a $1 billion shelf in the summertime. We drew down on that shelf in November for our issues of senior unsecured and our convert issue. It left us with a shelf that was about a little north of $300 million, that’s not a usable level of shelf capacity from our perspective and so our filing last night was simply to push our shelf registration size back up to $1 billion.
There’s nothing specific, nothing concrete going on, we don’t have a current plan to issue anything out of the shelf whether debt or equity and I just wanted to take some time to emphasize that point. It is housekeeping and we’ll certainly continue to talk actively about what our thoughts are around the capital structure.
In the quarter on the capital structure you’ll note that we did redeem the 6.5% senior unsecureds in February that was $435 million of an issue that matured in 2012. So with that redemption our maturity debts are now essentially clear until 2013 when our ABL matures.
During the quarter we also temporarily moved a large portion of our Canadian cash position down to the U.S. and we carried that intercompany loan position over the quarter end so that explains the significant decline in cash balance that you see on the balance sheet. It was roughly $160 million U.S. and obviously when we moved the cash into the U.S. we used it to pay down the ABL.
Total debt at the end of the quarter was down by $245 million since the year end and our net debt was down by $96 million.
On liquidity, we continue to have an exceptional liquidity position. We ended the quarter with about $800 million of total liquidity, that’s made up of $713 million under our ABL facility and another $58 million of capacity under our accounts receivable facility. So continue to be well-positioned in terms of liquidity.
Those are the key comments that I wanted to make for the quarter. Before we open it up for Q&A, I’d just like to echo the sentiment of Mike’s comments.
We’re seeing positive momentum in our business and indeed we’re as optimistic as we’ve been in quite some time. Obviously rates are still a challenge, but we’re focusing on managing rates as actively as we can. The uptick that we’ve seen in used equipment pricing, the strength that we’re seeing in time utilization we think will give us a better basis for managing rate and managing our business overall.
We’re positioning ourselves to take full advantage of it. Too soon to say whether it’s cyclical or seasonal but we certainly feel optimistic and we’re going to go after the businesses as strongly as we can.
So with that I’ll stop and ask the Operator to open up the call for questions-and-answers. Operator?

So as we look at opportunities to send fleet and I touched on it in my comments. There are two things that we’re trying to serve. One is just the overall management of the fleet and to manage the fleet consistent with our notion that you can’t starve the fleet, you’ve got to feed the beast at least at a certain level even in very difficult environments like we’re in today.
And so there will be some general fleet spend to address, components of the fleet that are aging out and that need to be replaced. But we’re also going to be focusing our spend on specific customer needs that fit with our strategy.
So for large key accounts that are significant to our business today and going forward, if they have projects that have specific needs and we can’t draw the fleet for those projects from our larger portfolio, then we’ll look at spending money to support that. We did it in the first quarter for those two that I mentioned in my comments; we’ll continue to try and support those specific needs with customers throughout the year.
What does that mean? That means that we expect to be able to do that within the 102 to 2, excuse me $100 to $120 million of net rental CapEx that we have offered as our outlook. If we have more opportunities, we’re not afraid to spend a little more as long as we can justify specific opportunities.

So, there are two RP baskets that are important to us, the one that is the most significant issue right now is the limitation at the subordinated debt level. The basket calculation for our sub debt RP limitation right now is negative 500 and change, it’s a big number.
What that means of course is that we can’t use operating company cash to go below the subordinated debt level of the op co, meaning we can’t use op co cash to buyback stock, we can’t use op co cash to buyback any of the debt of the outstanding hold co issues. So that’s probably the most significant one.
There is also an RP limitation within the senior unsubordinated debt of the op co and that basket is negative about $70 million or so as we speak and that’s really only -- that’s really only the result of the net losses that we’ve experienced since we issued our issues last year. Does that make sense to you?

I mentioned the workflow process. There are a lot of things that we’re doing differently today than we’ve done in the past that will change the outcome in the future.

We wanted to take a look at it and say is there a better way and a way we can expand retail? So we’re pushing that through and we have some initiatives underway which I already described, that’s one part.
The other part is that we will ramp up our sales as we go forward and there’s an expectation that we’ll sell more fleet. Obviously as the seasonality comes on you would expect demand from people who want to buy something would increase. That being said, we still want to push it as much as we can through on the retail side.
Push that all aside, we’re not afraid to use auctions if need be in order for us to achieve what we want to achieve. But we’re very happy with the signs that we’ve seen and the reality of it is if you could look at the auction prices that are out there, those prices are improving as well.

We don’t feel that we were overly selective in what we sold in the first quarter and as evidenced by the 75-month average age of what we sold. We’ll continue to make decisions based on where the market is as to how much we sell in a given quarter and, in fact, the mix of what we sell in a given quarter and that’s why I threw out the caution about don’t just annualize the first quarter margin.
As that mix changes, whether it’s channel mix or product mix, we’re going to have different margin results. But you can certainly look for us to sell a more normalized amount of used equipment over the course of the year. And it will just depend on what quarter we’re in as to exact results that come out of used sales activity.

With me is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer, and other members of our senior management team. This morning, I want to spend some time on the external environment, also to share with you where we think we are in the cycle and then update you on the actions that we are taking for both the short term and long term, in order to move the needle towards profitable growth.
Before I get to that, first, the first quarter is always the weakest period, due to seasonality. And this period's no different. This was pushed down even further by the weather and also the economy. However, we're starting to see some positive indicators. 
The turn in the industry, as far as our cycle is concerned, was always not a question of if, it was more a question of when. And from the first days of the downturn, everybody involved here at United Rentals, from the senior management team all the way down to our employees and our front lines, have been working hard to ensure that we're in the best position to benefit in the upturn. 
Today, we're looking forward to sharing some of the specifics with you about the positive momentum that we're seeing, and the first quarter results we reported don't reflect the strategic momentum that we're gaining in the field. Rental revenue was down 15%. Now some of that was due to fleet being down by 6% on a year-over-year basis. The worst of the environment happened in January to mid-February. And then we saw a shift late in February and continue into March, and March came back stronger than we anticipated.
Time utilization in the quarter was basically flat, on a year-over-year basis, at 56.2%. Rates, however, were down 6.5%. It's not great. It's not where we want to be. We put a lot of focus on this and a lot of effort, and we're managing this everyday. However, we're still under pressure, but declines are beginning to show signs of leveling of. So we've seen a very clear positive change in used equipment pricing. Used margin in the first quarter was 31.4% versus 11.9% a year ago. Used equipment pricing is a leading indicator of where we are in a cycle.
Now turning to cost cutting. Obviously, it's a great story to talk about, particularly the first quarter. SG&A down $22 million, cost of rent down an additional $19 million. Bill's going to go into a lot more detail and discuss our decision to raise the financial targets for both SG&A, as well as the free cash flow target for the year.
So where are we? It's fair to say that we're more optimistic than we have been for a while. We see a healthy mix of conditions driving our metrics for the first three months in 2010. Some of that's coming from the external environment, and I'll talk about that next, but a lot is being driven by our own efforts. And that will be my second topic that I want to cover this morning with you.
So first, looking at the operating environment. Here's a look at what we're seeing in the field. It's still challenging out there, but as we moved through the first quarter, things seemed to get a little better. And so far, in April, a positive trend is continuing. 
Now in terms of geographies, Bill and I spent several weeks in the field during business reviews, talking to district managers, branch managers and hourly employees. And the tone's changed. They're now more cautiously optimistic. 
 
Canada, we talked about three months ago, was also going to be a bright spot. And that's holding true. In March, rental revenue for Canada, as a whole, was basically flat on a year-over-year basis in local currency. And that's with 6% less fleet. And right now, that's being driven by the activity in Northeast Canada, but we're also beginning to see Western Canada come back online as oil prices improve.
Southeast is also picking up in projects like infrastructure, power plants and bridges. The Gulf area activity is increasing, as industrial plants return to a more normalized maintenance schedule, which impacts the local economies. 
California, if you recall, was the first to see the weakness back in 2008, and had a terrible track record as it went through the recession. We're now seeing that level off, both in North and Southern California. However, the Midwest is still the weakest, and it will be for a while. However, we got some good news yesterday, with the ABI index for the region up over 50, for the first time in a long time.
Now a lot of recent big projects are tied to infrastructure, helping the performance of our Trench Safety Pump and Power operations. Give you an example; revenues were down 7% in the first quarter and rental revenues for that segment were up 10% on a year-over-year basis for March alone. Stimulus money is driving some of that performance, but there's also uptick in underground construction, which is also typical of leading edge of a recovery. 
Now we've said that before. We expect the public construction and infrastructure to recover first, followed by institutional construction and then commercial construction being the last to show improvement. But there's also a historical sequence to the metrics that I've experienced in my career, with used prices improving, recovering first, then time utilization would improve, and lastly, you would see rates improve after that. We believe that will happen in this cycle too. And when you look at the first quarter, as I mentioned, used equipment pricing for most categories is the best we've seen in over a year. 
Rates are lagging in the cycle, as we expected, but the year-over-year decline is moderating. Now to give you some early insight into first quarter – no, actually, into April, rates have been essentially flat. So when you put the rate trend together with used equipment pricing and time utilization, which is continuing a positive trend as we move through April, it suggests that we saw the worst part of the cycle in the first quarter.
So the big question is, where do we go from here? Our opinion hasn't changed. We expect to see an increasing number of local markets begin to recover, as we move through the balance of the year. It's not going to be upward trajectory. It's going to remain choppy. A broader recovery will begin in the back half of 2010, and take hold in 2011. Please feel free to ask us more about the environment on the Q&A.
Now I want to turn the discussion to operations, talk about actions that we are taking to transform the way we create long-term value. We've been very successful at cutting costs. As you know, we reported last night, further cost reductions. It's becoming part of our culture, and we are committed to doing more, providing a low-cost structure going forward. 
Now we're pivoting towards revenue generation. We're beginning to see some momentum of our strategy, which is our customer service and customer segmentation through Operation United. Our strategy is not about the economy, it's about United Rentals, and it's where we intend to take this company and the actions that we are taking to reach those goals: Leveraging our footprint and fleet through our people; focusing our sales efforts on larger and more profitable accounts, key accounts, national, strategic, government and local accounts that have been assigned a single point of contact; also, investing in areas to drive growth. For an example, our headcount is down in the first quarter year-over-year, but the number of national and strategic account managers is up 27%.
So the segmentation strategy is working. Numbers show that our larger target customers are the right customers for our long-term growth. They're more stable in times of economic uncertainty. National account revenue was only down 6% year-over-year in the first quarter. New service accounts more profitably over time, there's more upside in terms of share of wallet and there's more benefit realized on both sides, from servicing these accounts to a single point of contact. 
Today, we now have coverage of 50% of our revenue, meaning our reps are assigned directly to customers. Equally as important, complete visibility to our sales force automation, also pursuing Industrial business with our goal of 30% of rental revenue. Currently, for the quarter, 19%, but it continues to make progress. Of the 65 national accounts signed in the first quarter, 25 were industrial, with a total wallet estimated to be at $25 million.
Now within our national accounts team, we now have a broad base of managers, who are subject matter experts in industrial, to help us grow that business. And everything I just mentioned relates to target customers, also paying close attention to the rest of our customer base, our sales initiatives, in-place design to drive revenue generation across all markets. One of the examples of that is reactivating dormant accounts. In March, we pushed out to our sales force automation tool 7,000, what we call, quiet accounts, accounts that revenue was declining over the last trailing 12 months. We generated over $1.3 million of additional revenue in March alone, by calling on these customers.
Our Customer Care Center is taking more proactive poll in revenue generation to co-calling. Our centers, to us, is a key differentiator. And we believe our center is the only one in the industry with the ability to solve 100% of the customers' needs with one contact. For example, you can take an order and place it anywhere in North America. You can take a unit offhand [ph] (27:54) or just answer our question. It's multilingual, open 24/7. 
There's a lot going on with our service initiatives as well in 2010. The customer-focused scorecard, our price optimization software, our workflow process to drive efficiencies and field automation. We've talked about these initiatives before, and we'll have more to say, as we move through the year to report our progress. If you have specific questions today, we'll be happy to answer to the best we can.
So service is where our business is at. It's the right thing to focus on as a differentiator. It's also listening and learning from our customers. It's critically important to revenue generation. Exceptional service earns that customer loyalty. It lends to repeat business and referrals, and it also strengthens that relationship between the company and the customers. That makes this easier to ramp up new business when we open cold starts or warm starts. We're now much more efficient at customer service than we have been in the past, able to handle greater inflow of business at lower cost. 
In March, we also streamlined our field platform under the leadership of Matt Flannery, industry venom with over 20 years of experience. We also continued to optimize our footprint by closing and consolidating summon locations in the first quarter without leaving any market, and our business development team is in fact, constantly reviewing market opportunities. We expect to open some strategic cold and warm starts later this year, plus do some selective consolidations. We also continue to repurpose our capital to serve the needs of our targeted customers. An example would be our fleet mix, less aerial, more earthmoving, because that's what our customers need. 
So to summarize, while our first quarter results were down year-over-year, we believe that we've seen the lowest point in the cycle, based on what we've experienced in March, and now, what we're seeing in April. We're comfortable where the estimation of the recovery will begin in the back half of 2010, and become more universal in 2011. The things that we are hearing and seeing in the field support this. We see positive signs. Our branches are more optimistic in many trade areas. But more importantly, when we go out and we talk to our customers, we're hearing that there's more bidding activity. It's competitive, but nonetheless, there's more bidding activity. We're also in a great place to jump on opportunities presented by the recovery, not indiscriminately, but where our efforts can bear the most fruit. 
Everything we just discussed today will be covered in more detail on our new investor presentation. However, we're doing something different this quarter. It's not posted on our website yet. It contains a lot of new information. However, we want to walk you through it, and we're going to be introducing it this Thursday, the 29th. We're going to webcast it, 12:30 on Eastern time. And I urge all of you to join us, so that we can walk through this together and we hope you find the information very valuable. Now with that, I'm going to pass it over to Bill to review our results, and then we'll go into Q&A and we'll take your questions. Over to you, Bill."

As usual, I'll give more detail on the numbers, but also hope to provide some more color on what made them up. We'll look at cost revenue, and then we'll update our outlook before I finish up.
So first, turning to revenues. For our Rental line of business, our Rental revenue, as Mike mentioned, was down 15% in the quarter. And as you would expect, that revenue was really a story of rates, fleet size and fleet utilization. Mike touched on the rates, down 6.5% for the quarter, on a year-over-year basis. But as you delve a little deeper, there's some positive news there, in that the year-over-year decline for each month of the quarter was less, successively, as you went through the quarter. So March, less of a decline than February, less than January. We've seen that momentum continue in April and are heartened by the fact that, that is continuing. And we hope that portends a better rate environment, as we get further into the year.  
Looking forward, in fact, while we're not going to get too aggressive talking about the rate impact that we'll see over the full year, we do think that we will see a slight modest decline of rates, overall, for the full year. What we're talking about is something in the low single digits, on a full year basis, for rates this year, compared to last.
A little bit more context on our fleet. Our fleet size during the quarter was down versus last year, down 6% at the end of the quarter. And obviously, that was a positive in supporting utilization. Utilization, as Mike said, was essentially flat. It was up, actually, a tenth of a percentage point, compared with the same quarter last year.
As you look within that, the other interesting piece is that we're seeing some significant gains from certain categories. For example, the earthmoving categories were up significantly. Earthmoving categories were up 6 1/2%, on a year-over-year basis, in time utilization. As we've said before, that's an early cycle component of our portfolio, and so we take that as positive news for utilization of the equipment. 
Turning to used equipment sales, revenues from used equipment this quarter were $35 million for our sales. And as Mike mentioned, the margin was 31.4%, it's up 19 1/2 percentage points compared to last year. And within that, we're seeing, as Mike said, improvement in the prices that we realized in our used equipment sales, whether through our retail channel, or through auction or other channels. That's good news. We certainly take that as positive news for where the market is, overall. The mix of channels that we use this year was also very favorable. That was another significant part of that improvement in margin.
So we sold 70% of our sales in the quarter through our own retail channels this year. That compares to 34% through retail last year. Auction was 17% of our sales this quarter, compared to about 39% last year. So that certainly was a positive contribution, in addition to the improvement in underlying equipment prices.
Earthmoving, in particular, was a better performing component of our used sales than other categories. For contractor supplies, another solid story for us, even though the revenue was down materially, down 28% year-over-year, the gross margin improved very significantly. Gross margin was up 230 basis points for the quarter, to just over 30% in our Contractor Supplies business. So we're continuing to execute the strategy that we've talked about, focusing on the higher margin sales opportunity, making sure that the sales that we do, do support our Rental line of business, and that's playing out to better margins in that line of business.
Let me now turn to costs and touch on our SG&A performance for the quarter. We delivered $22 million of SG&A reduction for the quarter, compared to last year, and that's consistent with what we've been focused on for the last number of quarters. We're looking to take advantage of cost savings in every line of our SG&A. And in this quarter, virtually every line was again a save versus last year. 
Specifically, salaries and benefits were a major component, and they came down in line with a significant headcount reduction. Professional fees were down materially as well. They came down in line with our greater focus on being careful on where we engage professional service providers. Travel and entertainment came down, as we focused more on what's the right travel and what's the right way to travel to drive savings there. We also saw a modest reduction in bad debt expense for the quarter. 
So all in all, we feel very good about the SG&A performance. Good enough, in fact, to raise our target for SG&A reduction this year to $40 million to $50 million for the full year. And that compares to our previous target of $25 million to $35 million. Now because of some discrete items that we had in the quarter, we won't just annualize the $22 million save that we had in the first quarter. But we are very confident that we can deliver $40 million $50 million of SG&A reduction, and as always, we continue to look for more opportunities.
On our cost of rent excluding depreciation, that came down $19 million in the quarter. And like SG&A, we had contributions from most of the lines of our cost of rent. Salaries and benefits, again, in line with headcount, was a significant contributor. But other areas such as R&M facility costs were also down, and we continue to look for opportunities to continue that momentum.
As we streamline, as we automate, as we really drill into our rental processes, we believe there are more opportunities available. Things like the fast initiative that Mike mentioned, to help optimize our logistics operation, we think, will contribute to our path on costs in our cost of rent lines. We feel comfortable with the outlook that we have provided, $70 million to $90 million. Quite honestly, we're focused on greater opportunities there, and hopefully, we'll be able to continue to deliver good results in those areas.
Put it all together, between revenue and cost, and you see that we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $115 million for the quarter, and that was in a margin of 21.4%. So none of us are satisfied with 21.4% EBITDA margin, but for the first quarter, seasonally the weakest quarter, and compared to last year, we think that represents solid performance in the quarter. The EBITDA margin was only 3/10 of a percentage point, down versus last year. And obviously, in light of a 15% rental revenue decline, nearly 19% total revenue decline, we'll claim that as solid performance and we'll continue to look to drive it.
Turning to free cash flow. We generated $99 million of free cash flow for the quarter. That included a $55 million cash tax refund that we received in March. That tax refund is consistent with the cash tax impact that we talked about in February. As we've looked at that cash tax refund and some other tax planning strategies and changes in our estimate, we now think that cash taxes will be a greater contribution to free cash flow than we had initially guided to. So it contributes to our increased outlook for free cash flow for the full year.
We now expect a total of $200 million to $225 million of free cash flow for the full year. And that's up, compared to the $175 million to $200 million that we gave in February. It's up, primarily because of the SG&A cost reductions, which were essentially all cash, and with an improved view on what the cash tax benefit will be roughly $10 million more cash tax benefit than we were in February.
A couple of thoughts on fleet. We continue to drive the fleet strategy, and in terms of leveraging our fleet the best way that we can, transfers are a key component. We had 1.02 billion of transfers this quarter, that was about 33% of our overall fleet involved in our transfer activities over the quarter. When you look at our used sales activity, the age of what we sold from the fleet in our used sales this quarter were 75 months, again, consistent with our strategy of selling the oldest fleet first. And within those sales, about 60% of the sales were in aerial and reach forklift categories that are lagging a little bit, in terms of overall market performance.
As I mentioned, on a year-over-year basis, our overall fleet size is down 6% at the quarter end. And this helped us achieve the essentially flat time utilization that we remarked earlier. In terms of rental CapEx, we spent $40 million gross in the quarter, and we spent that money buying categories that we expect to perform well, as we go forward. For instance, we're buying high-capacity reach forklifts. We're buying light towers, compressors, excavators and a host of gen rent and earthmoving products that help us focus on the earlier stage activity that we're starting to see. We're skewing our buy away from aerial products, except for very specific categories that continue to see good demand.
Importantly, among that $49 million of spend, about $10 million in the quarter was spent for two specific strategic relationships that we have, where we had identified needs with the customer that we spend into. And that reflects the approach that we're trying to take with our rental CapEx spend this year. We want to be targeted and focused in trying to support specific customer needs, along with our general level of spending needed to keep the fleet fresh.
Now just a couple of thoughts on our capital structure. Last night, you noted that we filed an update to our shelf registration. And I must admit, I've been surprised by the level of questions and energy that we've gotten around that filing. Recall, last year, that we had initially filed $1 billion shelf in the summertime. We drew down on that shelf in November for our issues of senior unsecured and our convert issue. It left us with a shelf that was about a little north of $300 million. 
That's not a usable level of shelf capacity, from our perspective. And so our filing last night was simply to push our shelf registration size back up $1 billion. There's nothing specific, nothing concrete going on. We don't have a current plan to issue anything under the shelf, whether debt or equity, and I just wanted to take some time to emphasize that point. It's housekeeping, and we'll certainly continue to talk actively about what our thoughts are around the capital structure.
In the quarter, on the capital structure, you'll note that we did redeem the 6 1/2% senior unsecured in February. That was $435 million of an issue that matured in 2012. So with that redemption, our maturity decks are now essentially clear until 2013 when our ABL matures.
During the quarter, we also temporarily moved a large portion of our Canadian cash position down to the U.S., and we carried that inter-company loan position over the quarter end. So that explains a significant decline in cash balance that you see on the balance sheet. It was roughly $160 million U.S., and obviously, when we moved the cash in the U.S., we used it to pay down the ABL.
Total debt at the end of the quarter was down by $245 million since the year end, and our net debt was down by $96 million. On liquidity, we continue to have an exceptional liquidity position. We ended the quarter with about $800 million of total liquidity. That's made up of $713 million under our ABL facility and another $58 million of capacity under our accounts receivable facility. So we continue to be well positioned, in terms of liquidity.
Those are the key comments that I want to make for the quarter. Before we open it up for Q&A, I just like to echo the sentiment of Mike's comments. We're seeing positive momentum in our business. And indeed, we are as optimistic as we've been in quite some time. Obviously, rates are still a challenge, but we're focusing on managing rates as actively as we can. The uptick that we see in the used equipment pricing, the strength that we're seeing in time utilization, we think will give us a better basis for managing rate and managing our business overall. We're positioning ourselves to take full advantage of it. Too soon to say whether it's cyclical or seasonal, but we certainly feel optimistic and we're going to go after the businesses as strongly as we can. So with that, I'll stop and ask the operator to open up the call for questions and answers. Operator?"

Those things still have to play out. Obviously, if we start adding fleet, yes, we're going to have to add more people as we go forward. But we still think we've got a bandwidth here that we can clearly control.

But it was refreshing to hear from our customers that the level of bidding activity they're seeing is increasing. Again, as I mentioned on my opening statement is that, it is still competitive but nonetheless, there's more bidding activity."

With me is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer, and other members of our senior management team. This morning, I want to spend some time on the external environment, also to share with you where we think we are in the cycle and then update you on the actions that we are taking for both the short term and long term in order to move the needle towards profitable growth.
Before I get to that, first, the first quarter's always the weakest period due to seasonality, and this period's no different. This was pushed down even further by the weather and also the economy. However, we're starting to see some positive indicators. 
The turn in the industry, as far as our cycle is concerned, was always not a question of if, it was more a question of when. And from the first days of the downturn, everybody involved here at United Rentals, from the senior management team all the way down to our employees and our front lines, have been working hard to ensure that we're the best position to benefit in the upturn. 
Today, we're looking forward to sharing some of the specifics with you about the positive momentum that we're seeing. And the first quarter results we reported don't reflect the strategic momentum that we're gaining in the field. Rental revenue was down 15%. Now some of that was due to fleet being down by 6% on year-over-year basis. The worst of the environment happened in January to mid-February. And then we saw a shift late in February and continue into March, and March came back stronger than we anticipated.
Time utilization in the quarter was basically flat, on a year-over-year basis at 56.2%. Rates, however, were down 6.5%. It's not great. It's not where we want to be. We put a lot of focus on this and lot of effort and we're managing this everyday. However, we're still under pressure. But declines are beginning to show signs of leveling of. So we've seen a very clear positive change in used equipment pricing. Used margin in the first quarter was 31.4% versus 11.9% a year ago. Used equipment pricing is a leading indicator of where we are in a cycle.
Now turning to cost cutting. Obviously, it's a great story to talk about, particularly the first quarter. SG&A, down $22 million, cost of rent, down an additional $19 million. Bill's going to go into a lot more detail and discuss our decision to raise the financial targets for both SG&A as well as the free cash flow target for the year.
So where are we? It's fair to say that we're more optimistic than we have been for a while. We see a healthy mix of conditions driving our metrics for the first three months in 2010. Some of that's coming from the external environment, and I'll talk about that next, but a lot is being driven by our own efforts. And that will be my second topic that I want to cover this morning with you.
So first, looking at the operating environment. Here's a look at what we're seeing in the field. It's still challenging out there, but as we moved through the first quarter, things seemed to get a little better. And so far, in April, a positive trend is continuing. 
Now in terms of geographies, Bill and I spent several weeks in the field during business reviews, talking to district managers, branch managers and hourly employees. And the tone's changed. They're now more cautiously optimistic. 
 
Canada, we talked about three months ago, was also going to be a bright spot. And that's holding true. In March, rental revenue for Canada, as a whole, was basically flat on a year-over-year basis in local currency. And that's with 6% less fleet. And right now, that's being driven by the activity in Northeast Canada, but we're also beginning to see Western Canada come back online as oil prices improve.
Southeast is also picking up in projects like infrastructure, power plants and bridges. The Gulf area activity is increasing, as industrial plants return to a more normalized maintenance schedule, which impacts the local economies. 
California, if you recall, was the first to see the weakness back in 2008, and had a terrible track record as it went through the recession. We're now seeing that level off, both in North and Southern California. However, the Midwest is still the weakest, and it will be for a while. However, we got some good news yesterday, with the ABI index for the region up over 50, for the first time in a long time.
Now a lot of recent big projects are tied to infrastructure, helping the performance of our Trench Safety Pump and Power operations. Give you an example; revenues were down 7% in the first quarter and rental revenues for that segment were up 10% on a year-over-year basis for March alone. Stimulus money is driving some of that performance, but there's also uptick in underground construction, which is also typical of leading edge of a recovery. 
Now we've said that before. We expect the public construction and infrastructure to recover first, followed by institutional construction and then commercial construction being the last to show improvement. But there's also a historical sequence to the metrics that I've experienced in my career, with used prices improving, recovering first, then time utilization would improve, and lastly, you would see rates improve after that. We believe that will happen in this cycle too. And when you look at the first quarter, as I mentioned, used equipment pricing for most categories is the best we've seen in over a year. 
Rates are lagging in the cycle, as we expected, but the year-over-year decline is moderating. Now to give you some early insight into first quarter – no, actually, into April, rates have been essentially flat. So when you put the rate trend together with used equipment pricing and time utilization, which is continuing a positive trend as we move through April, it suggests that we saw the worst part of the cycle in the first quarter.
So the big question is, where do we go from here? Our opinion hasn't changed. We expect to see an increasing number of local markets begin to recover, as we move through the balance of the year. It's not going to be upward trajectory. It's going to remain choppy. A broader recovery will begin in the back half of 2010, and take hold in 2011. Please feel free to ask us more about the environment on the Q&A.
Now I want to turn the discussion to operations, talk about actions that we are taking to transform the way we create long-term value. We've been very successful at cutting costs. As you know, we reported last night, further cost reductions. It's becoming part of our culture, and we are committed to doing more, providing a low-cost structure going forward. 
Now we're pivoting towards revenue generation. We're beginning to see some momentum of our strategy, which is our customer service and customer segmentation through Operation United. Our strategy is not about the economy, it's about United Rentals, and it's where we intend to take this company and the actions that we are taking to reach those goals: Leveraging our footprint and fleet through our people; focusing our sales efforts on larger and more profitable accounts, key accounts, national, strategic, government and local accounts that have been assigned a single point of contact; also, investing in areas to drive growth. For an example, our headcount is down in the first quarter year-over-year, but the number of national and strategic account managers is up 27%.
So the segmentation strategy is working. Numbers show that our larger target customers are the right customers for our long-term growth. They're more stable in times of economic uncertainty. National account revenue was only down 6% year-over-year in the first quarter. We serve these accounts more profitably over time, there's more upside in terms of share of wallet and there's more benefit realized on both sides from servicing these accounts to a single point of contact. 
Today, we now have coverage of 50% of our revenue, meaning our reps are assigned directly to customers. Equally as important, complete visibility to our sales force automation. Also, pursuing Industrial business with our goal of 30% of rental revenue, currently, for the quarter, 19%, but it continues to make progress. Of the 65 national accounts signed in the first quarter, 25 were industrial, with a total wallet estimated to be at $25 million.
Now within our national accounts team, we now have a broad base of managers who are subject matter experts in industrial to help us grow that business. And everything I just mentioned relates to target customers, also paying close attention to the rest of our customer base, our sales initiatives, in-place design to drive revenue generation across all markets. One of the examples of that is reactivating dormant accounts. In March, we pushed out to our sales force automation tool 7,000 we call quiet accounts, accounts that revenue was declining over the last trailing 12 months. We generated over $1.3 million of additional revenue in March alone by calling on these customers.
Our customer care center is taking more proactive poll in revenue generation across all markets. Our center, to us, is a key differentiator, and we believe our center is the only one in the industry with the ability to solve 100% of the customers' need with one contact. For an example, you can take an order and place it anywhere in North America. You can take a unit off rent or just answer a question. It's multilingual, open 24/7. 
There's a lot going on with our service initiatives as well in 2010. The customer-focused scorecard, our price-optimization software, our workflow process to drive efficiencies and field automation. We've talked about these initiatives before and we'll have more to say as we move to the year to report our progress. But if you have specific questions today, we'll be happy to answer to the best we can.
So service is where our business is at. It's the right thing to focus on and as a differentiator. It's also listening and learning from our customers. It's critically important to revenue generation. Exceptional service earns that customer loyalty. It lends to repeat business and referrals. It also strengthens that relationship between the company and the customers. That makes this easier to ramp up new business when we open cold starts or warm starts. We're now much more efficient at customer service than we have been in the past, able to handle greater inflow of business at lower cost. 
In March, we also streamlined our field platform under the leadership of Matt Flannery, industry veteran with over 20 years of experience. We also continued to optimize our footprint by closing and consolidating seven locations in the first quarter without leaving any market. And our business development team is constantly reviewing market opportunities. We expect to open some strategic cold and warm starts later this year, plus, do some selective consolidations. 
We'll also continue to repurpose our capital to serve the needs of our targeted customers. An example would be our fleet mix, less aerial, more earthmoving, because that's what our customers need. 
So to summarize, while our first quarter results were down year-over-year, we believe that we've seen the lowest point in the cycle based on what we've experienced in March, and now, what we're seeing in April. We're comfortable where the estimation of the recovery will begin in the back half of 2010 and become more universal in 2011. The things that we are hearing and seeing in the field support this. We see positive signs. Our branches are more optimistic in many trade areas. But more importantly, when we go out and we talk to our customers, we're hearing that there's more bidding activity. It's competitive, but nonetheless, there's more bidding activity. We're also in a great place to jump on opportunities presented by the recovery, not indiscriminately, but where our efforts can bear the most fruit. 
Everything we just discussed today will be covered in more detail on our new investor presentation. However, we're doing something different this quarter. It's not posted on our website yet. It contains a lot of new information. However, we want to walk you through it, and we're going to be introducing it this Thursday, the 29th. We're going to webcast it, 12:30 on Eastern time. And I urge all of you to join us, so that we can walk through this together and we hope you find the information very valuable. Now with that, I'm going to pass it over to Bill to review our results, and then we'll go into Q&A and we'll take your questions. Over to you, Bill."

As usual, I'll give more detail on the numbers, but also hope to provide some more color on what made them up. We'll look at cost revenue, and then we'll update our outlook before I finish up.
So first, turning to revenues. For our Rental line of business, our Rental revenue, as Mike mentioned, was down 15% in the quarter. And as you would expect, that revenue was really a story of rates, fleet size and fleet utilization. Mike touched on the rates, down 6.5% for the quarter, on a year-over-year basis. But as you delve a little deeper, there's some positive news there, in that the year-over-year decline for each month of the quarter was less, successively, as you went through the quarter. So March, less of a decline than February, less than January. We've seen that momentum continue in April and are heartened by the fact that, that is continuing. And we hope that portends a better rate environment as we get further into the year.  
Looking forward, in fact, while we're not going to get too aggressive talking about the rate impact that we'll see over the full year, we do think that we will see a slight modest decline of rates, overall for the full year. What we're talking about is something in the low-single digits on a full year basis for rates this year compared to last.
A little bit more context on our fleet. Our fleet size during the quarter was down versus last year, down 6% at the end of the quarter. And obviously, that was a positive in supporting utilization. Utilization, as Mike said, was essentially flat. It was up, actually, a tenth of a percentage point compared to the same quarter last year.
As you look within that, the other interesting piece is that we're seeing some significant gains from certain categories. For example, the earthmoving were up significantly. Earthmoving categories were up 6.5% on a year-over-year basis in time utilization. As we've said before, that's an early cycle component of our portfolio and so we take that as positive news for utilization of the equipment. 
Turning to used equipment sales, revenues from used equipment this quarter were $35 million for our sales. And as Mike mentioned, the margin was 31.4%. It's up 19.5 percentage points compared to last year. And within that, we're seeing, as Mike said, improvement in the prices that we realized in our used equipment sales, whether through our retail channel or through auction or other channels. That's good news. We certainly take that as positive news for where the market is overall. The mix of channels that we use this year was also very favorable. That was another significant part of that improvement in margin.
So we sold 70% of our sales in the quarter through our own retail channels this year. That compares to 34% through retail last year. Auction was 17% of our sales this quarter compared to about 39% last year. So that certainly was a positive contribution in addition to the improvement in underlying equipment prices.
Earthmoving, in particular, was a better performing component of our used sales than other categories. For Contractor Supplies, another solid story for us. Even though the revenue was down materially, down 28% year-over-year, the gross margin improved very significantly. Gross margin was up 230 basis points for the quarter to just over 30% in our Contractor Supplies business. So we're continuing to execute the strategy that we've talked about, focusing on the higher margin sales opportunity, making sure that the sales that we do, do support our Rental line of business. And that's playing out to better margins in that line of business.
Let me now turn to costs and touch on our SG&A performance for the quarter. We delivered $22 million of SG&A reduction for the quarter compared to last year, and that's consistent with what we've been focused on for the last number of quarters. We're looking to take advantage of cost savings in every line of our SG&A. And in this quarter, virtually every line was, again, a save versus last year. 
Specifically, salaries and benefits were a major component, and they came down in line with the significant headcount reduction. Professional fees were down materially as well. They came down in line with our greater focus on being careful on where we engage professional service providers. Travel and entertainment came down as we focused more on what's the right travel and what's the right way to travel to drive savings there. We also saw a modest reduction in bad debt expense for the quarter. 
So all in all, we feel very good about the SG&A performance. Good enough, in fact, to raise our target for SG&A reduction this year to $40 million to $50 million for the full year. And that compares to our previous target of $25 million to $35 million. Now because of some discrete items that we had in the quarter, we won't just annualize the $22 million save that we had in the first quarter. But we are very confident that we can deliver $40 million $50 million of SG&A reduction, and as always, we continue to look for more opportunities.
On our cost of rent excluding depreciation, that came down $19 million in the quarter. And like SG&A, we had contributions from most of the lines of our cost of rent. Salaries and benefits, again, in line with headcount, was a significant contributor. But other areas such as R&M facility costs were also down, and we continue to look for opportunities to continue that momentum.
As we streamline, as we automate, as we really drill into our rental processes, we believe there are more opportunities available. Things like the fast initiative that Mike mentioned, to help optimize our logistics operation, we think, will contribute to our path on costs in our cost of rent lines. We feel comfortable with the outlook that we have provided, $70 million to $90 million. Quite honestly, we're focused on greater opportunities there, and hopefully, we'll be able to continue to deliver good results in those areas.
Put it all together between revenue and cost and you'd see that we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $115 million for the quarter, and that was in a margin of 21.4%. So none of us are satisfied with 21.4% EBITDA margin. But for the first quarter, seasonally the weakest quarter and compared to last year, we think that represents solid performance in the quarter. The EBITDA margin was only three-tenths of a percentage point, down versus last year, and obviously, in light of a 15% rental revenue decline, nearly 19% total revenue decline. We'll claim that as solid performance and we'll continue to look to drive it.
Turning to free cash flow. We generated $99 million of free cash flow for the quarter. That included a $55 million cash tax refund that we received in March. That tax refund is consistent with the cash tax impact that we talked about in February. As we've looked at that cash tax refund and some other tax planning strategies and changes in our estimate, we now think that cash taxes will be a greater contribution to free cash flow than we had initially guided to. So it contributes to our increased outlook for free cash flow for the full year.
We now expect a total of $200 million to $225 million of free cash flow for the full year. And that's up compared to the $175 million to $200 million that we gave in February. It's up primarily because of the SG&A cost reductions, which were essentially all cash and with an improved view on what the cash tax benefit will be roughly $10 million more cash tax benefit than we were in February.
A couple of thoughts on fleet. We continue to drive the fleet strategy, and in terms of leveraging our fleet the best way that we can, transfers are key component. We had 1.2 billion of transfers this quarter, and that was about 33% of our overall fleet involved in our transfer activities over the quarter. When you look at our used sales activity, the age of what we sold from the fleet in our used sales this quarter was 75 months, again, consistent with our strategy of selling the oldest fleet first. And within those sales, about 60% of the sales were in aerial and reach forklift categories that are lagging a little bit in terms of overall market performance.
As I mentioned, on a year-over-year basis, our overall fleet size is down 6% at the quarter end. And this helped us achieve the essentially flat time utilization that we remarked earlier. In terms of rental CapEx, we spent $40 million gross in the quarter, and we spent that money buying categories that we expect to perform well as we go forward. For instance, we're buying high-capacity reach forklifts. We're buying light towers, compressors, excavators and a host of gen rent and earthmoving products that help us focus on the earlier stage activity that we're starting to see. We're skewing our buy away from aerial products, except for very specific categories that continue to see good demand.
Importantly, among that $49 million of spend, about $10 million in the quarter was spent for two specific strategic relationships that we have where we had identified needs with the customer that we spend into, and that reflects the approach that we're trying to take with our rental CapEx spend this year. We want to be targeted and focused in trying to support specific customer needs, along with our general level of spending needed to keep the fleet fresh.
Now just a couple of thoughts on our capital structure. Last night, you noted that we filed an update to our shelf registration. And I must admit, I've been surprised by the level of questions and energy that we've gotten around that filing. Recall last year, that we had initially filed $1 billion shelf in the summertime. We drew down on that shelf in November for our issues of senior unsecured and our convert issue. It left us with a shelf that was about a little north of $300 million. That's not a usable level of shelf capacity from our perspective. And so our filing last night was simply to push our shelf registration size back up to $1 billion. There's nothing specific, nothing concrete going on. We don't have a current plan to issue anything under the shelf, whether debt or equity, and I just wanted to take some time to emphasize that point. It's housekeeping and we'll certainly continue to talk actively about what our thoughts are around the capital structure.
In the quarter, on the capital structure, you'll note that we did redeem the 6 1/2% senior unsecureds in February. That was $435 million of an issue that matured in 2012. So with that redemption, our maturity debts are now essentially clear until 2013 when our ABL matures.
During the quarter, we also temporarily moved a large portion of our Canadian cash position down to the U.S., and we carried that intercompany loan position over the quarter end. So that explains a significant decline in cash balance that you see on the balance sheet. It was roughly $160 million U.S., and obviously, when we moved the cash in the U.S., we used it to pay down the ABL.
Total debt at the end of the quarter was down by $245 million since the year end. And our net debt was down by $96 million. On liquidity, we continue to have an exceptional liquidity position. We ended the quarter with about $800 million of total liquidity. That's made up of $713 million under our ABL facility and another $58 million of capacity under our accounts receivable facility. So we continue to be well positioned in terms of liquidity.
Those are the key comments that I want to make for the quarter. Before we open it up for Q&A, I'd just like to echo the sentiment of Mike's comments. We're seeing positive momentum in our business. And indeed, we are as optimistic as we've been in quite some time. Obviously, rates are still a challenge, but we're focusing on managing rates as actively as we can. The uptick that we see in the used equipment pricing, the strength that we're seeing in time utilization, we think will give us a better basis for managing rate and managing our business overall. 
We're positioning ourselves to take full advantage of it. Too soon to say whether it's cyclical or seasonal, but we certainly feel optimistic and we're going to go after the businesses as strongly as we can. So with that, I'll stop and ask the operator to open up the call for questions and answers. Operator?"

The one that is most significant issue right now is the limitation at the subordinated debt level. The basket calculation for our sub debt RP limitation right now is negative 500 in change. It's a big number. What that means, of course, is that we can't use operating company cash to go below the subordinated debt level of the opco [operating company]. Meaning, we can't use opco cash to buy back stock. We can't use opco cash to buy back any of the debt of the outstanding HoldCo issues. So that's probably the most significant one. There's also an RP limitation within the senior unsubordinated debt of the opco, and that basket is negative about $70 million or so as we speak. And that's really only the result of the net losses that we've experienced since we'd issued our issues last year. That makes sense to you?"

That's not to say that it's not going to be challenges in specific areas, but we've changed the process as well. I mentioned the workflow process. There's a lot of things that we're doing differently today than we've done in the past. That will change the outcome in the future. Those things still have to play out. Obviously, if we start adding fleet, yes, we're going to have to add more people as we go forward, but we still think we've got a bandwidth here that we can clearly control. And when you look at what the costs that we've taken out, we've said that roughly 55% or more is going to be out permanently as we go forward. And obviously, in SG&A, yes, that's one that's going to fluctuate. It's going to fluctuate as revenues go up. Sales expense will be there. Other things, there's some inflationary factors around fuel could go up and have an impact. So on balance, we think that we've got very good controls in place. Our people understand it.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome. On the call with me today is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of our senior management team. I want to start with a quick overview of the results we reported last night",1993,"Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. On the call with me today is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of our senior management team. 
I want to start with a quick overview of the results we reported last night, and then focus on the metrics that indicate changes that are starting to take effect in our markets and within our company. I'll talk about the drivers of change, the seasonal, cyclical and our strategy in particular, and share some insights into what kind of demand we expect to see over the next six to 12 months. But still too early to speak in absolutes, but the second quarter did shed some light on the cycle
As you saw in our press release, we had a strong quarter. The environment is better. Our strategy is taking hold. We're more optimistic than we have been for some time, and we appear to be seeing the early stages of an upturn. And while we continue to bear down on cost, our focus is now on growing the business. So let's start with the results
We made money in the second quarter. Last year, revenues were slightly higher in the period but gross profit was lower and earnings per share was negative. So it's clear that we've improved the business from top to bottom. EBITDA is up. We reported a significant increase in adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter from 24.4% last year to 32.1% this year. There's a lot of discipline behind those numbers starting with the revenue line.
Our rental revenues outperformed the operating environment in the second quarter. Total non-residential construction spending, which includes both private and public construction was down 16.1% in April year-over-year and down 15.2% in May. And you compare that to our rental revenues, which were down less than 1% for the quarter. At the same time, our same-store rental revenues were actually up 2.7%. So going hard after the business that's out there, implementing our market strategy, identifying and going after the right types of customers and winning more profitable jobs, but we're staying very aware of the quality of our revenues, not just the quantity. We'll talk more about our strategy in just a moment
Now on the cost side, we took $11 million of SG&A expense out of the business compared to the second quarter last year. We also brought down our cost of equipment rentals x depreciation by $4 million. Bill will talk in just a moment about where we are in these initiatives and what we see for the balance of the year. With CapEx, we've a lot of bandwidth to react to the market conditions. We bought $125 million of new fleet in the second quarter. We also sold $80 million of used OEC at 24.3% margin. And we ended the quarter with $3.8 billion of fleet with an average age of 45 months.
So we're very disciplined around the use of our capital and CapEx. At the same time, managing our liquidity very carefully and despite buying more fleet then we originally planned, still generated positive free cash flow of $8 million in the quarter. 
Now I'll spend a few minutes to talk about the two dynamics that drive our numbers. Rental rates and utilization. As you saw, rates were down 2% in the quarter year-over-year. Still a lot of pressure on pricing out there but if you dissect the quarter, the sequential trends are promising. We are continuing to focus very intensely on rates. It's a huge priority for our business, and I would say for the industry as well. 
We estimate that every point of rate is worth about $18 million of annual EBITDA to us, so I can assure you we're doing everything in our power to reverse the year-over-year trend on rates. Our approach is very informed and very disciplined. We're working to achieve the optimal price on every contract. We're also walking away from unprofitable deals and we're implementing the price optimization software, which we call core, which if you recall is about dynamic pricing, each price subject to that type of customer. The core is currently rolled out to 75% of our branches and we'll complete it by the end of August. Right now, short-term transactional business is trending upwards as it always does in the spring and summer. Smaller construction projects coming on line, they typically are daily and weekly rentals and they involve less price negotiation, better rates
In the second quarter, about 70% of our business was monthly. Monthly rates are always going to recover last because equipment stays out for longer periods of time at fixed rates. Monthly rates are still a good long-term strategy for us and are more profitable over time, but they also recover last. Still, 30% of our districts in the U.S. and Canada showed a year-over-year rate improvement in the second quarter
The other dynamic I mentioned is utilization. As you know, a combination of rates and time utilization drive dollar utilization in our business. Yesterday, we reported a record second quarter time utilization of 65.4%. Our dollar utilization increased to 46.7%, which is 1.8 percentage points higher than last year. It's worth noting that we had $40 million of original equipment [ph] (22:34) cost on rent more compared to last year. And even though the average size of our fleet actually decreased by $186 million. 
So where's demand coming from? We believe that we're seeing the early stages of a cyclical uptick on top of the normal seasonal benefit. The tight credit markets are also helping us with our access to capital, more contractors are renting equipment as opposed to buying it. And from a macro standpoint, we're definitely seeing more spending in public construction. The public transportation sector in particular is showing year-over-year growth in spending --
Residential construction is recovering in some trade areas but it's not a big market for us, but everything else. Infrastructure jobs are now beginning to come online and energy and hospital construction is holding steady. The weak link is commercial construction. There's very little activity and we expect it to recover last. Now taking a look at it from a geography standpoint, our key indicator is same-store rental revenue and six of our nine operating regions showed a year-over-year growth in the second quarter. Canada continues to be strong especially northeast Canada. And in the U.S., we're seeing activity increased by trade area rather than broad regional patterns. But revenues increased in parts of the Southeast driven by demand for general construction equipment. And the Southeast had year-over-year growth and rental revenues
In the Gulf, we saw choppy growth and the region, as a whole, is basically flat. However, if you set aside the impact of Mexico, which we sold the Briggs halfway through the quarter, rental revenue for the Gulf was actually up year-over-year. Now our weakest geographies are still the Southwest and some of the markets to the central part of the U.S., although we're beginning to see pockets of opportunity in both those regions
Now I want to mention our Trench, Power and HVAC business, which reported a 13% increase in rental revenues in the second quarter; obviously, getting a boost from stimulus spending. Our Trench business has equipment currently, today, on 194 stimulus jobs. They're mostly infrastructure projects and we expect to see stimulus spending last for at least another 12 months or maybe longer
The Power and HVAC rentals is a growth area for us in that business. Our teams responded to floods this spring in Rhode Island and Tennessee and we're currently, supplying power and climate control to  a number of cleanup camps in the Gulf. Right now, we're averaging approximately $250,000 of rental revenues per month related to the oil spill. So basically, it's very choppy out there but things are getting better. We can sense it in the field as well. Customers are telling us they're bidding more jobs although it's still extremely competitive. Now we're cautiously optimistic but a little less cautious and more optimistic than we were in April. 
At the same time, we're not relying on the external environment. we're taking control by driving some of the performance from the inside, using our customer segmentation strategy to focus on building relationships with large construction and industrial customers service to our single point of contact. And we know from experience that large customers are less cyclical and more stable. They appreciate our broad footprint across North America and they almost have an untapped share of wallet that we could earn at a lower cost.
Now we signed 130 new National Accounts to June 30. Now 40% of those were industrial accounts. Now as you can see, we're moving closer to our goal of 30% of revenue from the industrial market. It will take some time to get there but each quarter brings us closer and I have all the confidence that we'll achieve our goal. Now segmentation is a larger part of our go-to-market strategy called, ""Operation United"". It includes optimization of our fleet footprint, corporate operations and most importantly, our customer service capabilities
Now I said many times, service is a critical differentiator for us, particularly in our industry. If we get service right, the revenues will follow. And we received some good news with service recently with our net promoter store. They told the customers, especially larger customers, are recognizing how committed we are to customer service. That's gratifying for our employees because they're the ones on the front lines driving customer satisfaction.
Now I mentioned that we're pivoting the company toward revenue generation. That's going to be the story going forward, it's about growth and value creation. In addition to segmentation, we have a number of revenue initiatives underway, some of which I started talking about in the first quarter. An aggressive push to new business. In the second quarter, we signed 6,600 new accounts. That's a 25% increase over last year. We also reactivated dormant accounts, and year-to-date, we reactivated 6,100 dormant accounts and generated $16 million of rental revenue from this group alone. And we continue to optimize our branch footprint, positioning our branches in promising markets where they have the opportunity to perform well. And we're close to consolidate at 10 branches in the second quarter. 
However, we also opened two new cold starts and we didn't exit any markets in that process. Now we also intend to grow our power HVAC presence this year and into next. So as you can see, all the various parts of our strategy are starting to mesh. And our employees have been exceptional in pursuit to this goals. Our second quarter performance is really a credit to their hard work, great attitude and their professionalism. They really embraced our strategy. It's only appropriate I want to tip my hat to all the employees who are on this call today, and they deserve it.
Now so to summarize, we said in April that we believe the first quarter was the lowest point in the cycle and so far, that appears to be true. Now I want to be very candid with everyone. This is an environment that is still uncertain. there are challenges but things are getting better. The second quarter started well, we got better as we moved through the quarter. Construction spending is still spongy and our activity will shift up and down for a little. But our current advantage point today, we expect many of our end markets to show modest growth as the year progresses moving toward a broader recovery in 2011 and 2012. So when you look at our second quarter performance in this context, frankly, we're very encouraged. 
Now in that note, we'll now shift you over to Bill to review our results and then, we'll take your questions after that. So over to you, Bill."
36005,109039086,68225,"United Rentals, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-21-2010",2010-07-21,"Earnings Calls","United Rentals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As usual, I'll give a little bit more detail on the financial results for the quarter and then I'll update our outlook for the remainder of the year. First, looking at our revenue performance, in the Rental li",2210,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As usual, I'll give a little bit more detail on the financial results for the quarter and then I'll update our outlook for the remainder of the year. 
First, looking at our revenue performance, in the Rental line of business, as Mike said, this was a strong quarter for us. No revenue was down less than 1% in the quarter. And as you'd expect, it's about the interplay of fleet size, fleet utilization and rental rates. On the fleet side of things, the average size of our fleet was down by about 5% in the quarter compared to last year. But despite that smaller fleet, we were able to put more OEC on rent. OEC on rent for the quarter was actually up by 2% versus last year in the quarter
So more OEC on rent, smaller fleet size, put them together and you get what was really impressive time utilization for the quarter. 65.4% is a record for the company in the second quarter. That's up 4.1 percentage points versus last year and as we look closer at that increase, we saw very nice improvement in certain key categories. 
Earthmoving equipment, for example, was particularly strong. The OEC on rent, dollars for earthmoving equipment for the quarter was up 11% compared to last year. So that helped drive that overall 2% improvement in OEC on rent. And we take heart from that because, as you know, earthmoving equipment tends to be earlier in the cycle when things are improving.
While when we look at our rental rates, as Mike mentioned, we were down 2% year-over-year on rental rate. Although on a sequential basis, the second quarter was about flat with the first quarter of this year. As you look within that and take a look at each month sequential improvement during the quarter, it was an improvement. So every month in the second quarter was better than the prior month in the second quarter. And that follows the first quarter where the pattern was the opposite. In the first quarter, every month sequentially was a little worse than the prior month. That turned around in the second quarter, and so the net effect in the quarter was a quarter that was sequentially flat with the first quarter. By the way, that string of sequential month improvements in the second quarter so far continues into July. 
So you put that rate performance together, and while rates are not where we want to be long-term, the trend is positive. And it fits with the view that we've expressed about the sequence of a recovery. So first, we expected to see used equipment prices recover. That's been going on according routes and others. Then you'd expect to see utilization rebound. Certainly, you'd have to say that we got a nice rebound utilization. And then we expect to see rates improve. Hopefully we're at the early stage of a sustained improvement in rates
When you look at rates on a full-year basis, we're still saying what we said at the last quarter. We expect the full-year rate performance to be only modestly down. We're still calling it down something in the low single digits compared to the year. 
When you look at our used equipment activities this quarter, we generated $37 million of proceeds from our used equipment sales. And though that's down significantly from last year, remember last year in the second quarter, we were aggressively downsizing the fleet. And so we were selling a lot of equipment. We sold $271 million of OEC last year compared to only $80 million of OEC this year. 
Our margins have shown a dramatic improvement. The 24.3% margin that we realized in the second quarter compares to a negative 9.5% last year. That margin performance reflects both a shift in channels and also overall an improved pricing. In terms of channel mix, our retail contribution was 60% this quarter. That compares to only 26% last year
From the flip side, the option channel this quarter was only 22% and that compares to 52% option last year. Pricing meanwhile has improved across nearly all categories and that certainly is reflected in the activity that we're seeing in the used market. And you can see that in external sources such as Ralph's reports.
Turning to our cost performance, Mike mentioned we delivered $11 million of SG&A reduction this quarter. And consistent with what we've seen over the last number of quarters, that reduction came across the great majority of lines within SG&A. In particular, we had benefits in salaries and benefit expense. Those came down in line with headcount reductions that we've realized since last year. We also had a nice quarter in professional fee reductions. We've been more disciplined and focused on use of service providers and professional fees came down nicely as a result. But we also had contributions in the SG&A save from many other lines as well.
So given the trends that we've seen, even though the top line performance is stronger than what we expected earlier in the year, and therefore there's going to be pressure on selling cost, even with all that, we still are comfortable reaffirming our target for $40 million to $50 million of full year SG&A reductions. And as always, we'll keep looking for more and drive that as much as we possibly can.
On the cost of rent lines excluding depreciation, that story is a little bit more complex. We did reduce cost to rent x depreciation by $4 million versus last year. And within that, salary and benefit cost were our main driver. Again, headcount reductions being a main component there. We also had lower facility cost as we see some of the impact of the closures that we've had since last year. But when you look at the full year for cost of rent, we're taking down our estimate for the full year reduction by about $40 million. So right now, we're looking for full year savings and cost of rent in the range of $30 million to $50 million
That's not great news on the surface but there are some real positives when you look into the details. That reduction in the expected save really has driven by variable cost that flow from higher volume. We got more rental transactions than we expected. We're running at a higher time utilization than we expected. We've got more OEC on rent as a result and so you put all that together and the variable cost components are going to be higher. And so our ability to save versus last year is reduced. In particular, repair and maintenance expense, delivery expense and overtime are the biggest drivers of our revised outlook.
Turning to EBITDA and EPS performance, first on EBITDA. Our adjusted EBITDA up for the quarter was $179 million and that was at a margin of 32.1%. Very nice improvement in the margins, 770 basis points versus last year. That's especially significant given that our total revenues were down 9%. 
Although 32% is not where we want to be long term, it certainly is a significant improvement and it gives a sense of a very nice operating leverage that we're building into the business as we focus on driving those key customer relationships and continuing to manage cost. In fact, to put it into some perspective, 32.1% margin this quarter is higher than the second quarter margin that we achieved in the second quarter of 2007. And arguably, you could call that the peak of the last cycle. So we feel good about the EBITDA performance we delivered this year.
Looking at EPS, we delivered EPS on a GAAP basis of $0.18 in the quarter. And as we noted on the release last night, that $0.18 includes the effect of a tax benefit of $9 million taken in the second quarter. That benefit arises out of a change in our full year projection. As we look at the full year now and we calculate the expected tax that we will have to provide over the course of the year, we get an effective tax rate for the full year of about 55%. And as we apply that 55% rate to the first half performance as GAAP requires, it resulted in the benefit that you saw in the second quarter
Even when you adjust for that tax matter by the way, we still feel good about the quarter that we just delivered overall. The only other point I'll make on EPS is that the number of shares and the diluted EPS calculation went up as we went into a positive net income. You have to include more share. So the share count for the quarter was 68 million shares in the diluted EPS calculation 
Now some thoughts on our fleet. We continue to drive our fleet strategy. First, on leveraging the existing fleet to the max, we're transferring fleet as we have been for the last several years. We're transferring fleet very aggressively. We transferred $1.6 billion in fleet in total in the quarter. That's about 42% of our overall fleet moving around during the course of the quarter. We continue to execute our life cycle management approach by selling older equipment from our fleet. Our used sales during the quarter were made at an average age of 71 months. And again, that's consistent with our view that we should be selling the older equipment as we manage the fleet to be more effective for our customers. By the way, that 71 months is slightly lower than it's been over the last few quarters, and that really reflects the impact of the sale of equipment in Mexico. The average age of the equipment that we sold in Mexico was a little less than normal. If you strip out Mexico, the average age of the other fleet that we sold is about 74 months, not significantly different
In terms of our rental spend, we spent $125 million of gross rental CapEx in the quarter. And we're buying categories with that spend that we expect to perform well in the near term. So for instance, we're buying forklifts, we're buying light towers, compressors, excavators, really a host of general rental and earthmoving products and skewing away from aerial products in the spend. We are spending a little bit on aerial but doing so in specific categories like big booms, which are still in good demand.
We're also buying categories, quite honestly, that fit with the demand we're seeing from our customer groups. As we look at specific customers and specific projects and we have visibility to the fleet that's needed to support those, we've been spending more money on those types of situations. 
In terms of our full-year CapEx expectations and given the strong demand that we're seeing and couple that with the focus that we have on support in the key accounts, we decided that we should raise our outlook for full year net rental CapEx. We're now expecting to spend between $160 million to $180 million of net rental CapEx. That's up $60 million from our prior range.
And as I mentioned, that strong demand that we're seeing is expected to continue into the back half, and we are confident that as we do put that new CapEx into our fleet, that we'll be able to put that fleet on rent right away. So that's our strategy on fleet. We're going to target the spend on specific categories. We're going to support specific accounts, and we're going to really focus on driving returns out of the investment
A couple of real brief thoughts on free cash flow. We generated $8 million of free cash flow in the quarter and, while that may not seem like a big number, it's impressive given our fleet spend that I just spent some time on. We think our full year, when you put all together the time utilization, the impact of our cost of rent changes, the greater fleet spend, the full year free cash flow still feels good to us at $200 million to $225 million. So we're maintaining our forecast for $200 million  to $225 million for the year. And as always, we're going to look for more and we'll share it to you as we identify it.
Real briefly and lastly on liquidity, we maintain a very strong liquidity position. At the end of the quarter, we had $800 million of total liquidity. Principally that was from availability under our ABL Facility, so we're well-positioned to be able to support whatever capital investment need that we identify.
So those are my key comments on the quarter. I'll stop talking, open it up for Q&A right now. But before we do that, I guess I'll just reemphasize that as we look at this quarter, it was a strong quarter and we feel very good about what we are able to deliver. Continue to be cautious about our outlook going forward but we're going to be there to take full advantage of whatever the market offers to us. 
So I'll stop there and ask the operator to open up the call for Q&A."

What we said is that we don't feel uncomfortable at that level even though it's higher than the optimum range that we talked about historically. Historically, we've talked about a 35- to 45-month optimum range. But operating in the high 40s or even low 50s, even mid-50s would not impact our ability to generate revenue. We're very convinced of that. In fact, again, if you refer to Ralph's about the industry data, Ralph's would tell you that the average rental fleet is already north of 50 months in average age. So we feel comfortable with what we've got on the plate for this year. Next year, we haven't sat down and really nailed a view of where the fleet age is going to go next year. And so we'll certainly talk about it as we get further into our planning process for next year. What I will say is that as a rule of thumb, in order to maintain the size and the age of our fleet constant through a course of a year, we would have to spend about $575 million gross rental CapEx. And obviously, the net would be less than that as you assume some reasonable amount of new sales, so $575 million gross to keep age and size constant across the year. And that will inform how we think about our spend is going forward."

In terms of thinking, and we did not use any of that cash directly from the intercompany Canadian U.S. loan to repurchase the subnotes that we repurchased in the second quarter. On the subnote repurchases, that was done out of URI. It used part of the cash capacity at URI to execute those, and we had to because of the limitations on our restricted payments basket that arises out of various debt facilities. We used roughly $24 million, $25 million of that cash capacity. At the end of the quarter, if you look in the Q and the guarantor statements, you'll see that, that cash capacity stood at about $55 million at the end of the quarter, and so that's what we have available to make further repurchases.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome. On the call with me today is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of our senior management team. I want to start with a quick overview of the results we reported last night",1993,"Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. On the call with me today is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of our senior management team. 
I want to start with a quick overview of the results we reported last night, and then focus on the metrics that indicate changes that are starting to take effect in our markets and within our company. I'll talk about the drivers of change, the seasonal, cyclical and our strategy in particular, and share some insights into what kind of demand we expect to see over the next six to 12 months. But still too early to speak in absolutes, but the second quarter did shed some light on the cycle
As you saw in our press release, we had a strong quarter. The environment is better. Our strategy is taking hold. We're more optimistic than we have been for some time, and we appear to be seeing the early stages of an upturn. And while we continue to bear down on cost, our focus is now on growing the business. So let's start with the results
We made money in the second quarter. Last year, revenues were slightly higher in the period but gross profit was lower and earnings per share was negative. So it's clear that we've improved the business from top to bottom. EBITDA is up. We reported a significant increase in adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter from 24.4% last year to 32.1% this year. There's a lot of discipline behind those numbers starting with the revenue line.
Our rental revenues outperformed the operating environment in the second quarter. Total non-residential construction spending, which includes both private and public construction was down 16.1% in April year-over-year and down 15.2% in May. And you compare that to our rental revenues, which were down less than 1% for the quarter. At the same time, our same-store rental revenues were actually up 2.7%. So going hard after the business that's out there, implementing our market strategy, identifying and going after the right types of customers and winning more profitable jobs, but we're staying very aware of the quality of our revenues, not just the quantity. We'll talk more about our strategy in just a moment
Now on the cost side, we took $11 million of SG&A expense out of the business compared to the second quarter last year. We also brought down our cost of equipment rentals x depreciation by $4 million. Bill will talk in just a moment about where we are in these initiatives and what we see for the balance of the year. With CapEx, we've a lot of bandwidth to react to the market conditions. We bought $125 million of new fleet in the second quarter. We also sold $80 million of used OEC at 24.3% margin. And we ended the quarter with $3.8 billion of fleet with an average age of 45 months.
So we're very disciplined around the use of our capital and CapEx. At the same time, managing our liquidity very carefully and despite buying more fleet then we originally planned, still generated positive free cash flow of $8 million in the quarter. 
Now I'll spend a few minutes to talk about the two dynamics that drive our numbers. Rental rates and utilization. As you saw, rates were down 2% in the quarter year-over-year. Still a lot of pressure on pricing out there but if you dissect the quarter, the sequential trends are promising. We are continuing to focus very intensely on rates. It's a huge priority for our business, and I would say for the industry as well. 
We estimate that every point of rate is worth about $18 million of annual EBITDA to us, so I can assure you we're doing everything in our power to reverse the year-over-year trend on rates. Our approach is very informed and very disciplined. We're working to achieve the optimal price on every contract. We're also walking away from unprofitable deals and we're implementing the price optimization software, which we call core, which if you recall is about dynamic pricing, each price subject to that type of customer. The core is currently rolled out to 75% of our branches and we'll complete it by the end of August. Right now, short-term transactional business is trending upwards as it always does in the spring and summer. Smaller construction projects coming on line, they typically are daily and weekly rentals and they involve less price negotiation, better rates
In the second quarter, about 70% of our business was monthly. Monthly rates are always going to recover last because equipment stays out for longer periods of time at fixed rates. Monthly rates are still a good long-term strategy for us and are more profitable over time, but they also recover last. Still, 30% of our districts in the U.S. and Canada showed a year-over-year rate improvement in the second quarter
The other dynamic I mentioned is utilization. As you know, a combination of rates and time utilization drive dollar utilization in our business. Yesterday, we reported a record second quarter time utilization of 65.4%. Our dollar utilization increased to 46.7%, which is 1.8 percentage points higher than last year. It's worth noting that we had $40 million of original equipment [ph] (22:34) cost on rent more compared to last year. And even though the average size of our fleet actually decreased by $186 million. 
So where's demand coming from? We believe that we're seeing the early stages of a cyclical uptick on top of the normal seasonal benefit. The tight credit markets are also helping us with our access to capital, more contractors are renting equipment as opposed to buying it. And from a macro standpoint, we're definitely seeing more spending in public construction. The public transportation sector in particular is showing year-over-year growth in spending --
Residential construction is recovering in some trade areas but it's not a big market for us, but everything else. Infrastructure jobs are now beginning to come online and energy and hospital construction is holding steady. The weak link is commercial construction. There's very little activity and we expect it to recover last. Now taking a look at it from a geography standpoint, our key indicator is same-store rental revenue and six of our nine operating regions showed a year-over-year growth in the second quarter. Canada continues to be strong especially northeast Canada. And in the U.S., we're seeing activity increased by trade area rather than broad regional patterns. But revenues increased in parts of the Southeast driven by demand for general construction equipment. And the Southeast had year-over-year growth and rental revenues
In the Gulf, we saw choppy growth and the region, as a whole, is basically flat. However, if you set aside the impact of Mexico, which we sold the Briggs halfway through the quarter, rental revenue for the Gulf was actually up year-over-year. Now our weakest geographies are still the Southwest and some of the markets to the central part of the U.S., although we're beginning to see pockets of opportunity in both those regions
Now I want to mention our Trench, Power and HVAC business, which reported a 13% increase in rental revenues in the second quarter; obviously, getting a boost from stimulus spending. Our Trench business has equipment currently, today, on 194 stimulus jobs. They're mostly infrastructure projects and we expect to see stimulus spending last for at least another 12 months or maybe longer
The Power and HVAC rentals is a growth area for us in that business. Our teams responded to floods this spring in Rhode Island and Tennessee and we're currently, supplying power and climate control to  a number of cleanup camps in the Gulf. Right now, we're averaging approximately $250,000 of rental revenues per month related to the oil spill. So basically, it's very choppy out there but things are getting better. We can sense it in the field as well. Customers are telling us they're bidding more jobs although it's still extremely competitive. Now we're cautiously optimistic but a little less cautious and more optimistic than we were in April. 
At the same time, we're not relying on the external environment. we're taking control by driving some of the performance from the inside, using our customer segmentation strategy to focus on building relationships with large construction and industrial customers service to our single point of contact. And we know from experience that large customers are less cyclical and more stable. They appreciate our broad footprint across North America and they almost have an untapped share of wallet that we could earn at a lower cost.
Now we signed 130 new National Accounts to June 30. Now 40% of those were industrial accounts. Now as you can see, we're moving closer to our goal of 30% of revenue from the industrial market. It will take some time to get there but each quarter brings us closer and I have all the confidence that we'll achieve our goal. Now segmentation is a larger part of our go-to-market strategy called, ""Operation United"". It includes optimization of our fleet footprint, corporate operations and most importantly, our customer service capabilities
Now I said many times, service is a critical differentiator for us, particularly in our industry. If we get service right, the revenues will follow. And we received some good news with service recently with our net promoter store. They told the customers, especially larger customers, are recognizing how committed we are to customer service. That's gratifying for our employees because they're the ones on the front lines driving customer satisfaction.
Now I mentioned that we're pivoting the company toward revenue generation. That's going to be the story going forward, it's about growth and value creation. In addition to segmentation, we have a number of revenue initiatives underway, some of which I started talking about in the first quarter. An aggressive push to new business. In the second quarter, we signed 6,600 new accounts. That's a 25% increase over last year. We also reactivated dormant accounts, and year-to-date, we reactivated 6,100 dormant accounts and generated $16 million of rental revenue from this group alone. And we continue to optimize our branch footprint, positioning our branches in promising markets where they have the opportunity to perform well. And we're close to consolidate at 10 branches in the second quarter. 
However, we also opened two new cold starts and we didn't exit any markets in that process. Now we also intend to grow our power HVAC presence this year and into next. So as you can see, all the various parts of our strategy are starting to mesh. And our employees have been exceptional in pursuit to this goals. Our second quarter performance is really a credit to their hard work, great attitude and their professionalism. They really embraced our strategy. It's only appropriate I want to tip my hat to all the employees who are on this call today, and they deserve it.
Now so to summarize, we said in April that we believe the first quarter was the lowest point in the cycle and so far, that appears to be true. Now I want to be very candid with everyone. This is an environment that is still uncertain. there are challenges but things are getting better. The second quarter started well, we got better as we moved through the quarter. Construction spending is still spongy and our activity will shift up and down for a little. But our current advantage point today, we expect many of our end markets to show modest growth as the year progresses moving toward a broader recovery in 2011 and 2012. So when you look at our second quarter performance in this context, frankly, we're very encouraged. 
Now in that note, we'll now shift you over to Bill to review our results and then, we'll take your questions after that. So over to you, Bill.

As usual, I'll give a little bit more detail on the financial results for the quarter and then I'll update our outlook for the remainder of the year. First, looking at our revenue performance, in the Rental li",2210,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As usual, I'll give a little bit more detail on the financial results for the quarter and then I'll update our outlook for the remainder of the year. 
First, looking at our revenue performance, in the Rental line of business, as Mike said, this was a strong quarter for us. No revenue was down less than 1% in the quarter. And as you'd expect, it's about the interplay of fleet size, fleet utilization and rental rates. On the fleet side of things, the average size of our fleet was down by about 5% in the quarter compared to last year. But despite that smaller fleet, we were able to put more OEC on rent. OEC on rent for the quarter was actually up by 2% versus last year in the quarter
So more OEC on rent, smaller fleet size, put them together and you get what was really impressive time utilization for the quarter. 65.4% is a record for the company in the second quarter. That's up 4.1 percentage points versus last year and as we look closer at that increase, we saw very nice improvement in certain key categories. 
Earthmoving equipment, for example, was particularly strong. The OEC on rent, dollars for earthmoving equipment for the quarter was up 11% compared to last year. So that helped drive that overall 2% improvement in OEC on rent. And we take heart from that because, as you know, earthmoving equipment tends to be earlier in the cycle when things are improving.
While when we look at our rental rates, as Mike mentioned, we were down 2% year-over-year on rental rate. Although on a sequential basis, the second quarter was about flat with the first quarter of this year. As you look within that and take a look at each month sequential improvement during the quarter, it was an improvement. So every month in the second quarter was better than the prior month in the second quarter. And that follows the first quarter where the pattern was the opposite. In the first quarter, every month sequentially was a little worse than the prior month. That turned around in the second quarter, and so the net effect in the quarter was a quarter that was sequentially flat with the first quarter. By the way, that string of sequential month improvements in the second quarter so far continues into July. 
So you put that rate performance together, and while rates are not where we want to be long-term, the trend is positive. And it fits with the view that we've expressed about the sequence of a recovery. So first, we expected to see used equipment prices recover. That's been going on according routes and others. Then you'd expect to see utilization rebound. Certainly, you'd have to say that we got a nice rebound utilization. And then we expect to see rates improve. Hopefully we're at the early stage of a sustained improvement in rates
When you look at rates on a full-year basis, we're still saying what we said at the last quarter. We expect the full-year rate performance to be only modestly down. We're still calling it down something in the low single digits compared to the year. 
When you look at our used equipment activities this quarter, we generated $37 million of proceeds from our used equipment sales. And though that's down significantly from last year, remember last year in the second quarter, we were aggressively downsizing the fleet. And so we were selling a lot of equipment. We sold $271 million of OEC last year compared to only $80 million of OEC this year. 
Our margins have shown a dramatic improvement. The 24.3% margin that we realized in the second quarter compares to a negative 9.5% last year. That margin performance reflects both a shift in channels and also overall an improved pricing. In terms of channel mix, our retail contribution was 60% this quarter. That compares to only 26% last year
From the flip side, the option channel this quarter was only 22% and that compares to 52% option last year. Pricing meanwhile has improved across nearly all categories and that certainly is reflected in the activity that we're seeing in the used market. And you can see that in external sources such as Ralph's reports.
Turning to our cost performance, Mike mentioned we delivered $11 million of SG&A reduction this quarter. And consistent with what we've seen over the last number of quarters, that reduction came across the great majority of lines within SG&A. In particular, we had benefits in salaries and benefit expense. Those came down in line with headcount reductions that we've realized since last year. We also had a nice quarter in professional fee reductions. We've been more disciplined and focused on use of service providers and professional fees came down nicely as a result. But we also had contributions in the SG&A save from many other lines as well.
So given the trends that we've seen, even though the top line performance is stronger than what we expected earlier in the year, and therefore there's going to be pressure on selling cost, even with all that, we still are comfortable reaffirming our target for $40 million to $50 million of full year SG&A reductions. And as always, we'll keep looking for more and drive that as much as we possibly can.
On the cost of rent lines excluding depreciation, that story is a little bit more complex. We did reduce cost to rent x depreciation by $4 million versus last year. And within that, salary and benefit cost were our main driver. Again, headcount reductions being a main component there. We also had lower facility cost as we see some of the impact of the closures that we've had since last year. But when you look at the full year for cost of rent, we're taking down our estimate for the full year reduction by about $40 million. So right now, we're looking for full year savings and cost of rent in the range of $30 million to $50 million
That's not great news on the surface but there are some real positives when you look into the details. That reduction in the expected save really has driven by variable cost that flow from higher volume. We got more rental transactions than we expected. We're running at a higher time utilization than we expected. We've got more OEC on rent as a result and so you put all that together and the variable cost components are going to be higher. And so our ability to save versus last year is reduced. In particular, repair and maintenance expense, delivery expense and overtime are the biggest drivers of our revised outlook.
Turning to EBITDA and EPS performance, first on EBITDA. Our adjusted EBITDA up for the quarter was $179 million and that was at a margin of 32.1%. Very nice improvement in the margins, 770 basis points versus last year. That's especially significant given that our total revenues were down 9%. 
Although 32% is not where we want to be long term, it certainly is a significant improvement and it gives a sense of a very nice operating leverage that we're building into the business as we focus on driving those key customer relationships and continuing to manage cost. In fact, to put it into some perspective, 32.1% margin this quarter is higher than the second quarter margin that we achieved in the second quarter of 2007. And arguably, you could call that the peak of the last cycle. So we feel good about the EBITDA performance we delivered this year.
Looking at EPS, we delivered EPS on a GAAP basis of $0.18 in the quarter. And as we noted on the release last night, that $0.18 includes the effect of a tax benefit of $9 million taken in the second quarter. That benefit arises out of a change in our full year projection. As we look at the full year now and we calculate the expected tax that we will have to provide over the course of the year, we get an effective tax rate for the full year of about 55%. And as we apply that 55% rate to the first half performance as GAAP requires, it resulted in the benefit that you saw in the second quarter
Even when you adjust for that tax matter by the way, we still feel good about the quarter that we just delivered overall. The only other point I'll make on EPS is that the number of shares and the diluted EPS calculation went up as we went into a positive net income. You have to include more share. So the share count for the quarter was 68 million shares in the diluted EPS calculation 
Now some thoughts on our fleet. We continue to drive our fleet strategy. First, on leveraging the existing fleet to the max, we're transferring fleet as we have been for the last several years. We're transferring fleet very aggressively. We transferred $1.6 billion in fleet in total in the quarter. That's about 42% of our overall fleet moving around during the course of the quarter. We continue to execute our life cycle management approach by selling older equipment from our fleet. Our used sales during the quarter were made at an average age of 71 months. And again, that's consistent with our view that we should be selling the older equipment as we manage the fleet to be more effective for our customers. By the way, that 71 months is slightly lower than it's been over the last few quarters, and that really reflects the impact of the sale of equipment in Mexico. The average age of the equipment that we sold in Mexico was a little less than normal. If you strip out Mexico, the average age of the other fleet that we sold is about 74 months, not significantly different
In terms of our rental spend, we spent $125 million of gross rental CapEx in the quarter. And we're buying categories with that spend that we expect to perform well in the near term. So for instance, we're buying forklifts, we're buying light towers, compressors, excavators, really a host of general rental and earthmoving products and skewing away from aerial products in the spend. We are spending a little bit on aerial but doing so in specific categories like big booms, which are still in good demand.
We're also buying categories, quite honestly, that fit with the demand we're seeing from our customer groups. As we look at specific customers and specific projects and we have visibility to the fleet that's needed to support those, we've been spending more money on those types of situations. 
In terms of our full-year CapEx expectations and given the strong demand that we're seeing and couple that with the focus that we have on support in the key accounts, we decided that we should raise our outlook for full year net rental CapEx. We're now expecting to spend between $160 million to $180 million of net rental CapEx. That's up $60 million from our prior range.
And as I mentioned, that strong demand that we're seeing is expected to continue into the back half, and we are confident that as we do put that new CapEx into our fleet, that we'll be able to put that fleet on rent right away. So that's our strategy on fleet. We're going to target the spend on specific categories. We're going to support specific accounts, and we're going to really focus on driving returns out of the investment
A couple of real brief thoughts on free cash flow. We generated $8 million of free cash flow in the quarter and, while that may not seem like a big number, it's impressive given our fleet spend that I just spent some time on. We think our full year, when you put all together the time utilization, the impact of our cost of rent changes, the greater fleet spend, the full year free cash flow still feels good to us at $200 million to $225 million. So we're maintaining our forecast for $200 million  to $225 million for the year. And as always, we're going to look for more and we'll share it to you as we identify it.
Real briefly and lastly on liquidity, we maintain a very strong liquidity position. At the end of the quarter, we had $800 million of total liquidity. Principally that was from availability under our ABL Facility, so we're well-positioned to be able to support whatever capital investment need that we identify.
So those are my key comments on the quarter. I'll stop talking, open it up for Q&A right now. But before we do that, I guess I'll just reemphasize that as we look at this quarter, it was a strong quarter and we feel very good about what we are able to deliver. Continue to be cautious about our outlook going forward but we're going to be there to take full advantage of whatever the market offers to us. 
So I'll stop there and ask the operator to open up the call for Q&A.

Historically, we've talked about a 35- to 45-month optimum range. But operating in the high 40s or even low 50s, even mid-50s would not impact our ability to generate revenue. We're very convinced of that. In fact, again, if you refer to Ralph's about the industry data, Ralph's would tell you that the average rental fleet is already north of 50 months in average age. So we feel comfortable with what we've got on the plate for this year. Next year, we haven't sat down and really nailed a view of where the fleet age is going to go next year. And so we'll certainly talk about it as we get further into our planning process for next year. What I will say is that as a rule of thumb, in order to maintain the size and the age of our fleet constant through a course of a year, we would have to spend about $575 million gross rental CapEx. And obviously, the net would be less than that as you assume some reasonable amount of new sales, so $575 million gross to keep age and size constant across the year. And that will inform how we think about our spend is going forward.

The residual values, I think that if the contractor doesn't have the credit and you see an expansion in the secular side of the business, there's going to be an inherent demand for rental companies to probably add more fleet. Not everyone adds new fleet. A lot of the smaller localized will go to the used market. So I think it will still be a very robust market. Keep in mind that 60% of everything that manufactured still went into ownership. So we're just getting a bigger slice of that pie.

We'll continue to manage that within the rules set out by the tax authorities. In terms of thinking, and we did not use any of that cash directly from the intercompany Canadian U.S. loan to repurchase the subnotes that we repurchased in the second quarter. On the subnote repurchases, that was done out of URI. It used part of the cash capacity at URI to execute those, and we had to because of the limitations on our restricted payments basket that arises out of various debt facilities. We used roughly $24 million, $25 million of that cash capacity. At the end of the quarter, if you look in the Q and the guarantor statements, you'll see that, that cash capacity stood at about $55 million at the end of the quarter, and so that's what we have available to make further repurchases.

On the call, as the operator stated, is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer, and other members of our senior management team. I'm going to start this morning by summarizing the quarter for you, particularly those metrics that relate to our strategy. And I want to focus our discussion on a tie-in between our strategy, our actions and our results. I'll also talk to you about the operating environment and where we see the recovery going next. And then Bill, later in the call, will cover all these in detail, the results in detail. And then after that, we'll take all of your questions. 
And so let's start with the numbers.  As you saw from our press release, we had a strong third quarter. We got some help from the environment in terms of demand. But for the most part, we generated our performance from the inside out by paying close attention to our strategy. As I shared with you in the past, that strategy is to transform the company for long-term profitability by defining our rentals according to our core business rental, achieving customer service leadership in our industry, continuously improving our cost structure and fleet management, and leveraging our size by pivoting our customer base towards large construction and industrial accounts that we service through a single point of contact. And we're being very disciplined about how we target these accounts while at the same time pursuing more profitable rentals from our customer base at large.
So as a result, we had positive net income of $23 million and EPS of $0.33 per share, when you compare that with the third quarter last year when we had a net income and earnings of zero. But the change is even more dramatic on an adjusted basis, with an EPS of $0.40 compared with $0.01 in last year's third quarter. And we've repeatedly said that we're only interested in profitable growth, and here's the evidence. We increased our adjusted EBITDA dollars by 17%, even though rental total revenues increased by only 2%. 
Our rental gross margin was up 1.9 percentage points for the quarter versus last year. In short, the numbers clearly show that we are delivering on our strategic priorities, and we're doing it within the context of a choppy recovery. It's true the cycle is turning, but it's a slow turn. And I'm happy to say that our performance has outpaced the construction environment for two straight quarters now. 
We know that construction spending in the U.S. actually took a step backward in July and August compared to last year, but I'm happy to report with the ABI numbers that came in last night, we're actually up the first time since 2008, and we take that as a piece of positive news.
When our rental revenues were up 6%, with that includes a same-store growth of 9.7%. Now these are all good indicators of how well positioned we are to leverage this recovery. We also continue to be diligent about costs, with an additional $4 million of SG&A expense out of the business compared to last year. That's a sustainable improvement, and that puts us solidly on target with our projections.
But the cost of equipment rentals x depreciation, which is a metric influenced by demand volume, increased by $12 million. And some of the demand is seasonal, some of it cyclical. And some of it, we believe, is coming from our end markets opting to rent equipment rather than to purchase it. And when you take these external factors into account and combine them with the impact of our strategy, it helped explain the record time utilization we reported last time. 
Now given these market opportunities, we have increased our strategic spend on fleet in the quarter by $113 million. We also sold $74 million of used equipment at more than 4x the margin we got last year, again, another sign that things are stabilizing. 
We have a lot of discipline invested in both cost control and fleet management, which is why we feel very comfortable reaffirming our free cash flow estimate for the year, even with the projected increase in net rental CapEx. Bill will go over these numbers and elaborate on our full year outlook after I complete this.
Now before I talk about the environment, I want to be very direct with you on the subject of rental rates. I know rates are a hot topic right now. I also know that there are some mixed signals in terms of the metrics being reported by our industry. As you saw last night, our own numbers showed record time utilization for the third quarter, but our rates were still down 1.4% compared to last year. 
So what's going on here? Well, for one thing, rates in general are lagging utilization in the recovery, as expected. Second, monthly rates are lagging daily weekly rates, and because our strategy focused on large accounts, about 71% of our transactions are monthly right now, that's up about two points sequentially and year-over-year. And the inherent difference in rates is obvious when you break it down in rental term. For example, in the third quarter, our monthly rates improved sequentially 1.7%, while daily rates were up 3%. That's almost twice the pace monthly.
The third factor is fleet mix. Aerial equipment accounts for roughly half our fleet, and we've said before, third equipment gets rented first on projects followed by aerial. And we expected aerial rates to be challenging in the short term. To some degree, they mask the environment in earthmoving and general rental rates. 
Overall, our rates have turned the corner. And in the third quarter, rates improved 2% sequentially from the second quarter. And that's one of the largest sequential improvements we've seen. And since we're focused on achieving a more optimal balance of pricing and time utilization, our dollar utilization is also improving, up 2.9 percentage points year-over-year in the quarter. That's good, but we plan to do a lot better.
Now at this point, and given current trends, we expect our rates to be flat or slightly positive year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and to continue to trend upward as we go into the next year in the first quarter of 2011.
Now we would normally be cautious by giving out that outlook, but I have a lot of confidence in the discipline that we're creating around rental rates. For example, our price optimization software called core is now in place on all of our branches except Trench. Core is giving us customer-centric pricing, which essentially means that our sales team now has a better understanding of optimal pricing. They know how far they can negotiate. And more importantly, they know when to walk away. Our price optimization is an example of how we're continuing to invest in technology, again, to support our strategy. Another one is our mobile website, which we announced last month. 
And when I look at all these initiatives, I see our strategy at work, but I also see a marketplace that is ready to move away from the downturn. Now I want to share some information that we're making available for the first time this morning. It supports what we hear from analysts and what our own employees report back for us in the field and a three good reasons to expect that rates will continue to trend upwards. In September, we surveyed over 1,600 of our customers with a wide range of rental spend. And to get their outlook on 2011, it excludes the goal where the survey is being conducted this month. And our results come from contractors out there in the trenches that they live in the reality every day. 
43% of those surveyed expect business to increase in 2011. 38% indicated the status quo are uncertain, and only 19% think things will continue to go downhill. The greatest uncertainty appears to be in the West, particularly the Southwest. The greatest optimism comes from the customers in our Northeast Canada and Midwest regions. So we're staying very close to our customers and listening to their input. 
Now let me tell you what our own branches are seeing out in the field. All nine of our regions show year-over-year growth in rental revenues in the third quarter, with the strongest being Northeast Canada and the weakest being the East and the Southwest. And on a macro level, the pictures equally is encouraging. In the third quarter, our rental revenues were up year-over-year in 33 of our 48 states and all Canadian provinces. Our 22 states and provinces now show year-over-year growth for 2010 through September. 
In our Trench, Power HVAC business had a good third quarter, up 6.8% in revenues and a 7.2% improvement in operating margin, and we're seeing demand from several directions. For one thing, the stimulus money is still in play and we have trench safety systems out on about 150 stimulus jobs right now. Both trench and power HVAC are servicing more infrastructure projects. The public sectors together with growth in industrial are driving results in this business.
I also want to mention the joint venture with AMECO that we announced in August. This is initially focused on oil and gas customers in the Gulf region. At this point, all the pieces are in place, and both partners are moving forward, and we'll keep you posted as things progress. But I think we've made it clear how excited we are to be able to pilot with this industrial venture with AMECO. Now even without the joint venture, our Industrial business contributed an additional $5 million of revenue in the third quarter versus last year. 
Industrial rental is just one example of how we're training our sales people to look beyond the traditional boundaries of the construction industry and pursue any market that fits our strategy for profitable growth. As we identify these opportunities, we are seeking out large customers where our scale has the most appeal, particularly our ability to share fleet across our North American footprint.
In the third quarter, national accounts accounted for about 29% of rental revenue, which is an increase both year-over-year and sequentially. Now it's worth noting that the increasing amount of our industrial business is coming from our national accounts. So as we grow our presence in the industrial sector, we're being guided by our customer segmentation strategy. 
The concept of staying true to our strategy informs every decision we make as we steer our company into the recovery. It's not going to be a smooth ride. But when we look at it at the markets, we see customers choosing to rent more equipment they need. Demand is part of the strong momentum that we're experiencing as we move into the two slowest quarters and should help soften the effect of seasonality. 
Now we've begun process of putting our plans in place for 2011, and to the degree that we can comment on, that will share our thoughts. So now on that note, I will now ask Bill to review the results. And then after that, we'll take your questions. So over to you, Bill."

As has become our tradition, I'll give some more detail on the quarter: Revenues; our cost performance; a little bit on the fleet; liquidity; update our outlook for 2010; and then touch on, as Mike said, touch on 2011.
On the revenue front, it was a good quarter, almost any way you slice it. Rental revenue, in particular, was up 6% year-over-year. That's the first year-over-year increase we've had in the quarter since the first quarter of 2008. So it's been a long time coming. Within that, Mike mentioned the time utilization increase that we saw, 71.3% time for the quarter. That's up 7.1 percentage points year-over-year. And I think it's legitimate to say that we didn't get it by shrinking the size of the fleet. Overall, the size of the fleet averaged slightly smaller this year compared to last year. The time really came out of stronger demand. OEC on rent was up 11% year-over-year.
Rates were working against us. So I think that makes that 6% revenue increase in rental revenue even more impressive. As Mike said, rates were down 1.4% year-over-year, although they were up two percentage points sequentially for the quarter. And when you look within the quarter, in fact, if you look over the last couple of quarters, on a sequential basis, rates have been sequentially positive for six consecutive months. Starting in April, they've been up every month on a sequential basis. 
Now Mike highlighted some of the internals that go along within rate. For example, daily and weekly rates are clearly outperforming our monthly rates overall. And when you look at equipment type, earthmoving and other general rentals categories are outperforming aerial and forklifts. But overall, the trend is established in the right direction and we certainly, as always, will continue to drive for better rate realization just across the board.
The other area of revenue that I wanted to focus a little bit of time on is used equipment sales. We sold $32 million in proceeds of used equipment during the third quarter. While it's down versus last year, you will all recall that we were selling at record levels of used equipment sales last year. So it should be no surprise that the proceeds came down. On an OEC basis, we sold $74 million of OEC in the quarter, and that was down as well versus $100 million or so that we sold last year. The good news is that we achieved the margin on our used sales this quarter of 31.3%. 
And as has been the case for the prior two quarters of this year, the margin story is really heavily driven by the distribution channel. We sold 57% of what we sold in the third quarter through retail and supported by used equipment pricing. The trends in used equipment pricing continue to be positive, that by the Rouse data that we received but also by our own individual experience in selling into the market. So used equipment market continues to be robust, and we'll continue to use it very effectively to manage our fleet.
On the cost side, cost of rentals were actually up year-over-year in the quarter, $237 million, up $12 million compared to last year. Now really, that cost performance is the tale of two cities. When you look into the fixed cost of our cost of rentals, we continue to deliver good cost performance on the fixed cost component of our cost structure. 
So when you look at salaries and benefits, you look at facilities cost, other structural fixed-cost components, we continue to deliver reductions in those components. It's just being outstripped by the variable cost components that are flowing with the increased rental volume. So when you look at repair and maintenance, delivery, fuel cost, those kinds of cost components that really are driven by how many transactions you do, they're up, and they've offset the saves that we realized on the fixed-cost side. 
That's prompted us to re-evaluate our outlook for cost performance over the remainder of 2010, and we're now saying that we expect cost of rent x depreciation to be a save of $5 million to $15 million compared to last year. Longer term, we're still very comfortable that we've improved significantly the cost structure of this business and still feel very good about our work against the fixed cost components of our business.
The story on SG&A is better. SG&A was down $4 million year-over-year, and the benefits are still coming out of the same places that we've been talking about. So salaries and benefits, those are really driven by headcount. And the headcount reductions have continued, albeit at a somewhat smaller piece than in the prior quarters. Professional fees are still a very nice source of save for us, as we continue to be disciplined about our spend there. 
The bad debt experience in the quarter was higher. We actually had year-over-year about a $6 million negative in bad debt, and that reflects primarily the larger size of accounts receivable as we've driven higher revenue. We also had a slight deterioration in the aging of our portfolio, but the real driver was the size of the AR balance causing that $6 million negative year-over-year comparison for SG&A. 
All in all, we feel very good about SG&A. And in fact, we're reaffirming our target for a full year SG&A reduction of $40 million to $50 million. Obviously, we've got $37 million of that in our pocket already year-to-date. So we feel very comfortable that we'll be able to achieve the target that we did of $40 million to $50 million.
Looking at the profit lines, adjusted EBITDA came in at $216 million for the quarter, and that's had a 35.7% adjusted EBITDA margin, 460 basis points better than last year. And to Mike's point, obviously, we're taking full advantage of the increased operating leverage that we built into the business from lower cost. So a great story there, that in spite of a decline year-over-year in rental rates, I think is very encouraging. 
EPS, similar story there. Adjusted EPS of $0.40 for the quarter, and the drivers are the same as the EBITDA drivers I talked about. It is worth noting that in calculating EPS, we used a tax rate for the quarter of 39.5%. And I point that out simply because in the second quarter, we talked about a 54% tax rate as what we were thinking about going forward. That change in tax rate, we can talk about in Q&A if anybody wants to get into it. But as we look at fourth quarter, we think something like the low-40s to mid-40s is the right way to think about the tax rate to apply to the fourth quarter income, and we'll continue to update obviously if anything major changes there.
Just a couple of quick words on our fleet management in the quarter. We have continued to drive optimal use of our fleet. One of the ways we talk about that is the amount of fleet that we transfer within our system, and the transfers were strong again the third quarter, $1.6 billion of fleet transferred during the quarter. It's about 42% of our fleet overall moving during the quarter. And obviously, we've talked about how we believe that helps us to more effectively utilize the investment that we've made in fleet. 
In managing our used equipment sales for the quarter, we continue to execute our strategy of selling the older equipment first. So our used sales for the quarter came in at an average age of 78 months, consistent with where we've been over the last couple of years, and again, consistent with the strategy. 
Our net rental CapEx investment for the quarter was $81 million. That comprised of $113 million of gross capital spend and $32 million of used sales proceeds that I mentioned previously. Year-to-date, we've spent $287 million of gross CapEx. And that spend has been, as we talked about before, has been directed towards supporting the growth that we're seeing with large accounts, supporting the reshaping the mix of our fleet and making sure that we're making good decisions about the components that we have that need to be addressed and need to provide the maximum rental experience for our customers. 
Where we're buying is in earthmoving equipment, a heavy proportion of the spend there. We're obviously replacing aerial. When aerial is new and half your fleet, you're certainly going spend to replace there. But we're also disproportionately spending on other general rentals categories like light towers, compressors, supporting in areas like water trucks, pick-up trucks and other important general rental categories.
Given our spending in the quarter and what we've done year-to-date, we feel very comfortable with spending more to support the environment that we're managing in. And so as we look at 2010, we now believe that we'll spend net rental CapEx in the range of $180 million to $200 million. That's up from the $160 million to $180 million that we had guided to last quarter.
Free cash flow for the quarter was solid, $37 million in the quarter, and that brings us to $144 million for the year-to-date. And again, that's very well in line with the guidance that we've previously given of full year free cash flow in the $200 million to $225 million range. That, obviously, in spite of the lowered cost saves on cost of rent and in spite of the higher spend on net rental CapEx. So we feel very good about being able to preserve that kind of free cash flow.
Our liquidity position ended the quarter strong again. We ended with roughly $860 million of total liquidity. And so we feel very comfortable with the position of the capital structure currently and how it supports our business.
As it relates to the capital structure, I'll just touch real briefly on the bond deal that we issued the press release around this morning. Many of you saw that, I'm sure. We are announcing that we expect to issue 10 years of senior subordinated notes, and the notion there is to use the proceeds to redeem our 7 3/4% notes that are maturing in 2013. This is consistent with our ongoing strategy of making sure that the maturity within our debt is well managed and pushed out far enough so that we don't have any undue concerns about refinancing needs in the near term. We will be in the market today. We expect the issue to go well, and we expect that we will price and finalize terms over the next couple days.
Just real quickly on our 2010 outlook, I think I had touched on most of the components of our outlook. But just to reaffirm, our SG&A guidance for the 2010 full year is still expected to be a reduction of $40 million to $50 million, so no change there. Our cost of equipment rentals, we now expect a reduction of between $5 million and $15 million for the full year. That's down from the $30 million to $50 million that we had previously guided to. Net rental CapEx, we expect to spend between $180 million and $200 million. That's up from the previous range of $160 million to $180 million. And free cash flow, no change there, between $200 million to $225 million.
Real briefly on 2011. As we look down the road, we've started making some high-level decisions that we are certainly deep into our budgeting process as we speak. Still, we thought it was appropriate to give you some highlights as we're thinking about 2011. So on the rate front, Mike said that we expect, if trends continue, that the fourth quarter of this year will finish out with rates flat to up slightly year-over-year. If we achieve that, then going into 2011, we'll have nice momentum. And in fact, if we achieve that fourth quarter performance and then just kept those rates flat throughout 2011, we would experience carryover in 2011 of about two percentage points year-over-year. Obviously, we'll drive for more than that, but I just wanted to give that data point that there's a couple of points of carryover in 2011 as we think about it today.
On the CapEx front for 2011, we've said this in one-on-ones, but I wanted to say it here more specifically. Our gross and net rental CapEx spend next year will be more in 2011 than it is this year. And in fact, I think we'd say now that it will be significantly more. Somebody's going to ask me what I mean by significant in Q&A, and I'll tell you that we don't have that number yet. But what we're thinking for 2011, based on the good momentum that we've seen with key relationships from 2010, we're going to need to spend to support those relationships, as well as to continue to position the fleet for where we want it to be over the long haul.  That said, we still expect that we will deliver positive free cash flow in 2011. And again, somebody's going to ask me, ""Well, what is positive free cash flow mean?"" It's somewhere between zero and infinity. So we can talk about that in more detail as we go forward as well. 
Those are the comments I wanted to make. Maybe I'll stop there and open it up for Q&A, and we can take it from there. So operator?"

We've argued earlier in the year that this year's seasonal pattern seemed to be stronger than where it's been over the last several years, certainly stronger than last year. And so if you think about 7.1 percentage points of year-over-year time utilization improvement, I'd hate to put a number on how much of that is just seasonal -- excuse me, that year-over-year won't have a seasonal component. I'd hate to put a number on how much of that is broken out into the other buckets. That said, we've got nice growth in our key account relationships year-over-year in the quarter. So clearly, a portion of it is just growing those key account relationships. Mike, I'll let you put a number on how much of it might be the secular shift to rental versus owning.

But if you'd asked me that question a couple of months ago, I might've had a slightly different answer on the cost of rent components than I have today. Given the momentum we're seeing on volume demand and the variable cost drivers there, I'm probably less optimistic about a dramatic reduction in cost of rent next year. I know that we've got some initiatives that will help us address some of the fixed-cost components. I just think that the variable cost components could be a pretty strong headwind if the kind of volume demand that we're seeing continues into next year. So that one's a harder one to say that we'll have absolute dollars saves year-over-year next year or how much of those dollar saves might be. SG&A, I think I'm more optimistic that while we should have selling cost increase next year, that there are some other initiatives on the G&A cost components that we could use to offset those. I'm not ready to put a number on the page just yet. I'm hopeful that we'll be able to target further SG&A reductions next year.

So we'll look at it on an ongoing basis and I think we'll pull the trigger as we line up a set of banks and a set of conditions that we think look favorable. So stay tuned."

One is to flip the question around and say, how do I feel about the level of leverage that I'm at today or that I got to last year in the most severe downturn that we've seen in a long time? And the answer was we felt comfortable with the level of debt that we carried even in the depths of last year. And so you can kind of back in to get the EBITDA ratio in that environment was and infer that we would be comfortable there. Let's say that we got up to something in the 4.5 to 5x debt-to-EBITDA range at the depths of last year on a trailing 12 basis. That probably defines the upper side of that debt leverage measure that we look at. I'd peg a number, I'd just say 4 1/2, if we had a choice of actively managing it on the high side. On the low side, we've thought about the philosophy of the capitalization of this company quite a lot actually over the last year and a half. And we feel comfortable operating at levels of leverage that imply being a high-yield issuer. At the low end of the range, 3.5x debt-to-EBITDA is something that we think is probably a good place to look for the minimum of leverage. You go much beyond that and you start to lose some of the cost of capital benefits that we see from being a highly levered company. So that's the range that I talked about generally, 3.5 to 4.5. And I'd say, we'll operate that way unless there's something really extreme one way or the other."

But at the same time, we do think that we've got operating objectives, and some of those we might address more aggressively if we are getting toward the lower end of the range.

On the call as the operator stated is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of our senior management team.I’m going to start this morning by summarizing the quarter for you p",1889,"Thanks operator and good morning everyone and welcome. On the call as the operator stated is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of our senior management team.
I’m going to start this morning by summarizing the quarter for you particularly those metrics that relate to our strategy. I want to focus our discussion on the tie end between our strategy, our actions and our results. And I’ll also talk to you about the operating environment and where we see the recovery going next. And then Bill later in the call will discuss - will cover all these in detail, all the results in detail and then after that, we’ll take all of your questions.
And so we’ll start with the numbers. As you saw from our press release, we had a strong third quarter. We got some help from the environment in terms of demand, but for the most part we generally got a performance from the inside out by paying close attention to our strategy. As I shared with you in the past, that strategy is to transform the company for long-term profitability by defining on rentals according to our core business of rental, achieving customer service leadership in our industry, continuously improving our cost structure in fleet management, and leveraging our size by pivoting our customer base towards large construction in industrial accounts that we service to a single point of contract.
And we’re being very disciplined about how we target these accounts while at the same time, pursuing more profitable rentals from our customer base at large. So as a result, we had positive net income of $23 million, and an EPS of $0.33 per share. When you compare that with the third quarter of last year, when we had a net income and earnings of zero. The change is even more dramatic on the adjusted basis with an EPS of $0.40 compared with $0.01 in last year’s third quarter.
And we’ve repeatedly said that we’re only interested in profitable growth and here is the evidence. We increased our adjusted EBITDA dollars by 17% even though rental - total revenues increased by only 2%. Overall gross margin was up 1.9 percentage points for the quarter versus last year. In short, the numbers clearly show that we are delivering on our strategic priorities and we’re doing it within the context of a sharper recovery.
It’s true, the cycle is turning but it’s a slow turn. And I’m happy to say that our performance has outpaced the construction environment for two straight quarters now. We know the construction spending in the US actually took a step backwards in July and August compared to last year. So I’m happy to report that with ABI numbers that came in last night were actually up the first time since 2008. And we take that as a piece of positive news.
With our rental revenues were up 6%, with that includes a same-store growth of 9.7%. Now these are all good indicators of how well positioned we are to leverage this recovery. We also continued to be diligent about cost. We took an additional $4 million of SG&A expense out of the business compared to last year. That’s a sustainable improvement and it puts us solidly on target with our projects. But the cost of rentals ex depreciation which is a metric influence by demand, volume increased by $12 million. And some of the demand is seasonal, some of its cyclical and some of it we believe is coming from our end markets opting to rent equipment rather than to purchase it.
And when you take these external factors into account combining with the impact of our strategy, it helps explain the record time utilization we reported last night. Given these market opportunities, we’ve increased our strategic spend on fleet in the quarter by a $113 million. We also sold $74 million of used equipment at more than four times than margin we got last year. Again, another sign that things are stabilizing. We have a lot of discipline invested in both cost control and fleet management which is why we feel very comfortable reaffirming our free cash flow estimate for the year even with the projected increase in net rental CapEx.
Bill will go over these numbers and elaborate on our full year outlook after I complete this. Now before I talked about the environment, I want to be very direct with you on the subject of rental rates. I know rates are hot topic right now. I also know that there are some mixed signals in terms of these - of the metrics being reported by our industry. As you saw last night, our own numbers showed record time utilization for the third quarter but our rates were still down 1.4% compared to last year. So what’s going on here? Well, for one thing, rates in general are lagging utilization in the recovery as expected.
Second, monthly rates are lagging daily weekly rates because our strategy is focused on large accounts about 71% of our transactions are monthly right now. That’s up about two points sequentially in year-over-year. And the inherent difference in rates is obvious when you break it down in rental term. For example, in our third quarter our monthly rates improved sequentially 1.7% while daily rates were up 3%. That’s almost twice the pace of monthly.
The third factor is fleet mix. Aerial equipment accounts for roughly half of our fleet and we’ve said before dirt equipment gets rented first on projects followed by aerial. And we expect that aerial rates to be challenging in the short term and to some degree, they mask the environment in earthmoving and general rental rates. Overall, our rates have turned to corner and in the third quarter, rates improved 2% sequentially from the second quarter. And that’s one of the largest sequential improvements we’ve seen. And since we’re focused on achieving a more optimum balance of pricing and time utilization, our target [ph] utilization is also improving up 2.9 percentage point year-over-year in the quarter.
That’s good. But we planned to do a lot better. Now at this point, given current trends, we expect our rates to be flat or slightly positive year-over-year in the fourth quarter. And a continued trend upward as we go into the next year in the first quarter of 2011. Now we would normally be cautious by giving that outlook. But I have a lot of confidence in the discipline that we’re creating around rental rates. For example, our price optimization software called POR (ph) is now in place at all of branches except Trench.
POR is giving us customer centric pricing, which essentially means our sales team now has a better understanding of optimal pricing. They know how far they can negotiate. And more importantly, they know when to walk away. Our price optimization is an example of how we’re continuing to invest in technology again to support our strategy. Another one is our mobile website which we announced last month.
And when I look at all these initiatives I see our strategy at work, but I also see a marketplace that is ready to move away from the downturn. Now I want to share some information that we’re making available for the first time this morning. It supports what we hear from analyst and what our own employees report back for us in the field. And there are three good reasons to expect that rates will continue to trend upwards. In September, we surveyed over 1,600 of our customers with a wide range of rental spend. And to get their outlook on 2011, it excludes the gulf where the survey is being conducted this month.
And the results come from contractors out there in the trenches while they live in the reality every day. 43% of those surveyed expect business to increase in 2011, 38% indicated a status quo or uncertain and only 19% think things will continue to go downhill. The greatest uncertainly appears to be in the west, particularly the Southwest. The greatest optimism comes from the customers in our Northeast Canada and Midwest regions. So we’re staying very close to our customers and listening to their input. Now let me tell you what our own branches are seeing out in the field.
All nine of our regions show year-over-year growth in rental revenues in the third quarter. With the strongest being Northeast Canada, and the weakest being the East and the Southwest. And on a macro level, the picture is equally is encouraging. In the third quarter, our rental revenues were up year-over-year in 33 of our 48 states and all Canadian provinces. A 22 states and provinces now show year-over-year growth for 2010 through September. And our Trench, Power HVAC business had a good third quarter, up 6.8% in revenues and a 7.2% improvement in operating margin.
And we’re seeing demand from several directions. So one thing, the stimulus money is still in play and we have Trench Safety systems on about a 150 stimulus jobs right now. Both Trench and Power HVAC are servicing more infrastructure projects. A public sectors together with growth in industrial are driving results in this business. I also want to mention the joint venture with AMECO that we announced in the August.
This is initially focused on oil and gas customers in the gulf region. At this point all the pieces are in place and both partners are moving forward. And we’ll keep you posted as things progress, but I think we’ve made it clear how excited we are to be able to pilot with this industrial venture with AMECO. Even without the joint venture, our industrial business contributed an additional $5 million of revenue in the third quarter versus last year. Industrial rentals are just one example of how we’re training our sales people to look beyond the traditional boundaries into construction industry and pursue any market that fits our strategy for profitable growth.
As we identify these opportunities we are seeking our large customers where our scale has the most appeal particularly our ability to share fleet across our North American footprint. In the third quarter, national accounts accounted for about 29% of rental revenue, which is an increase both year-over-year and sequentially. And it’s worth noting that the increasing amount of our industrial business is coming from our national accounts. So as we grow our presence in the industrial sector, we’ve been guided by our customer segmentation strategy.
The concept of staying true to our strategy informs every decision we make as we steer our company into the recovery. It’s not going to be a smooth ride but when we look out at the markets, we see a customer choosing to rent more of equipment they need. So to manage some part of the strong momentum that we’re experiencing as we move into the two slowest quarters and it should help soften the effect of seasonality. We’ve begun the process of putting our plans in place for 2011 and to really we can comment on that we’ll share our thoughts.
So now on that note, I will now ask Bill to review the results and then after that we’ll take your questions. So over to you Bill.

As has become our tradition, I’ll give some more detail on the quarter, revenues, our cost performance, little bit on the fleet, liquidity, update our outlook for 2010 and then touch on as Mike said, touch on 20",2289,"Thanks Mike and good morning to everyone. As has become our tradition, I’ll give some more detail on the quarter, revenues, our cost performance, little bit on the fleet, liquidity, update our outlook for 2010 and then touch on as Mike said, touch on 2011.
On the revenue front, it was a good quarter almost any way you slice it, rental revenue in particular was up 6% year-over-year. That’s the first year-over-year increase we’ve had in a quarter since the first quarter of 2008. So it’s been a long time coming. Within that Mike mentioned the time utilization increase that we saw 71.3% time for the quarter, that’s up 7.1 percentage points year-over-year and I think its legitimate to say that we didn’t get it by shrinking the size of the fleet. Overall the size of the fleet averaged slightly smaller this year compared to last year.
The time really came out of stronger demand. OEC on rent was up 11% year-over-year. Rates were working against us, so I think that makes that 6% revenue increase in rental revenue even more impressive, as Mike said rates were down 1.4% year-over-year. Although, they were up two percentage points sequentially for the quarter. And when you look within the quarter, in fact if you look over the last couple of quarters, on a sequential basis rates, have been sequentially positive for six consecutive months starting in April, they’ve been up every month on a sequential basis.
Now Mike highlighted some of the internals going on within rate for example, daily and weekly rates are clearly outperforming our monthly rates overall. And then when you look at equipment type, earthmoving and other general rentals categories are clearly outperforming aerial and forklifts. But overall, the trend is established in the right direction. And we certainly as always will continue to drive for better rate realization just across the board.
The other area of revenue that I wanted to focus a little bit of time on is used equipment sales. We sold $32 million in proceeds of used equipment during the third quarter. While although it’s down versus last year, you’ll all recall that we were selling at record levels of used equipment sales last year. So there should be no surprise that the proceeds came down. On an OEC basis, we sold $74 million of OEC in the quarter and that was down as well versus $100 million or so that we sold last year. The good news is that we achieved a margin on our used sales this quarter of 31.3%. And as has been in the case for the prior two quarters of this year, the margin story is really heavily driven by the distribution channel.
We sold 57% of what we sold in the third quarter through retail. And supported by used equipment pricing, the trends in used equipment pricing continued to be positive backed by the Rouse data that we received, but also by our own individual experience in selling into the market. So the used equipment market continues to be robust and we’ll continue to use it very effectively to manage our fleet.
On the cost side, cost of rentals were actually up year-over-year in the quarter, $237 million, up $12 million compared to last year. And really that cost performance is the tale of two cities. When you look into the fixed cost of our cost of rentals, we continue to lever good to - to deliver good cost performance on the fixed cost component of our cost structure. So when you look at salaries and benefits, you look at facilities cost, other structural fixed cost components, we continued to deliver reductions in those components. It’s just being outstripped by the variable cost components that are flowing with the increased rental volume. So when you look at repair and maintenance, delivery, fuel costs, those kinds of cost components that really are driven by how many transactions you do, they are up. And they’ve offset the saves that we realized on the fixed cost side.
That’s prompted us to reevaluate our outlook for cost performance over the remainder of 2010. And we are now saying that we expect cost of rentals ex depreciation to be a save of 15, or excuse me $5 million to $15 million compared to last year. Longer term, we’re still very comfortable that we’ve improved significantly the cost structure of this business and still feel very good about our work against the fixed cost components of our business.
The story on SG&A is better. SG&A was down $4 million year-over-year. And the benefits are still coming out of the same places that we’ve been talking about. So salaries and benefits, those are really driven by headcount, and the headcount reductions have continued albeit at a somewhat smaller pace than in prior quarters. Professional fees are still a very nice source of save for us as we continued to be disciplined about our spend there.
The bad debt experienced in the quarter was higher. We actually had year-over-year about $6 million negative in bad debt, and that reflects primarily the larger size of accounts receivable as we’ve driven higher revenue. We also had a slight deterioration in the aging of our portfolio but the real driver was the size of the AR balance causing that $6 million negative year-over-year comparison for SG&A.
All in all, we feel very good about SG&A and in fact we are reaffirming our target for a full year SG&A reduction of $40 million to $50 million. Obviously, we’ve got $37 million of that in our pocket already year-to-date. So we feel very comfortable that we’ll be able to achieve the target that we gave of $40 million to $50 million. Looking at the profit lines, adjusted EBITDA came in at $216 million for the quarter. And that’s at a 35.7% adjusted EBITDA margin, 460 basis points better than last year and to Mike’s point obviously we’re taking full advantage of the increased operating leverage that we’ve built into the business from lower cost.
So a great story there. That’s in spite of a decline year-over-year in rental rates, I think is very encouraging. EPS, similar story there. Adjusted EPS of $0.40 for the quarter. And the drivers are the same as the EBITDA drivers that I talked about. It is worth noting that in calculating EPS, we used a tax rate for the quarter of 39.5% and I pointed out simply because in the second quarter, we talked about a 54% tax rate as what we were thinking about going forward. That change in tax rate we can talk about in Q&A if anybody wants to get into it but as we look at the fourth quarter, we think something like the low 40s to mid-40s is the right way to think about the tax rate to apply to the fourth quarter income.
And we’ll continue to update obviously if anything major changes there. Just a couple of quick words on our fleet management in the quarter. We have continued to drive optimal use of our fleet, one of the ways we talk about that is the amount of fleet that we transfer within our system. And the transfers were strong again in the third quarter, $1.6 billion of fleets transferred during the quarter. It’s about 42% of our fleet overall moving during the quarter. And obviously we talked about how we believe that helps us more effectively utilize the investment that we’ve made in fleet.
In managing our used equipment sales for the quarter, we continue to execute our strategy of selling the older equipment first. So our used sales for the quarter came in at an age, at average age of 78 months, consistent with where we’ve been over the last couple of years, and again consistent with the strategy. Our net rental CapEx investment for the quarter was $81 million, that comprised of a $113 million of gross capital spend and the $32 million of used sales proceeds that I mentioned previously.
Year-to-date we spend $287 million of gross CapEx. And that spend has been as we’ve talked about before, it’s been directed towards supporting the growth that we’re seeing with large accounts, supporting the reshaping the mix of our fleet and making sure that we’re making good decisions about the components that we have that need to be addressed and need to provide the maximum rental experience for our customers. Where we’re buying, is in earthmoving equipment, a heavy proportion of the spend there. We’re obviously replacing aerial, when aerial is nearly half of your fleet, you’re certainly going to spend to replace there.
But we’re also disproportionately spending on other general rentals categories like light towers, compressors supporting in the areas like water trucks, pickup trucks and other important general rental categories. Given our spending in the quarter in what we’ve done year-to-date, we feel very comfortable with spending more to support the environment that we are managing in and so as we look at 2010 we now believe that we’ll spend net rental CapEx in the range of $180 million to $200 million that’s up from the $160 million to $180 million that we had guided to last quarter.
Free cash flow for the quarter was solid, $37 million in the quarter and that brings us to a $144 million for the year-to-date. And again that’s very well in line with the guidance that we’ve previously given of full year free cash flow in the $200 million to $225 million range. That obviously in spite of the lowered cost saves on cost of rent and in spite of the higher spend on net rental CapEx. So we feel very good about being able to preserve that kind of free cash flow.
Our liquidity position, ended the quarter strong again. We ended with roughly $860 million of total liquidity and so we feel very comfortable with the position of the capital structure currently and how it supports our business. As it relates to the capital structure, I’ll just touch real briefly on the bond deal that we issued press release around this morning, many of you saw that I’m sure. We are now saying that we expect to issue 10 years of senior subordinated notes and the notion there is to use to proceeds to redeem our 7 ¾ % notes that are maturing in 2013.
This is consistent with our ongoing strategy of making sure that the maturity within our debt is well managed and pushed out far enough so that we don’t have any undue concerns about refinancing needs in the near terms. We will be in the market today. We expect the issue to go well and we expect that we will price and finalize terms over the next couple of days. Just real quickly on our 2010 outlook, I think I had touched on most of the components of our outlook but just to reaffirm our SG&A guidance for the 2010 full year is still expected to be a reduction of $40 million to $50 million, so no change there.
Our cost of equipment rentals, we now expect a reduction of between $5 million and $15 million for the full year, that’s down from the $30 million to $50 million that we had previously guided to. Net rental CapEx, we expect to spend between a $180 million and $200 million, that’s up from the previous range of $160 million to $180 million. And then free cash flow, no change there between $200 million and $225 million.
Real briefly on 2011, as we look down the road we’ve started making some high-level decisions but we are certainly deep into budgeting process as we speak. Still we thought it was appropriate to give you some highlights as we’re thinking about 2011. So on the rate front, Mike said that we expect if trends continue that the fourth quarter of this year will finish out with rates flat to up slightly year-over-year, if we achieve that, then going into 2011 we’ll have nice momentum and in fact if we achieve that fourth quarter performance and then just kept those rates flat throughout 2011, we would experience carryover in 2011 of about two percentage points year-over-year.
Obviously, we’ll drive from more than that but I just wanted to give that data point that there is a couple of points of carryover in 2011 as we think about it today. On the CapEx front for 2011. We’ve said this in one on ones, but wanted to say it here more specifically. Our gross and net rental CapEx spend next year will be more in 2011 than it is this year. And in fact I think we’d say now that it would be significantly more. Somebody is going to ask me what I mean by significant in Q&A and I’ll tell you that we don’t have that number yet but what we’re thinking for 2011 based on the good momentum that we’ve seen with key relationships from 2010, we’re going to need to spend to support those relationships as well as to continue to position the fleet for where we wanted to be over the long haul.
That said, we still expect that we will deliver positive free cash flow in 2011. And again somebody is going to ask me well what does positive free cash flow means its somewhere between zero and infinity. So we can talk about that in more detail as we go forward as well. Those are the comments I wanted to make. Maybe I’ll stop there and open it up for Q&A and we can take it from there. So, operator.

We are - we’ve argued earlier in the year that this year’s seasonal pattern seemed to be stronger than where it’s been over the last several years, certainly stronger than last year. And so if you think about 7.1 percentage points of year-over-year time utilization improvement, I’d hate to put a number on how much of that is just seasonal, excuse me that year-over-year will have a seasonal component.
I’d hate to put a number on how much of that is broken out into the other buckets. That said, we’ve got nice growth in our key account relationships year-over-year in the quarter. So clearly a portion of it is just growing those key account relationships. Mike, I’ll let you put a number on how much of it might be to shift to secular, secular shift to rental versus owning. But I’d say that that’s a smaller component of that year-over-year change. It’s just really hard to put numbers on it.

Seasonality has returned. The one thing I can tell you is that we look at and it’s on a year-over-year basis, our new accounts are up. So that means people are looking at ways to rent. They’re up about 15% year-to-date on a year-over-year basis. So but as Bill mentioned it’s very difficult to quantify the numbers specifically.

And so we’re going to have to figure out better ways, new ways and different ways of operating in order to be able to sustain these kinds of time utilization levels at reasonable costs. We’re going through that right now, we’re learning those processes but we as an executive team are convinced that we can operate in the high 60s.
I think we put 67% as the target in our sort of normalized EBITDA analysis last quarter and I think that’s a good indication of where we think we can drive it to on a sustainable basis.

And probably not dramatically different on forklifts.
So I know that’s high level and just directional but we want to continue that trend, right? We want to continue to focus on reshaping the fleet away from aerial toward earthmoving and then supporting the growth that we’re seeing in general rental categories especially driven by industrial relationships as well growth in Trench and Power and HVAC.

I would say though its mainly just reasoning from where we’re standing right now in terms of the amount of equipment that’s on rent. We’re at a high level of OEC on rent and on time utilization of our fleet as you can tell. Fourth quarter has started out with good momentum coming in from the third quarter. So we’re starting from a pretty high level of overall demand and we think that that will it’ll fall off seasonally but it will fall off less severely than it has over the last couple of years and the momentum on rates has been positive enough so that the seasonal impact will be as negative as maybe it is usually.
So that’s the reasoning that we apply to say that we could get flat year-over-year and flattish kind of sequentially.

In aerial, the aerial players are scattered across North America and you can take that from small to medium. But I think overall the industry is waking up and responding to need to improve on prices.
And by the way the industry overall is healing as I mentioned before its going out into the second quarter, used prices improving continue. We are seeing time utilization improve and my sense is that will be across the industry as a whole and as a result of that pricing will follow.

I know that we’ve got some initiatives that will help us address some of the fixed cost components I just think that the variable cost components could be a pretty strong headwind if the kind of volume demand that we’re seeing continues into next year.
So that one’s is a harder one to say that we’ll have absolute dollar saves year-over-year next year, or how much those dollar saves might be. SG&A I think I’m more optimistic that while we should have selling cost increase next year that there is some other initiatives on the G&A cost components that we could use to offset those. I’m not ready to put a number on the page just yet. I’m hopeful that we’ll be able to target further SG&A reductions next year.

And the answer was we felt comfortable with the level of depth that we carried even in the depths of last year.
And so you can kind of back into what debt-to-EBITDA ration in that environment was and infer that we would be comfortable there. Let’s say that we got up to something in the 4.5 to 5 times that the EBITDA range at the depths of last year on a trailing 12 basis. That probably defines the upper side of that leverage measure that we’d look at. I’d peg a number I’d just 4.5 if we had a choice of actively managing it on high side.
On the low side, we’ve thought about the philosophy of the capitalization of this company quite a lot actually over the last year and a half. And we feel comfortable operating at levels of leverage that imply being a high-yield issuer. At the low end of the range 3.5 times debt-to-EBITDA is something that we think is probably a good place to look for the minimum of leverage. You go much beyond that and you start to lose some of the cost of capital benefits that we see from being a highly levered company. So that’s the range that I talk about generally, 3.5 to 4.5. And I’d say we’ll operate that way unless there is something really extreme one way or the other.

So I don’t know that we would go out of our way at the point we reached 3.5 to say oh my goodness, now I’ve got to do something differently. But at the same time we do think that we’ve got operating objectives and some of those we might address more aggressively if we are getting towards the lower end of the range. For example, spending a little bit more on rental CapEx if it makes sense from an investment perspective. So we’ll balance all of those things as we go forward but it’d be a high class problem to have to figure out how to manage or leverage ratio that’s too low.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome. On the call, as the Operator stated, is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer, and other members of our senior management team. I'm going to start this morning by summarizing the quarter for you,",1871,"Thanks, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. On the call, as the Operator stated, is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer, and other members of our senior management team. I'm going to start this morning by summarizing the quarter for you, particularly those metrics that relate to our strategy. And I want to focus our discussion on the tie-in between our strategy, our actions and our results. I'll also talk to you about the operating environment and where we see the recovery going next. And then Bill, later in the call, will cover all these in detail, the results in detail. And then after that, we'll take all of your questions. 
And so let's start with the numbers.  As you saw from our press release, we had a strong third quarter. We got some help from the environment in terms of demand. But for the most part, we generated our performance from the inside out by paying close attention to our strategy. As I shared with you in the past, that strategy is to transform the company for long-term profitability by defining unit rentals according to our core business rental, achieving customer service leadership in our industry, continuously improving our cost structure and fleet management, and leveraging our size by pivoting our customer base towards large construction and industrial accounts that we service through a single point of contact. And we're being very disciplined about how we target these accounts while at the same time pursuing more profitable rentals from our customer base at large.
So as a result, we had positive net income of $23 million and EPS of $0.33 per share when you compare that with the third quarter last year when we had a net income and earnings of zero. But the change is even more dramatic on an adjusted basis, with an EPS of $0.40 compared with $0.01 in last year's third quarter. And we've repeatedly said that we're only interested in profitable growth, and here's the evidence. We increased our adjusted EBITDA dollars by 17%, even though total revenues increased by only 2%. 
Our rental gross margin was up 1.9 percentage points for the quarter versus last year. In short, the numbers clearly show that we are delivering on our strategic priorities, and we're doing it within the context of a choppy recovery. It's true, the cycle is turning, but it's a slow turn. And I'm happy to say that our performance has outpaced the construction environment for two straight quarters now. 
We know that construction spending in the U.S. actually took a step backward in July and August compared to last year, but I'm happy to report with the ABI numbers that came in last night, we're actually up the first time since 2008, and we take that as a piece of positive news.
When our rental revenues were up 6%, with that includes a same-store growth of 9.7%. Now these are all good indicators of how well-positioned we are to leverage this recovery. We also continue to be diligent about costs, with an additional $4 million of SG&A expense out of the business compared to last year. That's a sustainable improvement, and that puts us solidly on target with our projections.
But the cost of equipment rentals x depreciation, which is a metric influenced by demand volume, increased by $12 million. And some of the demand is seasonal, some of it cyclical. And some of it, we believe, is coming from our end markets opting to rent equipment rather than to purchase it. And when you take these external factors into account and combine them with the impact of our strategy, it helped explain the record time utilization we reported last time. 
Now given these market opportunities, we have increased our strategic spend on fleet in the quarter by $113 million. We also sold $74 million of used equipment at more than 4x the margin we got last year, again, another sign that things are stabilizing. 
We have a lot of discipline invested in both cost control and fleet management, which is why we feel very comfortable reaffirming our free cash flow estimate for the year, even with the projected increase in net rental CapEx. Bill will go over these numbers and elaborate on our full-year outlook after I complete this.
Now before I talk about the environment, I want to be very direct with you on the subject of rental rates. I know rates are a hot topic right now. I also know that there are some mixed signals in terms of the metrics being reported by our industry. As you saw last night, our own numbers showed record time utilization for the third quarter, but our rates were still down 1.4% compared to last year. 
So what's going on here? Well, for one thing, rates in general are lagging utilization in the recovery, as expected. Second, monthly rates are lagging daily weekly rates, and because our strategy focused on large accounts, about 71% of our transactions are monthly right now.  That's up about two points sequentially and year-over-year. And the inherent difference in rates is obvious when you break it down in rental term. For example, in the third quarter, our monthly rates improved sequentially 1.7% while daily rates were up 3%. That's almost twice the pace monthly.
The third factor is fleet mix. Aerial equipment accounts for roughly half our fleet, and we've said before, third equipment gets rented first on projects followed by aerial. And we expected aerial rates to be challenging in the short term. To some degree, they mask the environment in earthmoving and general rental rates. 
Overall, our rates have turned the corner. And in the third quarter, rates improved 2% sequentially from the second quarter. And that's one of the largest sequential improvements we've seen. And since we're focused on achieving a more optimal balance of pricing and time utilization, our dollar utilization is also improving, up 2.9 percentage points year-over-year in the quarter. That's good, but we plan to do a lot better.
Now at this point, and given current trends, we expect our rates to be flat or slightly positive year-over-year in the fourth quarter and to continue to trend upward as we go into the next year in the first quarter of 2011.
Now we would normally be cautious by giving out that outlook, but I have a lot of confidence in the discipline that we're creating around rental rates. For example, our price optimization software, called Core, is now in place on all of our branches except Trench. Core is giving us customer-centric pricing, which essentially means that our sales team now has a better understanding of optimal pricing. They know how far they can negotiate. And more importantly, they know when to walk away. Our price optimization is an example of how we're continuing to invest in technology, again, to support our strategy. Another one is our mobile website, which we announced last month. 
And when I look at all these initiatives, I see our strategy at work, but I also see a marketplace that is ready to move away from the downturn. Now I want to share some information that we're making available for the first time this morning. It supports what we hear from analysts and what our own employees report back for us in the field and there's three good reasons to expect that rates will continue to trend upwards. In September, we surveyed over 1,600 of our customers with a wide range of rental spend and to get their outlook on 2011.  It excludes the Gulf, where the survey is being conducted this month. And our results come from contractors out there in the trenches that they live in the reality every day. 
43% of those surveyed expect business to increase in 2011. 38% indicated the status quo or uncertain, and only 19% think things will continue to go downhill. The greatest uncertainty appears to be in the West, particularly the Southwest. The greatest optimism comes from customers in our Northeast Canada and Midwest regions. So we're staying very close to our customers and listening to their input. 
Now let me tell you what our own branches are seeing out in the field. All nine of our regions show year-over-year growth in rental revenues in the third quarter, with the strongest being Northeast Canada and the weakest being the East and the Southwest. And on a macro level, the picture's equally as encouraging. In the third quarter, our rental revenues were up year-over-year in 33 of our 48 states and all Canadian provinces. Our 22 states and provinces now show year-over-year growth for 2010 through September. 
And our Trench, Power HVAC business had a good third quarter, up 6.8% in revenues and a 7.2% improvement in operating margin, and we're seeing demand from several directions. For one thing, the stimulus money is still in play, and we have trench safety systems out on about 150 stimulus jobs right now. Both trench and power HVAC are servicing more infrastructure projects. The public sectors, together with growth in industrial, are driving results in this business.
I also want to mention the joint venture with AMECO that we announced in August. This is initially focused on oil and gas customers in the Gulf region. At this point, all the pieces are in place, and both partners are moving forward, and we'll keep you posted as things progress. But I think we've made it clear how excited we are to be able to pilot this industrial venture with AMECO. Now even without the joint venture, our Industrial business contributed an additional $5 million of revenue in the third quarter versus last year. 
Industrial rental is just one example of how we're training our sales people to look beyond the traditional boundaries of the construction industry and pursue any market that fits our strategy for profitable growth. As we identify these opportunities, we are seeking out large customers where our scale has the most appeal, particularly our ability to share fleet across our North American footprint.
In the third quarter, national accounts accounted for about 29% of rental revenue, which is an increase both year-over-year and sequentially. Now it's worth noting that the increasing amount of our industrial business is coming from our national accounts. So as we grow our presence in the industrial sector, we're being guided by our customer segmentation strategy. 
The concept of staying true to our strategy informs every decision we make as we steer our company into the recovery. It's not going to be a smooth ride. But when we look out at the markets, we see customers choosing to rent more of equipment they need. The demand has been part of the strong momentum that we're experiencing as we move into the two slowest quarters and should help soften the effect of seasonality. 
Now we've begun process of putting our plans in place for 2011, and to the degree that we can comment on that, we'll share our thoughts. So now on that note, I will now ask Bill to review the results. And then after that, we'll take your questions. So over to you, Bill."

As has become our tradition, I'll give some more detail on the quarter: revenues, our cost performance, a little bit on the fleet, liquidity, update our outlook for 2010 and then touch on, as Mike said, touch on",2261,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As has become our tradition, I'll give some more detail on the quarter: revenues, our cost performance, a little bit on the fleet, liquidity, update our outlook for 2010 and then touch on, as Mike said, touch on 2011.
On the revenue front, it was a good quarter almost any way you slice it. Rental revenue, in particular, was up 6% year-over-year. That's the first year-over-year increase we've had in the quarter since the first quarter of 2008. So it's been a long time coming. Within that, Mike mentioned the time utilization increase that we saw, 71.3% time for the quarter. That's up 7.1 percentage points year-over-year. And I think it's legitimate to say that we didn't get it by shrinking the size of the fleet. Overall, the size of the fleet averaged slightly smaller this year compared to last year. The time really came out of stronger demand. OEC on rent was up 11% year-over-year.
Rates were working against us. So I think that makes that 6% revenue increase in rental revenue even more impressive. As Mike said, rates were down 1.4% year-over-year, although they were up two percentage points sequentially for the quarter. And when you look within the quarter; in fact, if you look over the last couple of quarters, on a sequential basis, rates have been sequentially positive for six consecutive months. Starting in April, they've been up every month on a sequential basis. 
Now Mike highlighted some of the internals that go along within rate. For example, our daily and weekly rates are clearly outperforming our monthly rates overall. And when you look at equipment type, earthmoving and other general rentals categories are clearly outperforming aerial and forklifts. But overall, the trend is established in the right direction, and we certainly, as always, will continue to drive for better rate realization just across the board.
The other area of revenue that I wanted to focus a little bit of time on is used equipment sales. We sold $32 million in proceeds of used equipment during the third quarter. While it's down versus last year, you will all recall that we were selling at record levels of used equipment sales last year. So it should be no surprise that the proceeds came down. On an OEC basis, we sold $74 million of OEC in the quarter, and that was down as well versus $100 million or so that we sold last year. The good news is that we achieved the margin on our used sales this quarter of 31.3%. 
And as has been the case for the prior two quarters of this year, the margin story is really heavily driven by the distribution channel. We sold 57% of what we sold in the third quarter through retail and supported by used equipment pricing. The trends in used equipment pricing continue to be positive, that by the Rouse data that we received but also by our own individual experience in selling into the market. So used equipment market continues to be robust, and we'll continue to use it very effectively to manage our fleet.
On the cost side, cost of rentals were actually up year-over-year in the quarter, $237 million, up $12 million compared to last year. Now really, that cost performance is the tale of two cities. When you look into the fixed cost of our cost of rentals, we continue to deliver good cost performance on the fixed-cost component of our cost structure. 
So when you look at salaries and benefits, you look at facilities cost, other structural fixed-cost components, we continue to deliver reductions in those components. It's just being outstripped by the variable-cost components that are flowing with the increased rental volume. So when you look at repair and maintenance, delivery, fuel cost, those kinds of cost components that, really, are driven by how many transactions you do, they're up.  And they've offset the saves that we realized on the fixed-cost side. 
That's prompted us to re-evaluate our outlook for cost performance over the remainder of 2010, and we're now saying that we expect cost of rent x depreciation to be a save of $5 million to $15 million compared to last year. Longer term, we're still very comfortable that we've improved significantly the cost structure of this business and still feel very good about our work against the fixed cost components of our business.
The story on SG&A is better. SG&A was down $4 million year-over-year, and the benefits are still coming out of the same places that we've been talking about. So salaries and benefits, those are really driven by headcount. And the headcount reductions have continued, albeit at a somewhat smaller pace than in the prior quarters. Professional fees are still a very nice source of save for us as we continue to be disciplined about our spend there. 
The bad debt experience in the quarter was higher. We actually had, year-over-year, about a $6 million negative in bad debt, and that reflects primarily the larger size of accounts receivable as we've driven higher revenue. We also had a slight deterioration in the aging of our portfolio, but the real driver was the size of the AR balance causing that $6 million negative year-over-year comparison for SG&A. 
All in all, we feel very good about SG&A. And in fact, we're reaffirming our target for a full year SG&A reduction of $40 million to $50 million. Obviously, we've got $37 million of that in our pocket already year-to-date. So we feel very comfortable that we'll be able to achieve the target that we gave, of $40 million to $50 million.
Looking at the profit lines, adjusted EBITDA came in at $216 million for the quarter, and that's at a 35.7% adjusted EBITDA margin, 460 basis points better than last year. And to Mike's point, obviously, we're taking full advantage of the increased operating leverage that we built into the business from lower cost. So a great story there, that in spite of a decline year-over-year in rental rates, I think is very encouraging. 
EPS, similar story there. Adjusted EPS of $0.40 for the quarter, and the drivers are the same as the EBITDA drivers I talked about. It is worth noting that in calculating EPS, we used a tax rate for the quarter of 39.5%. And I point that out simply because in the second quarter, we talked about a 54% tax rate as what we were thinking about going forward. That change in tax rate we can talk about in Q&A if anybody wants to get into it. But as we look at fourth quarter, we think something like the low-40s to mid-40s is the right way to think about the tax rate to apply to the fourth quarter income, and we'll continue to update, obviously, if anything major changes there.
Just a couple of quick words on our fleet management in the quarter. We have continued to drive optimal use of our fleet. One of the ways we talk about that is the amount of fleet that we transfer within our system, and the transfers were strong again in the third quarter, $1.6 billion of fleet transferred during the quarter. It's about 42% of our fleet overall moving during the quarter. And obviously, we've talked about how we believe that helps us to more effectively utilize the investment that we've made in fleet. 
In managing our used equipment sales for the quarter, we continue to execute our strategy of selling the older equipment first. So our used sales for the quarter came in at an average age of 78 months, consistent with where we've been over the last couple of years, and again, consistent with the strategy. 
Our net rental CapEx investment for the quarter was $81 million. That comprised of $113 million of gross capital spend and the $32 million of used sales proceeds that I mentioned previously. Year-to-date, we've spent $287 million of gross CapEx. And that spend has been, as we talked about before, has been directed towards supporting the growth that we're seeing with large accounts, supporting the reshaping the mix of our fleet and making sure that we're making good decisions about the components that we have that need to be addressed and need to provide the maximum rental experience for our customers. 
Where we're buying is in earthmoving equipment, a heavy proportion of the spend there. We're obviously replacing aerial. When aerial is new and half your fleet, you're certainly going spend to replace there. But we're also disproportionately spending on other general rentals categories like light towers, compressors, supporting in areas like water trucks, pick-up trucks and other important general rental categories.
Given our spending in the quarter and what we've done year-to-date, we feel very comfortable with spending more to support the environment that we're managing in. And so as we look at 2010, we now believe that we'll spend net rental CapEx in the range of $180 million to $200 million. That's up from the $160 million to $180 million that we had guided to last quarter.
Free cash flow for the quarter was solid, $37 million in the quarter, and that brings us to $144 million for the year-to-date. And again, that's very well in line with the guidance that we've previously given of full year free cash flow in the $200 million to $225 million range. That, obviously, in spite of the lowered cost saves on cost of rent and in spite of the higher spend on net rental CapEx. So we feel very good about being able to preserve that kind of free cash flow.
Our liquidity position ended the quarter strong again. We ended with roughly $860 million of total liquidity. And so we feel very comfortable with the position of the capital structure currently and how it supports our business.
As it relates to the capital structure, I'll just touch real briefly on the bond deal that we issued the press release around this morning. Many of you saw that, I'm sure. We are announcing that we expect to issue 10 years of senior subordinated notes, and the notion there is to use the proceeds to redeem our 7 3/4% notes that are maturing in 2013. This is consistent with our ongoing strategy of making sure that the maturity within our debt is well-managed and pushed out far enough so that we don't have any undue concerns about refinancing needs in the near term. We will be in the market today. We expect the issue to go well, and we expect that we will price and finalize terms over the next couple days.
Just real quickly on our 2010 outlook, I think I had touched on most of the components of our outlook. But just to reaffirm, our SG&A guidance for the 2010 full year is still expected to be a reduction of $40 million to $50 million, so no change there. Our cost of equipment rentals, we now expect a reduction of between $5 million and $15 million for the full year. That's down from the $30 million to $50 million that we had previously guided to. Net rental CapEx, we expect to spend between $180 million and $200 million. That's up from the previous range of $160 million to $180 million. And then, free cash flow, no change there, between $200 million to $225 million.
Real briefly on 2011. As we look down the road, we've started making some high-level decisions but we are certainly deep into our budgeting process as we speak. Still, we thought it was appropriate to give you some highlights as we're thinking about 2011. So on the rate front, Mike said that we expect, if trends continue, that the fourth quarter of this year will finish out with rates flat to up slightly year-over-year. If we achieve that, then, going into 2011, we'll have nice momentum. And in fact, if we achieve that fourth quarter performance and then just kept those rates flat throughout 2011, we would experience carryover in 2011 of about two percentage points year-over-year. Obviously, we'll drive for more than that, but I just wanted to give that data point that there's a couple of points of carryover in 2011 as we think about it today.
On the CapEx front for 2011, we've said this in one-on-ones, but I wanted to say it here more specifically. Our gross and net rental CapEx spend next year will be more in 2011 than it is this year. And in fact, I think we'd say now that it will be significantly more. Somebody's going to ask me what I mean by significant in Q&A, and I'll tell you that we don't have that number yet. But what we're thinking for 2011, based on the good momentum that we've seen with key relationships from 2010, we're going to need to spend to support those relationships, as well as to continue to position the fleet for where we want it to be over the long haul.  That said, we still expect that we will deliver positive free cash flow in 2011. And again, somebody's going to ask me, ""Well, what does positive free cash flow mean?"" It's somewhere between zero and infinity. So we can talk about that in more detail as we go forward as well. 
Those are the comments I wanted to make. Maybe I'll stop there and open it up for Q&A, and we can take it from there. So Operator?"

We've argued earlier in the year that this year's seasonal pattern seemed to be stronger than where it's been over the last several years, certainly stronger than last year. And so if you think about 7.1 percentage points of year-over-year time utilization improvement, I'd hate to put a number on how much of that is just seasonal -- excuse me, that year-over-year won't have a seasonal component. I'd hate to put a number on how much of that is broken out into the other buckets. That said, we've got nice growth in our key account relationships year-over-year in the quarter. So clearly, a portion of it is just growing those key account relationships. Mike, I'll let you put a number on how much of it might be the secular shift to rental versus owning.

But if you'd asked me that question a couple of months ago, I might've had a slightly different answer on the cost of rent components than I have today. Given the momentum we're seeing on volume demand and the variable cost drivers there, I'm probably less optimistic about a dramatic reduction in cost of rent next year. I know that we've got some initiatives that will help us address some of the fixed-cost components. I just think that the variable cost components could be a pretty strong headwind if the kind of volume demand that we're seeing continues into next year. So that one's a harder one to say that we'll have absolute dollars saves year-over-year next year or how much of those dollar saves might be. SG&A, I think I'm more optimistic that while we should have selling cost increase next year, that there are some other initiatives on the G&A cost components that we could use to offset those. I'm not ready to put a number on the page just yet. I'm hopeful that we'll be able to target further SG&A reductions next year.

One is to flip the question around and say, how do I feel about the level of leverage that I'm at today or that I got to last year in the most severe downturn that we've seen in a long time? And the answer was, we felt comfortable with the level of debt that we carried even in the depths of last year. And so you can kind of back into what a debt-to-EBITDA ratio in that environment was and infer that we would be comfortable there. Let's say that we got up to something in the 4.5 to 5x debt-to-EBITDA range at the depths of last year on a trailing-12 basis. That probably defines the upper side of that debt leverage measure that we look at. I'd peg a number, I'd just say 4 1/2, if we had a choice of actively managing it on the high side. On the low side, we've thought about the philosophy of the capitalization of this company quite a lot, actually, over the last year and a half. And we feel comfortable operating at levels of leverage that imply being a high-yield issuer. At the low end of the range, 3.5x debt-to-EBITDA is something that we think is probably a good place to look for the minimum of leverage. You go much beyond that, and you start to lose some of the cost of capital benefits that we see from being a highly levered company. So that's the range that I talk about generally, 3.5 to 4.5. And I'd say, we'll operate that way unless there's something really extreme one way or the other."

But at the same time, we do think that we've got operating objectives, and some of those we might address more aggressively if we are getting toward the lower end of the range.

So we'll balance all of those things as we go forward, but it would be a high-class problem to have to figure out how to manage a leverage ratio that's too low."

I'm going to start this morning by summarizing the quarter for you,",1874,"Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. On the call, as the operator stated, is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer, and other members of our senior management team. I'm going to start this morning by summarizing the quarter for you, particularly those metrics that relate to our strategy. And I want to focus our discussion on a tie-in between our strategy, our actions and our results. I'll also talk to you about the operating environment and where we see the recovery going next. And then Bill, later in the call, will cover all these in detail, the results in detail. And then after that, we'll take all of your questions. 
And so let's start with the numbers.  As you saw from our press release, we had a strong third quarter. We got some help from the environment in terms of demand. But for the most part, we generated our performance from the inside out by paying close attention to our strategy. As I shared with you in the past, that strategy is to transform the company for long-term profitability by defining our rentals according to our core business rental, achieving customer service leadership in our industry, continuously improving our cost structure and fleet management, and leveraging our size by pivoting our customer base towards large construction and industrial accounts that we service through a single point of contact. And we're being very disciplined about how we target these accounts while at the same time pursuing more profitable rentals from our customer base at large.
So as a result, we had positive net income of $23 million and EPS of $0.33 per share, when you compare that with the third quarter last year when we had a net income and earnings of zero. But the change is even more dramatic on an adjusted basis, with an EPS of $0.40 compared with $0.01 in last year's third quarter. And we've repeatedly said that we're only interested in profitable growth, and here's the evidence. We increased our adjusted EBITDA dollars by 17%, even though rental total revenues increased by only 2%. 
Our rental gross margin was up 1.9 percentage points for the quarter versus last year. In short, the numbers clearly show that we are delivering on our strategic priorities, and we're doing it within the context of a choppy recovery. It's true the cycle is turning, but it's a slow turn. And I'm happy to say that our performance has outpaced the construction environment for two straight quarters now. 
We know that construction spending in the U.S. actually took a step backward in July and August compared to last year, but I'm happy to report with the ABI numbers that came in last night, we're actually up the first time since 2008, and we take that as a piece of positive news.
When our rental revenues were up 6%, with that includes a same-store growth of 9.7%. Now these are all good indicators of how well positioned we are to leverage this recovery. We also continue to be diligent about costs, with an additional $4 million of SG&A expense out of the business compared to last year. That's a sustainable improvement, and that puts us solidly on target with our projections.
But the cost of equipment rentals x depreciation, which is a metric influenced by demand volume, increased by $12 million. And some of the demand is seasonal, some of it cyclical. And some of it, we believe, is coming from our end markets opting to rent equipment rather than to purchase it. And when you take these external factors into account and combine them with the impact of our strategy, it helped explain the record time utilization we reported last time. 
Now given these market opportunities, we have increased our strategic spend on fleet in the quarter by $113 million. We also sold $74 million of used equipment at more than 4x the margin we got last year, again, another sign that things are stabilizing. 
We have a lot of discipline invested in both cost control and fleet management, which is why we feel very comfortable reaffirming our free cash flow estimate for the year, even with the projected increase in net rental CapEx. Bill will go over these numbers and elaborate on our full year outlook after I complete this.
Now before I talk about the environment, I want to be very direct with you on the subject of rental rates. I know rates are a hot topic right now. I also know that there are some mixed signals in terms of the metrics being reported by our industry. As you saw last night, our own numbers showed record time utilization for the third quarter, but our rates were still down 1.4% compared to last year. 
So what's going on here? Well, for one thing, rates in general are lagging utilization in the recovery, as expected. Second, monthly rates are lagging daily weekly rates, and because our strategy focused on large accounts, about 71% of our transactions are monthly right now, that's up about two points sequentially and year-over-year. And the inherent difference in rates is obvious when you break it down in rental term. For example, in the third quarter, our monthly rates improved sequentially 1.7%, while daily rates were up 3%. That's almost twice the pace monthly.
The third factor is fleet mix. Aerial equipment accounts for roughly half our fleet, and we've said before, third equipment gets rented first on projects followed by aerial. And we expected aerial rates to be challenging in the short term. To some degree, they mask the environment in earthmoving and general rental rates. 
Overall, our rates have turned the corner. And in the third quarter, rates improved 2% sequentially from the second quarter. And that's one of the largest sequential improvements we've seen. And since we're focused on achieving a more optimal balance of pricing and time utilization, our dollar utilization is also improving, up 2.9 percentage points year-over-year in the quarter. That's good, but we plan to do a lot better.
Now at this point, and given current trends, we expect our rates to be flat or slightly positive year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and to continue to trend upward as we go into the next year in the first quarter of 2011.
Now we would normally be cautious by giving out that outlook, but I have a lot of confidence in the discipline that we're creating around rental rates. For example, our price optimization software called core is now in place on all of our branches except Trench. Core is giving us customer-centric pricing, which essentially means that our sales team now has a better understanding of optimal pricing. They know how far they can negotiate. And more importantly, they know when to walk away. Our price optimization is an example of how we're continuing to invest in technology, again, to support our strategy. Another one is our mobile website, which we announced last month. 
And when I look at all these initiatives, I see our strategy at work, but I also see a marketplace that is ready to move away from the downturn. Now I want to share some information that we're making available for the first time this morning. It supports what we hear from analysts and what our own employees report back for us in the field and a three good reasons to expect that rates will continue to trend upwards. In September, we surveyed over 1,600 of our customers with a wide range of rental spend. And to get their outlook on 2011, it excludes the goal where the survey is being conducted this month. And our results come from contractors out there in the trenches that they live in the reality every day. 
43% of those surveyed expect business to increase in 2011. 38% indicated the status quo are uncertain, and only 19% think things will continue to go downhill. The greatest uncertainty appears to be in the West, particularly the Southwest. The greatest optimism comes from the customers in our Northeast Canada and Midwest regions. So we're staying very close to our customers and listening to their input. 
Now let me tell you what our own branches are seeing out in the field. All nine of our regions show year-over-year growth in rental revenues in the third quarter, with the strongest being Northeast Canada and the weakest being the East and the Southwest. And on a macro level, the pictures equally is encouraging. In the third quarter, our rental revenues were up year-over-year in 33 of our 48 states and all Canadian provinces. Our 22 states and provinces now show year-over-year growth for 2010 through September. 
In our Trench, Power HVAC business had a good third quarter, up 6.8% in revenues and a 7.2% improvement in operating margin, and we're seeing demand from several directions. For one thing, the stimulus money is still in play and we have trench safety systems out on about 150 stimulus jobs right now. Both trench and power HVAC are servicing more infrastructure projects. The public sectors together with growth in industrial are driving results in this business.
I also want to mention the joint venture with AMECO that we announced in August. This is initially focused on oil and gas customers in the Gulf region. At this point, all the pieces are in place, and both partners are moving forward, and we'll keep you posted as things progress. But I think we've made it clear how excited we are to be able to pilot with this industrial venture with AMECO. Now even without the joint venture, our Industrial business contributed an additional $5 million of revenue in the third quarter versus last year. 
Industrial rental is just one example of how we're training our sales people to look beyond the traditional boundaries of the construction industry and pursue any market that fits our strategy for profitable growth. As we identify these opportunities, we are seeking out large customers where our scale has the most appeal, particularly our ability to share fleet across our North American footprint.
In the third quarter, national accounts accounted for about 29% of rental revenue, which is an increase both year-over-year and sequentially. Now it's worth noting that the increasing amount of our industrial business is coming from our national accounts. So as we grow our presence in the industrial sector, we're being guided by our customer segmentation strategy. 
The concept of staying true to our strategy informs every decision we make as we steer our company into the recovery. It's not going to be a smooth ride. But when we look at it at the markets, we see customers choosing to rent more equipment they need. Demand is part of the strong momentum that we're experiencing as we move into the two slowest quarters and should help soften the effect of seasonality. 
Now we've begun process of putting our plans in place for 2011, and to the degree that we can comment on, that will share our thoughts. So now on that note, I will now ask Bill to review the results. And then after that, we'll take your questions. So over to you, Bill."

As has become our tradition, I'll give some more detail on the quarter: Revenues; our cost performance; a little bit on the fleet; liquidity; update our outlook for 2010; and then touch on, as Mike said, touch o",2259,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As has become our tradition, I'll give some more detail on the quarter: Revenues; our cost performance; a little bit on the fleet; liquidity; update our outlook for 2010; and then touch on, as Mike said, touch on 2011.
On the revenue front, it was a good quarter, almost any way you slice it. Rental revenue, in particular, was up 6% year-over-year. That's the first year-over-year increase we've had in the quarter since the first quarter of 2008. So it's been a long time coming. Within that, Mike mentioned the time utilization increase that we saw, 71.3% time for the quarter. That's up 7.1 percentage points year-over-year. And I think it's legitimate to say that we didn't get it by shrinking the size of the fleet. Overall, the size of the fleet averaged slightly smaller this year compared to last year. The time really came out of stronger demand. OEC on rent was up 11% year-over-year.
Rates were working against us. So I think that makes that 6% revenue increase in rental revenue even more impressive. As Mike said, rates were down 1.4% year-over-year, although they were up two percentage points sequentially for the quarter. And when you look within the quarter, in fact, if you look over the last couple of quarters, on a sequential basis, rates have been sequentially positive for six consecutive months. Starting in April, they've been up every month on a sequential basis. 
Now Mike highlighted some of the internals that go along within rate. For example, daily and weekly rates are clearly outperforming our monthly rates overall. And when you look at equipment type, earthmoving and other general rentals categories are outperforming aerial and forklifts. But overall, the trend is established in the right direction and we certainly, as always, will continue to drive for better rate realization just across the board.
The other area of revenue that I wanted to focus a little bit of time on is used equipment sales. We sold $32 million in proceeds of used equipment during the third quarter. While it's down versus last year, you will all recall that we were selling at record levels of used equipment sales last year. So it should be no surprise that the proceeds came down. On an OEC basis, we sold $74 million of OEC in the quarter, and that was down as well versus $100 million or so that we sold last year. The good news is that we achieved the margin on our used sales this quarter of 31.3%. 
And as has been the case for the prior two quarters of this year, the margin story is really heavily driven by the distribution channel. We sold 57% of what we sold in the third quarter through retail and supported by used equipment pricing. The trends in used equipment pricing continue to be positive, that by the Rouse data that we received but also by our own individual experience in selling into the market. So used equipment market continues to be robust, and we'll continue to use it very effectively to manage our fleet.
On the cost side, cost of rentals were actually up year-over-year in the quarter, $237 million, up $12 million compared to last year. Now really, that cost performance is the tale of two cities. When you look into the fixed cost of our cost of rentals, we continue to deliver good cost performance on the fixed cost component of our cost structure. 
So when you look at salaries and benefits, you look at facilities cost, other structural fixed-cost components, we continue to deliver reductions in those components. It's just being outstripped by the variable cost components that are flowing with the increased rental volume. So when you look at repair and maintenance, delivery, fuel cost, those kinds of cost components that really are driven by how many transactions you do, they're up, and they've offset the saves that we realized on the fixed-cost side. 
That's prompted us to re-evaluate our outlook for cost performance over the remainder of 2010, and we're now saying that we expect cost of rent x depreciation to be a save of $5 million to $15 million compared to last year. Longer term, we're still very comfortable that we've improved significantly the cost structure of this business and still feel very good about our work against the fixed cost components of our business.
The story on SG&A is better. SG&A was down $4 million year-over-year, and the benefits are still coming out of the same places that we've been talking about. So salaries and benefits, those are really driven by headcount. And the headcount reductions have continued, albeit at a somewhat smaller piece than in the prior quarters. Professional fees are still a very nice source of save for us, as we continue to be disciplined about our spend there. 
The bad debt experience in the quarter was higher. We actually had year-over-year about a $6 million negative in bad debt, and that reflects primarily the larger size of accounts receivable as we've driven higher revenue. We also had a slight deterioration in the aging of our portfolio, but the real driver was the size of the AR balance causing that $6 million negative year-over-year comparison for SG&A. 
All in all, we feel very good about SG&A. And in fact, we're reaffirming our target for a full year SG&A reduction of $40 million to $50 million. Obviously, we've got $37 million of that in our pocket already year-to-date. So we feel very comfortable that we'll be able to achieve the target that we did of $40 million to $50 million.
Looking at the profit lines, adjusted EBITDA came in at $216 million for the quarter, and that's had a 35.7% adjusted EBITDA margin, 460 basis points better than last year. And to Mike's point, obviously, we're taking full advantage of the increased operating leverage that we built into the business from lower cost. So a great story there, that in spite of a decline year-over-year in rental rates, I think is very encouraging. 
EPS, similar story there. Adjusted EPS of $0.40 for the quarter, and the drivers are the same as the EBITDA drivers I talked about. It is worth noting that in calculating EPS, we used a tax rate for the quarter of 39.5%. And I point that out simply because in the second quarter, we talked about a 54% tax rate as what we were thinking about going forward. That change in tax rate, we can talk about in Q&A if anybody wants to get into it. But as we look at fourth quarter, we think something like the low-40s to mid-40s is the right way to think about the tax rate to apply to the fourth quarter income, and we'll continue to update obviously if anything major changes there.
Just a couple of quick words on our fleet management in the quarter. We have continued to drive optimal use of our fleet. One of the ways we talk about that is the amount of fleet that we transfer within our system, and the transfers were strong again the third quarter, $1.6 billion of fleet transferred during the quarter. It's about 42% of our fleet overall moving during the quarter. And obviously, we've talked about how we believe that helps us to more effectively utilize the investment that we've made in fleet. 
In managing our used equipment sales for the quarter, we continue to execute our strategy of selling the older equipment first. So our used sales for the quarter came in at an average age of 78 months, consistent with where we've been over the last couple of years, and again, consistent with the strategy. 
Our net rental CapEx investment for the quarter was $81 million. That comprised of $113 million of gross capital spend and $32 million of used sales proceeds that I mentioned previously. Year-to-date, we've spent $287 million of gross CapEx. And that spend has been, as we talked about before, has been directed towards supporting the growth that we're seeing with large accounts, supporting the reshaping the mix of our fleet and making sure that we're making good decisions about the components that we have that need to be addressed and need to provide the maximum rental experience for our customers. 
Where we're buying is in earthmoving equipment, a heavy proportion of the spend there. We're obviously replacing aerial. When aerial is new and half your fleet, you're certainly going spend to replace there. But we're also disproportionately spending on other general rentals categories like light towers, compressors, supporting in areas like water trucks, pick-up trucks and other important general rental categories.
Given our spending in the quarter and what we've done year-to-date, we feel very comfortable with spending more to support the environment that we're managing in. And so as we look at 2010, we now believe that we'll spend net rental CapEx in the range of $180 million to $200 million. That's up from the $160 million to $180 million that we had guided to last quarter.
Free cash flow for the quarter was solid, $37 million in the quarter, and that brings us to $144 million for the year-to-date. And again, that's very well in line with the guidance that we've previously given of full year free cash flow in the $200 million to $225 million range. That, obviously, in spite of the lowered cost saves on cost of rent and in spite of the higher spend on net rental CapEx. So we feel very good about being able to preserve that kind of free cash flow.
Our liquidity position ended the quarter strong again. We ended with roughly $860 million of total liquidity. And so we feel very comfortable with the position of the capital structure currently and how it supports our business.
As it relates to the capital structure, I'll just touch real briefly on the bond deal that we issued the press release around this morning. Many of you saw that, I'm sure. We are announcing that we expect to issue 10 years of senior subordinated notes, and the notion there is to use the proceeds to redeem our 7 3/4% notes that are maturing in 2013. This is consistent with our ongoing strategy of making sure that the maturity within our debt is well managed and pushed out far enough so that we don't have any undue concerns about refinancing needs in the near term. We will be in the market today. We expect the issue to go well, and we expect that we will price and finalize terms over the next couple days.
Just real quickly on our 2010 outlook, I think I had touched on most of the components of our outlook. But just to reaffirm, our SG&A guidance for the 2010 full year is still expected to be a reduction of $40 million to $50 million, so no change there. Our cost of equipment rentals, we now expect a reduction of between $5 million and $15 million for the full year. That's down from the $30 million to $50 million that we had previously guided to. Net rental CapEx, we expect to spend between $180 million and $200 million. That's up from the previous range of $160 million to $180 million. And free cash flow, no change there, between $200 million to $225 million.
Real briefly on 2011. As we look down the road, we've started making some high-level decisions that we are certainly deep into our budgeting process as we speak. Still, we thought it was appropriate to give you some highlights as we're thinking about 2011. So on the rate front, Mike said that we expect, if trends continue, that the fourth quarter of this year will finish out with rates flat to up slightly year-over-year. If we achieve that, then going into 2011, we'll have nice momentum. And in fact, if we achieve that fourth quarter performance and then just kept those rates flat throughout 2011, we would experience carryover in 2011 of about two percentage points year-over-year. Obviously, we'll drive for more than that, but I just wanted to give that data point that there's a couple of points of carryover in 2011 as we think about it today.
On the CapEx front for 2011, we've said this in one-on-ones, but I wanted to say it here more specifically. Our gross and net rental CapEx spend next year will be more in 2011 than it is this year. And in fact, I think we'd say now that it will be significantly more. Somebody's going to ask me what I mean by significant in Q&A, and I'll tell you that we don't have that number yet. But what we're thinking for 2011, based on the good momentum that we've seen with key relationships from 2010, we're going to need to spend to support those relationships, as well as to continue to position the fleet for where we want it to be over the long haul.  That said, we still expect that we will deliver positive free cash flow in 2011. And again, somebody's going to ask me, ""Well, what is positive free cash flow mean?"" It's somewhere between zero and infinity. So we can talk about that in more detail as we go forward as well. 
Those are the comments I wanted to make. Maybe I'll stop there and open it up for Q&A, and we can take it from there. So operator?"

We've argued earlier in the year that this year's seasonal pattern seemed to be stronger than where it's been over the last several years, certainly stronger than last year. And so if you think about 7.1 percentage points of year-over-year time utilization improvement, I'd hate to put a number on how much of that is just seasonal -- excuse me, that year-over-year won't have a seasonal component. I'd hate to put a number on how much of that is broken out into the other buckets. That said, we've got nice growth in our key account relationships year-over-year in the quarter. So clearly, a portion of it is just growing those key account relationships. Mike, I'll let you put a number on how much of it might be the secular shift to rental versus owning. But I'd say that, that's a smaller component of that year-over-year change. It's just really hard to put numbers on it."

The one thing I can tell you is that we look at, and it's on a year-over-year basis, our new accounts are up. So that means people are looking at ways to rent.

But if you'd asked me that question a couple of months ago, I might've had a slightly different answer on the cost of rent components than I have today. Given the momentum we're seeing on volume demand and the variable cost drivers there, I'm probably less optimistic about a dramatic reduction in cost of rent next year. I know that we've got some initiatives that will help us address some of the fixed-cost components. I just think that the variable cost components could be a pretty strong headwind if the kind of volume demand that we're seeing continues into next year. So that one's a harder one to say that we'll have absolute dollars saves year-over-year next year or how much of those dollar saves might be. SG&A, I think I'm more optimistic that while we should have selling cost increase next year, that there are some other initiatives on the G&A cost components that we could use to offset those.

One is to flip the question around and say, how do I feel about the level of leverage that I'm at today or that I got to last year in the most severe downturn that we've seen in a long time? And the answer was we felt comfortable with the level of debt that we carried even in the depths of last year. And so you can kind of back in to get the EBITDA ratio in that environment was and infer that we would be comfortable there. Let's say that we got up to something in the 4.5 to 5x debt-to-EBITDA range at the depths of last year on a trailing 12 basis. That probably defines the upper side of that debt leverage measure that we look at. I'd peg a number, I'd just say 4 1/2, if we had a choice of actively managing it on the high side. On the low side, we've thought about the philosophy of the capitalization of this company quite a lot actually over the last year and a half. And we feel comfortable operating at levels of leverage that imply being a high-yield issuer. At the low end of the range, 3.5x debt-to-EBITDA is something that we think is probably a good place to look for the minimum of leverage. You go much beyond that and you start to lose some of the cost of capital benefits that we see from being a highly levered company. So that's the range that I talked about generally, 3.5 to 4.5. And I'd say, we'll operate that way unless there's something really extreme one way or the other."
