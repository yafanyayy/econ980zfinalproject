Before we begin I would like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.
On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron’s President and CEO and Frank Connor, Textron’s Chief Financial Officer. Moving now to fourth quarter’s results which appear on slide 3 of the earnings call presentation. Revenues in the quarter were $2.8 billion, down 21% from a year ago which yielded a GAAP loss of $0.23 per share. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations, excluding special charges were $0.15 per share, down from $0.37 a year ago.
We recorded fourth quarter pretax special charges of $114 million. This included an $80 million charge to reflect impairment of goodwill at our Golf and Turf Care businesses. The impairment reflects our expectation of a slower recovery in these markets than previously anticipated. The remaining $34 million of special charges were associated with our restructuring program.
For the year, manufacturing operations provided $424 million of cash flow compared to our target of $300 million to $400 million. This included a $132 million in manufacturing restructuring cash outflows. And with that I will turn the call over to Scott.

Our industrial v",1420,"Thank you, Doug. Good morning everyone. I think we’ve brought a solid close to what for us has clearly been a challenging year. We have faced volume challenges throughout the year, ultimately delivering 289 [Jet numbers] to 467 in 2008. Our industrial volumes finished the year approximately 29% below the 2008 level and obviously in our financial services market, we faced too many of the same challenges that the financial industry has faced across the board.
I guess what I would like to do at this point is focus on the actions we’ve taken and how we take our company forward. In response to the challenging financial markets, we decided and announced early in the year to exit the non-captive finance businesses at TFC and I think our team has made a very good progress in executing the strategy. We’ve also taken a number of actions to reduce overhead and restructuring actions to match our production to the actual market demands.
From late 2008 through 2009, this resulted in a headcount reduction of over 10,000 people, almost one quarter of our work force. And all these actions have been difficult for our company and for our employees. I do believe we created a cost structure that should allow us to leverage volumes as market returns.
We have been focused on cash generation throughout the year, particularly with respect to working capital improvements primarily related to inventory. These programs have yielded real results as inventories were down $820 million. We have made a number of important capital structure changes to strengthen our balance sheet and we’ve restored access to the public capital market as we demonstrated through new term debt, convertible debt and equity offerings.
By the end of the year, we reduced our net debt, including securitizations by over $4 billion. And while we are not finished, I think we are on track to have a capital structure over the next couple of years which support a solid investment grade rating for manufacturing company with a relatively modest captive finance business. So let’s discuss each of the segments in detail.
In finance, as we mentioned earlier, our team at TFC, did a perfect job of shifting the focus from portfolio growth to liquidation and cash conversion. We reduced our managed receivables by $3.8 billion, compared to our initial 2009 goal of $2.6 billion. And we did this as you can see on slide 4 with high cash conversion with 94% for both, the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2009.
Slide 5 shows our full breakdown by portfolio, as you see the large reduction of $2.3 billion was in our distribution finance portfolio. As we look forward to 2010, we’re targeting a further reduction of $1.6 billion bringing our two year target to $5.4 billion. That’s $900 million higher than our original target of $4.5 billion. We are also upto a good start of 2010 as we recently completed the transfer of another private brand [four] plan account which included both the forward-funding commitments and the current receivables.
As we begin to liquidate an increasing proportion of our golf course and our resort portfolios, and properties this year, we would expect a different mix also in our remaining distribution finance asset, so in total we are expecting a cash conversion ratio of somewhere in the mid 80s. This is well within our five-year liquidation plan which we discussed earlier. In the business jet market, environment remains difficult but stable and we believe that we will begin to see improvement in order flow through the second half of the year.
In the meantime, we did have a $1.7 billion in cancellations for the quarter primarily driven by a single large customer account as we announced late last year. On the order front, we did see a pickup in activity as we had 32 gross orders in the quarter compared to 38 for the first three quarters combined. New Citation aircraft available for sale continued to decrease and in the year at 15.4% down from a peak of 17.3%.
Used pricing was essentially flat compared to the third quarter, but we are seeing more examples of planes being sold above prevailing rates. Usage on Cessna aircraft also increased slightly to 0.66 hours from 0.65 in the previous quarter. We delivered 68 jets this quarter which for the total year as I mentioned at 289 including 125 Mustangs. This contributed a strong cash flow assessment in the fourth quarter.
So as we look forward to 2010 we are targeting about 225 jet deliveries including 105 Mustangs and a much improved cash flow outlook. We currently have order for about 70% of the delivery plan. We expect to see low first quarter order rates as the number of the fourth quarter activities were driven primarily by tax incentive buyers, but we would expect that order rate to pick up throughout the course of the year.
With additional order activity we saw in the fourth quarter, we have actually increased our production plan slightly from where we had initially set it back in July timeframe. In the meantime, we continue to work on ways to reduce our costs including consolidation facilities and moving certain activities to lower cost countries.
In industrial segment, volumes were down 8% in the quarter, however our improved cost structure led to a $42 million increase in the segment profit despite the fact that revenues were down $26 million. The segment also generated a strong cash flow over 3.5 times segment profit. Looking to 2010, we are expecting a modest topline growth in the segment led by strong sales of Kautex.
We saw automotive volume increase in the fourth quarter and the consensus view in the auto industry is to continue to see that growth throughout 2010. The sales growth should generate a significant improvement in profits in our industrial segment.
Systems also had another strong quarter, sales were up nearly 11% from a year ago and we posted 13% margins. This growth is driven primarily by a diverse array of products we are producing, critically supporting our troops in today’s regional conflicts. We will talk more on our February 9 Analyst Day, but we clearly see more opportunities for future growth in this business as increasingly we look to foreign military entities for demand in this business.
Bell also had a good quarter which capped up a very solid year of operational execution. We delivered six V-22s bringing our full year total to 20. We delivered four H1s for a total of nine last year. We delivered all 29 of these military aircrafts ahead of schedule despite the six week labor disruption. In the quarter, we also delivered 50 commercial units bringing the total year number to 153.
While revenues were flat for the year, we boosted margins into double digits and we significantly increased our cash flow. 2009 was also an important year for Bell because we began to work [necessary] to support substantial growth over the next several years. For example in the commercial side we received certification of our new 429 light twin and started production processes of our 25 planned deliveries for this year going to 50 in 2011. We also ramped up our V-22 and H1 lines to deliver 28 V-22s and 20 H1s in 2010. Those backlog increased $1.3 billion in the quarter primarily reflecting the next installment of V-22 multi-year funding.
So we ended the year with a $6.9 billion backlog. Clearly growth is going to be very solid for Bell going forward. So in summary I would say we had a good quarter as we finished a year of transition. Looking forward, we still are going to continue our focus on cash generation and further reducing our debt and enhancing our liquidity and capital position. We still have work to do at Cessna on our costs, but we have seen the market stabilize and we do expect improvement as the economy progresses.
Leverage will increase as we see more volume coming through our industrial business and systems has a steady outlook for growth. And as I said Bell we believe is in the first of several years of significant growth driven by our backlog particularly in our military product lines. Across the board, we certainly expect to continue to invest in new products and services that are critical to future business growth. With that I would like to turn it over to Frank to go through some of the details.

Let’s start with the major factors that drove the $0.22 year-over-year reduction in adjusted EPS which are outlined on slide 6 of the earnings presentation deck. As you would expect the largest driver was lower manufacturing volume which reduced EPS by $0.63. Taxes reduced earnings by $0.10 primarily as a result of the foreign tax credit benefit from the repatriation of foreign cash during last year’s fourth quarter.
Higher share count and interest expense cost $0.05. And inflation rate of 1.2% cost $0.07 per share, slightly up raising pricing of $0.06 which reflected a rate of 1%. On the positive side, overall cost performance including lower SG&A and lower used aircraft losses benefited the quarter by $0.43. And TFC’s lower operating loss contributed $0.14 on a year-over-year basis. Now let’s look at the results for each of the segments starting with Cessna.
Cessna’s revenues decreased $642 million from the fourth quarter of 2008 reflecting lower volumes across the board. Cessna’s segment profit decreased $170 million due to lower sales volume which was partially offset by favorable cost performance. The favorable cost performance included lower selling and administrative expenses largely due to workforce reductions in 2009, the benefit of forfeiture income from order cancellations and a decrease in writedowns of pre-owned aircraft inventory.
The absolute impact of used aircraft for adjustments was minimal for this quarter. Cessna’s backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $4.9 billion, a decline of $2 billion from the third quarter.
Moving to Bell, Bell’s revenue decreased $51 million due to lower sales volume partially offset by higher pricing. Bell’s segment profit decreased $10 million due to the lower volume and a change in the commercial helicopter product mix partially offset by higher pricing.
At Textron Systems, revenue increased $49 million due to higher defense volumes which were partially offset by lower aircraft engine volumes. Segment profit increased $8 million again due to higher defense volumes, partially offset by the lower aircraft volume. Backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.7 billion, down $183 million from the third quarter.
Looking at the industrial segment, revenue decreased $26 million due to lower volume and lower pricing partially offset by a favorable foreign exchange impact. The industrial segment profit increased $42 million, due to the improved cost performance partially offset by lower volume and pricing. Our cost performance reflected workforce reductions, employee furloughs, temporary plant shutdowns and lower selling and administrative expenses.
Results at the finance segment reflected continuing financial challenges among our customers and the execution of our liquidation strategy. Looking at slide 7, 60 day plus delinquencies of finance receivables held for investment increased to $569 million from $440 million at the end of the third quarter. Non-accrual finance receivables increased to $1.04 billion from $838 million last quarter.
Charge-offs were $22 million compared to $23 million for the third quarter bringing total 2009 charge-offs to $115 million. Loss reserves ended the year at $341 million. In addition to loss reserve, the mark-to-market valuation allowance at the end of the year was $185 million. Collectively the loss reserve and valuation allowance reflects 7.6% of managed receivables.
Now let’s turn to our 2010 outlook. Looking at slide 8, we expect our EPS from continuing operations before special charges will be in the range of $0.30 to $0.50 per share based on a fully diluted share count of about 300 million shares. We expect that restructuring charges primarily for Cessna will cost about $30 million pretax or $0.06 per share on an after-tax basis.
We are anticipating a strong year on the cash front with manufacturing free cash flow of between $500 million and $550 million. A quick point on pension, we are estimating 2010 pension expense will be about $155 million which is about $65 million higher than our 2009 expense.
Now let’s move to our segment detail on slide 9. Our outlook at Cessna is based on reaching the 225 deliveries target that Scott mentioned. We expect deliveries to be lower in the early part of the year and build throughout the year. Specifically, we are planning for 30 to 35 deliveries in the first quarter which will result in a segment loss for the quarter. As volumes recover through the balance of the year, we expect margins will follow accordingly. As we previously indicated, we expect full year margins at Cessna in the low-single digits.
At Bell, our military ramp is expected to drive an overall increase in revenues of about 16%. Our margin expectation in the 10% to 10.5% range reflects increased military mix, higher pension costs and higher R&D. At Textron Systems, we are expecting mid-single digit revenue growth, primarily reflecting growth in unmanned aircraft systems and intelligent battlefield products.
We are projecting margins will compress slightly to a range of 11% to 12% as program lots are completed and the favorable productivity performance is rolled into forward contracts. For the industrial segment, we are anticipating an overall revenue growth rate of 6% and margins in the range of 3% to 4% as we get volume leverage from our improved cost structure.
Moving to our finance segment. As Scott discussed, we expect to liquidate about $1.6 billion of finance assets during the year and we are estimating a 2010 pretax loss in a range of around $250 million. I would note that these levels are fully consistent with our liquidation plan. So that concludes our prepared remarks for today. We look forward to providing more color at our Analyst Day on February 9 and operator we are now ready to take any questions.

So we have a number of programs going and it’s been sort of a gamut of update, block point type changes to a even a couple of aircraft that ultimately we would envision as new entries into the family of our products at Cessna.
So, we don’t have anything at this point that we would be publicly announcing.

So in other word, we don't want to announce, a new upgrade or block point change or a new aircraft if we don't think there’s going to be a reasonable level of commercial demand out there, again I think we saw some strength in the level of orders in the fourth quarter.
I would say generally speaking, we do feel a higher level of interest, more inquiries y across the board in terms of new aircraft, but until we really feel pretty confident that there is going to be a strong receptivity, we wouldn't announce a new aircraft in the market.

The reality is of course as you look at the non-accrual is that the team is working very hard and I think we always have to keep in mind this is a liquidating portfolio right. So everyone of these accounts, whether it’s in non-accrual or not a non-accrual or worse delinquency is getting a lot of a pretty direct attention in terms of the path forward via restructuring activity, a sales activity.
So we are working through these things sort of hand-to-hand combat, if you will regardless of whether it’s non-accrual or not. I think what’s important to note is that regardless of the non-accrual status, be it there because of delinquency or be it there because of our judgment that over the long-term we don’t think we will get full principal interest back, that this is all still well within the context of what we showed you guys in terms of the alternate liquidation of TFC i.e. the losses that we guided you towards and we presented and obviously we will give you an update to go through the full details again in the Analyst Day on the 9. That this all falls within that. So there is no material change to our view of what the ultimate total losses are going to be as we liquidate this portfolio.

So there clearly are more banks and financial institutions now that are wanting to move back into the space. There is yet to be seen as you think about the golf and the resort. Those are very different assets. We did see some securitizations that were done by some companies in the timeshare space in the latter part of 2009.

Adjusted earnings from continuing operations, excluding special charges, were $0.15 per share, down from $0.37 a year ago.We recorded fourth quarter pretax special charges of $114 million. This included an $80 million charge to reflect the impairment of goodwill at our Golf and Turf Care businesses. The impairment reflects our expectation of a slower recovery in these markets than previously anticipated. The remaining $34 million of special charges were associated with our restructuring program.For the year, manufacturing operations provided $424 million of cash flow compared to our target of $300 million to $400 million. This included $132 million in manufacturing restructuring cash outflows. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."

I think we've brought a solid close to what for us has clearly been a challenging year. We have faced volume challenges throughout the year, ultimately delivering 289 jets at Cessna versus 467 in 2008. Our Industrial volumes finished the year approximately 29% below the 2008 levels. And obviously, in our financial service market, we faced in too many of the same challenges that the financial industry has faced across the board. I guess what I'd like to do at this point is focus on the actions we've taken and how we take our company forward. In response to the challenging financial markets, we decided to announce early in the year to exit the non-captive finance businesses at TFC, and I think our team has made very good progress in executing this strategy. We've also taken a number of actions to reduce overhead and restructuring actions to match our production to the actual market demands. From late 2008 through 2009, this resulted in a headcount reduction of over 10,000 people, almost 1/4 of our workforce. And while these actions have been difficult for our company and for our employees, I do believe we've created a cost structure that should allow us to leverage volumes when markets return.We've been very focused on cash generation throughout the year, particularly with the working capital improvements, primarily related to inventory. These programs have yielded real results, as our inventories are down $820 million. We've made a number of important capital structure changes to strengthen our balance sheet, and we've restored access to the public capital markets, as we demonstrated through new term debt, convertible debt and equity offerings.By the end of the year, we've reduced our net debt, including securitizations, by over $4 billion. And while we're not finished, I think we are on track to have a capital structure over the next couple of years, which should support a solid investment-grade rating for a manufacturing company with a relatively modest captive finance business. So let's discuss each of the segments in detail.  In Finance, as I mentioned earlier, our team at TFC did a terrific job of shifting their focus from portfolio growth to liquidation and cash conversion. We reduced our managed receivables by $3.8 billion compared to our initial 2009 goal of $2.6 billion.  And we did this, as you can see on Slide 4, with high cash conversion, with 94% for both the fourth quarter and for the full year 2009.Slide 5 shows our full breakdown by portfolio. As you see, the largest reduction of $2.3 billion, was in our Distribution Finance portfolio. As we look forward to 2010, we're targeting a further reduction of $1.6 billion, bringing our two-year target to $5.4 billion. That's $900 million higher than our original target of $4.5 billion.We're also off to a good start in 2010, as we recently completed the transfer of another private brand floor plan account, which included both the forward funding commitments and the current receivables. As we begin to liquidate an increasing proportion of our golf course and our resort portfolios and properties this year, we would expect a different mix also in our remaining Distribution Finance asset. So in total, we're expecting a cash conversion ratio somewhere in the mid-80s. This is well within our five-year liquidation plan, as we discussed earlier.At Cessna, the business jet market environment remains difficult but stable, and we believe that we will begin to see improvement in order flow through the second half of the year. In the meantime, we did have a $1.7 billion in cancellations for the quarter, primarily driven by a single large customer account, as we announced late last year. On the order front, we did see a pick up in activity, as we have 32 gross orders in the quarter compared to 38 for the first three quarters combined. New Citation aircraft available for sale continue to decrease, ending the year 15.4%, down from a peak of 17.3%.  Used pricing was essentially flat compared to the third quarter, but we are seeing more examples of planes being sold above prevailing rates.Uses on Cessna aircraft also increased slightly to 0.66 hours from 0.65 in the previous quarter. We delivered 68 jets this quarter, which brought our total for the year, as I mentioned, to 289, including 125 Mustangs. This contributed to strong cash flow assessed in the fourth quarter.So as we look forward to 2010, we're targeting about 225 jet deliveries, including 105 Mustangs and a much improved cash flow outlook. We currently have orders for about 70% of the delivery planned. We expect to see lower first quarter order rates, as the number of the fourth quarter activities were driven primarily by tax incentive buyers, but we would expect that order rate to pick up throughout the course of the year.With the additional order activity that we saw in the fourth quarter, we've actually increased our production plan slightly from where we initially set it back in the July timeframe. In the meantime, we continue to work on ways to reduce our cost, including consolidation of facilities and moving certain activities to lower-cost countries. In the Industrial segment, volumes were down 8% in the quarter. However, our improved cost structure led to a $42 million increase in segment profit despite of the fact that revenues were down $26 million.The segment also generated a strong cash flow, over 3.5x segment profit. Looking to 2010, we're expecting a modest top line growth in the segment, led by strong sales of Caltex. We saw automotive volume increase in the fourth quarter, and the consensus view in the auto industry is to continue to see that grow throughout 2010.The sales growth should generate a significant improvement in profits in our Industrial segment. Systems also had another strong quarter. Sales were up nearly 11% from a year ago, and we posted 13% margins. This growth is driven primarily by diverse array of products that we're producing, critically supporting our troops in today's regional conflicts. We'll talk more on our February 9 Analyst Day, but we clearly see more opportunities for future growth in this business, as increasingly, we look to foreign military entities for demand in this business.Bell also had a good quarter, which capped up a very solid year of operational execution. We delivered six V-22s, bringing our full year total to 20. We delivered four H1s, for a total of nine last year. We delivered all 29 of this military aircraft ahead of schedule despite the six-week labor disruption.In the quarter, we also delivered 50 commercial units, bringing the total year number to 153. While revenues were flat for the year, we boosted margins into double digits. And we significantly increased our cash flow. 2009 was also an important year at Bell because we began the work necessary to support substantial growth over the next several years. For example, in the commercial side, we received certification of our new 429 Light Twin and started production processes of our 25 planned deliveries for this year, growing to 50 in 2011. We also ramped up our V-22 and H1 lines to deliver 28 V-22s and 20 H1s in 2010. Bell's backlog increased $1.3 billion in the quarter, primarily reflecting the next installment of V-22 multi-year funding, so we ended the year with a $6.9 billion backlog.  Clearly, growth is going to be very solid for Bell going forward. So in summary, I say we had a good quarter, as we finish a year of transition. Looking forward, we clearly want to continue our focus on cash generation and further reducing our debt and enhancing our liquidity and capital position. We still have work to do at Cessna on our cost, but we have seen the markets stabilize, and we do expect improvement as the economy progresses.Leverage will increase, as we see more volume coming through our Industrial business and Systems have a steady outlook for growth. And as I said, Bell, we believe, is in the first of several years of significant growth, driven by our backlog, particularly in military product lines.And across the board, we certainly expect to continue to invest in the new products and services that are critical to future business growth. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Frank to go through some of the details."

Let's start with the major factors that drove the $0.22 year-over-year reduction in adjusted EPS, which are outlined on Slide 6 of the earnings presentation deck. As you would expect, the largest driver was lower manufacturing volume, which reduced EPS by $0.63. Taxes reduced earnings by $0.10, primarily as a result of the foreign tax credit benefit from the repatriation of foreign cash during last year's fourth quarter. Higher share count and interest expense cost $0.05. An inflation rate of 1.2% cost $0.07 per share, slightly outpacing pricing of $0.06, which reflected a rate of 1%. On the positive side, overall cost performance, including lower SG&A and lower used aircraft losses, benefited the quarter by $0.43.  And TFC's lower operating loss contributed $0.14 on a year-over-year basis. Now let's look at the results for each of the segments, starting with Cessna.  Cessna's revenues decreased $642 million from the fourth quarter of 2008, reflecting lower volumes across the board. Cessna's segment profit decreased $170 million due to lower sales volume, which was partially offset by favorable cost performance. The favorable cost performance included lower selling and administrative expenses, largely due to workforce reductions in 2009, the benefit of forfeiture income from order cancellations and a decrease and write-downs of pre-owned aircraft inventory.  The absolute impact of used aircrafts  for the adjustments was minimal for this quarter.  Cessna's backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $4.9 billion, a decline of $2 billion from the third quarter.Moving to Bell, Bell's revenue decreased $51 million due to lower sales volume, partially offset by higher pricing. Bell's segment profit decreased $10 million due to the lower volume and the change in the commercial helicopter product mix, partially offset by higher pricing. At Textron Systems, revenue increased $49 million due to higher defense volumes, which were partially offset by lower aircraft engine volumes. Segment profit increased $8 million, again due to higher defense volumes, partially offset by the lower aircraft volume. Backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.7 billion, down $183 million from the third quarter.Looking at the Industrial segment, revenue decreased $26 million due to lower volume and lower pricing, partially offset by a favorable foreign exchange impact. The Industrial segment profit increased $42 million due to the improved cost performance, partially offset by lower volume and pricing. Our cost performance reflected workforce reductions, employee furloughs, temporary plant shutdowns and lower selling and administrative expenses.  Results at the Finance segment reflected continuing financial challenges among our customers and the execution of our liquidation strategy. Looking at Slide 7, 60-day-plus delinquencies of finance receivables held for investment increased to $569 million from $440 million at the end of the third quarter.  Non-accrual finance receivables increased to $1.04 billion from $838 million last quarter. Charge-offs were $22 million compared to $23 million for the third quarter, bringing total 2009 charge-offs to $115 million. Loss reserves ended the year at $341 million. In addition to loss reserve, the mark-to-market valuation allowance at the end of the year was $185 million. Collectively, the loss reserve and valuation allowance reflect 7.6% of managed receivables.Now let's turn to our 2010 outlook. Looking at Slide 8, we expect our EPS from continuing operations before special charges will be in the range of $0.30 to $0.50 per share based on a fully-diluted share count of about 300 million shares. We expect that restructuring charges, primarily for Cessna, will cost about $30 million pretax or $0.06 per share on an after-tax basis. We're anticipating a strong year in the cash front, with manufacturing free cash flow of between $500 million and $550 million. A quick point on pension, we're estimating 2010 pension expense will be about $155 million, which is about $65 million higher than our 2009 expense.Now let's move to our segment detail on Slide 9. Our outlook at Cessna is based on reaching the 225 deliveries target that Scott mentioned. We expect deliveries to be lower in the early part of the year and build throughout the year. Specifically, we're planning for 30 to 35 deliveries in the first quarter, which will result in a segment loss for the quarter. As volumes recover through the balance of the year, we expect margins will follow accordingly. As we've previously indicated, we expect full year margins at Cessna in the low single digits.At Bell, our military ramp is expected to drive an overall increase in revenues of about 16%. Our margin expectation in the 10% to 10 1/2% range reflects increased military mix, higher pension costs and higher R&D. At Textron Systems, we're expecting mid-single digit revenue growth, primarily reflecting growth in unmanned aircraft systems and intelligent battlefield products.We're projecting margins will compress slightly to a range of 11% to 12%, as program lots are completed and a favorable productivity performance is rolled into forward contracts. For the Industrial segment, we're anticipating an overall revenue growth rate of about 6% and margins in the range of 3% to 4% as we get volume leverage from our improved cost structure.Moving to our Finance segment, as Scott discussed, we expect to liquidate about $1.6 billion of Finance assets during the year, and we are estimating a 2010 pretax loss in a range around $250 million. I would note that these levels are fully consistent with our liquidation plan.So that concludes our prepared remarks for today. We look forward to providing more color at our Analyst Day on February 9. And operator, we're now ready to take any questions."

But then we look at more coming from Golf, where we would expect to see larger discounting to get people to refinance those properties. So it is very much a mix of that. But generally speaking, I'd say we still expect to be holding to the strategy that we had which was the 2010 will be predominantly, a year where it's more runoff. But I think there will be higher losses associated with some of the balance of what we have in the distribution of finance and we've always assumed that we would have higher discounting or losses associated with things like the Golf Mortgage portfolio."

On the call today we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's President and CEO; and Frank Connor, Textron's Chief Financial Officer. Our customary earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Moving now to first quarter results, which appear on Slide 3 of the presentation, revenues in the quarter were $2.2 billion, down 12.5% from a year ago, which yielded a loss from continuing operations of $0.01 per share. During the quarter, we incurred special charges which include the following two items: $12 million in pretax restructuring costs were up $0.02 per share on an after-tax basis and a discrete tax charge of $11 million related to the recently enacted federal health-care law were $0.04 per share. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations, excluding special charges then, were $0.05 per share compared to $0.26 a year ago. 
On the free cash flow front, manufacturing operations used $153 million of cash, reflecting normal seasonality compared to a use of $286 million in the first quarter of 2009. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."

While overall revenues were down, reflecting lower aircraft deliveries and the wind down of our Non-Captive Finance business, we had strong performance across the rest of the company. Industrial revenues were up 32%,",1145,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. While overall revenues were down, reflecting lower aircraft deliveries and the wind down of our Non-Captive Finance business, we had strong performance across the rest of the company. Industrial revenues were up 32%, reflecting strong growth in the global automotive markets, and early signs of growth in our non-U.S. markets for E-Z-GO, Jacobsen and Greenlee. Aftermarket revenue at Bell and Cessna were both up solid single digits, reflecting increased aircraft utilization, and our System business revenues were up over 9.5%. Bell and Systems also delivered solid margins in the quarter. As we look at the trends, we believe the first quarter marginal revenue trough for Textron, and we expect our earnings will clearly grow over the course of the year.  
So let's discuss highlights of each of our segments, beginning with Finance, where we continue to make excellent progress with our liquidation strategy. We reduced managed receivables by $769 million in the quarter, bringing our total reduction since the beginning of 2009 to $4.5 billion. About $380 million of first quarter reduction occurred in our Distribution Finance business, which contributed to an overall favorable cash conversion rate of 95%. We also made progress in our timeshare portfolio in the quarter, reducing it by $100 million. 
In terms of credit performance, 60-day delinquencies were $515 million, down from $569 million in the fourth quarter, and non-accrual stabilized at $1.03  billion, down modestly from $1.04 billion last quarter. Charge-offs were $31 million, up from $22 million in the fourth quarter, as previously reserve losses were realized. Looking forward, we're increasing our 2010 liquidation target by $200 million to $1.8 billion, which will bring us to a two-year reduction of $5.6 billion.
At Cessna, we delivered 21 Mustangs and 10 light mid-sized jets in the quarter, consistent with our expectations. Orders in the first quarter were also consistent with our expectations. However, cancellations came in slightly above plan, although a majority were for deliveries in 2011 and beyond. 
Looking forward, we see additional cancellations in the second quarter, but we're expecting orders to pick up as market and economic indicators continue to trend in the right direction. For example, used Citation aircraft available for sale continued to decrease, ending the quarter 15.1%, down from a peak of 17.3% and 15.4% at the end of 2009. Used pricing remained stable. Average daily utilization on Cessna Aircraft also remained stable at 0.66 hours for the quarter, while FAA reported takeoff and landing cycles are up. As I mentioned, Cessna aftermarket revenues were up about 6%. 
U.S. corporate profits, a key leading indicator, has been up over the past several quarters and earning results so far in the quarter have been positive as well. And finally, we're seeing increased sales increase, particularly in our light to mid-size jet models. In the meantime, we continue to work on reducing costs, including consolidation of facilities and moving certain activities to lower cost locations. On the new product development front, the CJ4 was certified during the quarter, and we've already delivered our first unit earlier this month.  Looking to the second quarter, we're expecting to deliver between 40 and 45 jets, with a balance mixed of Mustangs and light to mid-size jets. 
In the Industrial business, we're getting good conversion on volume growth, achieving a margin of 7.8%. This reflects the positive impact of our cost reduction programs are having in these businesses. We're also pursuing new business opportunities to launch new products, winning new accounts and expanding geographically. 
At Textron Systems, growth was driven by a diverse array of products we're providing to our troops in today's conflicts. AAI delivered seven new Shadow Systems in the quarter, up from three a year ago. We're also selected to be a key subcontractor for development and initial production of a sophisticated avionic warfare testing system, which features AAI's leading-edge RF stimulus measurement subsystems. ASV program also continues to move forward as we expect to sign new contracts soon, which would increase backlog and extend production through the first quarter of 2012.
Another product manufactured by New Orleans-based TMLS [Textron Marine & Land Systems] operation is a 47-foot Motor Life Boat. During the quarter, we delivered the first of the six for the Mexican Navy and are pursuing additional international opportunities for that product as well. 
At Bell, we also had a good quarter, demonstrating continued operational execution. We delivered four V-22s and three H-1s compared to five and four, respectively, a year ago, but consistent with our delivery plan for the year. This is simply a matter of timing, and we're on track to deliver 28 V-22s and 20 H-1s this year, up from the 20 V-22s and nine H-1s last year. We also delivered 15 commercial units in the quarter. We have significant sales inquiry activity underway, and we remain on track for our commercial helicopter delivery plan of about 150 units. 
Our first new 429 entered into commercial service and the air ambulance configuration this month, and has already demonstrated its performance capabilities. The 429 production on schedule, we expect to deliver approximately 25 of these aircraft in 2010.
So as we look forward for the balance of the year, I'd say we are confident that we can reach our new target of $1.8 billion of liquidations in our Non-Captive Finance business. We feel that cash generation has been generated to date, has allowed us to make substantial improvements in our capital structure. Frank will take you through the details of that shortly. It also gives us the flexibility, I believe, to make sure that we make the proper economic decisions as we exit the balance of that portfolio. 
We talked last year about our restructuring programs and focused on cost reduction and what that would need in terms of delivering additional margin as volume return. And I think we've demonstrated that in the first quarter in our Industrial segment. Our Systems business continues to have a steady outlook for growth and is executing very well. Bell Military is successfully executing the middle of our multi-year ramp on the military side of the program, and I think we've put the right people and the right products in place to capitalize on growth in the commercial sector going forward. 
Clearly, the last 18 months have been difficult in the business jet market and has presented numerous challenges for our Cessna business. As I indicated earlier, we believe that the cycle is going to follow its normal course. We see the right early indicators, including most recently, corporate profit is getting stronger. And I would say that the increased level of inquiry and sales activity in the latter part of the first quarter bodes well for this industry to start to turn.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Frank to take you through the details and the financials."

Let's start with the major factors that drove the $0.21 year-over-year reduction in adjusted EPS, which are outlined on Slide 7. The largest driver was lower manufacturing volume, which reduced EPS by $0.29. Last",617,"Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with the major factors that drove the $0.21 year-over-year reduction in adjusted EPS, which are outlined on Slide 7. The largest driver was lower manufacturing volume, which reduced EPS by $0.29. Last year's CESCOM sale at Cessna cost $0.12 per share. A number of discrete tax items, which occurred last year, resulted in a $0.09 reduction in earnings. An inflation rate of 2.3% caused $0.11 per share, which outpaced pricing of 1%,  which provided a $0.05 lift. A higher share count in interest expense cost $0.03 per share, and our pension headwind cost $0.02.
On the positive side, overall cost performance and lower S&A benefited the quarter by $0.38 per share, and TFC's lower operating loss contributed $0.02 on a year-over-year basis. 
Now let's start with the results for each our segments, starting with Cessna.  For Cessna in the quarter, revenues decreased $336 million, reflecting the lower aircraft volumes. Segment profit decreased $114 million due to the lower sales volume, the gain related to last year's CESCOM sale and higher inflation. These items were partially offset by improved cost performance, which included lower selling and administrative expenses, largely due to workforce reductions, lower inventory reserves and lower used aircraft losses. Cessna backlog at the end of the quarter at $4.1 billion, a decline of $820 million from the end of last year. 
Looking at Bell, revenues decreased $124 million due to lower sales volume. Segment profit, however, increased $5 million as positive program performance, nonrecurring product launch costs in 2009 and lower warranty, selling and administrative cost more than offset the negative impact of reduced volumes. Bell backlog at the end of the first quarter was $6.9 billion, down slightly from the end of last year. 
For Textron Systems, segment revenues and profits increased $40 million and $3 million, respectively, primarily due to higher defense volumes. Backlog at Systems ended the fourth quarter at $1.4 billion, down $220 million from the fourth quarter of last year. 
For the Industrial segment, revenue increased $150 million, which was driven by $140 million increase in our Automotive businesses. Industrial profit increased $58 million due to higher volume and improved cost performance, partially offset by higher inflation, net of pricing. Cost performance improved due to workforce reductions and other cost initiatives.
For the Finance segment, revenues decreased $46 million compared to the first quarter of 2009, largely due to the revenue impact of lower average Finance receivables, a mark-to-market adjustment on our held-for-sale portfolio and suspended earnings on non-accrual receivables. Finance segment losses improved $8 million, primarily reflecting lower loan loss provisions, reduced selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by the impact of the lower average Finance receivables, the mark-to-market adjustment and suspended earnings on non-accrual receivables.
Turning our attention to the 2010 outlook and looking at Slide 8, we continue to expect EPS from continuing operations before special charges will be in the range of $0.30 to $0.50 per share, with free cash flow from continuing operations for the manufacturing group of between $500 million and $550 million. 
As Scott mentioned, I'd like to conclude by reviewing progress we've made with our balance sheet. Looking at Slide 9, you can see that we ended the quarter with net debt of $6.8 billion, down from $7.4 billion at the end last year and $11.9 billion at the end of 2008. And given our improved liquidity position, yesterday, we paid down $250 million of Textron's bank line.

In fact, in particular the European markets, which historically will do some restocking through the winter season didn't really do that. So they held off on taking inventory.

But as you look back in previous cycles, you never saw such a dramatic roll off of backlog. And near as I can tell, it's really just driven by the fact that you came into this thing with such an incredibly unprecedentedly strong market in terms of demand for business jets. And then of course, the depth of the economic collapse on the other side was just as severe. So I think we've seen the results of this decline. The backlog are just like an intersection of an unprecedented strong period followed by an unprecedented weak period. Obviously, most of us hope not to ever see that again. I mean I think we'll have more modest growth on the upside, if you'd like to think that we're never going to see the kind of economic collapse that we saw. And of course, you throw the politics on top of it, which also exaggerated, I think, the downside of this. So you had a situation where even people who still have the economic wherewithal stay in the backlog. Off a lot of people bailed out because they didn't even want to have a perception of being associated with business jets. So it's just in an awfully wild swing in both directions. Obviously, one of the things we're going to do and hopefully we see this across the whole industry is look for tougher deposit terms and higher level of deposits with many of the customers. But again I don't want to mislead you. That's a commercial term and condition, and it's a competitive marketplace out there.

On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's President and CEO; and Frank Connor, Textron's Chief Financial Officer. Our customary earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Moving now to first quarter results, which appear on slide three of the presentation, revenues in the quarter were $2.2 billion, down 12.5% from a year ago, which yielded a loss from continuing operations of $0.01 per share.
During the quarter, we incurred special charges which include the following two items; $12 million in pre-tax restructuring costs or $0.02 per share on an after-tax basis, and a discrete tax charge of $11 million related to the recently enacted federal healthcare law or $0.04 per share.
Adjusted earnings from continuing operations excluding special charges then were $0.05 per share compared to $0.26 a year ago. On the pre-tax role front, manufacturing operations used $153 million of cash, reflecting normal seasonality compared to a use of $286 million in the first quarter of 2009.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.

While overall revenues were down, reflecting lower aircraft deliveries and the wind-down of our non-captive finance business, we had strong performance across the rest of the company.Industrial revenues were up",1133,"Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. While overall revenues were down, reflecting lower aircraft deliveries and the wind-down of our non-captive finance business, we had strong performance across the rest of the company.
Industrial revenues were up 33%, reflecting strong growth in the global automotive markets and early signs of growth in our non-U.S. markets for EZ-GO and Jacobsen agreement. Aftermarket revenue with Bell and Cessna were both up solid single digits, reflecting increased aircraft utilization. And our Systems business revenues were up over 9.5%. Bell and Systems also delivered solid margins in the quarter. As we look at the trends, we believe the first quarter margin revenue dropped for Textron and we expect our earnings will clearly grow over the course of the year.
So let's discuss highlights of each of our segments beginning with Finance where we continue to make excellent progress with our liquidation strategy. We reduced managed receivables by $769 million in the quarter, bringing our total reductions since the beginning of 2009 to $4.5 billion. About $380 million of first quarter reduction occurred in our distribution finance business, which contributed to an overall favorable cash conversion rate of 95%. We also made progress in our timeshare portfolio in the quarter, reducing it by $100 million.
In total, the credit performance, 60-day delinquencies were $515 million, down from $569 million in the fourth quarter; and non-accruals stabilized at $1.03 billion, down modestly from $1.04 billion last quarter. Charge-offs were $31 million, up from $22 million in the fourth quarter, as previously reserved losses were realized. Looking forward, we're increasing our 2010 liquidation target by $200 million to $1.8 billion, which will bring us to a two-year reduction of $5.6 billion.
At Cessna, we delivered 21 Mustangs and 10 light mid-sized jets in the quarter, consistent with our expectation. Orders in the first quarter were also consistent with our expectations. However, cancellations came in slightly above plan, although a majority were for deliveries in 2011 and beyond. Looking forward, we see additional cancellations in the second quarter, but we're expecting orders to pick up as market and economic indicators continue to trend in the right direction.
For example, used Citation aircraft available for sale continued to decrease, ending the quarter with 15.1%, down from a peak of 17.3% and 15.4% at the end of 2009. Used pricing remained stable. Average daily utilization of Cessna aircraft also remained stable at 0.66 hours for the quarter, while FA reported takeoff and landing cycles were up. As I mentioned, Cessna aftermarket revenues were up about 6%.
U.S. corporate profit, a key leading indicator, has been up over the past several quarter, and earning results so far in the quarter have been positive as well. And finally, we are seeing increased sales, particularly in our low-to-mid sized jet models. In the meantime, we continue to work on reducing costs, including consolidation of facilities and moving certain activities to lower-cost locations.
On the new product development front, the CJ4 was certified during the quarter, and we've already delivered our first unit earlier this month. Looking over the second quarter, we're expecting to deliver between 40 and 45 jets for the balance mixed of Mustangs and light-to-mid sized jets.
In the Industrial business, we're getting conversion on volume growth, achieving a margin of 7.8%. This reflects the positive impact that our cost reduction programs are having on these businesses. We're also pursuing new business opportunities to launch new products, winning new accounts and expanding geographically.
At Textron Systems, growth was driven by a diverse array of products we're providing to our troops in today's complex. AAI delivered seven new Shadow systems in the quarter, up from three a year ago. We're also selected to be a key subcontractor for development and initial production of a sophisticated avionic warfare testing system which features AAI's leading-edge RF stimulus and measurement subsystems.
ASV program also continues to move forward, as we expect to sign new contracts soon, which would increase backlog and extend production through the first quarter of 2012.
Another product manufactured by our New Orleans based TM&LS operation is the 47-foot Motor Lifeboat. During the quarter we delivered the first of six for the Mexican Navy and are pursuing additional international opportunities for that product as well.
At Bell, we also had a good quarter, demonstrating continued operational execution. We delivered four V-22s and three AH-1s compared to five and four respectively a year ago, but consistent with our delivery plan for the year. This is simply a matter of timing, and we're on track to deliver 28 V-22s and 20 H-1s this year, up from 20 V-22s and 9 H-1s last year. We also delivered 15 commercial units in the quarter.
We have significant sales enquiry activity underway. We remain on track for a commercial helicopter delivery plan of about 150 units. Our first 429 entered into commercial service in the air ambulance configuration this month and has already demonstrated its performance capabilities. With 429 production on schedule, we expect to deliver approximately 25 of these aircrafts in 2010.
So as we look forward for the balance of the year, I'd say we are confident that we can reach our new target of $1.8 billion of liquidations in our non-captive finance business. We feel the cash generation that's been generated to date has allowed us to make substantial improvements in our capital structure. Frank would take you through the details of that shortly. It also gives us the flexibility I believe to make sure that we make the proper economic decisions as we exit the balance of that portfolio.
We talked last year about our restructuring programs and focused on cost reduction and what that would need in terms of delivering additional margin as volume returned. And I think we have demonstrated that in the first quarter in our industrial segment.
Our systems business continues to have a steady outlook for growth and is executing very well. Bell Military is successfully executing the middle of a multi-year ramp on the military side of the program. And I think we put the right people and the right products in place to capitalize on growth in the commercial sector going forward.
Clearly the last 18 months have been difficult in the business-jet market, and has presented numerous challenges for our Cessna business. As I indicated earlier, we believe that this cycle is going to follow its normal course. We see the right early indicators, including most recently corporate profits getting stronger, and I would say the increased levels of enquiry and sales activity in the latter part of the first quarter bodes well for this industry to start to turn.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Frank to take you through the details on the financials.

Let's start with the major factors that drove the $0.21 year-over-year reduction in adjusted EPS, which are outlined on slide 7. The largest driver was lower manufacturing volume, which reduced EPS by $0.29. Last year's CESCOM sale at Cessna cost $0.12 per share.
The number of discrete tax items which occurred last year resulted in a $0.09 reduction in earnings. An inflation rate of 2.3% cost $0.11 per share, which outpaced pricing of 1%, which provided a $0.05 lift. A higher share count in interest expense cost $0.03 per share. And our pension headwind cost $0.02. On the positive side, overall cost performance and lower S&A benefited the quarter by $0.38 per share, and TSC's lower operating loss contributed $0.02 on a year-over-year basis.
Now, let's start with the results for each of our segments, starting with Cessna. For Cessna in the quarter, revenues decreased $336 million, reflecting lower aircraft volumes. Segment profit decreased $114 million due to the lower sales volume, the gain related to last years CESCOM sale, and higher inflation. These items were partially offset by improved cost performance, which included lower selling and administrative expenses, largely due to workforce reductions, lower inventory reserves, and lower used aircraft losses. Cessna backlog at the end of the quarter at $4.1 billion, a decline of $820 million from the end of last year.
Looking at Bell, revenues decreased $124 million due to lower sales volume. Segment profit, however, increased $5 million, as positive program performance, non-recurring product launch cost in 2009, and lower warranty selling and administrative cost more than offset the negative impact of reduced volumes. Bell backlog at the end of the first quarter was $6.9 billion, down slightly from the end of last year.
For Textron Systems, segment revenues and profits increased $40 million and $3 million respectively, primarily due to higher defense volumes. Backlog at Systems, ended the fourth quarter at $1.4 billion, down $220 million from the fourth quarter of last year.
For the Industrial segment, revenue increased $150 million, which was driven by a $140 million increase in our automotive businesses. Industrial profit increased $58 million due to higher volume and improved cost performance, partially offset by higher inflation net of pricing. Cost performance improved due to workforce reductions and other cost initiatives.
For the Finance segment, revenues decreased $46 million compared to the first quarter of 2009 largely due to the revenue impact of lower average finance receivables, a mark-to-market adjustment on our held-for-sale portfolio, and suspended earnings on non-accrual receivables. Finance segment losses improved $8 million, primarily reflecting lower loan loss provisions, reduced selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by the impact of the lower average finance receivables, the mark-to-market adjustment, and suspended earnings on non-accrual receivables.
Turning our attention to the 2010 outlook and looking at slide 8, we continue to expect EPS from continuing operations before special charges will be in the range of $0.30 to $0.50 per share, with free cash flow from continuing operations for the manufacturing group of between $500 million and $550 million.
As Scott mentioned, I'd like to conclude by reviewing progress we've made with our balance sheet. Looking at slide 9, you can see that we ended the quarter with net debt of $6.8 billion, down from $7.4 billion at the end of last year, and $11.9 billion at the end of 2008. And given our improved liquidity position, yesterday we paid down $250 million of Textron's bank line. Based on our current projections, we would expect to make additional payments on the Textron bank line over the balance of the year.
Now that concludes our prepared remarks for today. And Rich, we're ready to take questions.

In the other markets, particularly if you look at EZ-GO and Jacobsen, again, I think we have good signs of this stuff is moving through the retail channel. So it's not a restocking. In fact, in particular the European markets, which historically will do some restocking through the winter season, didn't really do that. So they held off on taking inventory. And as a result, we're really seeing deliveries that flow directly out through to the field.
So I don't think we've seen any signs that there is a whole lot of retail restocking going on. It really is going retail.

But as you look back on previous cycles, you never saw such a dramatic roll-off of backlog. And near as I can tell, it's really just driven by the fact that you came into this thing with such an incredibly unprecedentedly strong market in terms of demand for business jets. And then of course, the depth of the economic collapse on the other side was just as severe. So I think we've seen the results of this decline, the backlog are just an intersection of an unprecedented strong period, followed by an unprecedented weak period.
Obviously, most of us hope not to ever see that again. I mean, I think we'll have more modest growth on the upside, and you'd like this thing because we're never going to see the kind of economic collapse that we saw. And of course, you throw the politics on top of it, which also exaggerated I think the downside of it. So, you had a situation where, even people who still have the economic wherewithal to stay in the backlog, awful lot of people bailed out because they didn't even have a perception of being associated with business jets.
So, it's just been an awfully wild swing in both directions. Obviously, one of the things we're going to do, and hopefully we see this across the whole industry is, look for tougher deposit terms and higher levels of deposits with many of the customers. I don't want to mislead you, right? That's a commercial (term we) condition, and it's a competitive marketplace out there, but clearly from our perspective we would like to see higher levels of deposits to help make people be more attached to the aircraft. But even so, the severity of the cycles that we just went through, I'm not sure that would have even had a huge impact.

I would explain, Cessna production, obviously is a relatively long cycle production and you kind of set your rate and you move.

So, certainly our production rate and our delivery rate are not perfectly aligned. But I would not say that we are in a position where we feel like we're building a lot of aircraft that aren't going to have buyers. So, it's more of a work in progress, and yes, for sure you have some that are getting to that finished goods inventory level.
But that's really more of an artifact of aligning both what your delivery demand is and your production demand. You can't get those on a long cycle business to be perfectly aligned, especially when you're going to have a turn hopefully towards the upside here as deliveries increase over the course of the year.

So, we've seen some of that. We've seen a couple of small charter operators with Mustangs that in some cases already have some aircraft and are operating and successfully operating, but don't see enough demand in the economy. Yet, to them, to grow their fleet size, we tried a couple others where they're already in business, but they fly also small turboprops and they want to go to a jet, but don't feel like right now is the right time for them to make that transition.
So it's been some domestic, some international. It really is across the Board Steve in terms of both customer situation and aircraft configuration.

Before we begin, I'd like to mention that we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today.

On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's President and CEO; and Frank Connor, Textron's Chief Financial Officer. We are originating our call from London today, as Scott and Frank are here meeting with customers and industry participants in conjunction with the Farnborough Air Show.
Our customary earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Moving now to the second quarter results, which appear on slide three of the presentation, revenues in the quarter were $2.7 billion, up 3.7% from a year ago, which yielded GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.27. This compares to a $0.23 per share loss in last year's second quarter.
We incurred $0.02 per share on restructuring charges in the quarter. So our second quarter EPS from continuing operations before special charges was $0.29 per share compared to $0.08 a share a year ago. The manufacturing operations generated $170 million in free cash flow during the quarter.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.

We're pleased with the solid resumption of top-line growth in the quarter, reflecting expansion of our defense business and recovery in our early cycle markets.
While the pace of the recovery remains uncertain with the European sovereign debt concerns having negatively impacted business and consumer confidence during the quarter, we do believe the ability of our businesses to generate profits and cash in the cycle is apparent in our second quarter results.
So let's take a look at how that played out in our businesses, starting with Industrial where revenues were up about 30%. We continue to achieve good conversion on this revenue growth, as we posted a segment margin of 7.7%, which reflects the positive impact our cost reduction programs are having.
At the same time, we're also focused on new product development to drive growth. For example, during the quarter, we introduced EZ-GO's new low-speed road vehicle, the 2Five. 2Five is a zero-emission electric vehicle that meets regulatory standards for use on 35 miles an hour and under public roads.
We believe the EZ-GO brand will work well in this market and customer demand during the product's introduction launch has been positive. With the public attention on energy conservation, we believe this will be a good growth opportunity for us that leverages our current capabilities.
Moving to the Finance segment, we had another good quarter of liquidations. If you look at slide four in the presentation, you can see that we reduced managed receivables by $674 million, bringing our total reductions since the beginning of 2009 to $5.2 billion. Distribution finance was the largest share of reduction again with $203 million. Also, $120 million of liquidations were generated from our timeshare business, which is also a positive continued future success of our liquidation plan.
As we look at the rest of the year, we're increasing our total 2010 liquidation target from $1.8 billion to $2 billion, which will bring us to a two-year reduction of nearly $6 billion.
Looking at slide five, the cash conversion on finance asset liquidations came in at 87% for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date rate to 91%. We now expect our full year cash conversion rate will trend into the mid to high 80s.
In terms of credit performance, we saw a reduction in 60-day delinquencies from $515 million to $385 million and a reduction in non-accrual finance receivables from $1.03 billion to $876 million primarily due to the resolution of several accounts for restructuring and repositioning activities. Charge-offs were $57 million, up from $31 million in the first quarter as previously reserved losses were realized.
Moving to Cessna, results were in line with our expectations as we delivered 43 jets, 23 light to mid-sized and 20 Mustangs. As a result, Cessna returned to profitability and positive cash flow for the quarter. Business jet usage continued to expand. Our average daily utilization reached to 0.68 hours from about 0.66 hours in the first quarter. The FAA rolling three-month averages for takeoff and landings were up in both April and May. Our due date will probably be out shortly.
Correspondingly, Cessna aftermarket revenues were up nearly 20% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. On the used front, the number of previously owned Cessna's available-for-sale remained flat with last quarter at 15.1% and used pricing remained relatively stable with the exception of some further weakness in older models high-usage aircraft.
On the order front, as expected, we had a number of cancellations, which included the cancellation of a large Mustang order from a European fleet operator. On the other hand, gross orders increased from the first quarter. And most of these orders were for light to mid-sized aircraft, so we actually had a positive order contribution backlog on a dollar basis.
While we're encouraged by demand trends in April and May, June did see a slowdown in market activity following European debt concerns, which we believe weakened business confidence around the world.
As we discussed on our April call, we've already been experiencing softness in the Mustang orders. As a result, we've reduced our 2010 Mustang order outlook to about 70 units and adjusted our production plan accordingly.
With respect to the light to mid-sized market, we're still evaluating how the pace of the economic recovery might impact demand for these models. We're hopeful that Congress will pass the bonus depreciation bill. We believe the continued positive earnings reports, the stabilization of the European credit market will contribute to an improved environment for business jet orders.
We will be watching the market closely over the next several months. We will fine-tune our delivery expectations, production plans for light to mid based on how the market develops. In any event, we continue to believe that business jet demand will recover as long as the global economy continues to expand. I still believe that 2010 will be the trough year for Citation deliveries.
As we move to Textron systems, revenues were up nearly 12% reflecting strong domestic and international demand for our products. For example, on the international front, we completed delivery of the $57 million Sensor Fuzed Weapon shipment to the United Arab Emirates in June. Margins were also strong again, as we had good performance on our legacy US Armored Security Vehicle and unmanned aircraft system contracts.
Backlog was up in the quarter, driven by new US ASV orders and Shadow systems from Sweden. We expect the backlog will grow again in the third quarter based on anticipated domestic shadow orders as well as the recently announced deal to supply shadow systems to Italy.
We also recently completed two small bolt-on acquisitions of systems which add nicely to our product and technical capabilities. The most recent, Crane Wireless Monitoring Solution based in Texas will complement our intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance products to better meet our world needs of growing reliance on networked sensors as well as a host of future non-military security applications.
And last month, we added MillenWorks, which is an engineering company out of California that augments our advanced powertrain and suspension capabilities for combat and specialty vehicles.
Looking forward, we believe we are well-positioned despite likely DoD spending constraints to our products that are aligned with prevailing nature of asymmetrical threats and throughout the international demand as well.
Wrapping up with Bell, we had a good quarter both in terms of top-line growth and operational execution. On the military side, we delivered eight V-22s and three H-1s. The V-22 continues to perform well on theater, and we've begun discussions with the customer on next multi-year contract, which would cover production beginning in 2014.
On the H-1, we're on track with a production ramp to deliver 14 units during the second half of the year. We also signed a contract for 27 additional units which begin delivery late next year. And the DoD has recently completed its operational evaluation of the attack version of the H-1, and we expect the full rate production decision this fall. So the outlook for the H-1 program remains very positive at this point.
Moving to the commercial side of the business, we delivered 21 helicopters, up from 15 in the first quarter. On the marketing front, we had positive net orders in the quarter contributing to an increase in bulk backlog. We are also making good progress through our 429 program. Initial delivery unit was placed in a medevac service. It's performing superbly and receiving accolades from the operator.
Certification of specific configurations is moving forward, and we are continuing to book 429 orders into our backlog. We expect deliveries to resume this quarter with about 75 planned over through the balance of this year and through 2011.
So the overall outlook at Bell this year and beyond is very good, both our commercial and military businesses. As Doug mentioned earlier, we're in Farnborough where Bell and Systems both had terrific reception of their products. In particular, the U.S. Marine Corps has a UH-1 Yankee Heuy that's been in combat in Afghanistan. The crews that have been flying that aircraft are giving great feedback to prospective customers.
Systems has Shadow and Aerosonde systems on display, and we've had a lot of international interest I think which builds well on top of our recently announced wins in Sweden and Italy. Cessna, while this is not typically a business jet show, is also seeing significant interest in terms of air assets for little troop movement as well as ISR missions.
To summarize, we think second quarter results demonstrate the earnings power of the company, and we will continue to focus on cost productivity and new product development. The benefits of these efforts were evident in Industrial segment margin again this quarter. Our Systems business continues to execute very well, and we have a steady outlook for growth there, especially with international opportunities that are emerging.
Bell is successfully executing the multiyear ramp in military platforms, and we're seeing increased activity in the commercial sector which should lead to solid growth over the foreseeable future.
At Cessna, clearly the last two years have been difficult in the business jet market, and we continue to believe this cycle is going to follow its normal course. And at Finance, we're confident we can reach our new liquidation target of $2 billion. And the cash which we've been generating has allowed us to make substantial improvements in our capital structure.
With that, I'll turn it over to Frank to provide financial details in full.

To pick up on Scott's comments on capital structure, as you can see on slide seven, in the quarter we reduced our net debt to $6.1 billion from $6.8 billion at the end of the first quarter and $7.4 billion at end",921,"Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. To pick up on Scott's comments on capital structure, as you can see on slide seven, in the quarter we reduced our net debt to $6.1 billion from $6.8 billion at the end of the first quarter and $7.4 billion at end of last year. We are now targeting to reduce our net debt to below $5.5 billion by the end of this year.
We also made a second $250 million repayment on the Textron bank line, bringing the total repayment to $500 million for the quarter.
You can now turn to slide eight, as we examine the major factors that drove $0.21 per share year-over-year increase in EPS before special items. Inflation came in as a 2% rate, which reduced earnings by $0.12 per share in the quarter, while positive pricing of 1.3% provided a $0.09 benefit. A higher share count, taxes and other miscellaneous items cost $0.07 per share. The combined impact of volume, mix and M&A cost $0.04 per share. Increased pension expense was $0.04. TFC's reduced losses benefited the quarter by $0.07. And our restructuring and execution focus netted a cost performance benefit of $0.32 per share.
Now let's look at the results for each of the segments, starting with Cessna. Cessna revenues decreased $236 million, reflecting delivery of 43 jets compared with 84 jets in the corresponding period last year. These decreases were partially offset by higher aftermarket and used aircraft volumes.
Segment profit decreased $45 million due to the lower volume and a reduction in deposit forfeiture income, partially offset by lower used aircraft write-downs, inventory reserves and selling and administrative expenses. Cessna backlog at the end of the second quarter was $3.7 billion, down $400 million from the end of the first quarter.
Bell revenues increased $153 million in the second quarter, reflecting higher V-22 and H-1 deliveries and higher spares and support volume, partially offset by lower commercial aircraft volume. Segment profit increased $36 million due to improved performance, higher military volume and commercial aircraft pricing in excess of inflation.
The improved performance reflects a $21 million operating profit contribution for the recognition of reimbursements for prior-period H-1 and V-22 program costs, plus the non-recurrence of 2009 termination cost related to certain cancelled commercial models. Bell backlog increased $200 million from the end of first quarter to $7.1 billion.
Moving to Textron Systems, revenues increased $57 million primarily due to higher UAS volume. Segment profit increased $15 million due to the impact of higher volume and improved performance. Systems backlog at the end of the second quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of $200 million from the end of the first quarter.
At Industrial, revenues increased $153 million due to higher volumes, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Segment profit increased $39 million due to higher volumes and improved cost performance partially offset by inflation. Looking to the rest of the year for Industrial, we expect growth to slow somewhat, reflecting normal summer and year-end holiday shutdowns in the automotive industry.
Moving to Finance, revenues decreased $30 million largely due to the non-recurrence of last year's gains on debt extinguishment and lower average finance receivables, partially offset by reduced portfolio losses. Finance segment loss improved $28 million, reflecting lower loan loss provisions, portfolio losses and selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by the non-recurrence of gains on debt extinguishment and the impact of lower average finance receivables.
Now moving to a few corporate items, corporate expenses were less than expected in the quarter, primarily on the compensation expense line resulting from a lower prevailing stock price. Our tax rate in the quarter was also lower, primarily related to a number of discrete items associated with our international operations which benefited the quarter by about $0.03. For the rest of the year, we anticipate that our tax rate will return to about 30%.
Now let's talk about special charges for the year looking at slide nine. First, we're increasing our restructuring cost estimate from $30 million to $45 million or about $0.10 on an after-tax per chare basis. Most of this increase is for additional restructuring at Cessna.
And a second change results from the continuing wind-down of our TFC Canadian operations where we anticipate taking a non-cash after-tax charge of about $78 million or about $0.26 per share. Now, this charge eliminates the balance of a cumulative currency translation account and will be triggered when the Canadian operations is considered to be substantially liquidated, which we expect to occur during the second half of the year.
It's important to note that the equity in TFC and Textron has already been reduced by this amount to previous other comprehensive income adjustments. So there is no further equity impact from this charge.
So let's now turn our attention to our 2010 outlook, and we're now looking at slide 10. As demonstrated in our second quarter results, we are more than making up for the weaker current performance of Cessna with stronger performance from the rest of our businesses.
On a net basis, we are increasing our 2010 outlook for EPS from continuing operations before special charges to $0.55 to $0.65 a share. We are maintaining our free cash flow from manufacturing operations outlook to $500 million to $550 million, although the probability is that we will likely trend towards the lower end of that range, given the lower expected delivery outlook at Cessna.
That concludes our prepared remarks for today. Operator, we're now ready to take questions.

We did have a little concern here in the latter part of the quarter as things kind of got rather around a little bit with the (inaudible) thing going on and what not. We saw some people sort of turn the back off. I don't think there are customers that are leaving necessarily, but people are taking a bit of a pause, if you will, to understand what's going on with the recovery.
Obviously, we don't know if that's a 30-day issue or a quarter or two. So that's one where we're just going to watch it. And obviously, if we see any kind of significant changes to our plan, we'll adjust production accordingly and obviously we'll have a lot better insight advice on future calls.

Historically, you usually see some softening just because of the volume is usually softer in the second half of year than the first half of the year in the automotive industry. Obviously, with Kautex being a big part of that, we would expect to see probably a modest decline through the course of the year, again driven primarily just by auto doing its normal cycle.
I think that Bell and Systems are going to continue to perform strongly through the balance of the year. I don't think you're going to see 13% margin rates obviously. The REA helped in the quarter for Bell, and we had some pretty strong deliveries here on some international programs like the SFW in the UAE in the second quarter. But I would expect those businesses will still be strong performers through the whole balance of the year and going forward.
Cessna, despite someone certainly around the order front, it's certainly our expectation that we will see incremental improvements as we go through each quarter in terms of our margin rates. So I think that's a reasonable expectation.
And Finance, there is no change to our previous guidance. I think we'll end up seeing a loss consistent with what we've guided you through the total year.

Right now we think at least in this market environment that the mustang really probably is 70 to 75 units per year kind of a run rate. So that's what we would expect to see, you know orders and what not. That supports that, and you get in the light to mid-size. And we'll see how that plays out through the balance of the year.

The 300 letter of intent that was out there was unfortunate when this 429 kind of came to the market in a pretty tough spot in terms of the commercial helicopter market. So the conversion rate on that 300 into the current backlog has been very low.
On the other hand, I would say over the last quarter or so we have been moving 429s into backlog as configurations have been identified. I would say that I feel probably better about the level of customer activity and the number discussions that are going on and the number of orders that we're starting to create in the 429 that I did from the beginning of the year.
So I think we are really starting to feel some pretty strong momentum. And that's really a function of getting these aircraft out there, a lot of demo rides, getting it into service, people starting to get some feedback on how it's performing with the actual aircraft.
So I feel probably better about the 429 right now than I have over the past year. So I think we're going to wait through that cycle, but also having aircraft out there and really being able to go out and start marketing and selling hard, it's doing very well.
E75, through the balance of 2011, I still feel very good about. We are, I would say, moving and not getting there as quick I'd like this year in terms of getting specific interiors defined and the associated certifications that have to happen with those. So it's always been backend loaded; it's still very backend loaded in terms of 429 shipments.
Most of that frankly though, is on us to get the configurations defined and get the certifications completed. So right now, I'm hopeful. We're sitting close to the 25 this year. But then if we don't, obviously I think we go out in the early part of 2011.
So I'd say the bottom-line in terms of the 429, it was unfortunate that the thing finally, actually came into production and launched at a pretty difficult time in the cycle. But the demand as we see it right now is strong and increasing, and I feel good about getting up to the production rate, the delivery rate we can talk about.

Before we begin, I'd like to mention that we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.
On the call today we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's President and CEO; and Frank Connor, Textron's Chief Financial Officer. We're originating our call from London today, as Scott and Frank are here meeting with customers and industry participants in conjunction with the Farnborough Airshow. Our customary earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Moving now to second quarter results, which appear on Slide 3 of the presentation. Revenues in the quarter were $2.7 billion, up 3.7% from a year ago, which yielded GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.27. This compares to a $0.23 per share loss in last year's second quarter. We incurred $0.02 per share in restructuring charges in the quarter, so second quarter EPS from continuing operations before special charges was $0.29 per share, compared to $0.08 a share a year ago.  The manufacturing operations generated $170 million in free cash flow during the quarter. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."

While the pace of the recovery remains uncertain with th",1604,"Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased we saw a resumption of top-line growth in the quarter, reflecting expansion of our defense businesses and recovery in our early cycle markets. While the pace of the recovery remains uncertain with the European sovereign debt concerns having negatively impacted business and consumer confidence during the quarter, we do believe the ability of our businesses to generate profits and cash in the cycle is apparent in our second quarter results. 
So let's take a look at how that played out in our businesses, starting with Industrial, where revenues were up about 30%. We continue to achieve good conversion on this revenue growth, as we posted a segment margin of 7.7%. This reflects the positive impact that our cost-reduction programs are having. At the same time, we're also focused on new product development to drive growth. For example, during the quarter, we introduced E-Z-GO’s new low-speed road vehicle, the 2Five. 2Five is a zero-emission electric vehicle that meets regulatory standards for use on 35-mile-an-hour-and-under public roads. We believe the E-Z-GO brand will work well in this market, and customer demand during the product’s introduction launch has been positive. With the public’s attention on energy conservation, we believe this will be a good growth opportunity for us that leverages our current capabilities.
Moving to the Finance segment, we had another good quarter of liquidations. If you look at Slide 4 in the presentation, you can see that we’ve reduced managed receivables by $674 million, bringing our total reduction since the beginning of 2009 to $5.2 billion. Distribution of Finance was the largest area of reduction again at $203 million. Also, $120 million in liquidations were generated from our Timeshare business, which is also a positive continued future success of our liquidation plan.  As we look at the rest of the year, we're increasing our total 2010 liquidation target from $1.8 billion to $2 billion, which will bring us to a two-year reduction of nearly $6 billion. 
Looking at Slide 5, the cash conversion on Finance asset liquidations came in at 87% for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date rate to 91%. We now expect our full year cash conversion rate will trend into the mid- to high-80s.
In terms of credit performance, we saw a reduction in 60-day delinquencies from $515 million to $385 million and a reduction in non-accrual Finance receivables from $1.03 billion to $876 million, primarily through the resolution of several accounts through restructuring and repossession activities. Charge-offs were $57 million, up from $31 million in the first quarter, as previously reserved losses were realized.
Moving to Cessna. Results were in line with our expectations as we delivered 43 jets, 23 were light- to mid-size and 20 Mustangs. As a result, Cessna returned to profitability and positive cash flow for the quarter. Business jet usage continued to expand. Average daily utilization reached 0.68 hours from about 0.66 hours in the first quarter. The FAA rolling three-month averages for takeoff and landings were up in both April and May. June data will probably be out shortly. Correspondingly, Cessna aftermarket revenues were up nearly 20% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. On the used front, the number of previously owned Cessnas available for sale remain flat with last quarter of 15.1%, and used pricing remained relatively stable, with the exception of some further weakness in older models and high-usage aircraft. 
On the order front, as expected, we had a number of cancellations, which included the cancellation of a large Mustang order from a European fleet operator. On the other hand, gross orders increased from the first quarter, and most of these orders were for light- to mid-size aircraft, so we actually had a positive order contribution to backlog on a dollar basis. While we were encouraged by demand trends in April and May, June did see a slowdown in market activity following European debt concerns, which we believe weakened business confidence around the globe. 
As we discussed on our April call, we've already been experiencing softness in the Mustang orders. As a result, we’ve reduced our 2010 Mustang delivery outlook to about 70 units and adjusted our production plan accordingly. With respect to the light- to mid-size market, we're still evaluating how the pace of economic recovery might impact demand for these models. We’re hopeful that Congress will pass a bonus depreciation bill and believe that continued positive earnings reports and stabilization of the European credit market will contribute to an improved environment for business jet orders. We will be watching the market closely over the next several months, and we'll fine-tune our delivery expectations and production plans for light to mids based on how that market develops. In any event, we continue to believe that the business jet demand will recover as long as the global economy continues to expand and still believe that 2010 will be the trough year for Citation deliveries. 
As we move to Textron Systems, revenues were up nearly 12%, reflecting strong domestic and international demand for our products. For example, in the international front, we completed delivery of a $57 million Sensor Fuzed Weapon shipment to the United Arab Emirates in June. Margins were also strong again as we had good performance on our legacy U.S. armored security vehicle and Unmanned Aircraft System contracts. 
Backlog was up in the quarter, driven by new U.S. ASV orders and an order for Shadow Systems from Sweden. We expect that backlog will grow again in third quarter, based on anticipated domestic Shadow orders, as well as the recently announced deal to supply Shadow Systems to Italy. 
We also recently completed two small bolt-on acquisitions at Systems, which add nicely to our product and technical capabilities. The most recent, Crane Wireless Monitoring Solution, based in Texas, will complement our Intelligence Surveillance & Reconnaissance products to better get our world play [ph] (0:22:40) to grow on reliance on network sensors, as well as a host of future nonmilitary security applications. And last month, we added MillenWorks, which is an engineering company out of California that augments our advanced powertrain suspensions capabilities for combat and specialty vehicles. 
Looking forward, we believe we are well positioned, despite likely DoD spending constraints, as our products are aligned with the prevailing nature of asymmetrical threats and developing international demand as well.
Wrapping up with Bell, we had a good quarter both in terms of top-line growth and operational execution. On the military side, we delivered eight V-22s and three H-1s. The V-22 continues to perform well in theater, and we’ve begun discussions with the customer on the next multi-year contract, which would cover production beginning in 2014. On the H-1, we’re on track with production ramp to deliver 14 units during the second half of the year. We also signed a contract for 27 additional units, which begin delivery late next year. And the DoD has recently completed its operational evaluation of the attack version of the H-1, and we expect a full-rate production decision this fall. So the outlook for the H-1 program remains very positive at this point. 
Moving to the commercial side of the business, we delivered 21 helicopters, up from 15 in the first quarter. On the marketing front, we had a positive net orders in the quarter, contributing to an increase in Bell backlog. We're also making good progress with our 429 program. The initial delivery unit that was placed into medevac service is performing superbly and receiving accolades from the operator. Certification of specific configurations is moving forward, and we're continuing to book 429 orders into our backlog. We expect deliveries will resume this quarter with about 75 planned over the next year, through the balance of this year and through 2011. 
So the overall outlook at Bell this year and beyond is very good, both our Commercial and Military businesses. As Doug mentioned earlier, we’re in Farnborough, where Bell and Systems both had terrific reception of their products. In particular, the U.S. Marine Corps has a USH, or a 1 Yankee here that’s been in combat with Afghanistan. The crews that have been flying that aircraft are giving great feedback to prospective customers. Systems has Shadow and Aerosonde systems on display, and we’ve had a lot of international interest, I think, which builds well on top of our recently announced wins in Sweden and Italy. Cessna, while this is not a typically a business jet, show -- is also seeing significant interest in terms of air assets for both [ph] (0:24:59) troop movement, as well as ISR missions. 
To summarize, we think second quarter results demonstrate the earnings power of the company. And we will continue to focus on cost productivity and new product development. The benefit of these efforts were evident in the Industrial segment margins again this quarter. Our Systems business continues to exceed very well, and we have a steady outlook for growth there, especially with international opportunities that are emerging. Bell is successfully executing the middle of a multi-year ramp in military platforms. And we're seeing increased activity in the commercial sector, which should lead to solid growth over the foreseeable future. 
At Cessna, clearly the last two years have been difficult, business jet market. But we continue to believe that the cycle is going to follow its normal course. And in Finance, we’re confident that we can reach our new liquidation target of $2 billion. And the cash which we've been generating has allowed us to make substantial improvements in our capital structure. With that, I'll turn it over to Frank to provide financial detail for the quarter."
35303,107905881,68200,"Textron Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-21-2010",2010-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Textron Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. To pick up on Scott's comments on capital structure, as you can see on Slide 7, in the quarter, we reduced our net debt to $6.1 billion from $6.8 billion at the end of the first quarter and $7.4 billion at the en",924,"Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. To pick up on Scott's comments on capital structure, as you can see on Slide 7, in the quarter, we reduced our net debt to $6.1 billion from $6.8 billion at the end of the first quarter and $7.4 billion at the end of last year. We are now targeting to reduce our net debt to below $5.5 billion by the end of this year. We also made a second $250 million repayment on the Textron bank line, bringing the total repayment to $500 million for the quarter. 
You can now turn to Slide 8, as we examine the major factors that drove $0.21 per share year-over-year increase in EPS before special items. Inflation came in at a 2% rate, which reduced earnings by $0.12 per share in the quarter, while positive pricing of 1.3% provided a $0.09 benefit. A higher share count, taxes and other miscellaneous items cost $0.07 per share. The combined impact of volume, mix and M&A cost $0.04 per share. Increased pension expense was $0.04. TFC’s reduced losses benefited the quarter by $0.07. And our restructuring and execution focus netted a cost performance benefit of $0.32 per share. 
Now let's look at the results for each of the segments, starting with Cessna. Cessna revenues decreased $236 million, reflecting the delivery of 43 jets compared with 84 jets in the corresponding period last year. These decreases were partially offset by higher aftermarket and used aircraft volumes. Segment profit decreased $45 million due to the lower volume and a reduction in deposit forfeiture income, partially offset by lower used aircraft write-downs, inventory reserves and selling and administrative expenses. Cessna backlog at the end of the second quarter was $3.7 billion, down $400 million from the end of the first quarter.
Bell revenues increased $153 million in the second quarter, reflecting higher V-22 and H-1 deliveries and higher spares and support volume, partially offset by lower commercial aircraft volume. Segment profit increased $36 million due to improved performance, higher military volume and commercial aircraft pricing in excess of inflation. The improved performance reflects a $21 million operating profit contribution for the recognition of reimbursements for prior period H-1 and V-22 program costs, plus the nonrecurrence of 2009 termination costs related to certain canceled commercial models. Bell backlog increased $200 million from the end of the first quarter to $7.1 billion.
Moving to Textron Systems, revenues increased $57 million, primarily due to higher UAS volume. Segment profit increased $15 million due to the impact of higher volume and improved performance. Systems backlog at the end of the second quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of $200 million from the end of the first quarter.
At Industrial, revenues increased $153 million due to higher volumes, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Segment profit increased $39 million due to higher volumes and improved cost performance, partially offset by inflation. Looking to the rest of the year for Industrial, we expect growth to slow somewhat, reflecting normal summer and year-end holiday shutdowns in the automotive industry.
Moving to Finance, revenues decreased $30 million, largely due to the nonrecurrence of last year's gains on debt extinguishment and lower average finance receivables, partially offset by reduced portfolio losses. Finance segment loss improved $28 million, reflecting lower loan loss provisions, portfolio losses and selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by the nonrecurrence of gains on debt extinguishment and the impact of lower average Finance receivables.
Now moving to a few corporate items. Corporate expenses were less than expected in the quarter, primarily on the compensation expense line, resulting from a lower prevailing stock price. Our tax rate in the quarter was also lower, primarily related to a number of discrete items associated with our International operations, which benefited the quarter by about $0.03. For the rest of the year, we anticipate that our tax rate will return to about 30%.
Now let's talk about special charges for the year, looking at Slide 9. First, we're increasing our restructuring cost estimate from $30 million to $45 million, or about $0.10 on an after-tax per share basis. Most of this increase is for additional restructuring at Cessna. And the second change results from the continuing wind-down of our TFC Canadian operations, where we anticipate taking a non-cash after-tax charge of about $78 million or about $0.26 per share. Now this charge eliminates the balance of a cumulative currency translation account and will be triggered when the Canadian operations is considered to be substantially liquidated, which we expect to occur during the second half of the year. It’s important to note that the equity in TFC and Textron has already been reduced by this amount through previous other comprehensive income adjustments. So there is no further equity impact from this charge.
So let's now turn our attention to our 2010 outlook, and we're now looking at Slide 10. As demonstrated in our second quarter results, we are more than making up for the weaker current performance at Cessna, with stronger performance from the rest of our businesses. On that basis, we are increasing our 2010 outlook for EPS from continuing operations before special charges to $0.55 to $0.65 a share. We are maintaining our free cash flow for manufacturing operations outlook of $500 million to $550 million, although the probability is that we will likely trend towards the lower end of that range, given the lower expected delivery outlook at Cessna. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for today. Operator, we're now ready to take questions."

Historically, you usually see some softening just because of the volume, is usually softer in the second half of the year than the first half of the year in the automotive industry. And obviously with Kautex being a big part of that, we would expect to see probably a modest decline through the course of the year, again driven primarily just by Auto just doing its normal cycle. I think that Bell and Systems are going to continue to perform strong through the balance of the year. I don't think you're going to see 13% margin rates, obviously. The REA helped in the quarter for Bell, and we had some pretty strong deliveries here on some international programs like the SFW in the UAE in the second quarter. But I would expect those businesses will still be strong performers through the whole balance of the year and going forward. Cessna, despite some uncertainty around the order front, it’s certainly our expectation that we will see incrementally, incremental improvements as we go through each quarter in terms of our margin rates. So I think that's a reasonable expectation. And Finance, there's no change to our previous guidance. I think we'll end up seeing the losses that are consistent with what we've guided you through the total year."

The 300 letter of intent that was out there is -- it was unfortunate when this 429 kind of came to the market in a pretty tough spot in terms of the commercial helicopter market. So the conversion rate on that 300 into the current backlog has been very low. On the other hand, I would say over the last quarter or so, we have been moving 429s into backlog as configurations have been identified. I would say that I feel probably better about the level of customer activity and the number of discussions that are going on and the number of orders that we’re starting to create in the 429 than I did from the beginning of the year. So I think we're really starting to feel some pretty strong momentum, and that's really a function of getting these aircraft out there, a lot of demo rides, getting it into service, people starting to give some feedback on how it's performing with the actual aircraft. So I feel probably better about the 429 right now than I have over the past year. So I think we're kind of working our way through that cycle, but also having aircraft out there and really being able to go out and start marketing and selling hard, it’s doing very well. The 75 over the next -- through the balance of 2011, I still feel very good about. We are, I would say, moving, not getting there as quick as I'd like this year in terms of getting specific interiors defined and the associated certifications that have to happen with those. So it's always been back-end loaded. It’s still very back-end-loaded in terms of 429 shipments. Most of that, frankly, though, is on us to get the configurations defined and get the certifications completed. So right now, I'm hopeful we're still going to get close to the 25 this year, but even if we [ph] (0:40:22) don’t, obviously, I think it would go out in the early part of 2011. So I'd say the bottom line in terms of the 429, yes, it was unfortunate that the thing finally actually came into production and launched at a pretty difficult time in the cycle. But the demand as we see it right now is strong and increasing, and I feel good about getting up to the production rate, the delivery rate, that we've been talking about."

On the call today we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's President and CEO; and Frank Connor, Textron's Chief Financial Officer. We're originating our call from London today, as Scott and Frank are here meeting with customers and industry participants in conjunction with the Farnborough Airshow. Our customary earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Moving now to second quarter results, which appear on Slide 3 of the presentation. Revenues in the quarter were $2.7 billion, up 3.7% from a year ago, which yielded GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.27. This compares to a $0.23 per share loss in last year's second quarter. We incurred $0.02 per share in restructuring charges in the quarter, so second quarter EPS from continuing operations before special charges was $0.29 per share, compared to $0.08 a share a year ago.  The manufacturing operations generated $170 million in free cash flow during the quarter. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."

We're pleased we saw a resumption of top-line growth in the quarter, reflecting expansion of our defense businesses and recovery in our early cycle markets. While the pace of the recovery remains uncertain with th",1601,"Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased we saw a resumption of top-line growth in the quarter, reflecting expansion of our defense businesses and recovery in our early cycle markets. While the pace of the recovery remains uncertain with the European sovereign debt concerns having negatively impacted business and consumer confidence during the quarter, we do believe the ability of our businesses to generate profits and cash in the cycle is apparent in our second quarter results. 
So let's take a look at how that played out in our businesses, starting with Industrial, where revenues were up about 30%. We continue to achieve good conversion on this revenue growth, as we posted a segment margin of 7.7%. This reflects the positive impact that our cost-reduction programs are having. At the same time, we're also focused on new product development to drive growth. For example, during the quarter, we introduced E-Z-GO’s new low-speed road vehicle, the 2Five. 2Five is a zero-emission electric vehicle that meets regulatory standards for use on 35-mile-an-hour-and-under public roads. We believe the E-Z-GO brand will work well in this market, and customer demand during the product’s introduction launch has been positive. With the public’s attention on energy conservation, we believe this will be a good growth opportunity for us that leverages our current capabilities.
Moving to the Finance segment, we had another good quarter of liquidations. If you look at Slide 4 in the presentation, you can see that we’ve reduced managed receivables by $674 million, bringing our total reduction since the beginning of 2009 to $5.2 billion. Distribution of Finance was the largest area of reduction again at $203 million. Also, $120 million in liquidations were generated from our Timeshare business, which is also a positive continued future success of our liquidation plan.  As we look at the rest of the year, we're increasing our total 2010 liquidation target from $1.8 billion to $2 billion, which will bring us to a two-year reduction of nearly $6 billion. 
Looking at Slide 5, the cash conversion on Finance asset liquidations came in at 87% for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date rate to 91%. We now expect our full year cash conversion rate will trend into the mid- to high-80s.
In terms of credit performance, we saw a reduction in 60-day delinquencies from $515 million to $385 million and a reduction in non-accrual Finance receivables from $1.03 billion to $876 million, primarily through the resolution of several accounts through restructuring and repossession activities. Charge-offs were $57 million, up from $31 million in the first quarter, as previously reserved losses were realized.
Moving to Cessna. Results were in line with our expectations as we delivered 43 jets, 23 were light- to mid-size and 20 Mustangs. As a result, Cessna returned to profitability and positive cash flow for the quarter. Business jet usage continued to expand. Average daily utilization reached 0.68 hours from about 0.66 hours in the first quarter. The FAA rolling three-month averages for takeoff and landings were up in both April and May. June data will probably be out shortly. Correspondingly, Cessna aftermarket revenues were up nearly 20% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. On the used front, the number of previously owned Cessnas available for sale remain flat with last quarter of 15.1%, and used pricing remained relatively stable, with the exception of some further weakness in older models and high-usage aircraft. 
On the order front, as expected, we had a number of cancellations, which included the cancellation of a large Mustang order from a European fleet operator. On the other hand, gross orders increased from the first quarter, and most of these orders were for light- to mid-size aircraft, so we actually had a positive order contribution to backlog on a dollar basis. While we were encouraged by demand trends in April and May, June did see a slowdown in market activity following European debt concerns, which we believe weakened business confidence around the globe. 
As we discussed on our April call, we've already been experiencing softness in the Mustang orders. As a result, we’ve reduced our 2010 Mustang delivery outlook to about 70 units and adjusted our production plan accordingly. With respect to the light- to mid-size market, we're still evaluating how the pace of economic recovery might impact demand for these models. We’re hopeful that Congress will pass a bonus depreciation bill and believe that continued positive earnings reports and stabilization of the European credit market will contribute to an improved environment for business jet orders. We will be watching the market closely over the next several months, and we'll fine-tune our delivery expectations and production plans for light to mids based on how that market develops. In any event, we continue to believe that the business jet demand will recover as long as the global economy continues to expand and still believe that 2010 will be the trough year for Citation deliveries. 
As we move to Textron Systems, revenues were up nearly 12%, reflecting strong domestic and international demand for our products. For example, in the international front, we completed delivery of a $57 million Sensor Fuzed Weapon shipment to the United Arab Emirates in June. Margins were also strong again as we had good performance on our legacy U.S. armored security vehicle and Unmanned Aircraft System contracts. 
Backlog was up in the quarter, driven by new U.S. ASV orders and an order for Shadow Systems from Sweden. We expect that backlog will grow again in third quarter, based on anticipated domestic Shadow orders, as well as the recently announced deal to supply Shadow Systems to Italy. 
We also recently completed two small bolt-on acquisitions at Systems, which add nicely to our product and technical capabilities. The most recent, Crane Wireless Monitoring Solution, based in Texas, will complement our Intelligence Surveillance & Reconnaissance products to better get our world play [ph] to grow on reliance on network sensors, as well as a host of future nonmilitary security applications. And last month, we added MillenWorks, which is an engineering company out of California that augments our advanced powertrain suspensions capabilities for combat and specialty vehicles. 
Looking forward, we believe we are well positioned, despite likely DoD spending constraints, as our products are aligned with the prevailing nature of asymmetrical threats and developing international demand as well.
Wrapping up with Bell, we had a good quarter both in terms of top-line growth and operational execution. On the military side, we delivered eight V-22s and three H-1s. The V-22 continues to perform well in theater, and we’ve begun discussions with the customer on the next multi-year contract, which would cover production beginning in 2014. On the H-1, we’re on track with production ramp to deliver 14 units during the second half of the year. We also signed a contract for 27 additional units, which begin delivery late next year. And the DoD has recently completed its operation evaluation of the attack version of the H-1, and we expect a full-rate production decision this fall. So the outlook for the H-1 program remains very positive at this point. 
Moving to the commercial side of the business, we delivered 21 helicopters, up from 15 in the first quarter. On the marketing front, we had a positive net orders in the quarter, contributing to an increase in Bell backlog. We're also making good progress with our 429 program. The initial delivery unit that was placed into medevac service is performing superbly and receiving accolades from the operator. Certification of specific configurations is moving forward, and we're continuing to book 429 orders into our backlog. We expect deliveries will resume this quarter with about 75 planned over the next year, through the balance of this year and through 2011. 
So the overall outlook at Bell this year and beyond is very good, both our Commercial and Military businesses. As Doug mentioned earlier, we’re in Farnborough, where Bell and Systems both had terrific reception of their products. In particular, the U.S. Marine Corps has a USH, or a 1 Yankee here that’s been in combat with Afghanistan. The crews that have been flying that aircraft are giving great feedback to prospective customers. Systems has Shadow and Aerosonde systems on display, and we’ve had a lot of international interest, I think, which builds well on top of our recently announced wins in Sweden and Italy. Cessna, while this is not a typically a business jet show -- is also seeing significant interest in terms of air assets for both troop movement, as well as ISR missions. 
To summarize, we think second quarter results demonstrate the earnings power of the company. And we will continue to focus on cost productivity and new product development. The benefit of these efforts were evident in the Industrial segment margins again this quarter. Our Systems business continues to execute very well, and we have a steady outlook for growth there, especially with international opportunities that are emerging. Bell is successfully executing the middle of a multi-year ramp in military platforms. And we're seeing increased activity in the commercial sector, which should lead to solid growth over the foreseeable future. 
At Cessna, clearly the last two years have been difficult, business jet market. But we continue to believe that the cycle is going to follow its normal course. And in Finance, we’re confident that we can reach our new liquidation target of $2 billion. And the cash which we've been generating has allowed us to make substantial improvements in our capital structure. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Frank to provide financial detail for the quarter."
35303,107905881,68235,"Textron Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-21-2010",2010-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Textron Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. To pick up on Scott's comments on capital structure, as you can see on Slide 7, in the quarter, we reduced our net debt to $6.1 billion from $6.8 billion at the end of the first quarter and $7.4 billion at the en",924,"Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. To pick up on Scott's comments on capital structure, as you can see on Slide 7, in the quarter, we reduced our net debt to $6.1 billion from $6.8 billion at the end of the first quarter and $7.4 billion at the end of last year. We are now targeting to reduce our net debt to below $5.5 billion by the end of this year. We also made a second $250 million repayment on the Textron bank line, bringing the total repayment to $500 million for the quarter. 
You can now turn to Slide 8, as we examine the major factors that drove $0.21 per share year-over-year increase in EPS before special items. Inflation came in at a 2% rate, which reduced earnings by $0.12 per share in the quarter, while positive pricing of 1.3% provided a $0.09 benefit. A higher share count, taxes and other miscellaneous items cost $0.07 per share. The combined impact of volume, mix and M&A cost $0.04 per share. Increased pension expense was $0.04. TFC’s reduced losses benefited the quarter by $0.07. And our restructuring and execution focus netted a cost performance benefit of $0.32 per share. 
Now let's look at the results for each of the segments, starting with Cessna. Cessna revenues decreased $236 million, reflecting the delivery of 43 jets compared with 84 jets in the corresponding period last year. These decreases were partially offset by higher aftermarket and used aircraft volumes. Segment profit decreased $45 million due to the lower volume and a reduction in deposit forfeiture income, partially offset by lower used aircraft write-downs, inventory reserves and selling and administrative expenses. Cessna backlog at the end of the second quarter was $3.7 billion, down $400 million from the end of the first quarter.
Bell revenues increased $153 million in the second quarter, reflecting higher V-22 and H-1 deliveries and higher spares and support volume, partially offset by lower commercial aircraft volume. Segment profit increased $36 million due to improved performance, higher military volume and commercial aircraft pricing in excess of inflation. The improved performance reflects a $21 million operating profit contribution for the recognition of reimbursements for prior period H-1 and V-22 program costs, plus the non-recurrence of 2009 termination costs related to certain canceled commercial models. Bell backlog increased $200 million from the end of the first quarter to $7.1 billion.
Moving to Textron Systems, revenues increased $57 million, primarily due to higher UAS volume. Segment profit increased $15 million due to the impact of higher volume and improved performance. Systems backlog at the end of the second quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of $200 million from the end of the first quarter.
At Industrial, revenues increased $153 million due to higher volumes, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Segment profit increased $39 million due to higher volumes and improved cost performance, partially offset by inflation. Looking to the rest of the year for Industrial, we expect growth to slow somewhat, reflecting normal summer and year-end holiday shutdowns in the automotive industry.
Moving to Finance. Revenues decreased $30 million, largely due to the non-recurrence of last year's gains on debt extinguishment and lower average finance receivables, partially offset by reduced portfolio losses. Finance segment loss improved $28 million, reflecting lower loan loss provisions, portfolio losses and selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by the non-recurrence of gains on debt extinguishment and the impact of lower average Finance receivables.
Now moving to a few corporate items. Corporate expenses were less than expected in the quarter, primarily on the compensation expense line, resulting from a lower prevailing stock price. Our tax rate in the quarter was also lower, primarily related to a number of discrete items associated with our International operations, which benefited the quarter by about $0.03. For the rest of the year, we anticipate that our tax rate will return to about 30%.
Now let's talk about special charges for the year, looking at Slide 9. First, we're increasing our restructuring cost estimate from $30 million to $45 million, or about $0.10 on an after-tax per share basis. Most of this increase is for additional restructuring at Cessna. And the second change results from the continuing wind-down of our TFC Canadian operations, where we anticipate taking a non-cash after-tax charge of about $78 million or about $0.26 per share. Now this charge eliminates the balance of a cumulative currency translation account and will be triggered when the Canadian operations is considered to be substantially liquidated, which we expect to occur during the second half of the year. It’s important to note that the equity in TFC and Textron has already been reduced by this amount through previous other comprehensive income adjustments. So there is no further equity impact from this charge.
So let's now turn our attention to our 2010 outlook, and we're now looking at Slide 10. As demonstrated in our second quarter results, we are more than making up for the weaker current performance at Cessna, with stronger performance from the rest of our businesses. On that basis, we are increasing our 2010 outlook for EPS from continuing operations before special charges to $0.55 to $0.65 a share. We are maintaining our free cash flow for manufacturing operations outlook of $500 million to $550 million, although the probability is that we will likely trend towards the lower end of that range, given the lower expected delivery outlook at Cessna. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for today. Operator, we're now ready to take questions."

Historically, you usually see some softening just because of the volume, is usually softer in the second half of the year than the first half of the year in the automotive industry. And obviously with Kautex being a big part of that, we would expect to see probably a modest decline through the course of the year, again driven primarily just by Auto just doing its normal cycle. I think that Bell and Systems are going to continue to perform strong through the balance of the year. I don't think you're going to see 13% margin rates, obviously. The REA helped in the quarter for Bell, and we had some pretty strong deliveries here on some international programs like the SFW in the UAE in the second quarter. But I would expect those businesses will still be strong performers through the whole balance of the year and going forward. Cessna, despite some uncertainty around the order front, it’s certainly our expectation that we will see incrementally, incremental improvements as we go through each quarter in terms of our margin rates. So I think that's a reasonable expectation. And Finance, there's no change to our previous guidance. I think we'll end up seeing the losses that are consistent with what we've guided you through the total year."

The 300 letter of intent that was out there is -- it was unfortunate when this 429 kind of came to the market in a pretty tough spot in terms of the commercial helicopter market. So the conversion rate on that 300 into the current backlog has been very low. On the other hand, I would say over the last quarter or so, we have been moving 429s into backlog as configurations have been identified. I would say that I feel probably better about the level of customer activity and the number of discussions that are going on and the number of orders that we’re starting to create in the 429 than I did from the beginning of the year. So I think we're really starting to feel some pretty strong momentum, and that's really a function of getting these aircraft out there, a lot of demo rides, getting it into service, people starting to give some feedback on how it's performing with the actual aircraft. So I feel probably better about the 429 right now than I have over the past year. So I think we're kind of working our way through that cycle, but also having aircraft out there and really being able to go out and start marketing and selling hard, it’s doing very well. The 75 over the next -- through the balance of 2011, I still feel very good about. We are, I would say, moving, not getting there as quick as I'd like this year in terms of getting specific interiors defined and the associated certifications that have to happen with those. So it's always been back-end loaded. It’s still very back-end-loaded in terms of 429 shipments. Most of that, frankly, though, is on us to get the configurations defined and get the certifications completed. So right now, I'm hopeful we're still going to get close to the 25 this year, but even if we [ph] don’t, obviously, I think it would go out in the early part of 2011. So I'd say the bottom line in terms of the 429, yes, it was unfortunate that the thing finally actually came into production and launched at a pretty difficult time in the cycle. But the demand as we see it right now is strong and increasing, and I feel good about getting up to the production rate, the delivery rate, that we've been talking about."

Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.
On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. We're originating today's call from the National Business Aviation Association Conference in Atlanta, as Scott and Frank are here meeting with customers and industry participants. Our customary earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Moving now to third quarter results, which appear on Slide 3 of the presentation. Revenues in the quarter were $2.5 billion, down 2.7% from a year ago, which yielded a GAAP loss per share from continuing operations of $0.17. This compares to income of $0.02 per share a year ago. 
During the quarter, we recorded $0.30 in special charges. $0.25 of this amount related to the wind down of TFC's Canadian operation, which we discussed on our second quarter call. This noncash charge eliminated the balance of a cumulative currency translation account, which was triggered because TFC's Canadian operations reached a substantially liquidated basis during the quarter. The remaining $0.05 of special charges was related to restructuring cost. Third quarter earnings from continuing operations, excluding these charges, were $0.13 per share compared to $0.12 a year ago. 
Manufacturing operations generated $157 million in free cash flow during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date amount to $174 million, which compares to last year's nine-month cash flow of $68 million. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."
35303,113616648,80420,"Textron Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2010",2010-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Textron Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. Since we're all here at NBAA, let me just reflected briefly on the mood of the show. I would say that, generally speaking, customers appear to be more optimistic and positive than they were a year ago at the show. Man",1480,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. Since we're all here at NBAA, let me just reflected briefly on the mood of the show. I would say that, generally speaking, customers appear to be more optimistic and positive than they were a year ago at the show. Many customers as you talk to them are reaching a point now where they're a year or two beyond with their normal replacement and upgrade cycle would be, so I think we have a fair number of customers that are genuinely looking at getting back into the market.
And so what I'll tell you, it's probably too early to conclude whether this really will be a turning point in the business jet order environment. We are encouraged by the level of customer interest. The recent passed U.S. bonus depreciation bill is certainly a positive factor, and we'll see how much this helps to drive sales. As we all know, new product announcements also stimulate demand in the business jet market. 
In that regard, we unveiled our new Citation Ten aircraft earlier this week and is generating significant attention at the show. The new Ten is a real remarkable aircraft with attractive new features, which we believe will reinvigorate demand for this unique and capable jet. The new Ten will be 15-inches longer and equipped with a set of new Rolls-Royce engines, so it would be more powerful and efficient. As a result, the Ten will be able to fly farther and faster and with more payload. Other features include new winglets, the entirely new Garmin 5000 [G5000] avionics suite, a redesigned cabin with new interiors  and cabin appointments, a new fiber optic-based cabin management system, including the latest interface options for greater in-flight productivity and connectivity.
We're particularly excited about the advanced technology incorporated with this special aircraft and the improved performance characteristics that will give our customers a more efficient and productive aircraft and cabin that are designed to meet the demand and requirements in business travel.
So we move back to the industry conditions, as we discussed on our last call, order activity in the business jet market slowed in June, and we did not see activity recovering in the July or August. In September, activity did pick up somewhat, as you would normally expect, and we ended the quarter with new order value exceeding the value with cancellations, although our book to bill did remain below one. 
On the delivery front, we shipped 26 jets compared to 68 a year ago. With this continued weakness in the demand environment, last month, we announced headcount and production cuts as we seek to reduce overhead costs and reduce our production build rates of Cessna.
On the other hand, the indicators are improving or at least remaining stable. For example, average daily utilization rate increased to 0.69 hours from 0.68 in the second quarter and 0.66 in the first quarter. This is the highest level we've seen since December of 2008. Also, the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] rolling three-month average for takeoffs and landings were up in both July and August. As a result, Cessna's aftermarket revenues were also up in the quarter, 11% on a year-over-year basis. Previously owned Citations available for sale remain flat at 15.1%. 
With respect to our outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect a significant increase in deliveries from the third quarter. The vast majority of which are already in our backlog. As a result, Cessna should return to profitability in the fourth quarter.
In Industrial segment, revenues were up nearly 15% as auto, turf care and tool sales remain resilient through the summer months. In fact, our organic growth at Industrial for the quarter was over 18%. Looking to the fourth quarter, we believe the year-over-year growth rate in Industrial will continue, but to a more moderate rate as we run into more traditional comparisons. 
At E-Z-GO, we've been working to expand our presence in the consumer industrial vehicle market. Last week, we agreed to purchase an electric 4x4 hunting and outdoor recreation vehicle product line, which adds to our specialty vehicle line and expands our distribution reach in that segment.
Moving to the Finance segment. We had another good quarter of liquidations. If you look at Slide 4 in the presentations, you can see that we reduced managed receivables less $627 million. This brings total reduction since the beginning of 2009 to $5.8 billion. Distribution and Finance was the largest new had a reduction of $280 million and $75 million liquidations was generated from our Timeshare business as about 50% of that portfolio is now in the amortizing phase. As we look to the full year, we're targeting a total liquidation of $2.4 billion, which will bring us to a two-year reduction of nearly $6.2 billion. 
On Slide 5, you can see cash conversion came in at 94% for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date rate to 92%. We expect the liquidation pace and cash conversion rates will decrease going forward as most of the high turnover, high conversion assets, namely those in our Distribution and Finance and asset-based Lending businesses haven't substantially liquidated. In terms of credit performance, we saw a reduction in 60-day delinquencies from $385 million to $357 million, while non-accruals were flat at $876 million. 
While this trend is encouraging and reflects improvement in the general credit market, we do project 60-day delinquencies will go up in the fourth quarter as a couple of large Timeshare accounts, which are already classified as non-accrual are expected to become delinquent. Charge-offs in the quarter were $26 million, down from $57 million in the second quarter.
Moving to Textron Systems. Revenues were down sequentially primarily related to the timing of international SFW shipments. We expect the fourth quarter revenues will benefit from another significant SFW shipment, similar to what occurred in the second quarter. Because customer acceptance with deliveries on international contracts like this one is often done on a lot basis, we do expect we will see some lumpiness in the revenue in this area.
Backlog was essentially flat at $1.6 billion. Markets did come down sequentially, primarily driven by lower pricing on new U.S. government ASV contracts and lower international sales on SFW shipments. We continue to pursue a diverse set of opportunities both domestically and internationally. For example, we recently won a contract to provide the ground control stations for the U.S. Army's Long Endurance Multi-Intelligence Vehicle, the LEMV program.
Wrapping up with Bell. We had a good quarter, both in terms of top line growth and operational execution. On the military side, we delivered seven V-22s and five H-1s. Performance on both programs continues to improve as we ramp-up production. This benefited our profit margins for the quarter as we recorded positive program adjustments, reflecting this trend. On the H-1 program, the attack version, also known as the Super Cobra, was declared operationally effective and suitable and we expect to have a full rate production decision next month. 
Moving to the Commercial side of the business. We delivered 24 units, including four of our new 429 model. We continue to see significant customer activity and interest in Bell products. For example, there was clearly high interest last week at the Air Medical Transport Conference, where we booked orders for 32 new helicopters from three of the largest medical transport service providers in the industry, with a potential for additional opportunities from these and other customers. Our 429 program is progressing with customer demonstrations around the world generating new orders. In fact, we're pleased we have signed our first 429 customer in the People's Republic of China. So the overall outlook at Bell this year beyond is strong in both our Commercial and Military businesses.
So to sum up the quarter, we think our results again demonstrate the earnings power of the company, despite continued weakness in the business jet market. As we indicated on our second quarter call, a positive business jet order trend appeared to be emerging earlier this year. However, that trend stalled at June moving the markets recovery to the right. In my of view, probably about six to nine months from what we would have anticipated.
Bonus depreciation and some stability in global economic expansion should provide a more positive environment for increased order activity going forward. Our Systems business continues to execute on its programs. We'll pursue several significant international opportunities. Our Industrial businesses continue to perform well as our markets recover. Bell is successfully executing its military programs, and we're seeing increased activity in the commercial sector, which should lead to solid growth over this foreseeable future. And at Finance, we've made excellent progress liquidating receivables. The cash we've generated has allowed us to make substantial improvements in our capital structure. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Frank to provide some financial details for the quarter."

Now turning to Slide 8, let's examine the factors that drove results in the quarter, which yielded a $0.01 year-over-year increase in EPS before special items. 
Inflation came in at a 2.3% rate, which reduced earnings by $0.12 per share in the quarter, while positive pricing of 0.7% provided a $0.04 benefit. The combined impact of volume and mix cost $0.11 per share. Increased pension expense was $0.04 a share. Our restructuring and execution focus netted a cost-performance benefit of $0.20 per share. TFC's reduced losses benefited the quarter by $0.03. And interest expense, taxes and other miscellaneous items collectedly provided $0.01 per share.
Now starting with Cessna. Let's look at the results for each of the business segments. Cessna's revenues decreased $290 million in the third quarter, reflecting lower deliveries. These decreases partially offset by higher aftermarket revenues, which were up about 11.5%. Segment profit decreased $63 million due to lower deliveries, partially offset by lower expenses. The performance benefits were somewhat offset by lower deposit forfeiture income as a result of fewer order cancellations. Cessna backlog ended the third quarter at $3.4 billion, down $321 million from the end of the second quarter.
Turning to Bell. Revenues increased $197 million in the third quarter. U.S. government revenues increased $172 million due to higher V-22 and H-1 deliveries. Commercial revenues increased $25 million due to higher aftermarket volume, improved pricing and favorable mix. Segment profit increased $28 million due to higher overall volume and favorable program adjustments based on improved operational performance. These were partially offset by a gain on a foreign currency exchange contract recorded in 2009, higher research and development costs and higher selling and administrative expenses. Bell backlog decreased $537 million from the end of the second quarter to $6.5 billion.
Moving to Textron Systems. Revenues decreased $42 million, primarily due to lower volume. Segment profit decreased $18 million due to the lower volume, pricing and unfavorable mix. Textron Systems' backlog at the end of the third quarter was $1.6 billion, essentially flat with the end of the second quarter.
At Industrial, revenues increased $77 million due to higher volume, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Segment profit increased $31 million due to higher volume and improved cost performance, partially offset by higher inflation.
At Finance, consistent with our ongoing liquidation of the non-captive business, segment revenues decreased $12 million. Finance segment loss improved $13 million, reflecting lower net portfolio losses, loan loss provisions and selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by the impact of lower average finance receivables, lower accretion from previous mark-to-market adjustments and a higher interest rate on debt and a non-recurrence of gains on debt extinguishment.
Now moving to a few corporate items. Corporate expenses were $35 million, down $8 million from a year ago, primarily reflecting lower corporate headcount. One quick comment on special charges. Looking at Slide 9, as you can see, we are still estimating full year special charges of about $0.40 per share. However, the mix has changed slightly. The Canadian currency translation adjustment that we recorded this quarter was less than our previous estimate due to changes in the exchange rate. And we are now projecting some additional restructuring cost associated with our downsizing activities.
With respect to our balance sheet, as announced last month, we repaid the remainder of Textron's bank line in the third quarter. And we now expect to begin to repay the TFC bank line beginning in the fourth quarter. Our consolidated net debt balance is now $5.4 billion, and we expect to reduce it further by the end of the year.
Turning to our outlook on Slide 10. During the fourth quarter, we expect a few non-recurring international tax-related items that will benefit income by about $0.08 per share. The exact amount will depend upon prevailing exchange rates. Including this impact, our full year 2010 outlook for EPS from continuing operations before special charges is now expected to be $0.70 to $0.75 a share. Our free cash flow for manufacturing operations outlook for the year is at least $400 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks for today. Greg, we're now ready to take questions."

Now this is the first time we've told you this, right? I mean, we've done this before.

As we do our forecast and look at our, both production rates and our sales programs, we anticipate that some of those customers where we kind of put in our book is a high-risk customer.

I mean, unfortunately, we just went through another set of cost reductions, although I would say probably half of that was directly volume related. The other half was continuing to make sure that we get our cost structure aligned with size of the business. And in general, just driving base cost productivity. Our activities and things like ramping up our Mexico operation actually are going very well on both the Cessna and the Bell side. I was down there with a bunch of the team just a few weeks ago and that's ramping up very quickly. So I think we're in a pretty good position here, that as volume comes back and we need to meet some of these requirements, capacity requirements that we're going to have a better cost base than we've had in the past. The other thing I would mention, which obviously here in the quarter we did finalize negotiations with our union in Wichita. I think it was a good outcome in terms of both the company and the employees. It's a seven-year deal which is great, and let's just get that behind us and focus on just getting the job done here for the next seven years. And we feel pretty good about where it was, obviously our employees agree to take sort of more of their share of the healthcare cost on a go-forward basis. And I think in terms of economics, we all recognize where the industry is and where it's going to be here in the near term going forward and put together a financial package that in the end was acceptable to both the company and the union."

The fact that they're now a year or two years, some of them going three years beyond what they would normally do in terms of refreshing and updating their aircraft. So I think these are people that are, without a doubt, going to do it. The question of the timing is obviously a little bit uncertain, but it's going to happen. The growth I think as we've talked to international customers, the desire, the demand to have business aircraft and the productivity that they're utilized for, you hear all those same things that you've always heard. I'm pleased that the politics side of it has certainly seem to have died out. People aren't afraid of, geez, why -- be viewed as a bad guy because we have corporate aircrafts. I mean, that seems to be subsiding a little bit, which is also encouraging. So I guess the bottom line, you don't hear customers talking about things or feel things out there that says that there's a fundamental change in utility or the rationale for why you have a business jet. It's all much more built around the confidence of knowing that their businesses are in a stable spot. They're going to grow, they're going to get back to the normal world.

So I think pretty sharp on their part. Now from our perspective, I think first of all, I don't think anybody should be surprised seeing NetJets offering as part of their suite of aircraft to customers, Embraers. They've had Cessna, they've had Hawker, they've Gulfstream. So I mean, if you look at their role it's kind of a reseller of aircraft in the fractional market.

But the bulk of our customers are small, mid-size business people and high net worth individual, not somebody that's the billionaire set. So I think the confidence in that community and that little buyer is more economically sensitive than the multi-billionaire or the huge, multi-national corporation. So I think that's just going to light the world we're living in right now is that our typical buyer is more economically sensitive than the real big cabin guys.

We're certainly, even though revenue and volume has come back, it's still nowhere near back to where it was historically. So in terms of capacity to produce, we're not in a point where we have to start thinking about making any kind of significant capital investments to support further ramp in those businesses. I mean, some tooling here and there, I mean there's obviously some capital, but there's certainly no reason to think about a need to invest a lot of capital in those businesses as they continue to grow because they're still well below the levels at which they historically have seen. At Cessna, the cost, I mean you certainly have a fixed-base cost, let's say in the Wichita in terms of facilities and capability. I think as volume returns, that we can effectively utilize that capacity. I think we have a union contract and a cost base that will allow us to be very competitive in terms of aircraft completions and customizing in interiors and delivery and things like that. But as we talked about before, we still believe and are continuing to restructure in terms of where a lot of the sub-level fabrication and assembly goes along. And that's been our strategy with Mexico, where we have made some significant investments and continue to do that to make sure that we have capacity in that region at a cost that we think would need us to be for us to be competitive going forward. So there's kind of blend here of making sure you're effectively utilizing what you have in place in Wichita, but also expanding capacity in those places, where we know we have to have a lower cost labor base."

Before we begin I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.
On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO, and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. We're originating today's call from the National Business Aviation Association Conference in Atlanta, as Scott and Frank are here meeting with customers and industry participants. Our customary earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our Web site.
Moving now to third quarter results, which appear on Slide 3 of the presentation. Revenues in the quarter were $2.5 billion, down 2.7% from a year ago, which yielded a GAAP loss per share from continuing operations of $0.17. This compares to income of $0.02 per share a year ago. 
During the quarter, we recorded $0.30 in special charges. $0.25 of this amount related to the wind down of TFC's Canadian operation, which we discussed on our second quarter call. This noncash charge eliminated the balance of a cumulative currency translation account, which was triggered because TFC's Canadian operations reached a substantially liquidated basis during the quarter. The remaining $0.05 of special charges was related to restructuring cost. Third quarter earnings from continuing operations, excluding these charges, were $0.13 per share compared to $0.12 a year ago. 
Manufacturing operations generated $157 million in free cash flow during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date amount to $174 million, which compares to last year's nine-month cash flow of $68 million. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."
35303,113616648,80447,"Textron Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2010",2010-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Textron Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. Since we're all here at NBAA, let me just reflected briefly on the mood of the show. I would say that generally speaking customers appear to be more optimistic and positive than they were a year ago at the show. Many",1477,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. Since we're all here at NBAA, let me just reflected briefly on the mood of the show. I would say that generally speaking customers appear to be more optimistic and positive than they were a year ago at the show. Many customers as you talk to them are reaching a point now where they're a year or two beyond when their normal replacement and upgrade cycle would be. So I think we have a fair number of customers that are genuinely looking at getting back into the market.
And so while I'll tell you it's probably too early to conclude whether this really will be a turning point in the business jet order environment, we are encouraged by the level of customer interest. The recently passed U.S. bonus depreciation bill is certainly a positive factor, and we'll see how much this helps to drive sales. As we all know, new product announcements also stimulate demand in the business jet market. 
In that regard, we unveiled our new Citation Ten aircraft earlier this week and it is generating significant attention at the show. The new Ten is a really remarkable aircraft with attractive new features which we believe will reinvigorate demand for this uniquely capable jet. The new Ten will be 15-inches longer and equipped with a set of new Rolls-Royce engines. So it will be more powerful and efficient. As a result, the Ten will be able to fly farther and faster and with more payload. Other features include new winglets, the entirely new Garmin 5000 [G5000] avionics suite, a redesigned cabin with new interiors and cabin appointments, a new fiber optic-based cabin management system, including the latest interface options for greater in-flight productivity and connectivity.
We're particularly excited about the advanced technology incorporated with this special aircraft and the improved performance characteristics that will give our customers a more efficient and productive aircraft and cabin that are designed to meet the demanding requirements of business travel.
As we move back to the industry conditions. As we discussed on our last call, order activity in the business jet market slowed in June, and we did not see activity recover into July or August. In September activity did pick up somewhat, as you would normally expect, and we ended the quarter with new order value exceeding the value of cancellations, although our book-to-bill did remain below one. 
On the delivery front, we shipped 26 jets compared to 68 a year ago. With this continued weakness in the demand environment, last month we announced headcount and production cuts as we seek to reduce overhead costs and reduce our production build rates of Cessna.
On the other hand, the indicators are improving or at least remaining stable. For example, average daily utilization rate increased to 0.69 hours from 0.68 in the second quarter and 0.66 in the first quarter. This is the highest level we've seen since December of 2008. Also, the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] rolling three-month average for takeoffs and landings were up in both July and August. As a result, Cessna's aftermarket revenues were also up in the quarter, 11% on a year-over-year basis. Previously owned Citations available for sale remain flat at 15.1%. 
With respect to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect a significant increase in deliveries from the third quarter, the vast majority of which are already in our backlog. As a result, Cessna should return to profitability in the fourth quarter.
In the Industrial segment. Revenues were up nearly 15% as auto, turf care and tool sales remain resilient through the summer months. In fact, our organic growth at Industrial for the quarter was over 18%. Looking to the fourth quarter, we believe the year-over-year growth rate in Industrial will continue but at a more moderate rate as we run into more traditional comparisons. 
At E-Z-GO, we've been working to expand our presence in the consumer and industrial vehicle market. Last week we agreed to purchase an electric 4x4 hunting and outdoor recreation vehicle product line, which adds to our specialty vehicle line and expands our distribution reach in that segment.
Moving to the Finance segment. We had another good quarter of liquidations. If you look at Slide 4 in the presentations, you can see that we reduced managed receivables less $627 million. This brings total reductions since the beginning of 2009 to $5.8 billion. Distribution and Finance was the largest area of reduction at $280 million. And $75 million liquidations was generated from our Timeshare business as about 50% of that portfolio is now in the amortizing phase. As we look to the full year, we're targeting a total liquidation of $2.4 billion, which will bring us to a two-year reduction of nearly $6.2 billion. 
On Slide 5, you can see cash conversion came in at 94% for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date rate to 92%. We expect the liquidation pace and cash conversion rates will decrease going forward as most of the high turnover, high conversion assets, namely those in our Distribution and Finance and asset-based Lending businesses, haven't substantially liquidated. In terms of credit performance, we saw a reduction in 60-day delinquencies from $385 million to $357 million, while non-accruals were flat at $876 million. 
While this trend is encouraging and reflects improvement in the general credit market, we do project 60-day delinquencies will go up in the fourth quarter as a couple of large Timeshare accounts, which are already classified as non-accrual, are expected to become delinquent. Charge-offs in the quarter were $26 million, down from $57 million in the second quarter.
Moving to Textron Systems. Revenues were down sequentially primarily related to the timing of international SFW shipments. We expect the fourth quarter revenues will benefit from another significant SFW shipment, similar to what occurred in the second quarter. Because customer acceptance with deliveries on international contracts like this one is often done on a lot basis, we do expect we will see some lumpiness in the revenue in this area.
Backlog was essentially flat at $1.6 billion. Markets did come down sequentially, primarily driven by lower pricing on new U.S. government ASV contracts and lower international sales on SFW shipments. We continue to pursue a diverse set of opportunities both domestically and internationally. For example, we recently won a contract to provide the ground control stations for the U.S. Army's Long Endurance Multi-Intelligence Vehicle, the LEMV program.
Wrapping up with Bell. We had a good quarter, both in terms of top line growth and operational execution. On the military side, we delivered seven V-22s and five H-1s. Performance on both programs continues to improve as we ramp-up production. This benefited our profit margins for the quarter as we recorded positive program adjustments, reflecting this trend. On the H-1 program, the attack version, also known as the Super Cobra, was declared operationally effective and suitable, and we expect to have a full rate production decision next month. 
Moving to the Commercial side of the business. We delivered 24 units, including four of our new 429 model. We continue to see significant customer activity and interest in Bell products. For example, there was clearly high interest last week at the Air Medical Transport Conference, where we booked orders for 32 new helicopters from three of the largest medical transport service providers in the industry, with a potential for additional opportunities from these and other customers. Our 429 program is progressing with customer demonstrations around the world generating new orders. In fact, we're pleased we have signed our first 429 customer in the People's Republic of China. So the overall outlook at Bell this year and beyond is strong in both our Commercial and Military businesses.
So to sum up the quarter, we think our results again demonstrate the earnings power of the company despite continued weakness in the business jet market. As we indicated on our second quarter call, a positive business jet order trend appeared to be emerging earlier this year. However, that trend stalled in June, moving the market’s recovery to the right. In my view, probably about six to nine months from what we would have anticipated.
Bonus depreciation and some stability in global economic expansion should provide a more positive environment for increased order activity going forward. Our Systems business continues to execute on its programs. We've pursued several significant international opportunities. Our Industrial businesses continue to perform well as our markets recover. Bell is successfully executing its military programs, and we're seeing increased activity in the commercial sector, which should lead to solid growth over the foreseeable future. And at Finance, we've made excellent progress liquidating receivables. The cash we've generated has allowed us to make substantial improvements in our capital structure. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Frank to provide some financial details for the quarter."

Now turning to Slide 8, let's examine the factors that drove results in the quarter, which yielded a $0.01 year-over-year increase in EPS before special items. 
Inflation came in at a 2.3% rate, which reduced earnings by $0.12 per share in the quarter, while positive pricing of 0.7% provided a $0.04 benefit. The combined impact of volume and mix cost $0.11 per share. Increased pension expense was $0.04 a share. Our restructuring and execution focus netted a cost-performance benefit of $0.20 per share. TFC's reduced losses benefited the quarter by $0.03. And interest expense, taxes and other miscellaneous items collectively provided $0.01 per share.
Now starting with Cessna, let's look at the results for each of the business segments. Cessna's revenues decreased $290 million in the third quarter, reflecting lower deliveries. These decreases were partially offset by higher aftermarket revenues, which were up about 11.5%. Segment profit decreased $63 million due to lower deliveries, partially offset by lower expenses. The performance benefits were somewhat offset by lower deposit forfeiture income as a result of fewer order cancellations. Cessna backlog ended the third quarter at $3.4 billion, down $321 million from the end of the second quarter.
Turning to Bell. Revenues increased $197 million in the third quarter. U.S. government revenues increased $172 million due to higher V-22 and H-1 deliveries. Commercial revenues increased $25 million due to higher aftermarket volume, improved pricing and favorable mix. Segment profit increased $28 million due to higher overall volume and favorable program adjustments based on improved operational performance. These were partially offset by a gain on a foreign currency exchange contract recorded in 2009, higher research and development costs and higher selling and administrative expenses. Bell backlog decreased $537 million from the end of the second quarter to $6.5 billion.
Moving to Textron Systems. Revenues decreased $42 million, primarily due to lower volume. Segment profit decreased $18 million due to the lower volume, pricing and unfavorable mix. Textron Systems' backlog at the end of the third quarter was $1.6 billion, essentially flat with the end of the second quarter.
At Industrial, revenues increased $77 million due to higher volume, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Segment profit increased $31 million due to higher volume and improved cost performance, partially offset by higher inflation.
At Finance, consistent with our ongoing liquidation of the non-captive business, segment revenues decreased $12 million. Finance segment loss improved $13 million, reflecting lower net portfolio losses, loan loss provisions and selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by the impact of lower average finance receivables, lower accretion from previous mark-to-market adjustments and a higher interest rate on debt and a non-recurrence of gains on debt extinguishment.
Now moving to a few corporate items. Corporate expenses were $35 million, down $8 million from a year ago, primarily reflecting lower corporate headcount. One quick comment on special charges. Looking at Slide 9, as you can see, we are still estimating full year special charges of about $0.40 per share. However, the mix has changed slightly. The Canadian currency translation adjustment that we recorded this quarter was less than our previous estimate due to changes in the exchange rate. And we are now projecting some additional restructuring cost associated with our downsizing activities.
With respect to our balance sheet, as announced last month, we repaid the remainder of Textron's bank line in the third quarter. And we now expect to begin to repay the TFC bank line beginning in the fourth quarter. Our consolidated net debt balance is now $5.4 billion, and we expect to reduce it further by the end of the year.
Turning to our outlook on Slide 10. During the fourth quarter we expect a few non-recurring international tax-related items that will benefit income by about $0.08 per share. The exact amount will depend upon prevailing exchange rates. Including this impact, our full year 2010 outlook for EPS from continuing operations before special charges is now expected to be $0.70 to $0.75 a share. Our free cash flow from manufacturing operations outlook for the year is at least $400 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks for today. Greg, we're now ready to take questions."

So most of the volume, or the number of cancellations, which we had, which were really more in the first, second quarters of this year, which were some of the fleet operators and things like that, I think have mostly flushed their way out. So we have seen a real slowing in terms of the number of individual customers that wait until that next deposit is due and walk away from the aircraft. So are there going to be still some? Absolutely. As we do our forecasts and look at our both production rates and our sales programs, we anticipate that some of those customers who we kind of put in our book as a high-risk customer, more and more of those are actually we're now getting that deposit check. Whereas a year ago, the rate of those that we identified as being at risk was much higher that we're going ahead and switching to a cancellation. So are there still some? Absolutely.

So from a margin perspective, from a revenue -- it's not going to be material. 429 specifically, we shipped four this quarter. We're a little behind where we would like to be just in terms of the time it took to get a lot of the kit certifications done and things like that.

So I think these are people that are without a doubt going to do it. The question of the timing is obviously a little bit uncertain, but it's going to happen. The growth I think as we've talked to international customers, the desire, the demand to have business aircraft and the productivity that they're utilized for. You hear all those same things that you've always heard. I'm pleased that the politics side of it has certainly seemed to have died out. People aren't afraid of, ‘Geeze, will I be viewed as a bad guy because we have corporate aircrafts?’ I mean, that seems to be subsiding a little bit, which is also encouraging. So I guess the bottom line though is you don't hear customers talking about things, or feel things out there that says that there's a fundamental change in the utility or the rationale for why you have a business jet. It's all much more built around the confidence of knowing that their businesses are in a stable spot. They're going to grow. They're going to get back to the normal world. And they're going to go about their business, which includes either buying business jets or refreshing their existing fleets."

And you negotiate at the bottom of the trough for new pricing for an aircraft that you're not going to turn around and sell to fractional customers until 2013, '14, '15, or so. So I think they're pretty sharp. They took advantage of a very down market and went out and tried to drive a very, very aggressive campaign that probably gave them some very favorable, I would say definitely very favorable, pricing. And get that locked in and not have to take the delivery for several years out. So I think it’s pretty sharp on their part. Now from our perspective, I think first of all, I don't think anybody should be surprised to be seeing NetJets offering as part of their suite of aircraft to customers, Embraers. They've had Cessna. They've had Hawker. They've had Gulfstream. So I mean, if you look at their role as kind of a reseller of aircraft in the fractional market, it shouldn't be a surprise again if they're going to carry a pretty broad range of aircraft."

Before we begin I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.
On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO, and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. We're originating today's call from the National Business Aviation Association Conference in Atlanta, as Scott and Frank are here meeting with customers and industry participants. Our customary earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our Web site.
Moving now to third quarter results, which appear on Slide 3 of the presentation. Revenues in the quarter were $2.5 billion, down 2.7% from a year ago, which yielded a GAAP loss per share from continuing operations of $0.17. This compares to income of $0.02 per share a year ago. 
During the quarter, we recorded $0.30 in special charges. $0.25 of this amount related to the wind down of TFC's Canadian operation, which we discussed on our second quarter call. This noncash charge eliminated the balance of a cumulative currency translation account, which was triggered because TFC's Canadian operations reached a substantially liquidated basis during the quarter. The remaining $0.05 of special charges was related to restructuring cost. Third quarter earnings from continuing operations, excluding these charges, were $0.13 per share compared to $0.12 a year ago. 
Manufacturing operations generated $157 million in free cash flow during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date amount to $174 million, which compares to last year's nine-month cash flow of $68 million. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."
35303,113616648,80568,"Textron Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2010",2010-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Textron Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. Since we're all here at NBAA, let me just reflected briefly on the mood of the show.

Since we're all here at NBAA, let me just reflected briefly on the mood of the show. I would say that generally speaking customers appear to be more optimistic and positive than they were a year ago at the show. Many customers as you talk to them are reaching a point now where they're a year or two beyond when their normal replacement and upgrade cycle would be. So I think we have a fair number of customers that are genuinely looking at getting back into the market.
And so while I'll tell you it's probably too early to conclude whether this really will be a turning point in the business jet order environment, we are encouraged by the level of customer interest. The recently passed U.S. bonus depreciation bill is certainly a positive factor, and we'll see how much this helps to drive sales. As we all know, new product announcements also stimulate demand in the business jet market. 
In that regard, we unveiled our new Citation Ten aircraft earlier this week and it is generating significant attention at the show. The new Ten is a really remarkable aircraft with attractive new features which we believe will reinvigorate demand for this uniquely capable jet. The new Ten will be 15-inches longer and equipped with a set of new Rolls-Royce engines. So it will be more powerful and efficient. As a result, the Ten will be able to fly farther and faster and with more payload. Other features include new winglets, the entirely new Garmin 5000 [G5000] avionics suite, a redesigned cabin with new interiors and cabin appointments, a new fiber optic-based cabin management system, including the latest interface options for greater in-flight productivity and connectivity.
We're particularly excited about the advanced technology incorporated with this special aircraft and the improved performance characteristics that will give our customers a more efficient and productive aircraft and cabin that are designed to meet the demanding requirements of business travel.
As we move back to the industry conditions. As we discussed on our last call, order activity in the business jet market slowed in June, and we did not see activity recover into July or August. In September activity did pick up somewhat, as you would normally expect, and we ended the quarter with new order value exceeding the value of cancellations, although our book-to-bill did remain below one. 
On the delivery front, we shipped 26 jets compared to 68 a year ago. With this continued weakness in the demand environment, last month we announced headcount and production cuts as we seek to reduce overhead costs and reduce our production build rates of Cessna.
On the other hand, the indicators are improving or at least remaining stable. For example, average daily utilization rate increased to 0.69 hours from 0.68 in the second quarter and 0.66 in the first quarter. This is the highest level we've seen since December of 2008. Also, the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] rolling three-month average for takeoffs and landings were up in both July and August. As a result, Cessna's aftermarket revenues were also up in the quarter, 11% on a year-over-year basis. Previously owned Citations available for sale remain flat at 15.1%. 
With respect to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect a significant increase in deliveries from the third quarter, the vast majority of which are already in our backlog. As a result, Cessna should return to profitability in the fourth quarter.
In the Industrial segment. Revenues were up nearly 15% as auto, turf care and tool sales remain resilient through the summer months. In fact, our organic growth at Industrial for the quarter was over 18%. Looking to the fourth quarter, we believe the year-over-year growth rate in Industrial will continue but at a more moderate rate as we run into more traditional comparisons. 
At E-Z-GO, we've been working to expand our presence in the consumer and industrial vehicle market. Last week we agreed to purchase an electric 4x4 hunting and outdoor recreation vehicle product line, which adds to our specialty vehicle line and expands our distribution reach in that segment.
Moving to the Finance segment. We had another good quarter of liquidations. If you look at Slide 4 in the presentations, you can see that we reduced managed receivables less $627 million. This brings total reductions since the beginning of 2009 to $5.8 billion. Distribution and Finance was the largest area of reduction at $280 million. And $75 million liquidations was generated from our Timeshare business as about 50% of that portfolio is now in the amortizing phase. As we look to the full year, we're targeting a total liquidation of $2.4 billion, which will bring us to a two-year reduction of nearly $6.2 billion. 
On Slide 5, you can see cash conversion came in at 94% for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date rate to 92%. We expect the liquidation pace and cash conversion rates will decrease going forward as most of the high turnover, high conversion assets, namely those in our Distribution and Finance and asset-based Lending businesses, haven't substantially liquidated. In terms of credit performance, we saw a reduction in 60-day delinquencies from $385 million to $357 million, while non-accruals were flat at $876 million. 
While this trend is encouraging and reflects improvement in the general credit market, we do project 60-day delinquencies will go up in the fourth quarter as a couple of large Timeshare accounts, which are already classified as non-accrual, are expected to become delinquent. Charge-offs in the quarter were $26 million, down from $57 million in the second quarter.
Moving to Textron Systems. Revenues were down sequentially primarily related to the timing of international SFW shipments. We expect the fourth quarter revenues will benefit from another significant SFW shipment, similar to what occurred in the second quarter. Because customer acceptance with deliveries on international contracts like this one is often done on a lot basis, we do expect we will see some lumpiness in the revenue in this area.
Backlog was essentially flat at $1.6 billion. Markets did come down sequentially, primarily driven by lower pricing on new U.S. government ASV contracts and lower international sales on SFW shipments. We continue to pursue a diverse set of opportunities both domestically and internationally. For example, we recently won a contract to provide the ground control stations for the U.S. Army's Long Endurance Multi-Intelligence Vehicle, the LEMV program.
Wrapping up with Bell. We had a good quarter, both in terms of top line growth and operational execution. On the military side, we delivered seven V-22s and five H-1s. Performance on both programs continues to improve as we ramp-up production. This benefited our profit margins for the quarter as we recorded positive program adjustments, reflecting this trend. On the H-1 program, the attack version, also known as the Super Cobra, was declared operationally effective and suitable, and we expect to have a full rate production decision next month. 
Moving to the Commercial side of the business. We delivered 24 units, including four of our new 429 model. We continue to see significant customer activity and interest in Bell products. For example, there was clearly high interest last week at the Air Medical Transport Conference, where we booked orders for 32 new helicopters from three of the largest medical transport service providers in the industry, with a potential for additional opportunities from these and other customers. Our 429 program is progressing with customer demonstrations around the world generating new orders. In fact, we're pleased we have signed our first 429 customer in the People's Republic of China. So the overall outlook at Bell this year and beyond is strong in both our Commercial and Military businesses.
So to sum up the quarter, we think our results again demonstrate the earnings power of the company despite continued weakness in the business jet market. As we indicated on our second quarter call, a positive business jet order trend appeared to be emerging earlier this year. However, that trend stalled in June, moving the market’s recovery to the right. In my view, probably about six to nine months from what we would have anticipated.
Bonus depreciation and some stability in global economic expansion should provide a more positive environment for increased order activity going forward. Our Systems business continues to execute on its programs. We've pursued several significant international opportunities. Our Industrial businesses continue to perform well as our markets recover. Bell is successfully executing its military programs, and we're seeing increased activity in the commercial sector, which should lead to solid growth over the foreseeable future. And at Finance, we've made excellent progress liquidating receivables. The cash we've generated has allowed us to make substantial improvements in our capital structure. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Frank to provide some financial details for the quarter."

Now turning to Slide 8, let's examine the factors that drove results in the quarter, which yielded a $0.01 year-over-year increase in EPS before special items. 
Inflation came in at a 2.3% rate, which reduced earnings by $0.12 per share in the quarter, while positive pricing of 0.7% provided a $0.04 benefit. The combined impact of volume and mix cost $0.11 per share. Increased pension expense was $0.04 a share. Our restructuring and execution focus netted a cost-performance benefit of $0.20 per share. TFC's reduced losses benefited the quarter by $0.03. And interest expense, taxes and other miscellaneous items collectively provided $0.01 per share.
Now starting with Cessna, let's look at the results for each of the business segments. Cessna's revenues decreased $290 million in the third quarter, reflecting lower deliveries. These decreases were partially offset by higher aftermarket revenues, which were up about 11.5%. Segment profit decreased $63 million due to lower deliveries, partially offset by lower expenses. The performance benefits were somewhat offset by lower deposit forfeiture income as a result of fewer order cancellations. Cessna backlog ended the third quarter at $3.4 billion, down $321 million from the end of the second quarter.
Turning to Bell. Revenues increased $197 million in the third quarter. U.S. government revenues increased $172 million due to higher V-22 and H-1 deliveries. Commercial revenues increased $25 million due to higher aftermarket volume, improved pricing and favorable mix. Segment profit increased $28 million due to higher overall volume and favorable program adjustments based on improved operational performance. These were partially offset by a gain on a foreign currency exchange contract recorded in 2009, higher research and development costs and higher selling and administrative expenses. Bell backlog decreased $537 million from the end of the second quarter to $6.5 billion.
Moving to Textron Systems. Revenues decreased $42 million, primarily due to lower volume. Segment profit decreased $18 million due to the lower volume, pricing and unfavorable mix. Textron Systems' backlog at the end of the third quarter was $1.6 billion, essentially flat with the end of the second quarter.
At Industrial, revenues increased $77 million due to higher volume, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Segment profit increased $31 million due to higher volume and improved cost performance, partially offset by higher inflation.
At Finance, consistent with our ongoing liquidation of the non-captive business, segment revenues decreased $12 million. Finance segment loss improved $13 million, reflecting lower net portfolio losses, loan loss provisions and selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by the impact of lower average finance receivables, lower accretion from previous mark-to-market adjustments and a higher interest rate on debt and a non-recurrence of gains on debt extinguishment.
Now moving to a few corporate items. Corporate expenses were $35 million, down $8 million from a year ago, primarily reflecting lower corporate headcount. One quick comment on special charges. Looking at Slide 9, as you can see, we are still estimating full year special charges of about $0.40 per share. However, the mix has changed slightly. The Canadian currency translation adjustment that we recorded this quarter was less than our previous estimate due to changes in the exchange rate. And we are now projecting some additional restructuring cost associated with our downsizing activities.
With respect to our balance sheet, as announced last month, we repaid the remainder of Textron's bank line in the third quarter. And we now expect to begin to repay the TFC bank line beginning in the fourth quarter. Our consolidated net debt balance is now $5.4 billion, and we expect to reduce it further by the end of the year.
Turning to our outlook on Slide 10. During the fourth quarter we expect a few non-recurring international tax-related items that will benefit income by about $0.08 per share. The exact amount will depend upon prevailing exchange rates. Including this impact, our full year 2010 outlook for EPS from continuing operations before special charges is now expected to be $0.70 to $0.75 a share. Our free cash flow from manufacturing operations outlook for the year is at least $400 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks for today. Greg, we're now ready to take questions."

So most of the volume, or the number of cancellations, which we had, which were really more in the first, second quarters of this year, which were some of the fleet operators and things like that, I think have mostly flushed their way out. So we have seen a real slowing in terms of the number of individual customers that wait until that next deposit is due and walk away from the aircraft. So are there going to be still some? Absolutely. As we do our forecasts and look at our both production rates and our sales programs, we anticipate that some of those customers who we kind of put in our book as a high-risk customer, more and more of those are actually we're now getting that deposit check. Whereas a year ago, the rate of those that we identified as being at risk was much higher that we're going ahead and switching to a cancellation. So are there still some? Absolutely.

So from a margin perspective, from a revenue -- it's not going to be material. 429 specifically, we shipped four this quarter. We're a little behind where we would like to be just in terms of the time it took to get a lot of the kit certifications done and things like that.

Now, as we see things coming back, I mean right now I would say we're probably getting more interest and more customer demand internationally than U.S. I think part of that is a lot of U.S. customers are sort of sitting on the sidelines saying, ‘Well, if I'm going to go, I'd like to have some certainty and understanding around things like the bonus depreciation plan,’ and whatnot. So hopefully that will move some of these guys. We know it's already moved a few of them kind of off the sideline and are going ahead and proceeding.

The other thing I would mention, which obviously here in the quarter we did finalize negotiations with our union in Wichita. I think it was a good outcome in terms of both the company and the employees. It's a seven-year deal, which is great. It lets us get that behind us and focus on just getting the job done here for the next seven years. And we feel pretty good about where it was.

The customers though you talk to, and I guess let me just couch it by saying a lot of these customers are folks that are here at the show. Folks that I interact with on an occasional basis. They are Cessna customers, right? They're flying our aircraft. And so this is kind of a core customer base, if you will, that does refresh their fleets on a fairly regular basis. This is what they're talking, right? The fact that they're now a year or two years, some of them going three years, beyond what they would normally do in terms of refreshing and updating their aircraft. So I think these are people that are without a doubt going to do it. The question of the timing is obviously a little bit uncertain, but it's going to happen. The growth I think as we've talked to international customers, the desire, the demand to have business aircraft and the productivity that they're utilized for. You hear all those same things that you've always heard. I'm pleased that the politics side of it has certainly seemed to have died out. People aren't afraid of, ‘Geeze, will I be viewed as a bad guy because we have corporate aircrafts?’ I mean, that seems to be subsiding a little bit, which is also encouraging. So I guess the bottom line though is you don't hear customers talking about things, or feel things out there that says that there's a fundamental change in the utility or the rationale for why you have a business jet. It's all much more built around the confidence of knowing that their businesses are in a stable spot. They're going to grow. They're going to get back to the normal world. And they're going to go about their business, which includes either buying business jets or refreshing their existing fleets."

And get that locked in and not have to take the delivery for several years out. So I think it’s pretty sharp on their part. Now from our perspective, I think first of all, I don't think anybody should be surprised to be seeing NetJets offering as part of their suite of aircraft to customers, Embraers. They've had Cessna. They've had Hawker. They've had Gulfstream. So I mean, if you look at their role as kind of a reseller of aircraft in the fractional market, it shouldn't be a surprise again if they're going to carry a pretty broad range of aircraft."

Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.
On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. We're originating today's call from the National Business Aviation Association Conference in Atlanta, as Scott and Frank are here meeting with customers and industry participants. Our customary earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Moving now to third quarter results, which appear on Slide 3 of the presentation. Revenues in the quarter were $2.5 billion, down 2.7% from a year ago, which yielded a GAAP loss per share from continuing operations of $0.17. This compares to income of $0.02 per share a year ago. 
During the quarter, we recorded $0.30 in special charges. $0.25 of this amount related to the wind down of TFC's Canadian operation, which we discussed on our second quarter call. This noncash charge eliminated the balance of a cumulative currency translation account, which was triggered because TFC's Canadian operation reached a substantially liquidated basis during the quarter. The remaining $0.05 of special charges was related to restructuring cost. Third quarter earnings from continuing operations, excluding these charges, were $0.13 per share compared to $0.12 a year ago. 
Manufacturing operations generated $157 million in free cash flow during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date amount to $174 million, which compares to last year's nine-month cash flow of $68 million. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."
35303,113616648,86728,"Textron Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2010",2010-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Textron Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. Since we're all here at NBAA, let me just reflect briefly on the mood of the show. I would say that, generally speaking, customers appear to be more optimistic and positive than they were a year ago at the show. Many",1480,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. Since we're all here at NBAA, let me just reflect briefly on the mood of the show. I would say that, generally speaking, customers appear to be more optimistic and positive than they were a year ago at the show. Many customers, as you talk to them, are reaching a point now where they're a year or two beyond where their normal replacement and upgrade cycle would be. So I think we have a fair number of customers that are genuinely looking at getting back into the market.
And so while I'll tell you it's probably too early to conclude whether this really will be a turning point in the business jet order environment. We are encouraged by the level of customer interest. The recently passed U.S. bonus depreciation bill is certainly a positive factor, and we'll see how much this helps to drive sales. As we all know, new product announcements also stimulate demand in the business jet market. 
In that regard, we unveiled our new Citation Ten aircraft earlier this week and is generating significant attention at the show. The new Ten is a real remarkable aircraft with attractive new features, which we believe will reinvigorate demand for this unique and capable jet. The new Ten will be 15-inches longer and equipped with a set of new Rolls-Royce engines, so it would be more powerful and efficient. As a result, the Ten will be able to fly farther and faster and with more payload. Other features include new winglets, the entirely new Garmin 5000 [G5000] avionics suite, a redesigned cabin with new interiors  and cabin appointments, a new fiber optic-based cabin management system, including the latest interface options for greater in-flight productivity and connectivity.
We're particularly excited about the advanced technology incorporated with this special aircraft and the improved performance characteristics that will give our customers a more efficient and productive aircraft and cabin that are designed to meet the demand and requirements of business travel.
So as we move back to the industry conditions, as we discussed on our last call, order activity in the business jet market slowed in June, and we did not see activity recovering into July or August. In September, activity did pick up somewhat, as you would normally expect, and we ended the quarter with new order value exceeding the value with cancellations, although our book to bill did remain below one. 
On the delivery front, we shipped 26 jets compared to 68 a year ago. With this continued weakness in the demand environment, last month, we announced headcount and production cuts as we seek to reduce overhead cost and reduce our production build rates at Cessna.
On the other hand, leading indicators are improving or at least remaining stable. For example, average daily utilization rate increased to 0.69 hours from 0.68 in the second quarter and 0.66 in the first quarter. This is the highest level we've seen since December of 2008. Also, the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] rolling three-month average for takeoff and landings were up in both July and August. As a result, Cessna's aftermarket revenues were also up in the quarter, 11% on a year-over-year basis. Previously owned Citations available for sale remained flat at 15.1%. 
With respect to our outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect a significant increase in deliveries from the third quarter, the vast majority of which are already in our backlog. As a result, Cessna should return to profitability in the fourth quarter.
In the Industrial segment, revenues were up nearly 15% as auto, turf care and tool sales remained resilient through the summer months. In fact our organic growth at Industrial for the quarter was over 18%. Looking to the fourth quarter, we believe the year-over-year growth rate in Industrial will continue but to a more moderate rate as we run into more traditional comparisons. 
At E-Z-GO, we've been working to expand our presence in the consumer industrial vehicle market. Last week, we agreed to purchase an electric 4x4 hunting and outdoor recreation vehicle product line, which adds to our specialty vehicle line and expands our distribution reach in that segment.
Moving to the Finance segment. We had another good quarter of liquidations. If you look at Slide 4 in the presentations, you can see that we reduced managed receivables less $627 million. This brings total reduction since the beginning of 2009 to $5.8 billion. Distribution and Finance was the largest area of reduction at $280 million and $75 million liquidations was generated from our Timeshare business as about 50% of that portfolio is now in the amortizing phase. As we look to the full year, we're targeting a total liquidation of $2.4 billion, which will bring us to a two-year reduction of nearly $6.2 billion. 
On Slide 5, you can see cash conversion came in at 94% for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date rate to 92%. We expect the liquidation pace and cash conversion rates will decrease going forward as most of the high turnover, high conversion assets, namely those in our Distribution and Finance and asset-based Lending businesses have been substantially liquidated. In terms of credit performance, we saw a reduction in 60-day delinquencies from $385 million to $357 million, while non-accruals were flat at $876 million. 
While this trend is encouraging and reflects improvement in the general credit market, we do project the 60-day delinquencies will go up in the fourth quarter as a couple of large Timeshare accounts, which are already classified as non-accrual are expected to become delinquent. Charge-offs in the quarter were $26 million, down from $57 million in the second quarter.
Moving to Textron Systems. Revenues were down sequentially primarily related to the timing of international SFW shipments. We expect fourth quarter revenues will benefit from another significant SFW shipment, similar to what occurred in the second quarter. Because customer acceptance with deliveries on international contracts like this one is often done on a lot basis, we do expect we will see some lumpiness in the revenue in this area.
Backlog was essentially flat at $1.6 billion. Margins did come down sequentially primarily driven by lower pricing on new U.S. government ASV contracts and lower international sales on SFW shipments. We continue to pursue a diverse set of opportunities both domestically and internationally. For example, we recently won a contract to provide ground control stations for the U.S. Army's Long Endurance Multi-Intelligence Vehicle, the LEMV program.
Wrapping up with Bell. We had a good quarter, both in terms of top line growth and operational execution. On the military side, we delivered seven V-22s and five H-1s. Performance on both programs continues to improve as we ramp-up production. This benefited our profit margins for the quarter as we recorded positive program adjustments reflecting this trend. On the H-1 program, the attack version, also known as the Super Cobra, was declared operationally effective and suitable, and we expect to have a full rate production decision next month. 
Moving to the Commercial side of the business. We delivered 24 units, including four of our new 429 model. We continue to see significant customer activity and interest in Bell products. For example, there was clearly high interest last week at the Air Medical Transport Conference, where we booked orders for 32 new helicopters from three of the largest medical transport service providers in the industry, with a potential for additional opportunities from these and other customers. Our 429 program is progressing with customer demonstrations around the world generating new orders. In fact, we're pleased we have signed our first 429 customer in the People's Republic of China. So the overall outlook at Bell this year beyond is strong in both our Commercial and Military businesses.
So to sum up the quarter, we think our results again demonstrate the earnings power of the company, despite continued weakness in the business jet market. As we indicated on our second quarter call, a positive business jet order trend appear to be emerging earlier this year. However, that trend stalled to June moving the market’s recovery to the right, in my of view, probably about six to nine months from what we would have anticipated.
Bonus depreciation and some stability in global economic expansion should provide a more positive environment for increased order activity going forward. Our Systems business continues to execute on its programs. We'll pursue several significant international opportunities. Our Industrial businesses continue to perform well as our markets recover. Bell is successfully executing its military programs, and we're seeing increased activity in the commercial sector, which should lead to solid growth over this foreseeable future. And at Finance, we've made excellent progress liquidating receivables. The cash we've generated has allowed us to make substantial improvements in our capital structure. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Frank to provide some financial details for the quarter."

Now turning to Slide 8, let's examine the factors that drove results in the quarter, which yielded a $0.01 year-over-year increase in EPS before special items. 
Inflation came in at a 2.3% rate, which reduced earnings by $0.12 per share in the quarter, while positive pricing of 0.7% provided a $0.04 benefit. The combined impact of volume and mix cost $0.11 per share. Increased pension expense was $0.04 a share. Our restructuring and execution focus netted a cost-performance benefit of $0.20 per share. TFC's reduced losses benefited the quarter by $0.03. And interest expense, taxes and other miscellaneous items collectedly provided $0.01 per share.
Now starting with Cessna, let's look at the results for each of the business segments. Cessna's revenues decreased $290 million in the third quarter, reflecting lower deliveries. These decreases partially offset by higher aftermarket revenues, which were up about 11.5%. Segment profit decreased $63 million due to lower deliveries, partially offset by lower expenses. These performance benefits were somewhat offset by lower deposit forfeiture income as a result of fewer order cancellations. Cessna backlog ended the third quarter at $3.4 billion, down $321 million from the end of the second quarter.
Turning to Bell. Revenues increased $197 million in the third quarter. U.S. government revenues increased $172 million due to higher V-22 and H-1 deliveries. Commercial revenues increased $25 million due to higher aftermarket volume, improved pricing and favorable mix. Segment profit increased $28 million due to higher overall volume and favorable program adjustments based on improved operational performance. These were partially offset by a gain on a foreign currency exchange contract recorded in 2009, higher research and development cost and higher selling and administrative expenses. Bell backlog decreased $537 million from the end of the second quarter to $6.5 billion.
Moving to Textron Systems. Revenues decreased $42 million, primarily due to lower volume. Segment profit decreased $18 million due to the lower volume, pricing and unfavorable mix. Textron Systems' backlog at the end of the third quarter was $1.6 billion, essentially flat with the end of the second quarter.
At Industrial, revenues increased $77 million due to higher volume, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Segment profit increased $31 million due to higher volume and improved cost performance, partially offset by higher inflation.
At Finance, consistent with our ongoing liquidation of the non-captive business, segment revenues decreased $12 million. Finance segment loss improved to $13 million, reflecting lower net portfolio losses, loan loss provisions and selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by the impact of lower average finance receivables, lower accretion from previous mark-to-market adjustments and a higher interest rate on debt and a non-recurrence of gains on debt extinguishment.
Now moving to a few corporate items. Corporate expenses were $35 million, down $8 million from a year ago, primarily reflecting lower corporate headcount. One quick comment on special charges. Looking at Slide 9, as you can see, we are still estimating full year special charges of about $0.40 per share. However, the mix has changed slightly. The Canadian currency translation adjustment that we recorded this quarter was less than our previous estimate due to changes in the exchange rate, and we are now projecting some additional restructuring cost associated with our downsizing activities.
With respect to our balance sheet, as announced last month, we repaid the remainder of Textron's bank line in the third quarter, and we now expect to begin to repay the TFC bank line beginning in the fourth quarter. Our consolidated net debt balance is now $5.4 billion, and we expect to reduce it further by the end of the year.
Turning to our outlook on Slide 10. During the fourth quarter, we expect a few non-recurring international tax-related items that will benefit income by about $0.08 per share. The exact amount will depend upon prevailing exchange rates. Including this impact, our full year 2010 outlook for EPS from continuing operations before special charges is now expected to be $0.70 to $0.75 a share. Our free cash flow for manufacturing operations outlook for the year is at least $400 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks for today. Greg, we're now ready to take questions."

Now this is not the first time we've told you this, right? I mean, we've done this before.

And so those adjustments we made at production rates and staffing aligned with that. In terms of your first part of your question is, what do we expect in terms of fourth quarter deliveries?

So most of the volume or the number of cancellations which we have, which are really more in the first, second quarters of this year, which were some of the fleet operators, things like that, I think mostly flushed their way out. So we have seen a real slowing in terms of the number of individual customers that wait until that next deposit is due and walk away from the aircraft. So are there going to be still some? Absolutely. As we do our forecast and look at our, both production rates and our sales programs, we anticipate that some of those customers where we kind of put in our book is a high-risk customer, more and more of those are actually -- we're now getting that deposit check.

So the way I see it, is that we'll be probably light to that number, but it will be mostly in sort of the very small, the very light helicopters. So from a margin perspective, from a revenue, it's not going to be material. 429 specifically, we shipped four this quarter. We're a little behind where we would like to be just in terms of the time it took to get a lot of the kit certifications done and things like that.

So I think we're in a pretty good position here, that as volume comes back and we need to meet some of these requirements, capacity requirements that we're going to have a better cost base than we've had in the past. The other thing I would mention, which obviously here in the quarter we did finalize negotiations with our union in Wichita. I think it was a good outcome in terms of both the company and the employees. It's a seven-year deal which is great, and let's just get that behind us and focus on just getting the job done here for the next seven years. And we feel pretty good about where it was, obviously our employees agree to take sort of more of their share of the healthcare cost on a go-forward basis. And I think in terms of economics, we all recognize where the industry is and where it's going to be here in the near term going forward and put together a financial package that in the end was acceptable to both the company and the union."

The customers that you talk to, and I guess let me just -- customer by saying, a lot of these customers are folks that are here at the show, folks that I interact with on occasional basis that are -- they are Cessna customers, right? They're flying our aircraft. And so this is kind of a core, if you will, of a customer base that does refresh their fleets on a fairly regular basis. This is what they're talking, right? The fact that they're now a year or two years, some of them going three years beyond what they would normally do in terms of refreshing and updating their aircraft. So I think these are people that are, without a doubt, going to do it. The question of the timing is obviously a little bit uncertain, but it's going to happen. The growth I think as we've talked to international customers, the desire, the demand to have business aircraft and the productivity that they're utilized for, you hear all those same things that you've always heard. I'm pleased that the politics side of it has certainly seem to have died out. People aren't afraid of, geez, why be viewed as a bad guy because we have corporate aircrafts. I mean, that seems to be subsiding a little bit, which is also encouraging. So I guess the bottom line is you don't hear customers talking about things or feel things out there that says that there's a fundamental change in the utility or the rationale for why you have a business jet. It's all much more built around the confidence of knowing that their businesses are in a stable spot. They're going to grow, they're going to get back to the normal world. And they're going to go about their business, which includes either buying business jets or refreshing their existing fleets."

So I think they're pretty sharp. They took advantage of a very down market and went out and tried to drive a very, very aggressive campaign that probably gave them some very favorable, I would say definitely very favorable pricing and get that locked in and not have to take delivery for several years out. So I think pretty sharp on their part. Now from our perspective, I think first of all, I don't think anybody should be surprised seeing NetJets offering as part of their suite of aircraft to customers, Embraers. They've had Cessna, they've had Hawker, Gulfstream. So I mean, if you look at their role it's kind of a reseller of aircraft in the fractional market.

But the bulk of our customers are small, mid-size business people and high net worth individual, not somebody that's the billionaire set. So I think the confidence in that community and that little buyer is more economically sensitive than the multi-billionaire or the huge, multi-national corporation. So I think that's just kind of the life the world we're living in right now is that our typical buyer is more economically sensitive than the real big cabin guys.

And then secondly, how much of your cost reduction is related to your six to nine month push out in terms of the business jet delivery's recovery? And then secondly, as well just on the Industrial business, you've had very high incremental margins there because of a steep revenue bounce back off of a fairly low cost base. I guess, how you're thinking about incremental margins in Industrial exiting this year in terms of adding on capacity or raising R&D and how those affect the incrementals?"

We're certainly, even though revenue and volume has come back, it's still nowhere near back to where it was historically. So in terms of capacity to produce, we're not in a point where we have to start thinking about making any kind of significant capital investments to support further ramp in those businesses. I mean, some tooling here and there, I mean there's obviously some capital. But there's certainly no reason to think about a need to invest a lot of capital in those businesses as they continue to grow because they're still well below the levels at which they historically have seen. At Cessna, the cost, I mean you certainly have a fixed-base cost, let's say in the Wichita in terms of facilities and capability. I think as volume returns, that we can effectively utilize that capacity. I think we have a union contract and a cost base that will allow us to be very competitive in terms of aircraft completions and customizing in interiors and delivery and things like that. But as we talked about before, we still believe and are continuing to restructure in terms of where a lot of the sub-level fabrication and assembly goes along. And that's been our strategy with Mexico, where we have made some significant investments and continue to do that to make sure that we have capacity in that region at a cost that we think would need us to be for us to be competitive going forward. So there's kind of blend here of making sure you're effectively utilizing what you have in place in Wichita, but also expanding capacity in those places where we know we have to have a lower cost labor base."

Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.
On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. We're originating today's call from the National Business Aviation Association Conference in Atlanta, as Scott and Frank are here meeting with customers and industry participants. Our customary earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Moving now to third quarter results, which appear on Slide 3 of the presentation. Revenues in the quarter were $2.5 billion, down 2.7% from a year ago, which yielded a GAAP loss per share from continuing operations of $0.17. This compares to income of $0.02 per share a year ago. 
During the quarter, we recorded $0.30 in special charges. $0.25 of this amount related to the wind down of TFC's Canadian operation, which we discussed on our second quarter call. This noncash charge eliminated the balance of a cumulative currency translation account, which was triggered because TFC's Canadian operation reached a substantially liquidated basis during the quarter. The remaining $0.05 of special charges was related to restructuring cost. Third quarter earnings from continuing operations, excluding these charges, were $0.13 per share compared to $0.12 a year ago. 
Manufacturing operations generated $157 million in free cash flow during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date amount to $174 million, which compares to last year's nine-month cash flow of $68 million. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."
35303,113616648,86729,"Textron Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2010",2010-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Textron Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. Since we're all here at NBAA, let me just reflect briefly on the mood of the show. I would say that, generally speaking, customers appear to be more optimistic and positive than they were a year ago at the show. Many",1480,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. Since we're all here at NBAA, let me just reflect briefly on the mood of the show. I would say that, generally speaking, customers appear to be more optimistic and positive than they were a year ago at the show. Many customers, as you talk to them, are reaching a point now where they're a year or two beyond where their normal replacement and upgrade cycle would be. So I think we have a fair number of customers that are genuinely looking at getting back into the market.
And so while I'll tell you it's probably too early to conclude whether this really will be a turning point in the business jet order environment. We are encouraged by the level of customer interest. The recently passed U.S. bonus depreciation bill is certainly a positive factor, and we'll see how much this helps to drive sales. As we all know, new product announcements also stimulate demand in the business jet market. 
In that regard, we unveiled our new Citation Ten aircraft earlier this week and is generating significant attention at the show. The new Ten is a real remarkable aircraft with attractive new features, which we believe will reinvigorate demand for this unique and capable jet. The new Ten will be 15-inches longer and equipped with a set of new Rolls-Royce engines, so it would be more powerful and efficient. As a result, the Ten will be able to fly farther and faster and with more payload. Other features include new winglets, the entirely new Garmin 5000 [G5000] avionics suite, a redesigned cabin with new interiors  and cabin appointments, a new fiber optic-based cabin management system, including the latest interface options for greater in-flight productivity and connectivity.
We're particularly excited about the advanced technology incorporated with this special aircraft and the improved performance characteristics that will give our customers a more efficient and productive aircraft and cabin that are designed to meet the demand and requirements of business travel.
So as we move back to the industry conditions, as we discussed on our last call, order activity in the business jet market slowed in June, and we did not see activity recovering into July or August. In September, activity did pick up somewhat, as you would normally expect, and we ended the quarter with new order value exceeding the value with cancellations, although our book to bill did remain below one. 
On the delivery front, we shipped 26 jets compared to 68 a year ago. With this continued weakness in the demand environment, last month, we announced headcount and production cuts as we seek to reduce overhead cost and reduce our production build rates at Cessna.
On the other hand, leading indicators are improving or at least remaining stable. For example, average daily utilization rate increased to 0.69 hours from 0.68 in the second quarter and 0.66 in the first quarter. This is the highest level we've seen since December of 2008. Also, the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] rolling three-month average for takeoff and landings were up in both July and August. As a result, Cessna's aftermarket revenues were also up in the quarter, 11% on a year-over-year basis. Previously owned Citations available for sale remained flat at 15.1%. 
With respect to our outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect a significant increase in deliveries from the third quarter, the vast majority of which are already in our backlog. As a result, Cessna should return to profitability in the fourth quarter.
In the Industrial segment, revenues were up nearly 15% as auto, turf care and tool sales remained resilient through the summer months. In fact our organic growth at Industrial for the quarter was over 18%. Looking to the fourth quarter, we believe the year-over-year growth rate in Industrial will continue but to a more moderate rate as we run into more traditional comparisons. 
At E-Z-GO, we've been working to expand our presence in the consumer industrial vehicle market. Last week, we agreed to purchase an electric 4x4 hunting and outdoor recreation vehicle product line, which adds to our specialty vehicle line and expands our distribution reach in that segment.
Moving to the Finance segment. We had another good quarter of liquidations. If you look at Slide 4 in the presentations, you can see that we reduced managed receivables less $627 million. This brings total reduction since the beginning of 2009 to $5.8 billion. Distribution and Finance was the largest area of reduction at $280 million and $75 million liquidations was generated from our Timeshare business as about 50% of that portfolio is now in the amortizing phase. As we look to the full year, we're targeting a total liquidation of $2.4 billion, which will bring us to a two-year reduction of nearly $6.2 billion. 
On Slide 5, you can see cash conversion came in at 94% for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date rate to 92%. We expect the liquidation pace and cash conversion rates will decrease going forward as most of the high turnover, high conversion assets, namely those in our Distribution and Finance and asset-based Lending businesses have been substantially liquidated. In terms of credit performance, we saw a reduction in 60-day delinquencies from $385 million to $357 million, while non-accruals were flat at $876 million. 
While this trend is encouraging and reflects improvement in the general credit market, we do project the 60-day delinquencies will go up in the fourth quarter as a couple of large Timeshare accounts, which are already classified as non-accrual are expected to become delinquent. Charge-offs in the quarter were $26 million, down from $57 million in the second quarter.
Moving to Textron Systems. Revenues were down sequentially primarily related to the timing of international SFW shipments. We expect fourth quarter revenues will benefit from another significant SFW shipment, similar to what occurred in the second quarter. Because customer acceptance with deliveries on international contracts like this one is often done on a lot basis, we do expect we will see some lumpiness in the revenue in this area.
Backlog was essentially flat at $1.6 billion. Margins did come down sequentially primarily driven by lower pricing on new U.S. government ASV contracts and lower international sales on SFW shipments. We continue to pursue a diverse set of opportunities both domestically and internationally. For example, we recently won a contract to provide ground control stations for the U.S. Army's Long Endurance Multi-Intelligence Vehicle, the LEMV program.
Wrapping up with Bell. We had a good quarter, both in terms of top line growth and operational execution. On the military side, we delivered seven V-22s and five H-1s. Performance on both programs continues to improve as we ramp-up production. This benefited our profit margins for the quarter as we recorded positive program adjustments reflecting this trend. On the H-1 program, the attack version, also known as the Super Cobra, was declared operationally effective and suitable, and we expect to have a full rate production decision next month. 
Moving to the Commercial side of the business. We delivered 24 units, including four of our new 429 model. We continue to see significant customer activity and interest in Bell products. For example, there was clearly high interest last week at the Air Medical Transport Conference, where we booked orders for 32 new helicopters from three of the largest medical transport service providers in the industry, with a potential for additional opportunities from these and other customers. Our 429 program is progressing with customer demonstrations around the world generating new orders. In fact, we're pleased we have signed our first 429 customer in the People's Republic of China. So the overall outlook at Bell this year beyond is strong in both our Commercial and Military businesses.
So to sum up the quarter, we think our results again demonstrate the earnings power of the company, despite continued weakness in the business jet market. As we indicated on our second quarter call, a positive business jet order trend appear to be emerging earlier this year. However, that trend stalled to June moving the market’s recovery to the right, in my of view, probably about six to nine months from what we would have anticipated.
Bonus depreciation and some stability in global economic expansion should provide a more positive environment for increased order activity going forward. Our Systems business continues to execute on its programs. We'll pursue several significant international opportunities. Our Industrial businesses continue to perform well as our markets recover. Bell is successfully executing its military programs, and we're seeing increased activity in the commercial sector, which should lead to solid growth over this foreseeable future. And at Finance, we've made excellent progress liquidating receivables. The cash we've generated has allowed us to make substantial improvements in our capital structure. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Frank to provide some financial details for the quarter."

Now turning to Slide 8, let's examine the factors that drove results in the quarter, which yielded a $0.01 year-over-year increase in EPS before special items. 
Inflation came in at a 2.3% rate, which reduced earnings by $0.12 per share in the quarter, while positive pricing of 0.7% provided a $0.04 benefit. The combined impact of volume and mix cost $0.11 per share. Increased pension expense was $0.04 a share. Our restructuring and execution focus netted a cost-performance benefit of $0.20 per share. TFC's reduced losses benefited the quarter by $0.03. And interest expense, taxes and other miscellaneous items collectedly provided $0.01 per share.
Now starting with Cessna, let's look at the results for each of the business segments. Cessna's revenues decreased $290 million in the third quarter, reflecting lower deliveries. These decreases partially offset by higher aftermarket revenues, which were up about 11.5%. Segment profit decreased $63 million due to lower deliveries, partially offset by lower expenses. These performance benefits were somewhat offset by lower deposit forfeiture income as a result of fewer order cancellations. Cessna backlog ended the third quarter at $3.4 billion, down $321 million from the end of the second quarter.
Turning to Bell. Revenues increased $197 million in the third quarter. U.S. government revenues increased $172 million due to higher V-22 and H-1 deliveries. Commercial revenues increased $25 million due to higher aftermarket volume, improved pricing and favorable mix. Segment profit increased $28 million due to higher overall volume and favorable program adjustments based on improved operational performance. These were partially offset by a gain on a foreign currency exchange contract recorded in 2009, higher research and development cost and higher selling and administrative expenses. Bell backlog decreased $537 million from the end of the second quarter to $6.5 billion.
Moving to Textron Systems. Revenues decreased $42 million, primarily due to lower volume. Segment profit decreased $18 million due to the lower volume, pricing and unfavorable mix. Textron Systems' backlog at the end of the third quarter was $1.6 billion, essentially flat with the end of the second quarter.
At Industrial, revenues increased $77 million due to higher volume, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Segment profit increased $31 million due to higher volume and improved cost performance, partially offset by higher inflation.
At Finance, consistent with our ongoing liquidation of the non-captive business, segment revenues decreased $12 million. Finance segment loss improved to $13 million, reflecting lower net portfolio losses, loan loss provisions and selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by the impact of lower average finance receivables, lower accretion from previous mark-to-market adjustments and a higher interest rate on debt and a non-recurrence of gains on debt extinguishment.
Now moving to a few corporate items. Corporate expenses were $35 million, down $8 million from a year ago, primarily reflecting lower corporate headcount. One quick comment on special charges. Looking at Slide 9, as you can see, we are still estimating full year special charges of about $0.40 per share. However, the mix has changed slightly. The Canadian currency translation adjustment that we recorded this quarter was less than our previous estimate due to changes in the exchange rate, and we are now projecting some additional restructuring cost associated with our downsizing activities.
With respect to our balance sheet, as announced last month, we repaid the remainder of Textron's bank line in the third quarter, and we now expect to begin to repay the TFC bank line beginning in the fourth quarter. Our consolidated net debt balance is now $5.4 billion, and we expect to reduce it further by the end of the year.
Turning to our outlook on Slide 10. During the fourth quarter, we expect a few non-recurring international tax-related items that will benefit income by about $0.08 per share. The exact amount will depend upon prevailing exchange rates. Including this impact, our full year 2010 outlook for EPS from continuing operations before special charges is now expected to be $0.70 to $0.75 a share. Our free cash flow for manufacturing operations outlook for the year is at least $400 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks for today. Greg, we're now ready to take questions."

Now this is not the first time we've told you this, right? I mean, we've done this before.

So most of the volume or the number of cancellations which we have, which are really more in the first, second quarters of this year, which were some of the fleet operators, things like that, I think mostly flushed their way out. So we have seen a real slowing in terms of the number of individual customers that wait until that next deposit is due and walk away from the aircraft. So are there going to be still some? Absolutely. As we do our forecast and look at our, both production rates and our sales programs, we anticipate that some of those customers where we kind of put in our book is a high-risk customer, more and more of those are actually -- we're now getting that deposit check. Whereas a year ago, the rate of those that we identified as being at risk was much higher that we're going ahead and switch into a cancellation. So are there still some? Absolutely.

But we have still seen continued strength in the larger helicopters, the oil and gas markets, the emergency medical service markets, the international FMS markets have stayed pretty robust. So the way I see it, is that we'll be probably light to that number, but it will be mostly in sort of the very small, the very light helicopters. So from a margin perspective, from a revenue, it's not going to be material. 429 specifically, we shipped four this quarter. We're a little behind where we would like to be just in terms of the time it took to get a lot of the kit certifications done and things like that.

The fact that they're now a year or two years, some of them going three years beyond what they would normally do in terms of refreshing and updating their aircraft. So I think these are people that are, without a doubt, going to do it. The question of the timing is obviously a little bit uncertain, but it's going to happen. The growth I think as we've talked to international customers, the desire, the demand to have business aircraft and the productivity that they're utilized for, you hear all those same things that you've always heard. I'm pleased that the politics side of it has certainly seem to have died out. People aren't afraid of, geez, why be viewed as a bad guy because we have corporate aircrafts. I mean, that seems to be subsiding a little bit, which is also encouraging. So I guess the bottom line is you don't hear customers talking about things or feel things out there that says that there's a fundamental change in the utility or the rationale for why you have a business jet. It's all much more built around the confidence of knowing that their businesses are in a stable spot. They're going to grow, they're going to get back to the normal world.

So you had backlogs of aircrafts, price levels that have been negotiated in a good market and you negotiate at the bottom of the trough for new pricing for aircraft that you're not going to turn around and sell to fractional customers until 2013, '14, '15 or so. So I think they're pretty sharp. They took advantage of a very down market and went out and tried to drive a very, very aggressive campaign that probably gave them some very favorable, I would say definitely very favorable pricing and get that locked in and not have to take delivery for several years out. So I think pretty sharp on their part. Now from our perspective, I think first of all, I don't think anybody should be surprised seeing NetJets offering as part of their suite of aircraft to customers, Embraers. They've had Cessna, they've had Hawker, Gulfstream. So I mean, if you look at their role it's kind of a reseller of aircraft in the fractional market. It shouldn't be a surprise again if they're going to carry a pretty broad range of aircraft."

And I think you're talking about some different dynamics here in terms of who those buyers are. Are they very large corporations or very, very high net worth individuals, families and such that tend to be the customer of that segment. Now the reality is, for the light to mid-size jet market, we do have obviously some fleet operations in pretty big companies. But the bulk of our customers are small, mid-size business people and high net worth individual, not somebody that's the billionaire set. So I think the confidence in that community and that little buyer is more economically sensitive than the multi-billionaire or the huge, multi-national corporation. So I think that's just kind of the life the world we're living in right now is that our typical buyer is more economically sensitive than the real big cabin guys. So that's where this confidence factor comes in, in terms of getting our customers confident to go spend $6 million, $8 million, $15 million, $20 million as opposed to being up there in the $50 million, $60 million kind of transaction that you see on the large cabin guys.

The Columbus, which we would certainly like to go back to at some point, when the market conditions are right and the light, mid-world has stabilized is a nice add-on in terms of taking care of that customer base because we do have a significant number of them that do have some international needs, longer-haul needs.

We're certainly, even though revenue and volume has come back, it's still nowhere near back to where it was historically. So in terms of capacity to produce, we're not in a point where we have to start thinking about making any kind of significant capital investments to support further ramp in those businesses. I mean, some tooling here and there, I mean there's obviously some capital. But there's certainly no reason to think about a need to invest a lot of capital in those businesses as they continue to grow because they're still well below the levels at which they historically have seen. At Cessna, the cost, I mean you certainly have a fixed-base cost, let's say in the Wichita in terms of facilities and capability. I think as volume returns, that we can effectively utilize that capacity. I think we have a union contract and a cost base that will allow us to be very competitive in terms of aircraft completions and customizing in interiors and delivery and things like that. But as we talked about before, we still believe and are continuing to restructure in terms of where a lot of the sub-level fabrication and assembly goes along. And that's been our strategy with Mexico, where we have made some significant investments and continue to do that to make sure that we have capacity in that region at a cost that we think would need us to be for us to be competitive going forward. So there's kind of blend here of making sure you're effectively utilizing what you have in place in Wichita, but also expanding capacity in those places where we know we have to have a lower cost labor base."

I want to be careful to comment specifically about your question, because I haven't had a discussion with them with respect to overall number changes. But there are regular discussions around how many utility versus how many Super Cobras. So as they are always looking out, their deployment schedules and what to make up for the squadrons are, how they operate, those are discussions that we have all the time with them. So obviously, anytime they want to add additional aircraft is certainly fine with us, and we're trying to make sure we're doing the right things in terms of the cost per unit to help allow them to do it. We know they always love to have more helicopters. But obviously, they have their own budgetary issues that they got to be careful about it. But sure, we'll work with them in terms of both the mix and the makeup of them and the overall total number."

Obviously, there's some minor modifications in the structure with the winglets. There's no tooling change on the engines. It's a redesign on the part of Rolls-Royce for the fan which gives us some better thrust and better efficiencies but does not impact final assembly in terms of tooling. And then of course the cockpit, that adaptation is mostly fabrication work in cable and harnessing. So there's a lot of work, but it's not a capital-intensive change."
